Does he have to cover himself to cover spouse or child? Answer: Correction: An employee may have spouse only coverage for voluntary term life provided the spouse is not an eligible employee. An employee must cover himself to cover a child. o (Follow up question ) Higher Ed: I only got a premium (for voluntary term life) for the spouse but no coverage for employee. Should I submit a Zen desk ticket? Answer: We have confirmed that an employee can enroll a dependent spouse in spouse only term life. If the employee elected spouse only term life the bill you received was correct. o Local Ed: Who is eligible for the services with Optum (behavioral health/EAP) ? To clarify for local education employees, b ehavioral health services are for those enrolled in medical. For EAP services, employees must be enrolled in the health plan, but thei r eligible dependents do not have to be enrolled. o Local Ed: Do you offer pre -marital counseling for free? Answer: This falls under the umbrella of EAP . Eligible employees and dependents get five EAP visits, per problem, per year at no cost. Visits are a vailable in person or by virtual visit. They just need to call Here4TN at 855 -Here4TN. o Local Ed: Do you still need an authorization number or is the Optum card all you need? Answer: Yes. You still need the authorization number. Members need to go to www.H ere4TN.com or call 855 -Here4TN. EAP benefits require prior authorization. They can g o to the Here4TN.com website and find the f orm under the main members tab and select submit form. Eligible members and dependents will have to answer a few questions and submit, or they can call 855-Here4TN , 24/7. o Local Ed: When our employees receive their Optum cards in the mail, does it include any information that we've seen in this slideshow? Answer: The Optum ID cards mailed will have two cards on a page, explaining the ID card and how to use it. The information does list a few services included. We have included a copy of the presenta tion with today's notes and you can share any , or all of it with your members. o Local Ed: I have tried several times to run PPACA report, but it does not appear. With whom do I need to speak about this? Answer: You can s ubmit a Zendesk ticket and put PPACA in the subject. It will route to us and we can help you. We've had a few instances in which the report is not opening. o Local Ed: Can you review the statement from the most recent annual enrollment? Answer: Yes. Right now, you see the benefits statem ent from Annual Enrollment . It will show the changes from October. o Local Ed: Can appeals still be filed? Answer: The deadline was 12/31. You can still send it in, but it will go to the Benefits Administration Review Team (B.A.R.T) . 6 o Local Ed: Sullivan County DOE joined the State Dental eff ective 1/1/2020. When we are going into ehire and ebenefits to add a new hire, we are not getting the option to choose Dental Insurance. Please advise. Answer: For any employees who are experiencing this, put in a Zendesk ticket. You can i nclude an enrollment change form with their election. o Local Ed: What is the timeline for an employee who was divorced, but the employee states there is a 30 -day appeal process? So, she was waiting for the 30 days to expire. What is her deadline to drop coverage on her spouse, is it 30 or 60 days? Do we go by the date on the divorce decree or the 30 days afterwards? Answer: We remove ex -spouses based on when the judge signs the final decree. It is not based on the ex tra 30 days to appeal. If the judge signs today (1/14), we would remove the spouse on 1/31. o Local Ed: If a member on the CDHP plan uses Telehealth, do they still have to meet their deductible? If so, do they receive any discount for the Telehealth visit? Answer: For CDHP plan members, they do have a deductible for Telehealth . Telehealth for medical is based on a negotiated rate. Behavioral health and Substance Use virtual visits are the same as an in -person mental health visit. o Local Ed: Ok, so it's the same for them as if they walk into the doctor (for Telehealth)? Answer: For CDHP members, a behavioral health/substance use virtual visit is the same as an office visit. CDHP members have a deductible and 30% coinsurance. Medical telehealth visits are different. The cost is the plan's negotiated cost (historically $30 -$50 per vis it, depending on the carrier and telehealth company) until the member meets the deductible. Then the member pays coinsurance which is 30% in -network for the Local Education CDHP. Please note that 30% for a medical telehealth visit vs. 30% for a medical off ice visit is not the same because the rates are different. o Local Ed: When I enter the correct effective date, it defaults to 01/01/1900, and gives me an error message and I have to re-enter the date. Is there a fix for this? Answer: I think that what you are referring to is when terminating someone. The fix was to make it be 1/1/1900. It will do that from now on. If you enter the action code first and then select the reason code of termination you will be able to change the termination date without receiving the error. o (Follow up question ) Local Ed: I understand the date is defaulting. When you put your date in and tab down and tell that you are terminating, it auto changes back to 1900. You'll have to do it a second time? Answer: Yes, you must do it a second time. o (Follow up question ): I have now started with Action and Reason then went back to edit the date. Then you only enter the date one time. Answer: Thank you for the tip . We have included this to the answer above. o State: Was everyone supposed to get a n (Optum) membership card? How do they request one if they did not? Answer: Only members who have behavioral health benefits (enrolled in a medical plan) will receive the Member ID Card. Replacement cards can be requested by calling 855 -Here4TN. o State: When did you say we would be getting our W2 through Edison? 7 Answer: 1095s must be issued by March 2, 2020.

Combined ABC Conference Call Notes Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government February 11, 2020 Materials and Communications State/Higher Ed : Premium Holiday Info for STATE, HIGHER ED employees only! What? On January 24th, Benefits Administration (BA) recommended and the State Insurance Committee voted to give all active state and higher education employees a premium holiday for June 2020 coverage . This means there will be no deduction for the health insurance premium this May. The premium holiday is for health insurance ( BCBST & Cigna) premiums only and will not include voluntary benefits. The p remium holiday is for active employees and COBRA participants only and does not impact retiree premiums. Why? For the past several years, insurance claims in the state plan have been lower than expected. A premium holiday allows us to give back to our e mployees some of the surplus money on a one-time basis while maintaining sufficient reserves needed to operate the plan. When? No premiums for health insurance will be deducted from: 5/31 paycheck for state employees; A May paycheck for higher educati on employees (depending on payroll); May direct -bill invoices for state and higher ed employees; and 6/15 draft sent by BA to higher education administration. Additional Information: Departments will not pay the 80% portion for the June insurance premi um. Agency budgets will be adjusted to reflect these non -recurring savings in FY 2020. There is no stip ulation that an employee has to work a specific amount of time to be eligible. If they are enrolled in coverage, they will not be charged premiums regard less of when their coverage began. All employees will still show on the premiums due report, with a $0 premium due for medical (for Higher Ed) . You may still see charges for medical coverage on the 6/15 draft for any retroactive changes (for Higher Ed) . Communicating to employees: State employees: Benefits Administration will send an email with a letter to all state employees letting them know that the re will be a May premium holiday for their June health coverage. The emails will go out in May before th e May end -of-month paychecks. o If employees reply to these emails, it generates a Zendesk ticket , so we can answer any questions state employees may have . Higher Ed employees : The email/letter we will send to state employees in May will be forwarded to Rob Chance , April Preston and Holly Girgies for them to distribute as they wish . 2 Presidents ' Day Holiday: State offices and the Benefits Administra tion service center are closed Monday, Feb. 17 for Presidents ' Day.

Operations Mid-Year Enrollments and Cancellations o Enrollments Rules are explained in Section 2.08 of the Plan Document Special Enrollment Provisions come from fede ral law - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Voluntary termination of other insurance coverage is not a qualifying event, and it doesn't appear as a reason on t he Enrollment Change Application o Cancellations Rules are explained in Section 4.01 of the Plan Document Employees and dependents may only cancel coverage during the annual enrollment period except for certain events Cost Change is not an approved cancel reason, and it doesn't appear on the Insurance Cancel Request Application Quest ions and Answers 1. Will the plan allow a mid -year enrollment when another employer has a different open enrollment period? No. The state -sponsored insurance plans do not r ecognize a different enrollment period as an opportunity to enroll in the State Group I nsurance Program. 2. What about an increase in the cost of coverage under another plan? No. The state - sponsored insurance plans do not recognize a cost increase under another plan as an opportunity to enroll in the State Group Insurance Program. The exceptio n would be if the increase comes from an employer stopping all contribution to the other insurance coverage. 3. Why don't the state -sponsored plans allow changes due t o other plans having different enrollment periods or when the cost for other coverage chang es? The plan is not required to recognize those events, and they aren't included in the plan rules. 4. Can an employee cancel coverage in this plan if they have an ope n enrollment opportunity with another plan? Yes. 5. Where can employees find more information ? Section 2.08 and 4.01 of the Plan Documents, available on the ParTNers For Health website, under the publications tab and the Enrollment Change Application and the Insurance Cancel Application, also on the website under forms .

OPERATIONS QUESTIONS o Higher Ed: Is dry needling covered under the plan's acupuncture benefit? Answer: No, dry needling is not covered. Dry needling is not the same as acupuncture. It's a variant of trigger point injection. Our current medical vendors consider dry needling to be experimental, investigational or unproven, and the plan has a specific exc lusion for medical or surgical procedures to be deemed experimental, investigational, or unproven. o Higher Ed: How does payroll deduction language in the Plan Document change (copied and pasted below) apply to higher education? Answer: It doesn't. The sta te handles payroll deduction for flex benefits for state employees, so that part of the change is directed just to state employees even though there is just one plan document for state and higher education employees. Higher education e mployees do not enrol l in flex benefits in Edison. They do so via the PayFlex portal during annual enrollment or via paper enrollments during the rest of the year, and they handle their own payroll. We apologize for the confusion. Higher education agencies should continue to p rocess flex enrollments and payroll deduction as usual. The other updates mentioned - plan year references and change in the maximum contribution amount - do apply to both state and higher education. Updated sections of Part II of the State Plan Document - this part of the PD deals with Flexible Benefits Updated plan year references throughout - Introduction, Section 1.06, Article II, Sections 2.16 and 4.01 Introduction - added language to clarify payroll deductions: Employees applying to enroll in the FSA or limited purpose FSA must consent to a payroll deduction agreement in Edison as a condition for being allowed to participate in either plan. This consent allows the State to make deductions from employee wages to re pay expenses that employees fail to su bstantiate to the claims administrator. 15 Updated Medical Flexible Spending Account (FSA) maximum contribution amount from $2,650 to $2,700 - Article II, Sections 2.16 and 2.26 o Higher Ed: Do we have dates yet for A nnual Enrollment (AE) ? Answer: Yes, Oct. 1 through Oct. 16 for state and higher education employees. This AE period will include two weekends as higher ed ABCs have requested. o Higher Ed: I need some help from Davis Vision with cards . I have employees who are calling Davis for cards and Davis is te lling them to call us (ABCs) for ID cards? Answer: We will contact the Davis Vision account manager for retraining their call center staff. When this does happen, if you can tell us the name s and dates that this occurred, it helps the Davis Vision account team research the issue. o Higher Ed: Has Edison been fixed for gathering the PPACA reports? Answer: We believe it has been fixed but if you are having issue s you can submit a Zendesk ticket . o Local Ed : Is there any talk as to when we may get insurance p remium increases for 2021 for budget purposes? Answer: We don't know yet , but we will let you know as soon as we can. We typically are able to provide an estimate in late April but the premiums won't be final until the I nsurance Committee votes to approve them later this spring o Local Ed: I would like to understand the process for cancel request due to divorces. It appears it is taking longer than normal for those submitted. Answer: We need a Cancel Request form , including the ex -spouse's address to send the COBRA notice in addition to the full final divorce decree. Sometimes we receive the marital dissolution paperwork, but we must have the full divorce decree signed by the judge to process the request. o Local Ed: Is it possible to have different vendor fo r dental and vison ? Answer: We issue request for proposals ( RFP) for dental and vision , so vendor changes are contingent upon the RFP process . We may or may not have new dental vendors for 202 1 as the dental contract will expire at the end of 2020 , and RFP s will be issued this year . The current v ision contract will expire on Dec. 31, 2022 , so the vision vendor may or may not be different on Jan 1, 2023. o Local Ed: What do you do if your employee will not give you the divorce decree to drop his/her spouse a nd it's past the 60 day time frame? Answe r: In this case, we will need you to notify us by submitting a Zendesk ticke t, and we can have our program integrity unit check vital r ecords . It could be that Benefits Administration is incurring claims from a non -eligible dependent , so we may have to open a fraud case for any claims incurred by an ineligible ex -spouse . If you mention this to the employee , it might encourage them to provide the necessary documentation. Local Ed: If a member is dropping a spouse/de pendent and are currently on the Limited PPO plan, once they drop the spouse/dependent, can they change their plan to the Premier PPO plan and/or change their carrier at that time? The only time members can make changes to their current coverage is if the y experience a special qualifying event (SQE). All special qualifying events are listed on the Enrollment Change Applicati on and Cancel Request forms. Under a SQE 16 they can change within the plan and change vendors. If the enrollment is due to a life event (birth, marriage) , then they cannot change vendors but we do allow them to make changes within the plan (e.g., Limited PPO BCBS to Premier PPO BCBS). o Local Ed: If it (SQE) is due to a child aging off or divorce that would be ok ay, correct? A child aging o ff is not a Special Qualifying Event. A divorce is listed on both the Enrollment Change Application and the Cancel Request as a SQE , and a member could make changes to their plan and vendor under this SQE. o Local Ed: Are we supposed to reach out to an empl oyee that we know has gotten a divorce and has not contacted us to remove their spouse? Is that allowed? Answer: I would encourage you to reach out as the employee is responsible for any ineligible claims incurred , and some employees ma y not realize this. Section 2.06 Substantiation of Dependent Eligibility requires an employee to submit the divorce decree. o Local Ed: Is the repayment of claims and fraud investigation written somewhere that we can share with the employee? Answer: Yes, there are two sections in the Plan Document that apply. 2.06 and 8.01 (B)(1) , and this information is included below. Note: we can require divorce decrees , and if they are not provided , it can result in a depend ent's eligib ility being suspended and eventual termination. 2.06 S ubstantiation of Dependent Eligibility. The insurance committee or its representative may, at its discretion, require marriage certificates, birth certificates, adoption papers, legal guardianship papers, divorce decrees, federal income tax returns (listin g dependent spouse), or any other requested documentation. Failure to provide the requested information will suspend a dependent's eligibility until such information is provided to the insurance committee or its r epresentative. In addition, dependents whos e coverage has been suspended may be subject to termination. If coverage is terminated, those dependents may only be re -enrolled in the plan during the annual open enrollment period or through compliance with the late applicant requirements of Section 2.08 . 8.01 (B)(1) Premium refunds will be subject to the following guidelines: (1) Employee fails to notify agency of eligibility change: Employees who do not notify about a change in their insurance enrollments in a timely manner will receive a three month r efund of their portion of the premium, from the date of notification to the agency unless the employee owes the plan for claims paid inappropriately, overpaid benefits above the employee premium refund amount will be billed to the employee. The agency will receive its entire portion. o Local Ed: If an employee retires and has a dependent who is d isabled, does the dependent coverage continue ? The dependent is under 65. Answer: It will depen d. If are you referring to a spouse who is pre-65 and Medicare entitle d, on the local education plan, a depende nt who is enti tled to Medicare is required to take Part A and B to remain eligible for the retirement plan , and then they would age off . For children , if they are entitled to Medicare and it is before they turn 26, they a required to take Medicare Parts A and B. o Local Ed: Is the following eligibility requirement for insurance at retirement applicable to both licensed and non -licensed staff? \"Retiree health and vision coverage are only available to employees hired b y a participating agency before July 1, 2015. If you started working for a participating local education agency or the state of Tennessee for 17 the first time on or after July 1, 2015, you are not eligible to continue or enroll in insurance at retirement .\" Answer: Yes, that is applicable to the local education plan whether you are certif ied or a non-certified emp loyee , and the employee must have been hired prior to July 1, 2015 , to be eligible to continue or enroll in insurance at retirement . If there are questions abou t this, the emp loyee is strongly encouraged to call t he BA service center for assistance. o Local Ed: So, the dependent must come off the state plan when the employee retirees and move to Medicare ? Answer: When a retiree is eligible to continue group coverage , it depends on different factors includ ing, years of service , dates of service and other thing s. If the retiree has a depend ent covered on the plan and the dep endent is eligible for Medicar e prior to 65 , the dependent may continue coverage o n the group health plan, but when they move to the retiree group plan , the dependent must take Medicare Parts A and B and the state coverage would be secondary . The dependent will then age off of the plan , if they turn 6 5, they will be ineligible for the state group health plan. o Local Ed: If a member 's spouse is on her coverage, but received Medicare in 2018, when their son ages off March 1st, does that open the window for the spouse to come off of her plan as well? Answer: Typically, when they are eligib le for coverage , they must notify us within 60 days . If you have a situation outside of 60 days , we will revie w and verify claims to make a determination . Follow up question: Would you go back to 2018 or would it be going forward? Answer: Our standard proc ess is that we go back to 60 days. It would be an admin error if we approve outside of 60 days. o Local Ed: Must dependents have (state plan) coverage at the time of employee's retirement or would the retiree be able to add dependents lat er such as during open enrollment or due to dependent losing other coverage? Answer: When employment terminates, for a retiree to add new dependent on the plan, the retiree must be covered on the group health plan. The retiree may add an eligible dependent during Annual Enr ollment or add an eligible dependent if they meet the special enro llment criteria, and if they apply to add them within 60 days. But if the retiree is no longer eligible for group health; they will not be able to add dependents to the plan. o Local Ed: Is there specific contact information for the retiree staff? Answer: The employee can call 800-253-9981 and select option 2 for retirement questions or email at retirement.insurance@tn.gov . o Local Ed: If an e mployee retires and has coverage under the spouse , and the spouse retire s, will the employee be able to join the state's plan at that time? Answer: This situation depend s on many variables . We will have to look at the record for the emp loyee and will have to look at eligibility if one of the emp loyees is over 65 . This will impact the answers . If you have a specific scenario such as this, we encourage to contact us at the service center at 800.253.9981 and select option 2 when you call in. o State: What abo ut the Virta Diabetes management? 18 Answer: We hope to launch the Pilot in early April. o State: I missed the premium holiday info? Answer: For state and higher education active employees and COBRA members, we are having a premium holiday for June cove rage, so the May premium will not come out of c hecks . o Local Gov: Even if the employee has not elected coverage , they should still be in Edison? Answer: Yes, that is correct . If the employee is benefits eligible , he/she need s to be hired into Edison . o Local Gov: When do we expect to receive notices of benefit increases? Answer: We will let you know about premiums as soon as we can. We typically are able to provide an estimate in late April , but the premiums won't be final until the Insurance Committee votes to ap prove them later this spring . o Local Gov: Once you have already been in Zendesk , are you already established ? And if you have forgotten your password , do you just go back in and you don't you have to log in with your user ID and password ? Answer: If you have already created a profile, you are already established . If it has been awhile since you've been in Zendesk, you may need to reset your password . You can also email us benefits.info@tn.gov or benefits.administration@tn.gov , and it will create a Zendesk ticket.

State/Higher Ed: Premium Holiday I nfo for State and Higher Education employees only : On May 4, we will send the premium holiday letter about June coverage to state employees enrolled in state health insurance by email. We will also send the letter to higher education leadership to distribute . Here is more information about the premium holiday: What? o Earlier this year Benefits Administration (BA) recommended and the State Insurance Committee voted to give all active state and higher education employees a premium holiday for June 2020 coverage . o This means there will be no deduction for the health insurance premium this May. 2 o The premium holiday is for the health insurance ( BCBST & Cigna) premiums only and will not include voluntary benefits. Premiums for dental, vision, voluntary life and disability will still be collected in June. o The premium holiday is for active employees and COBRA participants only and does not impact r etiree premiums. Why? o For the past several years, insurance claims in the state plan have been lower than expected. o Since we are self -insured, a premium holiday allows us to give back to our employees some of the surplus money on a one -time basis while maintaining sufficient reserves needed to operate the state health insurance plan. When? No premiums for health insu rance will be deducted from: o 5/31 paycheck for state employees; o A May paycheck for higher education employees (depending on payroll); o May direct -bill invoices for state and higher ed employees; and o 6/15 draft sent by BA to higher education administrat ion. Additional Information for ABCs: o Departments will not pay the 80% portion for the June insurance premium. Agency budgets will be adjusted to reflect these non -recurring savings in FY 2020. o There is no stipulation that employees have to work a specific amount of time to be eligible.

Operations LOA - Insurance Coverage Related to COVID -19 Leave : We have sent this information to you by email (April 1 and 3) but as a reminder, if you find that during this uncertain period you may need to put any of your employees enrolled in the State Group Insurance Program on a leave of absence (LOA), please submit a Zendesk ticket or call the BA Service Center as soon as possible. We will work with you on what you need to know about how these changes will impact insurance coverage for your employees. o Contact us by submitting a Zendesk ticket with \" COVID -19 leave question \" in the subject line or call us at 800.253.9981 or 615.741.3590, Monday - Friday, 8 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. CT. Higher Ed/ Local Ed/Local Gov: Security Audit Schedule: We are almost complete with the local education security audit, and we are moving forward with the higher education security audit. The local gov ernment security audit is scheduled for May. o This audit is an annual requirement. Edison System Upgrade: On April 20, the Edison system will be upgraded. This will require an outage of the entire Edison system from Friday, April 17 at 5:00 p.m. CT, through Monday, April 20 at 7:00 a.m. CT . General users will be locked out of Edison beginning on Friday, April 17 at 5:00 p.m. CT. 3 Why does Edison need to upgrade? Similar to how Microsoft periodically upgrades Word and Excel, the Edison software needs to be upgraded as well. Upgrades of this nature are critical to keeping the state current with advancing technology. In addition, to maintain our support with our vendor we must stay current or risk losing support. This support is critical a s issues arise that require us to reach out to our vendor for help. Where can I find information about the upgrade? Upgrade alerts will be posted in the 'Edison News Alerts' section of the Edison Portal. These alerts will help to familiarize you with more specific changes once the upgrade occurs. All prior alerts can be viewed by clicking the link 'News and Events' at the bottom of that section. We don't expect any impact to the Benefits pages as a result of the upgrade.

Answer: Optum created a weekly dashboard so that we could monitor utilization and trends during the pandemic. Overall call volume is down , however, COVID calls are increasing from 0.4% of calls the week of 3/15 to 5 .1% of calls the week of 4/5. The top presenting issue for EAP continues to be anxiety , however , overall EAP authorizations are down. Behavioral health virtual visits are trending up, with a huge spike the week of 3/23. Virtual EAP is also up. o Higher Ed: Do you have any info rmation on annual enrollment (vendors) ? Answer: Our pharmacy benefits manager will continue to be CVS/caremark. We will have an announcement about our HSA/FSA vendor and our two dental carriers after the May 21st meeting of the Insurance Committees. Our medical carrier contracts will be re -bid next year for a Jan. 1, 2022 start date. The Annual Enrollment dates for higher education employees will start Oct. 1 and run through Oct. 16, giving your employees the two weekends that you asked for. o Local Ed: What if employees (Educational Assistants) are asking to cancel their insurance because they can't afford it because they are not working due to schools being closed? Answer: This is a good example of what we would like for you to submit in a Zendesk ticket as there are a lot of variables, including if employees are not working at all or if they are working reduced hours. We ask that you send in a Zendesk ticket with COVID -19 so we are able to figure out what is best for these employees. o Local Ed: Why does the Continu ing Insurance at Retirement form not ask for an Edison ID but it does ask for it when completing the Zendesk ticket when uploading the form? It would be helpful to have it on the form if we have to enter it in Zendesk. Answer: We ask for the Social Security number (SSN) because not all retirees know their Edison ID number. We looked at removing the Edison ID in the system, and the Edison ID is a field on the tick et, but it is not required. You only need to input the SSN when submitting the ticket, but if you have the Edison ID available it is helpful to us to have it when you submit the ticket as well. o Local Ed: Will there be premium increases for 2021? Answer: Yes, there will be an increase , and we will signal this preliminary information to you as soon as we can. Our actuaries want to have the latest claims 5 information to make their final recommendation to the Insurance Committees at their May 21 meeting. o Local Ed: I've had a few employe es who have tried to send me enrollment documents from home and they are having issues, which has caused some delays. Are there any grace periods with the 31 day window for the newly eligible ? Answer: We recognize you may run into issues . Please send each employee's enrollment in as soon as possible with a note with the individual circumstances why the submission was delayed. o Local Ed: Any early news on 2021 health Insurance rates and the increase? Answer: We do know not yet as our actuaries are still gathering information. We will know for sure after the Insurance Committee meeting in May. We may have an idea in late April, and as soon as we have any more information we will share it with you. o Local Ed: Due to all this happening , are the June premiums still waived? Answer : The premium holiday does not apply to local educ ation . We are waiving premiums for the state and higher education but not for local education or local government. o Local Ed: How would we get the June premiums waived for local education? Answer: That is a decision made by the Insurance Committee , and it is based on several factors such as reserve funds available and claims experience for the plan. The local education plan does not have enough reserves to give employees a premium holiday , which is good , as this means that employees are paying the right amount for their coverage. If you think you will have issues with paying premiums due to the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic, please reach out to our office by submitting a Zendesk ticket with COVID -19 Billing Questions in the subject and we will reach ou t to you. o Local Ed: When is HIPAA training due for Local Education ? Answer: The 2020 HIPAA training is available in Edison for all new ABCs. All ABCs who are new to their positions and have access to Edison must take the training within the first 30 days of assuming their new role. For all other ABCs, the annual HIPAA training for 2020 has been waived due to pandemic. You will not have to take the online training this year. Regular annual training will resume in 2021. o Local Ed: On the last call we talked about Cigna's Surgical Treatment and Support Program and the new bundled care. More info rmation was to be sent out prior to 04/01 and an FAQ sheet was to be emailed. Did I miss this information? Answer: We decided not to share this information right now since all elective surgeries are currently on hold. Cigna will be adding some information to the member splash page so you can look for it there. More information will be sent to you and to members when elective surgeries resume. o Local Ed: Who do I need to reach out to about Security Audit questions as I have had trouble getting in contact with someo ne with a call to BA ? Answer: Please send a Zendesk ticket with Security Audit in the subject line . o State: When will the notification for May 30 (premium holiday letter) go out ? 6 Answer: The information has been shared with ABCs twice , and a letter from the Commissioner will go out by email on May 4 to plan members . o State: Do our fiscal director's know about the 80% premium charge in May? Answer: The fiscal directors are not notified directly. F&A Budget has taken this savings into consideration and will be adjusting the agency budgets to account for not spending the one -month premium for the premium holiday. This means it is essentially budget ne utral for the agencies. You can let them know if you would like to do so. o State: Will the notification (premium holiday) sent to employees be in the physical mail or via email? Answer: It will be an email, through the state government Outlook. Everyone who has an email through the state distribution sent through TennesseeStateEmployees@tn.gov will receive the email. We will send all ABCs a copy of the letter in advance which you can share with any plan members who don't use the state email system. o State: Will the holiday premium include employees who are on terminal leave? Answer : Yes, if the state emp loyee is still covered on insurance , it will apply to him/her. o State: Does that include retirees for the premium holiday? Answer : No, their premiums are handled differently . The premium holiday just includes active state and higher education employees and COBRA participants . o State: About t he LOA notification , is this for anyone who is in a leave without pay status or does it have to be related to the C OVID-19? Answer: Anyone who is on a LOA other than for COVID -19 can use the regular process . We just want to speak with you if you have to put someone on a temporary leave due to COVID -19. o Local Gov: Any word on 2020 -2021 rates? Answer: We do know not yet as our actuaries are still gathering information. We will know for sure after the Insurance Committee meeting in May. We may have an idea in late April, and as soon as we have any more information we will share it with you. o Local Gov: Will there be any leniency given to employees who may have missed their enrollment period due to the tornado and COVID -19? Answer: We recommend that you have employees fill ou t an application and send a letter explaining the extenuating circumstances , and we will revie w. o Local Gov: Any information on new dental providers ? Answer: We will likely know when the Insurance Committee meets in May and the results of the request for proposal (RFP) for our dental providers is announced.

The annual HIPAA training will resume in 2021 during our regular training schedule. All new ABCs are still required to take the HIPAA training within first 30 days of employment. This requirement has not been waived. While we are all dealing with the uncertainties of the COVID -19 pandemic; we are still focused and 2 committed to protecting our members' privacy and maintai ning the security of their protected health information. If you have any related HIPAA questions or concerns, please contact the HIPAA Compliance Officer at Chanda.Rainey@tn.gov . o HIPAA Compliance and the COVID -19 Coronavirus Pandemic : There is understandably concern about HIPAA compliance and the COVID -19 Coronavirus pandemic and how the HIPAA Privacy Rule and Security Rule apply. It is important to remember that during a public health emergency such as a disease outbreak like COVID -19, the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules still apply. The HIPAA Security Rule ensures the security of patients' protected health information (PHI) and requires reasonable safeguards to be implemented to protect PHI against impermissible uses and disclosures. The HIPAA Privacy Rule restricts the uses and disclosures of PHI to those related to treatment, payment, and healthcare operations. Benefits Administration's YouTube channel has a video for HIPAA compliance. Take a few minutes to refresh your HIPAA knowl edge and skills. There is no quiz involved. Click on the link to watch: https://youtu.be/D5pS3Q2VD18 There is a HIPAA reference guide on the ABC information page. The link is https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/finance/fa - benefits/documents/abc_hipaa_reference_guide.pdf o Working Remotely Safeguards : Many of us are working remotely to continue to support ou r insurance members' needs.

OPERATIONS QUESTIONS o Higher Ed: About the Cigna HCA change, a n employee was on hold with Cigna for elective surgery and will now have to switch surgeons. Who can they contact with issues? o Answer: Members can contact Cigna with any feedback and questions. Cigna can also help members find new providers. There are certain situations where Continuity of Care could come into consideration. If members are in a situation where switching could be detrimental to their care, they can fill out the Continuity of Care form , and a decision can be made about continuing care with their current HCA provider for a specified period of time . Members can call the Cigna State of Tennessee specific number at 800.997.1617 for help. The Continuity of Care form, member letters and provider lists are all found on the ParTNers for Health website, under Carrier Information . o Higher Ed: Any updates as to whether we will have be nefits fairs this year? o Answer: We don't have any updates at this time. If you are planning one , go ahead and notify the vendors as you usually do . We don't know if we will have them at this point or not. Here is the vendor contact list for benefits fairs . o Higher Ed: Does Cigna offer anything like eM Life that BlueCross BlueShield offers ? eM Life offers interactive mindfulness programs for the new normal including social distancing, financial stress, mindful parenting ; it's free for 90 days. 6 o Answer: Cigna does have some behavioral health resources for Cigna and non - Cigna members , but Optum, our EAP and behavioral health vendor, has great resources for eligible employees and members. You can go to the HERE4TN.com homepage and find information about Sanvello , a mobile app to help with anxiety, depressi on and stress. There is also information about Talkspace for those enrolled in behavioral he alth benefits where you can connect with a dedicated therapist anytime from anywhere , as well as virtual visits for EAP and behavioral health . All the virtual resources are on the HERE4TN.com homepage . There are also fliers about the resources available on the ABC webpage under Optum in the Marketing eToolkit . o Higher Ed: If we have an emp loyee who termed in April or May, are they el igible for the dental premium discount? Will we need to refund partial premium to this member? o Answer: Yes, anyone who was enrolled for each of those months would have been eligible and will be included on the collections applied report . o Higher Ed : This question is a bout Quest Diagnostics and onsite screenings in June; are the screenings in June canceled, and if they are, do the employees know this and has the state sent anyt hing to them? How do employees know if it is canceled ? Answer: ActiveHealth, our wellness vendor , will be sending information to members about onsite screenings , and they have been sending reminders about what members can do. They have not canceled the June screenings yet. They did cancel the April and May screenings . It depends on the facilit y, but members will receive an email letting them know if the screening is canceled. o Higher Ed : Is there a list of cancelled centers? o Answer: Any screenings scheduled for April and May were canceled or rescheduled for the fall . ActiveHealth will contact all of the June sites and work with them , but it is up to the facility if they are going to hold the screening event. o Higher Ed : I wanted to confirm that employees who are enrolled in a Cigna or MetLife dental plan will be eligible for the discount as of the actual date of eligibility and not the payroll deduction month ? o Answer: It doesn't matter when you made the payroll deduction , it depends on if the employee had coverage th e month the premium discount is offered. So MetLife will give a 25% discount for April and May coverage, and Cigna will give a 25% discount for March, April and May co verage. o Higher Ed: If an employee transferred, who pays the discount ? o Answer: In this case , the discount will show up on the new employer. If you have a specific employee that we need to review , we will look at it to determine what needs to happen in this situation. o Higher Ed: I have several employees who had tier plan changes effective as of February and then changed again as of April. What is the dental premium discount in this situation? o Answer: We will be l ooking at what they were enrolled in for that particular month and making manual changes . You will see the updated information on the collections applied report in early June. 7 o Higher Ed: I missed the first part of the meeting. Will there be a recording or transcript available for me to go back and review? Can someone please send me a link to the meeting when it's available in the archive ? Answer: We do not record the ABC webinar , but all of the information presented will be in the call notes we send out on Friday ., We also post the notes on the ABC webpage under Conference Call Notes . o Local Ed: Will the (dental premium) discount show on the June billing as a separate line item , or will the credit be deducted from the employee's June amount on the billing? Answer: The premium discount will all show on one line. You will see a reduced June premium to reflect all the premium discounts on the collections applied report that will be available in early June. o Local Ed: Will the discount for all months show on the June bill? Answer: Yes, it will be revised for June . You will just see the revised amount that shows all those refunds on one line . o Local Ed: Did I understand that the dental refunds will all be reflected on June bill? Answer: That is correct . o Local Ed: The May collection report for pays for June, so the June collection report will show the discounts? Answer: The May premium dues report already reflects the dental premium discount, but we do want to caution you , we are still researching members that changed coverage levels , changed plans or added or termed coverage so that information is not yet available on the premiums due report that you can run now . The final collection s applied report with this information included will not be available until the beginning of June. o Local Ed: If an employee has had surgery and is being impacted by the Tri Star HCA termination, is the employee allowed to stay with that surgeon until they have been released? Answer: If a member is in the middle of post-surgical care and still needs follow up care, the member can fill out a Continuity of Care form. It is highly likely that post- surgical care would be authorized , and they could continue care with that provider for a specified period of time . Members can find the form on the ParTNers for Health website under Carrier information , or they can log into myCigna.com or call 800.997.1617 for help. o Local Ed: Have members been provided with the new changes yet? Answer: Members received letters that included the network facility information and list of terming HCA providers effective 6/1/20. The online directories are updated as changes are effective and will be updated on 6/1/20. As soon as we have the updated PDF directory after 6/1/20 , it will be posted to the Cigna microsite and ParTNers for Health Carrier Information page. o Local Ed: Is the State considering allowing members to change to the Open Access Plus (OAP) network outside of open enrollment due to this announcement? Answer: No, t he state is not looking at allowing plan changes related to this network change because IRS regulations do not allow it . Members can request a Continuity of Care exception by completing the form found on the ParTNers for 8 Health website . HCA leaving the Loc alPlus network is no t appealable. The BA review team (BART) does not have the authority to review the se appeals. o Local Ed: Can you remind me how much the dental discount is and is it for one month? Answer: MetLife will give a 25% discount for April and May coverage, and Cigna will give a 25% discount for March, April and May coverage. We are applying the entire discount to the June premium . o Local Ed: Do you have any information on insurance premium increases for 2021? Answer: We won't know the 2021 premium information until the end of May when the Insurance Committee meets . For local education, it won't be more than 5%, and it could be less. o Local Ed: We can update retiree addresses correct? Answer: Any and all changes to a retiree's insurance record should go through the retirement unit at the BA Service Center. o Local Ed: To clarify, a 5% or less increase is likely for 2021 health premiums, but pending approval by the Insurance Committee in May? Answer: Correct. It won't be more than 5 % , and it might be less. The forecast is based on c laims and this year there are many variables . For local education, we won't know for sure until the I nsurance Committee meets at t he end of May . We will let you know sometime after that meeting . o Local Ed: Our school system does not participate in dental and vision . What about when they retire , are they eligible for dental and vision? We do par ticipate in retiree health insurance. Answer: To be eligible for retire dental and vision, retirees must be receiving a TCRS monthly pension. If receiving a TCRS monthly pension, they are eligible for the state dental coverage. For vision coverage, to be eligible the retiree must be receiving a monthly TCRS pension check, and he/she must also be enrolle d on the group health plan, then they are eligible for retiree vision. Information on the eligibility for retiree dental and retiree vision is accessible in the Local Education Guide To Continuing Insurance at Retirement at https://www.tn.gov/partnersforhealth/continuing -insurance -at-retirement.html . o Local Ed: Will the Edison issue with new hire emails that are sent automatically likely be fixed by June ? During the summer , we hire 100 new employees and it would be helpful if that is working properly . Answer: Edison is still working on this issue , and we do not know when it will be resolved . We hope it will be resolved by June , but we don't know yet. o Local Ed: Can a retiree carry the state health insurance if they do not receive a pension check ? Answer: The p lan doc ument does allow for non -TCRS emp loyees who are not allowed to participate in TCRS to be eligible if they meet certain criteria . There is information in the Continuing Insurance at Retirement gu ide. If you have question about a specific emp loyee, we can look at that emp loyee's record to determine his/her eligibility. o Local Ed: Any new carriers plan changes for 2021 ? 9 Answer: Our health carriers, BCBS and Cigna , will remain . We don't know about any additional plan changes at this time and won't know until after the Insurance Committee meeting on May 2 1. o State: I have a lot of employees that are very upset about HCA leaving Cigna LP. Does it look promising that HCA could stay in the Cigna OAP? I know the deadline is August 1, 2020 , and employees are asking if they could switch to the OAP in order to keep their HCA providers before open enrollment. Answer: Cigna is very hopeful that they will come to a long -term agreement with HCA for OAP. As far as switching to OAP, no, employees are not able to switch before the annual enrollment period for the next plan year, as there are not provisions in the plan document to allow f or this change . We have posted all of the provider lists and member communications on the ParTNers for Health site found by clicking the red button on the homepage - Cigna LocalP lus Network Change - which takes members to information on the Carrier Information page . Also, Cigna customer service representatives are available 24/7 at 800.997.16 17 and can help employees find new providers. A Continuity of Care form can also be filled out for consideration. o State: If your local hospital is an HCA (facility) and the next nearest hospital is more than 45 miles, would this be considered a special qualifying event ( SQE ) which would allow a change from Cigna to BCBS? o Additional question: Can employees switch to BCBS? Answer: No, th e location of the nearest hospital being more than 45 miles away is not a n SQE and therefore, it does not allow a change to another Cigna network or to BCBS. The SQE section of the plan document 2 .08 talks about SQEs. For emergency care, members can always s eek care at the nearest facility and it would be considered in -network. o State: Am I remembering correctly that HCA is not in network for BCBS? Answer: Correct. HCA facilities are not in the B lueCross BlueShield network . Also, we wanted to let you know HCA leaving is not an appealable event and is not referable to the BA review team (BART) . In other words, BART does not have authority to allow a network change. o State: One answer that I cannot seem to get a clear answer on is i f an employee chooses to stay with their doctors for the remainder of this year , what is the maximum allowable amount for out -of-network doctor visits? The letter mailed to affected employees stated that the employee may be balance billed for any amount billed over the MAC for out - of-network care. Answer: If a Continuity of Care agreement is signed by a HCA provider and approved by Cigna, that care is at the in -network level , and HCA providers should not balance bill the member. If the member gets out -of-network care outside of a Continuity of Care agreement, this question would apply, and members would be responsible for the maximum allowable charge (MAC) if the provider choo ses to balance bill the member. The maximum allowable charge is the amount paid by Cigna to the provider - what is important is whatever the provider is billing the patient. For example, if the provider bills $100 and Cigna only pays $50 ,the member pays th e other $50. The maximum allowable charge is typically a percent of the Medicare reimbursement rate for the provider based on their area. It is complicated and the member would have to know what the Medicare reimbursement rate is for his/her area, by the CPT code, then it depends on what CPT codes your provider is 10 billing for to calculate the MAC . Basically, w hatever the total amount the provider is billing, that could be what the member may have to pay. If the member is not okay paying that amount, then th e member may need to find in -network care. o State: After talking to a customer representative at Cigna about Continuity of Care , the exception would for an additional three months , but Cigna would review because of COVID -19 for an additiona l 6 months ? Answer: Continuity of Care depends on each individual and what he/she needs for their care to determine the length of Continuity of Care. If the customer service rep told you a particular case would be approved for six months, that could be right. A Continuity of Care exception will be reviewed for each case, for each member's need, and approved for the length of time needed to transition care . Typically , it is a 90-day period; sometimes less sometimes more. Each member should fill out a Continuity of Care form based on their medical necessity. o State: Should an agreement for OAP not be reached is there anything that could be done ? Since OAP is so much more of a cost, are there talks for a di fferent plan at a lower cost ? Everyone is concerned that this happened to employees before annual enrollment , and wer e not told this before annual enrollment but midstream and they are stuck now. What assurances are there now that this won't happen again. Are the contracts biannually, yearly? Answer: BA contracts with Cigna and BCBS for their commercial networks - BCBS network S, Cigna LP and Cigna OAP. BA won't go out for bid for those contracts until plan year 2022. We will have the same three networks again for annual enrollment (AE) this fall for the next plan year . BA doesn't control th e hospitals or providers in the networks as they are negotiated by Cigna and BCBS . BA can never make the assurance to members that they will always have access to their preferred providers or fa cilities . The network providers in the Cigna and BCBS networks come up for renewal throughout the year. We do try to communicate during AE that the networks can change at any time during a plan year . We cannot guarantee that the networks won't change at any time. For 2021, p remiums and surcharges will be determined at the May Insurance Committee meeting . o Local Gov: Do we anticipate any premium discounts from other carriers , such as vision or health ? Answer: Davis Vision will not be offering a discount as most members will wait until later in the year for eye exams and glasses. We don't anticipate any discounts for medical. o Local Gov: My agency plans to give the premium discount amount back on the last check in May. Will the discount be visible on the June bill? Answer: The discount is already visible on the premiums due report for June coverage . If you run the report , it will be on it now but some members who have changed carriers or coverage will have to be corrected. We are looking at these on an individual bas is and will have to make these changes manually. It won't be finalized until you are able to run the collections applied report at the beginning of June. o Local Gov: Does the premium discount effect June 2020 coverage only? Answer: We are applying the discount to June 2020 coverage to make up for the retroactive discounts for coverage the vendors are giving. MetLife will give a 25% 11 discount for April and May coverage, and Cign a will give a 25% discount for March, April and May coverage. o Local Gov: Is there a report I can run in Edison that will only show which employees have dental and which package? Answer: There is a query that will show this, the TN_BA219_MED_DEN_COVERAGE query . Enter the coverage begin date you are looking for, and it will give you everyone enrolled in medical, dental and vision coverage . You can sort or filter it to get the information you need. o Local Gov: How does HIPAA work with the C OVID tracing that states are trying to implement? Answer: HIPAA does provide safeguards concerning the release of protected health information ( PHI) but when there is a national public health emergency determined by Health and Human Services ( HHS ), information may be released to notify a public health authority in order to prevent or control spread of disease without patient authorization . We have attached a February 2020 bulletin on HIPAA Privacy and Novel Coronavirus that explains what information may be shared during this emergency situation. o Local Gov: Will there be a list of these facilities in the notes on Friday? Answer: The information is available on the ParTNers for Health website, on the Carrier Information page . On the website you'll find: a list of Cigna LocalPlus participating network hospitals , list of HCA Physician Groups terming , spreadsheet of HCA Physicians/Group Practices termin g, list of St. Thomas Medical Partners joining LocalPlus , copies of the letters sent to Middle TN members and East TN members , Cigna HCA FAQs , and the Cigna Continuity of Care document . o Local Gov: What about Skyline Medical ? Answer: TriStar Skyline Medical Center is a HCA TriStar facility in Nashville and is listed in the Middle TN letter as out-of-network as of June 1, 2020 . o Local Gov: Regarding the Summit mentioned regarding the Cigna change, is that a hospital? The Knoxville area has a physician group called Summit Medical Group that is NOT a hospital. Answer: The Summit facility mentioned is TriStar Summit Medical Center in t he Donelso n/Hermitage area. This is a hospital and is not the same as the Summit Medical Group in Knoxville. o Local Gov: Will providers be attending open enrollment activities in October? Answer: We don't know at this time . If you are planning benefits fairs , please contact vendors and give them your dates . As we get closer to the dates , we will know more about travel restrictions. But you can contact them now so they will have it on their schedule. Here is the Vendor Contact list . o Local Gov: When will the Insurance Committee vote on premiums rates? Answer : It could be May or it could be at the June meetings . Our actuaries are waiting until the last minute so they can review the most recent claims, project how 12 COVID -19 will impact premiums , and make as accurate a recommendation as possible . o Local Gov: When is the security audit due date? Answer: It will be due June 12. We ask that you please respond as quickly as you are able to . If everything is ok ay, then you just need to respond back to the email saying so. If not okay, then you may have to submit forms to get everything updated. o Local Gov: To confirm, with the dental discounts, we need to refund the 25% discount back to our employees for March and April, correct? Answer: Correct. Unless you pay the premium, then yes. MetLife will give a 25% discount for April and May coverage, and Cigna will give a 25% discount for March, April and May coverage. You will need to refund the premium back to the employees for the plans they were enrolled in. You may consider providing the refund by reducing the amount collected for June coverage by the amount of the total discount. o Local Gov: I don't recall signing in to Zendesk before. Is that our regular sign in for Edison or will we create a login? Answer: It is a separate login from Edison. I f you have received emails from us , you have received a Zendesk ticket or if you have emailed us at benefits.administration@tn.gov or benefits.info@tn.gov you have created a Zendesk ticket. You can create an account or you can call the service center and we can walk you through setting up your login and account. o Local Gov: If we pay a portion of the dental, are we required to prorate the refund? Answer: Yes, it will be up to you r agency to calculate the amount of the refund depending on the amount that you prorate the premium. o Local Gov: We have a time and attendance system that is offering free telehealth to our staff. Is this okay to send out to our staff ? Answer: Please submit a Ze ndesk ticket with you r telehealth question so that we can take a closer look at what is being offered. o Local Gov: The report shows deductions? Answer: Yes, the premiums due report in Edison shows deductions starting today . This report will be confirmed and turned into the collections appl ied report in early June and will be the final deductions from your agency . Follow up question: My report is set up to come to my email . How do I do this ? Answer: The instructions are on the ABC webpage , under the Training section . There are instructions for past collections applied reports and the instructions will help you run a new one. o Local Gov: Is it ok ay to sign up for new ABC Training as a refresher course? Answer: Absolutely! You can take the training any time you want . o Local Gov: Is there a particular code for the dental premium discount that we will be getting for the dental when we go to put this in? Answer: It will be the benefits plan names and it will be the same , you will just see a revised amount. 13 o Local Gov: Just to clarif y, are we required to refund dental premiums? ( We pay a portion) . Answer: We can't speak for what you do with the premium discount s, but we do recommend that if you are considering not pass ing them on, you discuss this with your legal advisor as it might affect your eligibility in a Section 125 C afeteria plan if you do not pass it along. Combined Call Notes - Limited Opportunity for Members to Change to Cigna OAP Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government June 2, 2020 Materials and Communications Limited Opportunity for Cigna Local Plus Members to Change to Cigna OAP network: The IRS issued guidance and the Insurance Committees approved a special mid -year opportunity for certain plan members to enroll in the Cigna Open Access Plus (OAP) network from June 8 -19, 2020. This limited offer allows all members enrolled in a narrow network ( Cigna LocalPlus and BlueCross BlueShield (BCBST) Network S) as of May 21, 2020, to change their coverage from the narrow network to the broad Cigna OAP Network only if the member's current network has lost 5 or more participating hospitals between January 1, 2020 and June 1, 2020. This change is important because the HCA/TriStar providers left Cigna LocalPlus on June 1, so members of Cigna LocalPlus ARE eligible to change their enrollment to Cigna OAP . The BCBST Network S has not lost 5 or more participating hospitals over this time period, so members in BCBST Network S DO NOT MEET the eligibility requirements and cannot enroll in OAP in June. The reason someone might want to change from LocalPlus to Cigna OAP is because HCA hospitals and providers are staying in the OAP network. LocalPlus members who choose to enroll in Cigna OAP must pay the higher premium which includes a monthly surcharge : $40 for employee only or employee+child(ren) coverage, or $80 for employee+spouse and employee+spouse+child(ren) coverage. New OAP coverage would begin July 1, 2020. Member Communications: We are required to notify all members in Cigna LocalPlus and BCBST Network S (our narrow networks) so they all were sent an email or a letter (if we don't have an email address ) letting them know about this change in IRS guidance, but only Cigna LocalPlus members ARE ELIGIBLE to change their enrollment to Cigna OAP. Letters/emails include instructions on how to enroll and FAQs . Copies were sent to ABCs on Friday, May 29. Even though we have sent 137,000 emails and another 7,000 letters to members, we know they will respond better when they hear from you, so if you have not already, we would ask you to share the information as well. The operations team is reaching out to everyone who contacted the service center and was told they could not enroll mid -year in OAP to let them know that t hey now can. All member communications and information are found on the ParTNers for Health website > Health Options > Carrie r Information Find the special mid -year OAP enrollment premium charts , member letter, FAQs, Enrollment Change Application and enrollment instructions, OAP Provider Directory, and more on the ParTNers for Health website, Carrier Information page. OAP total premium charts are on the website : State and Higher Education active employees 2 State and Higher Education retirees State and Higher Education COBRA participants Local Education active e mployees Local Educati on teacher retirees Local Education support staff retirees Local E ducation COBRA participants Local Government active employees Local Government retirees Local Government COBRA participants Local Education and Local Government premiums do not reflect any employers' contributions. As a reminder, HCA/TriStar providers are out of Cigna LocalPlus but St. Thomas facilities and providers ar e now in the LocalPlus network. Plan Documents have been updated to reflect the change that is being allowed. See Section 2.10 (D). Operations How to Enroll: LocalPlus members who wish to and agree to pay the OAP surcharge can enroll in OAP between June 8 -19, 2020, by completing an Enrollment Change Application.

Communications Reminder ABC Conference Calls next week : The June monthly ABC conference calls will be held next week. o Higher Ed - Tuesday, June 9 at 8:30 a.m. Central time o Local Ed - Tuesday, June 9 at 10 a.m. Central time o Central State - Tuesday, June 9 at 12:30 p.m. Central time o Local Government - Tuesday, June 9 at 2 p.m. Central time Agenda and information will be sent on Friday . STATE AND HIGHER ED QUESTIONS Are HCA/Tristar providers only in middle Tennessee? o Answer: They are in middle Tennessee, and the Parkridge hospitals in the Chattanooga area. Are St. Thomas (providers) in the OAP network in addition to LocalPlus ? o Answer: Yes, St. Thomas facilities and affiliated providers are in the Cigna OAP . OAP has all HCA providers and St. Thomas hospital system providers. This d oes not impact the w estern region, correct? o Answer: Correct. Just wanted to verify that if a LocalPlus member has been approved for a Continuity of Care exception under LocalPlus and this was approved through December 31, 2020, does that employee need to change to OAP or will the Continuity of Care still cover them ? o Answer: If someone has been approved for Continuity of Care through 2020 , it is up to the member if they want to continue and remain in LP or change to OA P. Members do not have to change to OAP in this instance, as their Continuity of Care will provide them in-network bene fits with the approved provider(s) or hospital . It does not give the member in-network access to other HCA/TriStar providers or hospitals . For 2021 , the indiv idual will want to look at all enrollment options based upon their provider preferences . 4 I thought the o riginal Continuity of Care exception in the letter only said 90 days ? o Answer: What we have tried to express in the information we have shared and during ABC calls is that the 90 days is a general standard . Every i ndividual situation is review ed and approved based on medical necessity and Continuity of Care is based on the individual and their medical necessity . Are you certain this network of hospitals is staying in OAP past 8/1 but not sure beyond 12/31/20? o Answer: Yes, HCA pr oviders will be in the OAP network for our members through 12/31/ 21. It is my understanding that the only HCA /TriStar hospital in the Chattanooga and surrounding area is Parkridge hospital. S ince the eligibility criteria requires the loss of five hospitals, would Chattanooga State employees be eligible to transfer to an OAP plan? They would only have our Erlanger hospital in -network facilities after losing Park ridge. I just need clarification. o Answer: The 5-hospital rule is for the en tire network , not within a certain radius for an individual . Even though the Parkridge hospital is only the facility within an individual's area, the LocalPlus member is eligible to make a change now because 5 hospitals have left the entire network. For clarification, there are three Parkridge hospitals in the Chattanooga area that are in the HCA/TriStar system; Parkridge East Hospital and Parkridge Medical Center in Chattanooga and Parkridge West Hospital in Jasper. If an employee has met their out -of-pocket max with Cigna LocalPlus for 2020, will they have to pay a higher deductible with OAP for 2020 year? o Answer: We will be working with Cigna to make sure that all accu mulator s are transferred to the OAP plan so they won't have to meet a new deducible and out-of- pocket maximum if they make a change. Also, t here is no difference in the out -of- pocket maximum and deductible with the change in LocalPlus to OAP as the member will be staying in the same enrollment tier (employee, family, etc.) and health plan option (Premier or Standard PPOs or CDHP). Is it possible for the HCA providers to return to LocalPlus after August 1? o Answer: No, it is not possible for the HCA provider s and facilities to return to LocalPlus. Cigna has a new relations hip with S t. Thomas facilities and associated providers . The LocalPlus network also includes the Vanderbilt facilities and providers. Do ABC's need to wait to submit enrollment change application until 06/08 or are we allowed to go ahead and upload via Zendesk as this time as the applications are received o Answer: You can go a head and send the enrollments in now. How long before new ID cards are mailed out? o Answer: The standard is for new ID cards to be mailed within 10 days af ter the new eligib ility file is loaded by Cigna . The FAQs mention hospitals and providers, what about labs? o Answer: The standard labs that Cigna uses, LabCorp , Quest, etc., are all in-network providers . If you are using a hospital -based lab, whether or not they are in -network will be based on the relationship with that hospital . Will the higher premium be added at the end of July payment? 5 o Answer: Yes, we will be billing at the end of June for July premiums, so you will see the changes on your July 15th ACH . I have received several forms already. Do I need to submit separate Zendesk tickets for each one? o Answer: Yes, we do need a separate Zendesk ticket for each enrollment form. If an employee sends an application directly to B enefits Administration (BA) will BA send it to the ABC to have the bottom part filled out or will BA process it without that information? o Answer : In this particular situation , we will process without the bottom filled out . This is a busy time , and we want to make sure the enrollment is keyed before it goes into effect. We will process the enrollment and send a response to the member and copy the primary ABC so you are aware as well . So what happens during the month of June for those with HCA providers? We pay at the end of the month, but coverage doesn't begin until 7/1? What does the 6/30 payment go towards? o Answer: We will finalize the bill for your agency at the end of June /beginning of July and that is for July coverage . They won 't pay for OAP coverage until that new coverage begins . If they visit an OAP provider during June , that will be considered an out -of- network visit unless they are approved for Continuity of Care. Did you exclude from communications , members in the western regio n? o Answer: No, we did not . We were required to communicate this mid -year enrollment opportunity to all members in both the BlueCross BlueShield Network S and Cigna LocalPlus narrow networks. How do we secure a Continuity of Care for our existing providers in the event of an emergency situation in June? o Answer: If there is an emergency , ER coverage still exist s and is not out -of-network . Members can go to the nearest hospital. If you need to request Continuity of Care for non-emergency care , members can go onto the state's Cigna site, cigna.com/stateoftn and find the Continuity of Care form and submit it to Cigna . LOCAL EDUCATION/LOCAL GOVERNMENT QUESTIONS Both Tri -Star and HCA are leaving Cigna L ocalPlus? o Answer: The name of the system is HCA/TriStar and it is the TriStar hospitals in middle Tennessee and three Parkridge hospitals in Chattanooga that are now out of the HCA/TriStar system. Does this affect West Tennessee ? o Answer: It really doesn't unless someone comes to a HCA/TriStar provider in middle Tennessee for their care . What if your agency isn't set up for self -service at this time? o Answer: You don't have to use self-service for these changes . BA has to key all of the enrollment forms and we will accept them from you or the employee . You also are not able to make the change in a Benefits eForm. 6 Will we be able to run a query showing who elected to make the change? o Answer: Yes, we have queries that are available that are typically used during the annual enrollment period . Run the TN_BA219 _MED _DEN _COVERAGE quer y if you want to see coverage for all your employees, and run TN_BA219_ MED _DEN _ELECTIONS to see changes made specifically during this time period. Use a date range from 6/1 through the current date until after the current enrollment period ends and this will show you who made a change . We recommend that you continue running this query until 7/1 to capture all changes made. We will also notify you via Zend esk ticket if we process an enrollment that does not have your signature on it. Can employees currently on Cigna LocalPlus change to BCBS if they want to? o Answer: No, the Insurance Committee approval does not allow this. Can we use Zendesk to upload the enrollment form? o Answer : Yes, absolutely. This is the preferred way . Either the AB C or the employee can upload the form. You do not have the LocalPlus (network option) anymore ? o Answer : Yes, we still have the LocalPlus network , but as of June 1, HCA/TriStar providers are no longer in LocalPlus , St. Thomas providers are now in the network. The limited opportunity allows LocalPlus members to change to OAP from June 8 -19 if they want to and agree to pay the higher premium/surcharge. What if employees elect not to change from L ocalPlus to Open Access? Or do n't submit forms in time? o Answer: Members do not have to change from LocalPlus to OAP . This is only for people who want to keep their HCA/TriStar doctors and hospitals that are still in the OAP network and agree to pay the higher premium/surcharge. If they want to s tay in the LocalPlus network , or if they do not submit a form by June 19th, they will ha ve to wait until Annual Enrollment to make a change, effective Jan. 1, 2021. Can multiple forms be uploaded or just one at a time o Answer: We ask for just one form at a time as they are uploaded into Edison and need to be on separate tickets to do this. If we have multiple forms , can we scan them all at one time to Zen desk or will we need to do each ticket individually? This effects almost half of our employees. o Answer : You will need to submit separate Zendesk tickets . Also, y our emp loyees do not have to make this change. It will result in a higher premium unless your agency covers the premium for your employees. This is o nly if members want to enroll in the OAP network . Can you fax them in batch es? o Answer : If you send in a batch , then we have to separate them in the system which will delay the process ing of the enrollment forms , so please send them individually . Does this affect east TN area hospitals? o Answer: It only affects three Parkridge area hospitals in the Chattanooga area. They also could change later during annual enrollment if they aren't sure now about changing ? 7 o Answer: Correct, if eligible, they can change now or during Annual Enrollment in October for coverage beginning January 2021 . Due to payroll timing and the timing of the open enrollment, I realize I will not be able to catch the June payroll, but we run our July payroll in the 3rd week of June. Is there any way that all changes can be keyed in Edison by June 24th? o Answer: We are going to key t he changes as quickly as we can . It will depend on volume . If you have enrollment forms please send them now. You don't have to wait until Monday , June 8 to start to submit them. What if you looked today and your physicians are still on the Cigna site as i n-network? Does that mean the employee is okay ? o Answer: Cigna has put effective terminations into the ir system , including HCA hospitals and HCA -owned provider groups . If you are doing a search using myCigna .com or are using the \"Find a LocalPlus Network Medical Provider\" link on the microsite , https://www.cigna.com/sites/stateoftn /, that information has been updated with what is effective at this time . There are some independent physicians still showing as in -network while they are waiting to obtain privi leges at in-network hospitals . If those independent providers do not obtain privileges at an in -network hospital , they will become out -of-network providers and the online searches and directories will be updated accordingly. Cigna is also updating the 2020 PDF Provider Directory Listing o n the Cigna microsite. o Until updates are complete, members should search for providers using the live search link s or by calling Cigna at the dedicated state number, 800.997.1617. Cigna customer service will be able to answer any questions including whether an independent provider has privileges at a hospital in the LocalPlus network. Have the letters already been sent to members or did I understand they will begin to be sent out n ext week informing members of this special enrollment time? o Answer: The emails went out on Monday , and the letters were mailed this morning . We emailed those for whom we had an address , about 137K members , and we snail mailed to about 7 K members who did not have an email address in Edison . How does the Community of Care forms submitted and approved affect changes switching over from L ocalPlus to OAP? I have an employee who was approved but the employee asked if there was a limited time this approval would last and if should the employee should switch to OAP? o Answer: Based on their own medical necessity the letter of Continuity of Care should have the length of time the Continuity of Care is approve d. The member can also call Cigna 's customer ser vice at 800.997.1617 for the length of time it was approved . In some cases it may be a short period of time and in some cases it may be longer . Based on their approval , the member may want to change to OAP to br idge the gap or if the Continuity of Care exception length of time is sufficient or if they plan to change providers , they may not want to make a switch. Last month , I was told HCA will stay on until 8/1 and it was pending the contract approval for the remainder of the year ? o Answer: We have confirmation that HCA /TriStar hospitals and providers will stay in the Cigna OAP network for our members until Dec. 31, 2021 . So if an employee has diabetes and wants to stay with their specialist will the Continuation of Coverage apply and work 8 o Answer : Continuity of Care is review ed for each ind ividual based on their medical necessity . If that p atient is a standard diabetic patient and they go once every six month s, it may not meet medical necessity . Any ind ividual who has a complex medical condition needs to reach out to Cigna directly and file for Continuity of Care and get a n approval or denial based on their needs. The form is on the Cigna microsite. If Continuity of Care is approved, it will be for a specified period of time and the member will ne ed to take that time period into consideration when deciding if they should stay in LP or switch to OAP and pay the higher premium/surcharge. Is there a way to check to see if our providers are part of HCA/TriStar? o Answer: Either go to the customer portal , mycigna.com if you are already a Cigna or Cigna State of Tennessee microsite and use the link there and search for your providers there .

And there are not likely to be many benefits fairs this summer and fall. Because of this, we are discussing the possib ility of having webinars with specific vendor partners just for employees due to lim ited access to vendors. This would not replace the general employee webinars that we during annual enrollment. We will have more information available later. 2021 Newsletter Pre -Order: With budget cuts, we need to save on printing and mailing costs wherever we can. We know some people are working in , and some out of the office, most of us have slower or no hiring right now and, as I mentioned earlier, there are likely to be no or very few benefits fairs this year, so, we have made the decision that we will not print or mail extra copies of the annual enrollment newsletters to ABCs this fall. We will of course snail mail to every eligible employee. o This means that you will need to email the Annual Enrollment newsletter or copy it to give to you r new hires between August 3rd and October 15 (S/HE) or Oct 30 (LEA/LG) . We will also, as usual, post PDFs of the newsletter on our website and you will be able to copy that link and/or direct members to the PDF on the ParTNers site. o We typically mail news letters to retirees who pick up retiree coverage after we finalize the list for mailing. This year, if we have an email address on file , we will email a copy of the newsletter instead of mailing it. If we do not have an email address, we will mail the news letter to them. o We do appreciate your understanding of the need to make this change. Cigna LocalPlus to Cigna OAP Limited Opportunity Enrollment, Now through June 19 o As relayed to you by email and during our special ABC webinar, Cigna LocalPlus members have the opportunity to make a change now through June 19, 2020, to Cigna OAP because the Cigna LocalPlus network has lost 5 or more participating hospitals between January 1, 2020, and June 1, 2020. o So far, we have receiv ed several hundred enrollment forms. Thank you for sending these in early and please continue to do so. o As a reminder, members do not have to make this change - Cigna LocalPlus members, if they wish to and agree to must pay the higher premium which includes a monthly surcharge: $40 for employee only or employee+child(ren) coverage, or $80 for employee+spouse and employee+spouse+child(ren) coverage. New OAP coverage would begin July 1, 2020. o Letters/emails were sent to all members (if we had an email address) , including BlueCross members because we had to inform BCBST members about this information - but only LocalPlus members can make a change to OAP. o HCA TriStar providers have left Cigna LocalPlus , but St. Thomas hospitals and affiliated providers have joined LocalPlus. o The reason someone might want to change from LocalPlus to Cigna OAP is because HCA hospitals and providers are staying in the OAP network. 3 o Member Communications: In addition to the email/letter sent, we sent another email out this week and will send another email next week reminding LocalPlus members about this limited enrollment opportunity. o All member communications and information are found on the ParTNers for Health website > Health Options > Carrier Information Find the special mid -year OAP enrollment premium charts , member letter, FAQs, Enrollment Change Application and enrollment instructions, OAP Provider Directory, and more on the ParTNers for Health website, Carrier Information page. 2021 Premiums and Benefits Updates o 2021 health insurance: Active state and higher education employees - 2.8% premium increase State and higher education retirees - 3.6% premium increase Local education employees /local education retirees - 2% premium increase Local government employees /local government retirees - 5.4% premium increase o Health insurance premium charts were sent to ABCs Friday, June 5, 2020 o Voluntary benefits: Vision coverage : no premium increase for either the Basic or Expanded plans . Davis Vision continues to be the vendor for vision coverage. Dental coverage : Dental Prepaid vendor will continue to be Cigna. Premium rates will increase by 3%. Dental DPPO vendor and premium rates to be announced as soon as the procurement process is f inal. As soon as all vendors are finalized, we will send out the 2021 voluntary benefits premium charts. State/Higher Ed : HSA/FSA vendor Optum will be the vendor managing the HSA/FSA accounts for members starting in January 2021. More information will be included in the 2021 newsletter. Local Ed/Local Gov : HSA vendor Optum will be the vendor managing the HSA accounts for members starting in January 2021. More information will be included in the 2021 newsletter. o CVS/caremark : will continue to administer our pharmacy benefits. The Committee adopted the Standard Control Formulary for prescription drugs. This formulary is widely adopted by other plans and purchasers. This will mean a change to 169 products and a savings to our plans an d is estimated to save members approximately $823,000. Letters will be sent to members from CVS caremark in mid -November . A pathway for coverage of excluded products, if medically necessary, will exist for members. o Osteoporosis medications added to maintenance tier. The Insurance Committees approved adding these medications to the drugs eligible for the maintenance tier , which allows members to receive a 90 -day supply at a reduced cost. 4 o State/Higher Ed: 2021 Wellness Program Incentive updates : We do have some 2021 wellness program updates and will share more information with you during the July ABC calls. For 2021, we will continue the dollar amount of $250 per head of contract and spouse ($500 maximum payment). Operations Higher Ed/ Local Ed/Local Gov: Email Addresses Update Reques t: We will be contacting agencies to update employee email addresses over the next few mont hs. We will start with higher education in the next week or two .

CONFERENCE CALL QUESTI ONS o Higher Ed: Do you have any w ellness program stats on utilization? Answer: We will go over the stats from 2019 during the July 2020 ABC conference calls. o Local Ed: Will members have new cards by July 1 (for the change to OAP from LocalPlus) and will they be a vailable on the website ? How soon can they print temp orary cards from the Cigna site? Answer: Members won't have new cards in the mail by July 1 due to the printing and mailing process. The majority of enrollment changes will have been sent to Cigna by July 1 , so the majority of members should be able to find their new card information on the websi te. There may be a bit of a delay for some members depending on when their enrollment form is processed by BA and the data is transmitted to Cigna. o Local Ed: Are the Cigna emails/letters being sent to west T ennessee as well, not just middle Tennessean an d east Tennessee? Answer: Yes, they are being sent to West Tennessee , as we are required to send to all LocalPlus members. 6 o Local Ed: Does the change in the formulary affect the drugs that have to be processed through the specialty pharmacy which seems to currently have a higher copay ? Answer: The change will affect multiple drugs , not just preferred brands or specialty pharmacy . Affec ted members will receive a letter in mid -November if their medication(s) is impacted by the formulary change. o Local Ed: A lot of our employees have asked why our presc ription plan does not do more for those with diabetes. It appears that the meds and products associated with diabetes is increasing. Just wanted to throw this out there as I am being asked about this . Answer: We provide a very rich benefit for members with diabetes, actually. Anyone who fills a diabetes -related medication (oral or injectable) , as well as insulin , test strips and lancets - when filled in a 90 -day supply through either mail order or at a participating Retail -90 pharmacy (e.g ., Kroger, Walmart, Food City, Publix or thousands of independents) , will pay a lower copay th an if you filled each 30 days 12 times per year. If you're in the CD HP, your diabetes meds in a 90-day supply will bypass the deductible, as allowed by the IRS, and will have a lower copayment as well. To find a participating Retail 90 pharmacy to fill you r diabetes medications, go to info.caremark.com/stateoftn and click on \"90 Day Retail Pharmacy List.\" o Local Ed: I have employees asking if there has been an increase in copays for Cigna due to being charged for specialty visits when going to places like Fast Pace, an urgent care facility. They were told by Cigna there was a n increase in February and they do not have to notify members . Can you check into this ? Answer: If the provider 's services change from a primary to specialist or convenience care to urgent care , the provider contract would be updated and the copay would change . We set our benefit copays, so if Fast Pace is an urgent care facility, they will charge a n urgent care copay. If members go to a convenience care clinic, this is a convenience care copay. We confirmed with Cigna that the contract with Fast Pace Urgent Care was updated effective 2/15 from multiple provider contracts with some as primary care and some as urgent care to a consoli dated contract as urgent care. o Local Ed: Following up to the previous question, c an providers make that change whenever they feel like it? I thought that these were set once a year? Answer: Providers are not necessarily making the change . This is similar to the contract neg otiations that our carriers go through with provider systems. P roviders come up for renewal throughout the year , and there is a recredentialing process . This includes w hat level of service they provide in their clinic a nd a renewal of the licensing for this provider . If the services are moving from basic to more urgent care, for example they are able to do IVs, some advanced imaging and more urgent care, this mo ves from basic care to more urgent care. W hen a primary care doctor is moving to a more specialist type of care , this can change the type of copay that is applied . Our plan copays, deductibles and coinsurance are established annually. Follow up question : I have only been charged the regular copay, as well as other employees in our district? Answer: We confirmed with Cigna that the contract with Fast Pace Urgent Care was updated effective 2/15 from multiple provider contracts with some as primary care and some as urgent care to a consolidated contract as urgent care. 7 o Local Ed: Can we send those emails in Excel (email address updates) and have B A upload? Answer: Yes, this is the same process as last year . o Local Ed: Are the email addresses that are being uploaded on the enrollment forms added into Edison by BA for those new employees or those employees who are adding dependents or taking dependents off? Answer: For your new emp loyees, when entering the new ehire form in Edison , you are prompted to enter the email address . You should enter the email address , and it won't let you move past it in the system. For the paper enrollment , SQE s and li fe events , our staff should be changi ng and adding the email address. If you noticed that we have missed entering an updated email address that was submitted on an enrollment form please submit a Zendesk ticket , and we will manually correct it in Edison. o Local Ed: When will we know about the summer meetings? Answer: We are finalizing our schedule for virtual meetings/webinars to be held in August and will send information to you as soon as it is available . o State: I had an emp loyee submit a form for the special enrollment from LocalPlus to OAP directly to BA for Treasury . Are ABC signatures required on these forms? Answer: For this limited enrollment, an ABC signature is not required for these forms for LP to OAP . For any other forms , then yes , the form need s to be signed by you. Due to the tight time frame , we do not need the signature on the June 8 -19 limited OAP enrollment form. o State: We will not be able to order additional newsletters this year correct? Only eligible members will get something via mail from BA ? Answer: Yes, correct. You won't be able to order extra newsl etters, and yes, all eligible employees hired before Aug 3 will get a mailed copy from BA . o State: Do you have info rmation about the benefits for those in the possible buy out? Answer: No, we do not . We h ave not been asked to put anything together. o State: Did you say there may be a possible change in vendors? Answ er: Yes, there will be a new H SA/FSA vendor beginning on Jan. 1, 2021 , and that will be Optum . Our dental contracts were re -procured , and we may or may not have a new Dental DPPO vendor. Cigna is the prevailing vendor for the Dental prepaid plan. BCBS and Cigna will remain as will Davis Vision. CVS/caremark will be the pharmacy vendor going forward. o State: With the new FSA/HSA vendor, will excess funds from FSA and HSA roll over to Optum? People who have an FSA can currently roll over up to $500 each year . Answer: We have not started the implementation with Optum yet , so all of the details are yet to be worked out . But no one will lose their funds in their PayFlex HSA. Further, anyone with a healthcare FSA or limited purpose FSA should be able to carry over up to $500 with Optum. We will work with Optum over the summer and fall to iron out all of the details and will communicate those to you once we know more. 8 o Local Gov: Which middle Tennessee hospitals left Cigna LocalPlus ? Our employees would like to know so they can make a decision. Answer: You can find a PDF of LocalPlus hospitals on the ParTNers website. It shows which HCA/TriStar hospitals terminated and which Saint Thomas hospitals joine d June 1 . The terminated HCA/TriStar hospitals in middle Tennessee include, Hendersonville Medical Center, Summit (Hermitage), Horizon Medical Center (Dickson), Stonecrest (Smyrna), Southern Hills and Skyline (Nashville), and Centennial (Nashville and Ashland City) . Effective June 1 in middle Tennessee, the hospitals that are in LocalPlus or contracted effective June 1 are the St. Thomas facilities and hospitals, Vanderbilt hospitals, Williamson Medical Center, among others. o Local Gov: What is the procedure for a member filing paperwork for Continuity for Care? Will the response be returned in time if the member is denied to then change to Cigna Open Access? Answer: Because of the time to enroll in OAP being short , it may not allow an individual to submit a Continuity of Care and receive a response prior to the deadline of June 19 at this point. o Local Gov: I had a question from an employee that wants to change to OAP. Will the amount she has paid toward her deductible stay in effect if she elects to change to OAP ? Answer: Yes, the amounts the employee has paid to the deductible and out-of- pocket maximum will be applied to OAP after the July effective date . It may take a couple of weeks , and if members have some late arriving claims or if some fe el that the am ounts are not accurate , they can cal l Cigna at 800.997.1617 for assi stance . o Local Gov : The June 2 call notes say the OAP providers will be in the network until Dec. 2020 , but the FAQs say 2021 ? Answer: We do have confirmation that OAP providers will stay in network th rough 2021 , which is when our current carrier contract exp ires. o Local Gov: Are HSA s moving from Payflex to Optum? Answer: Yes, that is correct , the PayFlex contract ends Dec. 31, 2020 , and Optum will be the new HSA trust administrator from January 1, 2021 -December 31, 2025. . o Local Gov: So Payflex wil l no longer be the HSA vendor beginning January 2021? Will there have to be changes made through your payroll system for submission of monies to account? Answer : We are still working out these details with Optum at this point . We will be in touch with ABCs as we have more inform ation . o Local Gov: What were the annual enrollment dates? Answer: For local government active employees and retirees, Oct. 1 through Oct. 30, 2020. o Local Gov: Is there a contact person I can speak to about the Continuity of Care? Answer: The best place to contact is to call Cigna directly , at 800.997.1617 , and they can get you the form and help you submit the form directly for review and approval. Please note, the Continuity of Care will be approved for a specified amount of time , and it may not be th rough the end of the year. 9 o Local Gov: Some of our employees are wondering about the C igna OAP deductibles and copays. A re they the same? Answer: Copays, deductibles and out -of pocket maximums are the same no matter what network ( Cigna LocalPlus, Cigna OAP or BlueCross BlueShield network S) a member is enrolled in. The premiums for OAP are more expensive because members have access to more providers. With OAP, there is a premium surcharge of $40 for employee only or employee plus child(ren) and $80 for employee plus spouse and employee plus spouse plus children. o Local Gov: I know you said you had limited information but do you kno w what will happen to our balance in our Payflex accounts? Answer: We will work with Optum over the summer and fall to iron out all of the HSA details and share those with you as we know more. No one will lose their HSA funds, as we are hopeful that we will be able to do a bulk transfer and move everyone's from PayFlex to Optum. We have to work with both companies and legal to iron out the logistics, though. We will let you know as we find out more. o Local Gov: Is there a list of hospitals that left (LocalPlus) in east Tennessee ? Answer: We have posted the hospital list on the Carrier Information page . All hospitals are still in LocalPlus e xcept for the three Parkridge hosp itals in the Chattanooga and outlying Chattanooga area. o Local Gov: Could an individual keep their Payflex account open but pay their own fees? Answer: We believe so, but be aware the state's contract with Optum is from 2021 through 2025 . When someone enrolls in the CDHP or the Local CDHP , the state sends the info rmation to that vendor and that vendor will be Optum . If the member decide s to keep money in the PayFlex account , the member w ill have to pay the fees. We have just started working with Optum and we will have more information to share later . o Local Gov: What happens to the investment accounts with Payflex? Answer: The HSA s are individually owned bank accounts . We have not talked to Optum about this yet, but we cannot whole sale move from one to the other. W e will talk to Optum , and we will discuss if we need individual approval for each account and will share that with you. It is l ikely there will be different investment options under Optum, and once any member's HSA funds are mo ved from PayFlex to Optum the member will then have the choice to again invest their funds and from a new slate of different investment opportunities. We will also work with the State Treasury office staff to ensure that all investments meet their approval . o Local Gov: We have several members who have not received notice of the Cigna change. Why could that be? Answer : We emailed them and snail mailed for those we did not have an email . If they did not get or open their email - all of the information, including copies of the letters and FAQs, is on our website. We have heard from some of you that the email went into a spam folder. This could occur for a number of reasons which could include a server or Internet Service Provider not allowing the email to go through. This is one reason why it is so important for ABCs to share the information we send you with your plan members. 10 o Local Gov: Regarding dental refunds , we did not receive refunds for employees that have terminated. Will we be getting these? Answer: Yes, your agency will receive the refunds for the dental discounts for termed employees on the July bill as they did not populate on the June bill . Higher Education, Local Education , State and Local Government ABC Conference Call July 14 , 2020 Materials and Communications ABC Survey Update : For the 2020 ABC Survey, we had 370 responses for a 62% response rate - which is great!

These protests result in a stay of the process to enter into a Dental DPPO contract. CPO must follow certain procedures to resolve the protests. So this means we are on hold in moving forward to announce the DPPO vendor for 2021 . We will share information with y ou as it is available. o Dental Prepaid vendor will continue to be Cigna. o HSA/FSA , beginning in 2021, the contract was awarded to Optum Bank . o Local Ed/Local Gov : Once we have more information about how employer payroll deduction s will work and any changes, we will share that information with you.

Local Ed/Local Gov: Optum - Talk It Out Tuesdays Campaign : Matt Cramer with Optum , our behavioral health and EAP vendor , joined us to talk about a new campaign that will start next week for local education and local government employees called Talk It Out Tuesdays . Talk It Out Tuesdays is a four -week program where members can call in to any or all of the sessions and listen and talk anonymously in a group setting with a licensed care clinician. Members can come and go as they please. It allows members to connect and process expe riences surrounding the pandemic and current state of the world in a safe setting with guidance from a licensed therapist. The ParT Ners Health and Wellness Center has been doing these sessions for state employees and the response has been extremely positiv e. We have attached a flier to the Friday email and encourage you to share it with your plan members. We will also send an email to all members for whom we have an email address in Edison next week. Operations o Local Ed: Employees not in Edison: BA recently conducted a review of Edison data versus TCRS data and identified local education employees that appear to be eligible for insurance based on service credits being reported to CONCORD but who are not active in Edison. We will be reaching out to the impacted agencies to confirm if these employees should be added to Edison and asking you to add them if they are elig ible.

CONFERENCE CALL QUESTIONS HIGHER EDUCATION o Higher Ed : Is the prostate exam no longer considered an eligible incentive ? Answer: That is correct. We took this off the incentive grid for 2020 . The preventive screening has been downgraded to a C /D rating , depending on a man's age. Undergoing this screening should be an individual decision that is best left up to the individual and the ir physician. We hope to replace this with the lung cancer screening, but we are on hold until the USPSTF completes their evaluation of the screening a nd updates the rating. o Higher Ed: Are there many institutions that are still having their biometric screenings this fall? Answer: We are communicating with ActiveHealth, and Quest has put safety measures in place . They are prepared to continue with the screening site if an institution wants to move forward and have their screening. Many state buildings 5 are still closed so we are canceling these screenings , but we are leaving the decision up to the higher education institutions to de cide if they would like to hold their screening s. o Higher Ed: Any word on the new FSA/HSA vendor? Answer: The Insurance Committees met in late May and awarded it to Optum Bank . We are meeting with Optum Bank this week and will share more details as they are available . o Higher Ed: Any dental vendor changes? Answer: Cigna will be the Prepaid Dental vendor going forward . The DPPO vendor contract is still under review . We will let you know when we have more information to share about the DPPO vendor. LOCAL EDUCATION o Local Ed: Who is the new dental vendor? Answer: The Prepaid Dental vendor will remain Cigna and for the DPPO vendor, at this time, we don't know. T here is a protest and the Central Procurement Office is in charge of the procurement process at this point. o Local Ed: Will local education employees receive an email about the Talk It Out Tuesday campaign ? Answer: Yes, we will send an email to those employees for whom we have an email address in Edison. We will also send a flier to all ABCs and would appreciate it if you will share it with your employees. o Local Ed: What are the differ ences between t he forms ? Do I use Application for The Tennessee Plan and the Application to Continue Insurance at Retirement ? I have a new retiree and this retirees want s to continue coverage but only want s to continue using the supplement . Answer: Whenever you have an active employee wanting to enroll in retirement insurance, you should always use the Application to Continu e Insurance at Retirement. They would use Part 4 on this form to enroll in The Tennessee Plan. As the ABC, you need to provide Benefits Administration the termination date of active insurance and the effective date of The Tennessee Pl an enrollment . This is true even if the member was not enrolled in active insurance coverage or was enrolled as a dependent on another employee's coverage. The stand -alone application for UMR/POMCO is used for those already retired and becoming Medicar e eligible. Local Ed: If MetLife is not awarded the dental contract , how do the waiting periods work? Answer: The waiting periods won't change , so if a member has already satisfied them with the current DPPO vendor , MetLife, they will have been met with the next DPPO vendor. So if a member is enrolled in the DPPO and stays enrolled in the DPPO , the time applied to their waiting periods will transfer. Local Ed: When keying new hires, if they have an existing Edison ID, even if it's inactive, Edison doesn't allow me to key benefits right away, as it does for employees who do not have an existing Edison ID. Can you explain this? 6 Answer: If you are using a future hire date , the system will not allow you to key the coverage until the hire date has occurred . Follow up question: But it does let me key benefits for those who didn't have existing Edison ID with a future date ? Answer: Yes, if the person is new to Edison , you can key the future hire and the benefits at the same time. The system is not allowing you to key the benefits on an existing Edison record due to the future hire date because the employee does not technically belong to your agency until that hire date. Additional question : Just confirming the Edison ID emails for new hires will also populate on the future hire date? Answer: Yes, that is correct. Once you have put the eHire form in and put the email address in the form , once that date approaches it will all s ync into Edison . o Local Ed: Do we need to key term ination for our retirees in Edison or will you term them? Answer: You should always terminate any employee who is no longer eligible for insurance through Job Data. This is true even for an employee who is retiring and has applied for retirement insurance. You can key the termination in Edison once you are aware the member is retiring, even if the active coverage is effective until the beginning of t he next school term. If necessary, Benefits Administration will terminate the active record if the retirement insurance enrollment is ready to be processed. Once a member is enrolled in retirement insurance, you should not make ANY changes to the member's record . All retirement insurance changes must be processed through Benefits Administration. o Local Ed : When can we order the new booklets for benefits? Answer : We are n ot going to print the annual enrollment newsletters this year for your new hires due to efforts to decrease our printing costs. We will send a PDF to you digitally that you can then email or print out for your new hires hired after July 27. We will pull the mailing list and wi ll mail a newsletter to all eligible employees that are hired in Edison by July 27. For any employees hired after this time, you will be able to share the PDF of the newsletter or the 2021 Eligibility and Enrollment Guide which will be available in November. o Local Ed: Do we continue to send our monthly employer contributions to PayFlex until further notice? Answer: Yes, you would continue to do this through Dec ember. We will work with Optum on these details . Linnie Stelk , with Optum, will be on a future call and will walk you through how this will work . o Local Ed: Can an HSA participant change th eir deduction amount throu ghout the year , i.e., increase, decrease or cancel? Answer : Yes, participants can chang e their HSA during the plan year , but they cannot go over the federal limits depending on cove rage, and if 55 or older , this includes the $1,000 more allowed per month. T his also includes any seed funds you may supply as the employer. You can find these amounts on our website at tn.gov/PartnersFo rHealth under CDHP/HSA Insurance Options . o Local Ed : Do we only certify the years they have been with our system? Answer: Yes, you can certify just the years of service with your agency. All service does not count towards eligibility for retirement insurance even if it counts towards the TCRS pension. We advise that you direct members with eligibility questions to 7 contact Benefits Administration at 800.253.9981 . They would need to select o ption 2 when calling the service center so they can speak to a retirement insurance analyst. o Local Ed : If I have hired my new hires in Edison as of 8/3/2020, will they receive the annual enrollment newsletter via email since their email address is set up in the new hire screen? Answer: They will not receive one by mail as we are pulling the address/mailing list July 27 , but you can email them a PDF version. Every employee who has a mailing address i n Edison by July 27 will receive a newsletter by mail. For a nyone hired after July 27, you will need to email a pdf or you can print one out for them. o Local Ed: Have the new rates been announced ? Answer: Premiums were announced during the June conference calls . We also sent the premium charts on June 5 to all ABCs with the Friday email , and they are posted on the ABC webpage under Weekly Emails .. Here are the 2021 health insurance rates for local education: Local education employees/local education retirees will have a 2% premium increase. o Local Ed: Is there any way to get a copy of the annual enrollment brochure before August 1 ? We are having a large new hire meeting on July 27. It would be great to give the new employees a copy at that time. Answer : The newsletters won't go to print until the second week of August so they won't be ready at that time. The PDFs won't be ready until the second week of August. . STATE o State: Have they opened the biometric screenings yet? Answer: Yes, Quest is ready and they have protocols and safety measures in place just as if you were to go to the doctor's office . However, holding a screening will depend on if the building/site is open. State: About the vendor webinars during annual enrollment, h ow will they be disseminated to employees or how will this work ? Answer: We will send the information to ABCs first to share , and then we will include the information in the Annual Enrollment emails we send out to employees. We are still working out the details and not sure yet if employees will have to regist er or not . As soon as we have information available, we will share it with you. We also plan on recording the webinars and posting on our website for those who are not able to attend. LOCAL GOVERNMENT o Local Gov: Is the State staying with MetLife dental or are we changing to a different provider? Answer : We don't know yet. T here is a contract award in a review process , and we will let you know as soo n as we know the outcome. o Local Gov: Is the new HSA provider the same Optum that handles the EAP/Behavioral Health? 8 Answer: It is the same company , but it is a different division and separate contract . We have one contract for EAP/ behavioral health and one for HSA/FSA , called Optum Bank . We will share much more information with you in the months to come. o Local Gov: Do we know if HCA will stay with Cigna OAP for the 2021 coverage? Answer: Yes, Benefits Administration has confirmed with Cigna and HCA that HCA will remain in OAP for our pla n members until the end of the current medical contract which expires 12/31/2021. o Local Gov: We have an employee's dentist who is offering a second cleaning before the six months is up . Is this okay? Answer: Yes, on the certificate of coverage is states that two cleanings per calendar year are allowed , they do not have to be six -months apart.

HIGHER ED ABC CALL QUESTIONS o Higher Ed: For STD, w ill MetLife initiate the statement of health (SOH) form for those increasing cov erage or enrolling for the first time during Annual Enrollment ? If so, when is this done approximately , and how long do they have to provide the statement back? Also, does Edison provide the requirement for approval and information when enrolling? Answer: For Annual Enrollment , MetLife will mail a ll SOH forms to those employees if they want to enroll or increase their coverage . Employees will have until Nov . 6 to mail , fax or email (postmark/timestamp) these back to MetLife . Once underwriting is complete, M etLife will let employees know if the application is approved or denied - the acknowledgement will not go th rough Edison . If someone newly enrolls or increases coverage, Edison will display a warning message letting them know that they will have to provide the SOH and Edison includes the November 6 deadline. LOCAL ED ABC CALL QUESTIONS o Local Ed : If an employee drops a plan with the HSA , what happens to the money in their HSA? If he is no longer contributing, does he lose the money he has in the HSA ? I have an employee who has gotten married and he is wanting to change his plan when he adds his new spouse. Answer: The member's HSA funds will stay with the member - they do not lose the funds in the account and can continue to use the funds for qualified medical expenses if he/she switches from a CDHP to a PPO plan. However, if someone is enrolled in the Local CDHP a nd wants to switch to a PPO, the HSA funds will remain with PayFlex, not the new vendor for 2021, Optum Bank. The state has been paying the admin fees each month as long as the member is enrolled in a CDHP . If he/she decides to switch from the Local CDHP t o the PPO, the member will be come responsible for the monthly $4.00 per month administrative fees and PayFlex will automatically deduct this fee from the member's HSA each month as long as it remains open . This causes the account to become a \"retail accoun t\" between the member and PayFlex, and the State Group Insurance Program no longer has any role in this relationship. The member could continue to use the PayFlex debit card , but he/she will no longer be able to contribute or add any more money to the HSA. If the member is going through a SQE, he/she will have 60 days to change their plan options , but there are certain requirements around dropping their CDHP . So the member would need to contact customer service so we can address his/her specific situatio n. Combined ABC Conference Call Notes Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government September 8, 2020 5 o Local Ed : I had an employee ask me about the age for the pneumonia shot. I was not sure if that was 60 years or if anyone could get one. Please advise ? Answer: Our plan covers the pneumococcal vaccine for anyone of any age, but the CDC typically only recommends the pneumonia shot for those 65 or older (or those who are younger with a health condition so their doctor recommends they need a pneumonia shot). Here is some additional information about pneumococcal vaccines: protect against pneumococcal disease, including infections in the lungs and bloodstream (recommended for all adults over 65 years old, and for adults younger than 65 years who have certain chronic health conditions). https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/vaccines -age.html Here is additional information about shingles vaccines: The two different shingles vaccines are covered at no cost for the following ages: Zostavax (older shingles vaccine) - ages 60 and up; Shing rix (newer shingles vaccine) - ages 50 and up and this is a 2 -dose regimen. o Local Ed: Is it possible to get a new vendor for Dental for 2022? I have had several complaints from employees about Met Life and the coverage? Answer: We procure vendors th rough a state contract , and it is a rigorous process. We do know there will be a procurement for a Dental DPPO vendor for coverage starting Jan. 1, 2022, but we don't know who the vendor is going to be . Thanks for letting us know about the comp laints , and you should let MetLife know , too. o Local Ed: If we have s hot nurse come in and do the flu shots, can an employee file the claim themselves for rei mbursement? The s hot nurse is a vendo r on the list , so it would be covered ? Answer: If a vendor or pharmacy is on the vaccination list, this is the same as going in to the pharmacy but the nurse or provider coming in to give the shots will have to take the members' information that is on their member IDs and input it into their system back at the pharmacy just as if each person they provided a shot to had come into the pharmacy in person. CVS Caremark will not accept roster billing. The member's cost share for a flu shot is zero; there is no need for the member to file a claim themselves. o Local Ed: Do members have to pay extra for ActiveHealth programs? Answer: No, for members enrolled in medical coverage, they are available as a part of your benefits , at no extra cost . o Local Ed: Will they have to be enrolled in benefits to be able to participate (in ActiveHealth wellness programs) ? Answer: Yes, they do have to be enrolled in medical benefits to access the ActiveHealth resources. o Local Ed: Is the $29 for gym fees per insured covered? Do you have to be on the health plan? Answer: Members have to be enrolled in the medical plan and have their insurance with BlueCross to get the discount. F or eligible enrolled members, each member would have to pay the $29 enrollment fee plus the monthly fee. The gym benefit is a Combined ABC Conference Call Notes Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government September 8, 2020 6 discount program. The gym fees are not a covered medical expense under the health plan. o Local Ed: I wish we had programs for those employees that have Diabetes already. Is this something that the insurance companies, both Blue Cross and Cigna could look into covering. Answer: Actually, ActiveHealth has a disease management program , and they do have programs for members who have diabetes . ActiveHealth will reach out directly to member s if they are high risk , or members can reach out directly by calling 888- 741-3390 . Follow up question : Okay, I thought that this (diabetes prevention program) was only for prediabetics, so I was unaware of this for ActiveHealth . I will pass this on to our employees. Answer: The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is offered through the med ical carriers, Blue Cross and Cigna. Those programs are for prediabetics. o Local Ed: Has there been a change for 2021 regarding the Cost Share on dependents who have \"double coverage\" thr ough other insurance in addition to the State's plan? Letters were mailed from B enefits Administration stating a possible change in 2021. Answer : Yes, letters were mailed to some members. Members are still able to have double coverage - so, th ere is no change to eligib ility or the ability to obtain insurance either through the State if one indiv idual is in Local Education plan and also enrolled in the State pla n or a plan with another employer . What is changing is how the secondary claim s will be processed. Members will have to pay the member cost shar e. Historically, in some cases the member cost share was not being charged . We have corrected this, and now the member will be charged the correct member cost share . There is more information, including the letter that mailed to members and coverage examples , at the bottom of the Carrier Information webpage . o Local Ed: I have a question about the email that ABCs received regarding employee email addresses in Edison. Should we ONLY be updating the email addresses that were on the spreadsheet that we were sent or are we supposed to be supplying email addresses for all insurance eligible employees that are active in Edison? Answer: We do need correct email addresses for all insur ance-eligible emp loyees in Edison. If you received a list , this is because we know the email address was no longer valid . If you have other indivi duals with email addresses that changed or are incorrec t, please include those as well . o Local Ed: I have an employee who is receiving emails for someon e who is no longer employed here. Also her email address that was entered was a personal email address and not a school address. I have sent in a Zendesk ticket last week and still no response from anyone at BA ? Answer: If that ticket is still open and you have not heard anything , you can reply to the ticket and check back on the status . We will get back to you as soon as possible . Combined ABC Conference Call Notes Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government September 8, 2020 7 o Local Ed: The e mails we are receiving about the Edison password expired - my employees have asked about these and when they try to go in and change the password, they don't know their user ID . Do I have access to this? It is not the Edison ID, correct? Answer: Correct, it is their Access ID. If they hav e logged in before, they do not need their Access ID. They can use the button \"Retrieve Access ID\". If they have never logged in, they can use the \"First Time Login / New Hire\" button. We are modifying TN_BA302_PERSON_AND_JOB query and adding the Access ID so that you can get it. The updated query should be available next Monday. o Local Ed: I've had questions from employees who are wanting to know if/how air ambulance services are covered? Specifically if both Vanderbilt Lifeflight and AirEvac are covered? o Additional question: Is there anywhere specific online that a member can view specific information on air ambulance coverage. Answer: Air amb ulance is covered in an emergency situ ation but has to be deemed a medical situation , and the member has to be taken to the nearest facil ity. They can't take the member back home , or to Vanderbilt , for example , if another facility is closer . If the member is already at a medical facility and being transferred , air ambulance has to be approved for u se instead of ground transportation. As far as which companies, in an emergency, or if from a scene of an accident to a hospital , it is covered and there is no network r equirement . If between facilitie s, it has to be approved in advance . The carrier would help direct you to an approved service and provider . In addition to looking at the plan document , member handbooks and benefit grids , members can call the carriers to ask for help with finding providers . Benefits grids are on the Publications webpage under Insurance Comparison Charts. Members can also search through the BCBS online find care tool . Type Air Ambulance and enter the city in which they want to search. The search begins at 25 miles but can be changed up to 100 miles. BCBS has confirmed that the specific providers questioned on the call are in the BCBS network (Vanderbilt does business as Rocky Mountain, AirEvac including Erlanger). Here is the li sting of the air ambulance providers BCBS contracts with: Combined ABC Conference Call Notes Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government September 8, 2020 8 Cigna members can view the air ambulance providers contracted with Cigna by searching the PDF Cigna directories for \"air ambulance\" or by searching online on the member page. For additional assistance, here is the contact information for Cigna or BCBS T: Cigna 800.997.1617 24/7 cigna.com/stateoftn BlueCross BlueShield 7 - 5 CT bcbst.com/members/tn_state/ o Local Ed: I have had several employ ees having trouble updating their password s in Edison and it is not giving them an option to update ? Answer: It is possible if they have changed school systems . They may have to log in as a new hire instead of retrieving their Edison ID and passwords , as they are the only one that can change their email address. We put a security profile change in place. If they do not see a link to reset the ir password , or a security image or phrase, this likely means they do not have a security profile set up and they will need to log in as a first-time user/new hire. BA is assisting with password resets now, and Edison will take over during A nnual Enrollment. Also, t hey don't need to log in yet ; they can wait unti l Annual Enrollment to reset their passwords. If they d on't plan on making any changes during Annual Enrollment, they do not have to log in. o Local Ed: When will the provider directories, member handbooks, and eligibility/enrollment guides will be updated on the publications page? Answer: Our carriers are in process of updating the provider directo ries. Member handbooks will be updated by the first of November , and the Eligibility and Enrollment guides will be updated in November . o Local Ed: Will passwords in Edison be reset again prior to Annual Enrollment? Answer: We no longer send out mass password resets. Employees can reset their passwords by using the link in Edison . If they plan on making changes to their insurance, they can reset their password now or can wait until Annual Enrollment . o Local Ed: Employees are being bombarded with emails concerning the changing of passwords. Is there a way to start sending those closer to Open Enrollment, possibly mid-September? Answer : We have received additional information since the ABC call. We were originally told that the email was sent inadvertently to 1,900 employees. We have since found out that the email was part of a system update and was sent purposefully to 181,000 employees. They received emails for 10 days until or unless they reset their password. Those that didn't reset their password before the 10 days were up will be prompted to reset it the next time they log in. The Edison team also sent an email to this population to let them know this information Wednesday evening. Combined ABC Conference Call Notes Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government September 8, 2020 9 STATE ABC CALL QUESTIONS o State: We have had employees tell us that MetLife is telling them that they cannot sign up for disability if they are on FMLA? They say it is due to the possibility that we have had paid FMLA that has not gone through. Do you have any info rmation on this? Durin g the course of the year , I had an employee was about to go out on parental leave and have a baby and wanted to file for disability . They told her if they put her on FMLA they would not be able to put her on disability due to the possibility that if our pa id FMLA goes through , how would that money be paid back to MetLife ? Answer: MetLife is not aware of this with their service center and will take back and research. o State: Regarding FMLA dependent care and day care , with people working from home and not requiring to pay for day care, if they stopped contributions to their dependent care FSA and cannot utilize the money in the account , is there any word on using this money so they won't lose it? Answer : We don't have any guidance from the IRS on this . The IRS did provide some language in early May to allow emp loyees to stop deductions , but we are not aware of any guidance to allow them to be refunded or carryov er those funds into 2021 , and claims will still need to be filed by April 30 of next year , just as with any other year. o State: Will an agency still be able to request a vendor to come onsite to give flu sho ts this year? Answer : At this point in the year due to COVID -19, most pharmacies are not likely going to come onsite as they have in the pas t. If you choose to do this , it is your responsib ility to reach out to a pharmacy chain and make sure to verify that they are in the CVS Caremark Vaccine Network . They also cannot do roster billing - so they have to collect each person's info rmation from their ID card and file an individual claim , not do a roster billing, which is a list of names of those who received a shot. You can f ind a participating vaccine network pharmacy by going to info.caremark.com/stateoftn and scrolling down to Network Lists and look for the TN-WY list (PDF) . o State: What network will HCA be in? Will it still be in Cigna LocalPlus ? Answer: No, HCA TriStar providers will be in Cigna OAP. LOCAL GOVERNMENT ABC CALL QUESTIONS o Local Gov: When will the link work to register (for the employee insurance carrier webinars) ? I tried this morning and you could not register .

However, the 2020 and the 2021 premium tables are available for comparison on the Partners for Health premium webpage at https://www.tn.gov/partnersforhealth/insurance -premiums.html o Local Gov: Employees have been getting emails that Edison password s are expiring. What does that mean? Answer: We have received additional information since the ABC call. We were originally told that the email was sent inadvertently to 1,900 employees. We have since found out that the email was part of a system update and was sent purposefully to 181,000 employees. They got emails for 10 days until or unless they reset their password. Those that didn't reset their password before the 10 days were up will be prompted to reset it the next time they log in.

HIGHER ED UCATION QUESTIONS Higher Ed: When did the medical underwriting requirement begin for a spouse ? I did not have to do this for my spouse (a new hire and not for term life ). My understanding is you have employee only, spouse only, or employee/spouse, you could have the child rider, when did this change ? Answer: Medical underwr iting is always requ ired for spouse coverage . AD&D never requires evidence of insurability and there is the same coverage tier s. Higher Ed: If not approved for more vol term life insurance coverage , do you automatically default the coverage to the minimum? Answer: You would be d efaulted back to the life insurance amount you currently have . If you have guarante ed coverage and you are approved for the $5,000 increase it will go to that amount of coverage , but you have to go in and elect the $5,000 increase . Higher Ed: Will information regarding the guaranteed issue increases be mailed to participating members again? Answer: Yes, these letters will mail to members' homes and should arrive on or around the first of Oc tober 1 . Higher Ed: Can an employee cover just the child for voluntary life insurance , or just the spouse, without covering themselves? Also, do you require proof that the person being covered is really the employee's legal child or spouse? Are children required to have EOI submitted during Annual Enrollment? Answer: Either the employee or the spouse has to have the voluntary term life coverage for the child to have coverage - an employee cannot cover the child Combined ABC Conference Call Notes Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government September 15, 2020 5 unless the employee or spouse has coverage. The employee does not need to participate in the voluntary term life program to choose spouse voluntary coverage. Regarding proof that the person covered is the employee's legal child or spouse, the employee signs the application that they are a legal dependent and if the employee were to file a claim and he/she were not, the employee may have to refund premiums . An eligible child does not need to provide evidence of insurability. o Higher Ed: If you are enrolled in Cigna LocalPlus (LP) and you travel outside of Tennessee and you need care, you would still have coverage if LocalPlus is not available where you are through the Open Access Plus; it doesn't matter that I am not enrolled in the Open Access Plus ne twork? Answer: Correct, if yo u are in the LP network and , for example, you were in Kentucky and it doesn 't not have a LP network th rough Cigna , you would have access to OAP providers. Or , you are in a part of T exas and while T exas does have some locations that are in LP not all of the state is a LP market. Y ou can go to mycigna.com and enter the city and state and it will let you know if LP is offered - it will automatically give you providers in LP . You can call our service center for help. Higher Ed: If there is no pediatric dentist in your area and you need for your child to see a pediatric dentist, can you get approval to go to one that is out of network for in - network coverage? Answer: If a Pediatric Dentist is not available within the customer's home zip code area, Cigna Dental will provide a referral for the customer to receive covered services at the non -network Pediatric Dentist at the in -network benefit level. The customer needs to reach out to Cigna for the ref erral and they will be responsible for their Patient Charge noted on the Patient Charge Schedule and Cigna Dental will pay the difference between the dentist's billed charge and the customer's Patient Charge for the covered service. Higher Ed: Memphis has no endodontis t. So they have let us go to another MetLife endodontist and the claim is processed out -of-network and then in -network because one is 70-miles away from Memphis. Answer: If you have a situation and you need a special ist and you are out of a certain mileage , we will try to find you one within a reasonable mileage . If the provider is not available within a reasonable area, we can approve services at the in - network level . Higher Ed: I have an employee who received a letter from BA that she or one of her dependents are enrolled in one or more plans and that coordination of benefits apply. She doesn't have secondary coverage on her , her spouse or dependents. She called the service center and was told that several letters were sent out incorrectly. Is there anything that she needs to do? Answer: We are n ot aware of any letters that were sent incorrectly. If you could send in the person's name and ID , we can follow up. If that empl oyee does not have other coverage in addition to the state of T ennessee coverage, then he/she does not need to worry about the coordination. For more information about Coordination of Benef its info, including links to a copy of the letter and examples, on the ParTNers Combined ABC Conference Call Notes Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government September 15, 2020 6 For Health website under the \"Health Options\" We'll also have someone on the calls next week to go over Coordination of Benefits (COB) .

Answer: No, we won't have another employee medical webinar, but you can contact the vendors directly at the information found on the Vendor Contact list and try to set something up virtually with them directly. Higher Ed: When employees click SUBMIT at the end of making changes during Annual Enrollment , did you say they'd get a preliminary email indicating they'd made changes? Answer: No, they will not get an email when they submit their changes. They will get an email after we finalize the enrollments at the end of the enrollment period. After they submit, they will see an Enrollment Preview statement that can be viewed, printed, or saved. Higher Ed: What about for the HSA/FSA? Will employees receive a confirmation email? Answer: Higher Education employees will enroll in flexible benefits through the Optum Bank Portal at optumbank.com/Tennessee . This enrollment process does not include entering an email address, so employees would not receive an email confirmation. However, employe es will see an onscreen enrollment that they can print for their records, if they like. For HSA, higher ed employees will enroll through Edison, and they will receive a confirmation email if they choose that option. (Note that the email from Edison will n ot contain flexible benefit elections, which are done outside of Edison on the Optum website itself.) A welcome letter and two cards will be sent via USPS, in two separate mailings in mid-December. If you are enrolled in both an HSA and an L -FSA, you will receive one card to use for both accounts. If you are enrolled in only one produce, an HSA, FSA, or L -FSA, you will receive one card. Higher Ed : Is MetLife Dental definitely the dental vendor? I saw where it was still pending. Answer: Yes, they are def initely the vendor for 2021. We had to go to press prior to final approval. The informa tion on our website is updated and correct . Higher Ed: When will the new pharmacy formulary be available ? Answer: It will be posted on the CVS Caremark microsite and the ParTNers for Health pharmacy webpage on Friday, Sept. 18 . o Higher Ed: Are the Optum Bank enrollment dates the same as Edison enrollment dates ?

Combined ABC Conference Call Notes Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government September 15, 2020 7 LOCAL EDUCATION ABC QUESTIONS o Local Ed: I did not see the 2021 BCBS and Cigna Handbooks, I may have overlooked those, but can you tell me if these are available on the ABC website? I apologize if this is something I have missed. Answer: 2021 handbooks will be posted on Nov. 1 as they are not provided unt il after the end of Annual Enrollment. There are no big surprises, no benefit changes. o Local Ed: What day will Optum talk to ABCs about the HSA changes? Is that next week? Answer: Yes, Optum Bank will join calls on Sept. 22 to talk about HSAs. o Local Ed: Will the employees still be able to delete their emails during the Annual Enrollment ? Answer: Yes, if they have an email in t he My System Profile, they can delete it. W e don't encourage them to do that , however, there is n othing we can do to stop them from deleting it . o Local Ed: Is the Edison site working , specifically the forgot password link ? Is it showing for everyone now so they can obtain a password reset? Answer: The forgot your password link will only show for those who have logged in the past few years. We have updated the password video s. If employees do not see the link to reset their passwords or a security image and phrase , then they should follow the steps to sign in as a new user. They may have never logged in, or they logged in before the security process was implemented , or they have changed agencies and in this situation we have wip ed out their security profiles since their one-time password email address is no longer valid if they were using a work email . If you have someone who is in this situation, please have them sign in as a new user. Here are links to the updated videos: How to reset your password: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1WRLE_N_BU&t=1s For retirees - how to reset your password: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1_sjXZ4kuk&t=2s o Local Ed: Recently I have received three to four Edison secure emails for new hires. Do we know why? They seem to all include the same information with Edison log in instructions, but was just curious why we are receiving multiple emails. Answer : Please send us a n email to benefits.administration@tn.gov or submit a Zendesk ticket so we can research as we were not aware this was occurring . o Local Ed: Why would employees be allowed to delete emails, when we as ABC's have to supply email addresses? Answ er: There isn't a way for us to pr event them from doing this . Emails are stored under My System Profile and it is not part of the enrollment process . They would have to navigat e to this page to delete their emails. o Local Ed: I also received Edison log in instructions twice for all new hires. It just started yesterday . Combined ABC Conference Call Notes Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government September 15, 2020 8 Answer: Thanks for letting us know . You can send us a Zendesk ticket with their employees ' names and IDs and we will get back t o you. o Local Ed: About emails , can Edison not do something to keep employees from deleting an email, changing, but not deleting? Answer : No, to our knowledge they cannot . o Local Ed: Can we add an email on the Modify a Person page? Answer: Yes, you can update a person's email on the Modify a Person's page . There are multiple places emails are stored . The one we use is in My S ystem Profile. W e move emails from Modi fy a Person to My System Profile once a month , and we will do this prior to A nnual Enrollment, or you can submit a spreadsheet with updates and changes for your employees. o Local Ed: BA is aware that we still have employees that are benefit s eligible who do not have email addresses ? Is there a way that we should indicate this upon hire? Answer: Yes, we are aware , and we have previously said we encourage you to set up an email address so we can send information directly to them. They can use a personal email or a work email account. If the employee refuses, instead of putting your own email addr ess in, we prefer you use something like noemail@noemail.com so it is clear the employee does not have one. o Local Ed: When I hire someone that existed in Edison (at another district) I don't receive Edison log in instructions for them. They don't always know what to do. What information would you suggest I give them since I didn't receive Edison log in instructions to send them. I could create some for them? Answer: The best thing you can do is to direct th em to the Partners For Health YouTube page and the video for How to Log in to Edison for the First Time . This video will walk them through the process . When an employee changes agencies, we clear out the security profile and they must sign in again as a new user. STATE ABC QUESTIONS o State: If you have a spouse covered at the maximum of $30,000, does the face value automatically drop to $15,000 when the spouse reaches over the age of 55? Answer: The overage will not reduce at age 55. The c overage amount depends on the amount they are eligible for . o State: Do you receive notice to increase your amount (guaranteed issue of $5,000) or does employee have to request through Securian? Answer: If eligible, the employee will receive a mailer from Securian notifying them about this but the employee does have to take action to make this election.

Local Ed/Local Gov: OPEB Response Update: Our Data/Program Integrity team would like to thank you for your response to OPEB collection this year. Benefits Higher Ed and Local Ed : Coordination of Benefits (COB): For those who are enrolled in two health plans at the same time, COB rules decide which insurance plan pays your claims first, how much each plan will pay, and how much you will pay. o Double Coverage means you have insurance under two medical plans. For example: you might be enrolled in the State Group Insurance Program* plus anot her employer plan; or you might be enrolled in two State Group Insurance Program* plans. (e.g., as an employee in the State plan and as a dependent, spouse or child, in the Local Education plan) o Benefits Administration (BA) has prepared a letter and exampl es explaining COB, Double Coverage and why plan members with Double Coverage may notice a difference in claims processed on or after January 1, 2021. COB t he letter and examples are both found on the Partners For Health website under Carrier Information found here: https://www.tn.gov/partnersforhealth/health -options/carrier -network.html o If members want to make a change to their double coverage they can do so during Annual Enrollmen t, by talking to you, or by talking to the representative who manages the other employer coverage.

Local Ed/Local Gov: Optum Bank HSA presentation: Linnie Stelk, relationship manager with Optum Bank, joined us today to talk about the HSA option, information available to members and to answer your questions. Combined ABC Conference Call Notes Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government September 22, 2020 3 HIGHER EDUCATION QUESTIONS o Higher Ed : Is the new formulary more restrictive, loss of generics, etc.? Answer : Any generic is going to be covered. There are some brands that there are some alternatives to those brands. We're not excluding any drugs, we're just requiring - that members require a prior authorization through the medical necessity process on some medic ations and other products starting 1/1/2021. Generics are preferred. There will be a targeted mailing that will go out that lists the drugs that are impacted by this formulary change in mid -November . Only the people who are affected by this change will rec eive that letter. Higher Ed : If enrolled in Medicare A only and still working with State and enrolled in CDHP, can you continue having an HSA? If not, do you all notify those turning 65 they must drop the HSA? Answer : When employees enroll in Edison and they choose the CDHP, there's an acknowledgement they have to read and to check that they are not enrolled in Medicare , or other non -higher deductible health plan coverage (even as a dependent on their spouse's health plan) . If you do become enrolled in Medicare during the year, you don't have to drop the CDHP plan coverage, but you would no longer be able to make contributions to your HSA and you must prorate any contributions that you make to your HSA during the year since you will have not been eligible to contribute to your HSA during the time that you were enrolled in Medicare. o Higher Ed : For employees hired through the year, will they be able to access the Optum Bank system to enroll or will there be a form to complete for new hires? Answer : With the FSA option, there will be a form for them to complete. The online enrollment will be available 10/1 -10/30. This portal is only open during the enrollment period. After that, they will use a paper form , and they should contact their agency benefits coordinator o Higher Ed : Some dental and vision services are health plan covered . Can the limited purpose FSA (L-FSA) pay out -of-pocket costs associated with those covered expenses? Answer : The only expense that your limited purpose FSA can be used for are those that are dental or vision related. In other words, those provided by your dentist, optometrist, ophthalmologist, etc. o Higher Ed : What is the transition period for rollover amounts from PayFlex to Optum? Answer : The up to $500 in carryover funds on the medical FSA and limited purpose FSA will take extra time this year before they are available in member s' accounts. The reason is because PayFlex will be processing the 2020 runout claims that members can still file from 1/1/2021 -4/30/2021. At that time, PayFlex will complete the final processing of all claims filed toward the end of April (of which there wil l be lots) during May and early June 2021. They will then send a bulk file of all the carry -over amounts to Optum Bank in late June. Optum will then add the carry -over amounts to members' 2021 Optum FSA or L -FSA balances. No one will receive their carryo ver funds until late June or July 1 . We are encouraging everyone to spend down th eir carryover funds this year so that they do not have to wait for these funds . In early Jan uary, you'll only have access to your Optum Bank funds you've elected to contribute for 2021. Combined ABC Conference Call Notes Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government September 22, 2020 4 o Higher Ed : Please review the procedure for recent hires for Annual Enrollment ; those recently hired on or before 9/1/2020 with benefits beginning 10/1will have access to Edison for A nnual Enrollment ? Those hired on or after 9/2 wi th benefits beginning 11/1 or later will need to complete a form and submit to their ABC to be forwarded to BA via Zendesk? Answer : It doesn't have to do with the hire date, it's about the date the benefits are processed. The day after the new hire enrollm ent is processed, an enrollment will be opened for AE . If the employee waits until the end of the 31-day new enrollment period to submit their elections , that's when we would need the paper form for annual enrollment . It depends on when the new hire benefits are keyed. o Higher Ed : Will those electing a dependent care FSA account receive a debit card as well? Answer : No, they will not. As is the case under PayFlex, the DC-FSA does not have a debit card. You'll file online or with a paper form next year with Optum Bank just like you do with PayFlex. o Higher Ed : Is that in any communications to member s regarding run-out claims (for the FSA) ? Answer : Everything we sent out to our own state employees was shared with Holly at the TBR and Pam at UT so they could consider whether they wanted to tweak or share similar emails with all ABCs and/or their employees LOCAL EDUCATION QUESTIONS o Local Ed : Is it still possible to have my maintenance prescriptions synced so they can all be filled at the same time? If so, how should I request that? o Answer : Yes. It depends on the pharmacy you use. We suggest you call the pharmacy or when you go to the pharmacy the next time, ask them to sync it. Sometimes you'll get a partial fill. o Local Ed : Going back to new formulary, did you say that all members will get a letter about the new formulary in Nov ember , or will it just go to those who are affected due to med th ey are taking? Answer : Members who are currently taking a medication that will no longer be covered in 2021 will receive a customized letter in mid -November from CVS Caremark. It will list the affected (no longer covered) medication as well as the covered 2021 medication. Their prescribing physician will also receive a similar letter. Both letters will explain the steps to take if the prescriber believes that the member should stay on the non -covered medication. This will provide a pathway to possible continued coverage. CVS Caremark will request clinical records from the physician in order to make this determination. Benefits Administration does not make the determination if a medication is covered or whether the plans will pay for it. o Local Ed : Will ABCs be contacted directly on how to send the payroll deductions (for HSAs) or will we be responsible for reaching out? Combined ABC Conference Call Notes Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government September 22, 2020 5 Answer : We are working on getting Optum Bank documents on the P artners for Health ABC page that are the same or similar to what you've used for PayFlex . We are waiting on a couple of others that will correlate for Optum Bank . You can access via phone or email the ABC support center. Reach out to us for any info rmation you need. Documents are on the ABC webpage , under the PayFlex drop -down , under Optum 2021. Vendor Contact list on the ABC webpage also has inf ormation for Optum Bank. o Local Ed : What happens to the HSA money in the PayFlex Accounts of the current HSA m embers? Answer : We're working on it with vendors now. We ask that you please stay tuned , and we'll share it with you. We've found out that we have to request approval from each health savings account holder before we move the funds. We plan to survey all existing HSA account holders this fall, and for those who indicate that they want their HSA balance (cash account plus any investments) moved to Optum Bank , we will work with both PayFlex and Optum to initiate that transfer. The plan at this point is that PayFlex HSA debit cards and those HSA funds can continue to be accessed through February 7, 2021. On February 8, 2021 , the debit card and account will be deactivated ( and not accessible in any way) so that PayFlex can liquidate the funds and start the transfer process. We are hoping that the transferred balances will be added to members' Optum Bank HSAs sometime the first week of March 2021. For members who do not respond to our survey or who indicate that they do not want their PayFl ex HSA funds transferred, those funds will remain in their PayFlex HSA account and the member will become responsible for the monthly administrative account fee, which will deducted automatically each month from the account. o Local Ed : How soon can we set up our account through payroll (for HSAs) ? Answer : That happens after the accounts are established mid -Dec. The accounts can't accept the contributions until after Jan. 1. It could happen as soon as the first payroll period. o Local Ed : What if you have employees pay a month ahead and you hold it out of previous months check for that current month (HSA) . We pay in Dec. for Jan. Answer : When you make the contribution to the HSA, it will have an effective date on the file. It will need to be a 2021 eff ective date because it's not eff ective until 1/1/2021. So as long as the effective date works with the plan year, it doesn't really matter b ecause when you get to the end of the year, the same year applies. Go to the ABC webpage and click on the PayFlex drop down box. Inside that, look for the Optum Bank 2021 section , and you can find the contribution spreadsheet there. Optum Bank is working between now and the end of the year to get as many correlating documents as was there for PayFlex loaded as possible. On the file when you send it to Optum , you will note the pay date and the contribution year. No file can be sent to Optum that is for a 2020 or prior contribution year, since Optum is not effective until 2021. Follow -up question : What if they are already enrolled in HSA, we will fill out the new form correct and send it in? Put 1/1/2021 on the form ? The pay date that it comes out of is 12/15/2020 . Combined ABC Conference Call Notes Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government September 22, 2020 6 Answer : The same rules would apply on the contribution file. The ABC would indicate both the payroll period and contribution year (which should be 2021). STATE QUESTIONS o State : What did you say about Lasik surgery? Answer : If you enroll with Davis Vision , we have partnered with a network of LASIK specialists so you can get a discount with an in -network specialist. To access that discount, you first have to call Davis Vision to get the referral. We will get you an appointment with a LASIK specialist near you that's in -network. You'll go there for an assessment because there are different types of LASIK. If you decide to go forward with the surgery with the in -network specialist, it will be provided at a deep discount. I can't tell you the exact discount since it depends on the type of LASIK surgery, but it's typically 40 to 50 percent. o State : If an employee is enrolling in benefits for the first time during Annual Enrollment but has an HSA from former employee insurance and the employee plans to enroll in our CDHP plan , what will the procedure be for combining the HSAs? Answer : Transfers are very common. If anyone has an HSA at any provider and wants to transfer balances , the IRS allows transfers without any limitations , as long as it's transferred from account to account . The first step is to contact your current provider and then you'll need your new account number and routing number after Jan. 1. So, you'll have to wait until 2021. Wait until early 2021 when your Optum HSA is set up and you have your Optum HSA account num ber and relevant details. Then contact your existing HSA custodian and tell them that you want to transfer your HSA funds to a new HSA. They should have a transfer form that you will complete (including adding your Optum HSA account number) and send it i n to them. This will allow for a direct transfer of the funds. o State : How complicated will it be for members to have access to their HSA funds in 2021 to pay for expenses incurred in January? Answer : The Optum Bank accounts will be accessible Jan. 1 and seed funds from the state should be added around January 5th. State employee contributions for plan year 2021 won't be available until paydays January 15th and January 31st, however, so your Optum HSA balances in January will be low . Members will still ha ve access to the PayFlex HSA balances and debit card through February 7, 2021. The state is working with PayFlex on when those funds will be transferred to the Optum Bank account if you elect to do so. We intend to survey all existing HSA accountholders this fall . Members who answer \"yes\" that they want the state to work with PayFlex to transfer their HSA balance to Optum should see those funds in their Optum HSA sometime the first week of March (and they will not be able to access their PayFlex HSA funds for approximately 3 weeks in February 2021, starting February 8, so that the funds can be transferred. ) Members who say \"no\" to the transfer of their PayFlex HSA funds OR who do not respond to our survey will have their funds stay with PayFlex and t hey will become responsible for paying the monthly account administrative fee. Combined ABC Conference Call Notes Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government September 22, 2020 7 LOCAL GOVERNMENT QUESTIONS o Local Gov: How will the upcoming webinars be different than the webinars finishing up tomorrow? Answer: The vendor webinars end Friday with dental. With these webinars the carriers are cover ing the benefits of their specific products. These webinars were all recorded and you can find them and/or direct your employees to them on our Partners YouTube page under the 2020 Employee Webinars playlist. The employee benefits webinars starting tomorrow cover 2021 benefits options, changes and premiums. o Local Gov: We haven't had anyone choose the CDHP so there hasn't been a need for the HS A but I do have a question. Is there a hosting fee from Optum or is this simply provided as a benefit if the employee is funding it? Answer: The HSA automatically is provided to an employee who enrolls in the Local CDHP option. If an HSA is opened, the St ate Group Insurance Program pays Optum each month for the monthly account fee as long as someone stays enrolled in the Local CDHP. If they leave employment, terminate, or switch to a PPO in a future year, they would then become responsible for the monthly HSA monthly account fee and these funds would be taken directly out of their HSA. Optum Bank added: The employer pays the fee on behalf of the account holder. If the employee leaves employment, they become a retail account holder and pay the fee. o Local Gov: What is the monthly account fee (for HSAs) ? Answer: There is not a monthly account fee for account holders who are enrolled in a the CDHP or Local CDHP health plans . The state group insurance program is paying the monthly account administrative fee as long as a member is enrolled in the CDHP or Local CDHP . Members only have to pay this fee if they leave employment, terminate, or move to a PPO plan in a future year and keep an HSA balance remaining with Optum. Follow up question: So, is the retail account fee a percentage based on account balance? Answer: The retail fee is $3.75 per month typically when the balance is below $3.000.00. If above $3,000.00, it is zero. o Local Gov: Does Optum's website offer receipt uploads for transactions that are made by the member? And possibly categorize them, e.g., pharmacy, doctor bill, etc. Answer: Yes, it does. That can be accessed by logging into the account or using the mobile app. o Local Gov: Will there be training for ABC's to set up the employer portion with Optum? Answer: There is no training set up at this time. There is an ABC support center and you can call or email. There will also be info rmation on the ABC webpage. We have posted some information and we will post more , just like we did with PayFlex. It will be in the same place. We may have presentations during calls in October or November and if needed, will set up additional ABC trainings. Combined ABC Conference Call Notes Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government September 22, 2020 8 o Local Gov: If employee leaves CDHP for 2021, will their funds transfer from PayFlex to Optum? Answer: We have emailed all current HSA acco unt holders with plans for transfers. We have gotten additional legal guidance and we cannot require transfer of funds from PayFlex to Optum Bank . We are still working on specifics on what it will look like and when it will occur. We are working with vendo rs on the best way to do this. For now, the plan is this: We intend to survey all existing HSA accountholders this fall. Members who answer \"yes\" that they want the state to work with PayFlex to transfer their HSA balance to Optum should see those funds in their Optum HSA sometime the first week of March (and they will not be able to access their PayFlex HSA funds for approximately 3 weeks in February 2021, starting February 8, so that the funds can be transferred.) Members who say \"no\" to the transfer of their PayFlex HSA funds OR who do not respond to our survey will have their funds stay with PayFlex and they will become responsible for paying the monthly account administrative fee. o Local Gov: We had an employee get married. Spouse does not work and is going to school. They do not have insurance. The spouse has to take the same ins urance as the employee, correct? Answer: That is correct. If the employee enrolls the spouse, the spouse will be on the exact same plan. You need to provide the marriage certificate and complete the Enrollment Change Application in order to add the spouse due to the recent marriage event. The ef fective date due to marriage can be the date of the marriage or the first of the following month. If the employee waits until Annual Enrollment to add the spouse, the employee can enroll through Employee Self Service or you can create an eBenefit form and that coverage will begin 1/1/2020.

Answer : It is mobile -optimized , so there should not be one browser that works better than another. For the MyBenefits site you can go to: http://www.mybenefits.metlife.com/StateofTN o Higher Ed: Am I correct that employees really won't need their Edison ID to get their Access ID or accessing Edison? They would only need it for LifeBenefits (website) ? Answer: It depends on if they have ever logged in before or if they have logged in since they have worked for your institution . If they need to log in as a new user and set up their security profile, they will need their Edison ID to set up their account and retrieve their Access ID.

Answer: You can make changes through a Benefits eForm in Edison . We do ask that you have them fill out and sign an enrollment form, so you have a record of the changes they requested . o Local Ed: What is a good query to use for retirees? For example , if they are c hanging tiers, dependents coming off, etc. Answer: Retirees should appear on any query you run for active employees. Some queries have a prompt for Department ID so retirees will show separately. If you have access to the Dep artment ID, then you can run any of the queries for retirees . o Local Ed: Remind me again on new hires that we just hired on 8/1 - how will they access their Access ID in Edison? Will I need to run the query in Edison that was sent to ABCs this week to get that for them , or is there a better way for the employee to dir ectly get this? Answer: They can retrieve/access t heir Access ID themselv es in Edison . We now have the green benefit button that says \"Benefits Annual Enrollment\" on the Edison homepage . If employees click that button, there is an optio n for New Hires/First Time Login .

When following the link stating they are a first -time user, they seem to receive the message that they have entered incorrect information - that their information does not match Edison information. Are others having this issue? Answer: We haven't heard any widespread issues . Employees can contact the Edison Help Desk for help loggi ng in. Here is the phone number : 866-376-0104 or 615-741-HELP (4357) . o Local Ed: I have a document I got off of the website that is called Employee Self Service instructions. Would this be helpful when they try to make open enrollment changes?

Does he need to do anything if he is not making any changes to his benefit? Answer: No, retirees do not do anything if they want to keep their same coverage . LOCAL GOV ERNMENT QUESTIONS o Local Gov: Have there been any changes to HIPAA due to COVID -19 such as reporting to employers ? Answer: No, there are no changes with COVID. However, different parts of the guidance were put in place that people were not used to when it first came out. A lot of health department information that has been released, some people thought it was covered by HIPAA and it was a health violation. The HIPAA Privacy Rule recognizes the legitimate need for public health authorities and others responsible for ensuring public health and safety to have access to protected health information that is necessary to carry out their public health mission. Therefore, the Privacy Rule permits covered entities to disclose needed protected health information without individual authorization: To a public health authority, such as the CDC or a state or local health department, that is authorized by law to collect or receive such information for the purpose of preventing or controlling disease, injury or disability. An employer is not recognized as a public health authority and does not have the right to receive information without an i ndividual authorization. This has not changed since the pandemic. o Local Gov: There are placeholders on the website for \" Employee Webinar Presentation Coming Soon! \" When will these be ready? Answer: We have posted links to PDFs for the employee benefits webinars on the Enrollment Materials page . We do also encourage employees to join one of the live webinars that will be held during the month of October.

It was my understanding that any visit that is COVID related wa s free. Is that correct? Answer : If it was COVID related and the facility charged the member , the member needs to call the carrier to possibly have the claim reprocessed . We have heard that 6 some urgent care facilities have charged members up front and have refused to file a claim with the member 's carrier . The member will need to follow up with the carrier , and possibly the facility to get a copy of the bill or claim to have a claim reprocessed. Once the claim is processed/reprocessed and the EOB shows no member cost share, the member will have to contact the Urgent Care facility for any refunds owed. o Local Gov: We have an employee who currently has employee+child medical insurance and family MetLife dental. She is planning on dropping the medical coverage but would like to know if she can keep her family dental coverage only? Answer: Yes, she can keep her family dental coverage. There is no requirement to be enrolled in the medical coverage to have the dental coverage for active employees. o Local Gov: Back in May of this year, we were informed Tristar/HCA hospitals and doctors committed to be in the Cigna Open Access Plus network t hrough the end of 2021. Has this changed? Answer: This has not changed This is still the correct information.

HIGHER EDUCATION QUESTIONS o Higher Ed: Employees also cannot set up direct deposit with Optum Bank until December , correct? Answer: In order to set up direct depot to an HSA, the account needs to be open. Employees will need the routing number and the account number to provide information to the bank funds flow into and out of. The account is not set up until the enrollment file is rea dy. This will be in mid -December. A welcome kit will go out to employees in mid -December and it will include the account number and routing number. That is when the account can be set up. o Higher Ed: Is there an HSA employee contribution form for 2021 available to our employees? Many of my employees are asking for that form. Answer: On the Partners for Health website on the ABC page there is a sampl e Optum Bank Employ ee Payroll Deduction Form in the Optum Bank (2021 ) drop down box o Higher Ed: Do we use the same contribution (HSA) form we've always used? 3 Answer: You can continue to use the same PayFlex form you have been using . Or, there is also a 2021 sample Employee Payroll Contribution Form from Optum Bank on the ABC webpage under Optum Bank 2021. o Higher Ed : I received an email from PayFlex requesting a file. We don't have to provide it do we? Answer: Yes, you do need to provide the information. PayFlex is requesting the information so they can send files without issues. o Higher Ed: We thought employees had to create an account in Optum but it looks like they can't do it yet. Are we waiting on the state to submit the enrollments for FSA/HSAs next year? Answer: The only thing employees should do at this point is enroll in the CDHP in Edison or the FSAs on the Optum Bank website . The HSA and FSA accounts will be created later. Right now , we are not opening accounts . Employees are just enrolling. o Higher Ed: And they enroll in FSA in Edison? Answer: No, for higher education, you enroll in the FSA through the Optum website, www. optumbank.com/ tennessee . The link is prominently displayed at the top of the homepage where higher educatio n employees click to enroll in FSAs . (Only state employees enroll in FSA in Edison .) o Higher Ed: Does the HSA form need to be filled out each year or just whenever you want to make a change in the amount contributed ? Answer: For higher education employees, the form does not need to be filled out each year unless the employee wants to make a change. The HSA payroll contribution will carry over from the year prior. o Higher Ed: When will Optum Bank provide instructions on how to pull reports from their system for 2021? Answer: We have included this information on the ABC webpage (now under the Optum Bank 2021 header ), including guides, for anyone who wants to start taking a look at that now. We are also talking internally about providing more info rmation on these calls. We can prepare information to do that. The ABC webpage has file feed and more info rmation . We will continue to add more helpful info rmation . You will receive login credentials via email to log in and take a look at the portal. ABCs will not have portal access for a while . For additional questions , please contact the ABC Service Center at p.m. CT o Higher Ed: We had employees try to create an account for their FSA next year and they couldn't. I called Optum Bank and they are showing Austin Peay as an inactive group. Answer: We asked the ABC to send in a Zendesk ticket to have it routed to Heather Pease. This situation has been resolved. o Higher Ed: If an employee wants to lower their term life, do they send form directly to Securian? Answer: Yes. Employees will need to l og in to Securian and lower the voluntary term life amount from there. 4 o Higher Ed: HSA elections carry over from year to year without new elections? They have increases in limits as well. Answer: For higher education employees, the form does not need to be filled out each year unless the employee wants to make a change. The HS A payroll contribution will carry over from the year prior. Just know that the maximum HSA contributions for 2021 are $3,600 for those with employee only coverage and $7,200 for those with any other coverage type . If any of your employees are maxing out their HSA for retirement or future medical expenses, they may want to be able to increase their contribution. Unless you advise them and allow them to change their election, their current payroll contributions will continue. o Higher Ed: The Save d But Not Submitted query, is it working for this enrollment period? I didn't understand that part. Answer: Yes. It is working. What I was referring to is the audit que ries. They never had \"saved but not submitted ;\" however, they will have that information going forward . The new query picks up changes that happened before, during and after hitting submit. o Higher Ed: Can you tell us the saved but not submitted query name again? Answer: TN_BA219_OE_NOT_SUBMITTED o Higher Ed: There have been calls to Securian to make changes for A nnual Enrollment , but they have been routed back to us to complete forms, etc. Would you mind contacting them to discuss this please? We would prefer this to be handled directly with Securian. Answer: We followed up with Securian , and Securian's Customer Service has been retrained to ensure calls related to voluntary life do not come back to ABCs . o Higher Ed: For retirees, if they are making a change and retiring as of Jan. 1 , 2021, do they just complete the form ? There is not an ESS for them right? Answer: Yes, if the employee's active insurance is going to terminate on or before January 1, 2021, and if the employee wants to make a change during the Annual Enrollment period , he/she will need to complete the Annual Enrollment retiree participant form , if not already enrolled as a retiree. If he/she still h as an active record and tr ies to make a change in their active record , it won't automatically transfer to the retiree record , so we recommend that they send in the Annual Enrollment retiree form in this scenario. LOCAL EDUCATION QUESTIONS o Local Ed: Has Edison had issues since Annual Enrollment started? I keep getting emails/calls from employees stating that they cannot get anyone to answer. Just letting you know , not sure if this is true or not, but would like to know if they are experiencing any issues. Answer: Yes, t here have been several issues. We did hear about login problems last Thursday due to statewide network issues. Those have been resolved. There were intermittent issue s last Friday morning . They are resolved now , and they were fixed before we could send an email. Yesterday, the state had VPN issues which affected staff's ability to get into the network. It is possible people had trouble yesterday as 5 well. As of right now everything is working properly . If they need password help, they should get through to the Edison Help Desk now . o Local Ed: I am getting copies of birth certificates, etc. , proof of joint ownership, etc. from B enefits Administration (BA) for those who are making online changes during open enrollment. Is there anything for me to do other than to keep a copy of the documents in their employee files ? Answer: If you are receiving notices from BA asking for dependent verification such as marri age certificates and birth certificates, we need a copy. You just need to send it back to us via Zendesk so we can finalize the event on our end. However , if the employee submitted dependent verification via Employee Self Service in Edison, our scanning te am is loading it in Zendesk for our active service center to review , and you're getting the email as notification that we have dependent verification on file. This does not require any action from you. If it is determined that we're missing information o r the submitted information is invalid, we will reach out to you. o Local Ed: Do our employees have to do anything if they are not changing their amounts being sent (for HSAs) . Also, when will we do set up with Optum Bank? Answer: For Local Education and Local Government employers: unless one of your employees fills out a new payroll deduction form and you take action to pull a different amount from their paycheck and send it pre -tax to the vendor each year, it will not change. How ever, whatever amount has been sent to PayFlex pre -tax via payroll contributions will NOT continue over to Optum Bank . You will need to set up payroll contributions with Optum Bank using the forms on the ABC webpage and ask your employees how much they wan t taken from their 2021 paychecks (you can use the 2021 payroll deduction form on the ABC webpage , under the Optum Bank (2021 ) header ) and you will need to set up this payroll deduction with Optum as they are a new vendor. For assistance setting up payroll contributions with Optum Bank , you can also contact their ABC Support Center at 1 -800-294-6620 , Monday - Friday , 7am-6pm CT. o Local Ed: I need to find out who I need to talk to about HSA insurance plan; we have employee's i nquiring about this and we have never had anyone on this plan. Answer: Please send a Zendesk ticket and ask that it be directed to Heather Pease, I can talk to you in detail about that and am happy to work with you . There is also information on the website on the CDHP/HSA Insurance webpage . And t here is also a video on our website about the CDHP /HSA (2020 CDHP) . o Local Ed: So do we need to have our setup with Optum Bank done in December? Do we have a date where we need to have this in place ? Answer: Yes, if you have employees enrolling in the Local CDHP and you offer payroll contributions you will need to work with Optum Bank to get that done in December. You need a plan in place by end of year. You can r each out to Optum Bank via email or phone, and they can walk you through it. Optum Bank's number is 800-294-6620. There is also a guide on the ABC webpage , now under the Optum Bank (2021 ) header . For Local Education and Local Government employers: unless one of your emp loyees fills out a new payroll deduction form and you take action to pull a different amount from their paycheck and send it pre -tax to the vendor each year, it will not change. However, whatever amount has been sent to PayFlex pre - tax via payroll contribu tions will NOT continue over to Optum Bank . You will need 6 to set up payroll contributions with Optum Bank using the forms on the ABC webpage and ask your employees how much they want taken from their 2021 paychecks (you can use the 2021 payroll deduction form on the ABC webpage , under the Optum Bank 2021 header ) and you will need to set up this payroll deduct ion with Optum Bank as they are a new vendor. For assistance setting up payroll contributions with Optum Bank you can also contact their ABC Support Center at 1 -800-294-6620 , Monday -Friday , 7 a.m. - 6 p.m. CT. o Local Ed: Can you repeat the website for Optu m? Answer: www. optumbank.com/Tennessee (This website is for Optum Bank HSAs only; it is not the website for the Optum behavioral health and EAP benefits) . o Local Ed: Two of our employees enrolling in dental and vision this year (this is our first year to be with the state's vision and dental) who have been enrolled in the health insurance for many years, have received the message that they need to provide dependent eli gibility on their spouse for dental and vision coverage. Is this necessary? Answer: They should not have to provide it again if the employee's spouse is already covered on medical. But I am concerned because that message should only display if the dependent is not enrolled in any plans currently . Please send a Zendesk ticket so we can look at this. o Local Ed: The dependent verification is happening on my employees as well. I helped one yesterday who had the message displayed to send in dependent doc uments and the dependent is currently already covered through medical ? Answer: Please send in the example in Zende sk so we can take a look at that as well. o Local Ed: I have helped several employees who are trying to reset their passwords. When they ask for an email, it does not send an email. When I go look, there is no email listed in Edison. They were not on the fi le from the state sent requesting email addresses. If I go in and add email in Edison will that correct this so they can get the password reset email? Answer: No. It is only available for the employee to add when they do set up or edit their account. If th ey cannot log in and they don't get the email, they will need to call the Edison help desk for a password reset at 866.376.0104 . When they get in to Edison , they should add their email in their \"My System Profile\" page under the one-time password email sec tion. o Local Ed: Which query do we run to get Access IDs for members ? Answer: TN_BA302_PERSON_AND_JOB STATE QUESTIONS o State: Do any of the Edison issues affect this group? Answer: No, we are n ot aware of any right now at all . All Edison issues from last week , plus yesterday's VPN issue , have all been resolved . o State: Is there an update on how or when the transfer of funds from PayFlex to Optum Bank will take place? 7 Answer: For the HSA , beginning on Jan . 1, 2021, we are changing to a new administrator , Optum Bank . In November, we will email all H SA participant s and ask them to answer yes or no for their approval to move the ir HSA funds f rom PayFlex to Optum Bank. I f they agree , we plan to have PayFlex move the funds the first week of March . For those who say no, the H SA funds will stay with PayFlex , and the member will be responsible for the monthly account service fee. Members can continue to access and use their existing PayFlex HSA funds through February 7, 2021. On February 8, the current PayFlex HSA debit cards will become inactive. On this same date, February 8, HSA funds will start to move to Optum Bank for those who agreed to move the funds , and the funds will take several weeks to move. We antic ipate that members who agree to have their PayFlex HSA funds moved to Optum will have those funds in their Optum HSA toward the end of the first week of March 2021. For the FSA and LFSA , it allows for a $500 carryover . Any balance remaining in your medical FSA or limited purpose FSA over $500 on 12/31/2020 will be forfeited . The carryover funds of $500 or less will stay with PayFlex until April 30 , so PayFlex can finish 2020 claims , which have to be finished by April 30 . After this date, PayFlex will transfer funds to your Optum FSA or L -FSA by July 1 , 2021. For those e nrolling in t he FSA or L-FSA for 2021 , those funds will be available upfront at the beginning of the year with Optum Bank , and members will have a debit card for those funds. We e ncourag e people to spend down the money in the ir PayFlex FSA and L -FSA so they don't have to wait for these funds by July 1, 20 21. LOCAL GOVERNMENT QUESTIONS o Local Gov: Do we have to contact Optum to do the employee deposit? Answer: Yes, you would want to contact Optum Bank to set this up for 2021. Here is contact information: accountservices@optum.com , and the ABC Support Center number is 800 -294-6620 M -F, 7a.m. - 6 p.m. CT. o Local Gov: If your employee s do not have changes, are the re any requirements for them to do? Answer: No, if they do not have any changes , then they do not have to log into Edison and you do not have to fill out a Benefit e Form . o Local Gov: How can we verify that an employee made changes for their 202 0 health insurance? Answer: The b est way is to look at their re cords individually in Edison or use the audit queries . The audit queries are the TN_BA133 (for individuals) or TN_BA265 (for agencies) . The current BA133 and BA265 queries in Edison just show changes for this year. We are working on new versions of the queries so that you can see historical changes as well. We will share more information about those queries as soon as they are available. o Local Gov: If an employee wants to employer to make the changes for them, can we do that? Answer: Yes, employees can fill ou t an Enrollment Change Application , and you can complete the Benefits eForm for them . However, you can not log into Edison for them . 8 o Local Gov: If the employee makes changes thru employee self -service (ESS) in Edison, does the ABC still need to complete a n Enrollment C hange Application? Answer: No, you only need an Enrollment Change Application if you are keying the change in Benefit eForm . o Local Gov: What is the process for employees that are hired after Annual Enrollment? Answer: It will depend on the timing of their hire . You can process the Benefit eForm for their hire event , and the follow ing day, the Benefit eForm will be open for the A nnual Enrollment event. If it is closer to the end of Annual Enrollment, you will have to fill out a n Enrollment Change Application and submit that , but only if the employee has additional changes for 2021. If he/she doesn't have cha nges, you don't need to submit a form . o Local Gov: Can you give those (audit) query numbers again please ? This year we are allowing our employees to use the self -service option. I need the information for our internal system so I can make changes for 2021 . Answer: The TN_BA133 and TN_BA265 queries . They have the same general information. The TN_BA 133 query is at the emp loyee level , so if you want to see all changes , will want to run the TN_BA 265 as it lists changes made by all employees .

What date would I put in? I put in the prior month? The prior month would be what? Answer: In this case where the employee terminates or resigns before the coverage begin date, we ask that the agency submit a Corrections and Clarification form and note that the employee left before coverage started . Our active team will manually key the termination using the hire date as the termination date. o Local Gov: I have an employee retiring Dec . 31 who is not going to use the state insurance plan, he will use Medicare. How do I stop his insurance coverage starting in January so it w on't hit the Collections Applied report? Answer: The standard termination rules would apply in this case.

Combined ABC Conference Call Notes Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government October 20, 2020 3 o Higher Ed: Has anyone else had employees having difficulty logging into Optum Bank to cre ate their FSA? I had an employee using MS Edge browser who had difficulty enrolling. The y switched to Chrome and it worked. Another comment: We called the customer care line and they've been very helpful. o Additional comments: When employees put in information, they were not recognized by the system. I got the same message. One had to call in. One tried later and something changed with questions. I was never able to use my own account last Friday. Answer: From Optum Bank: We appreciate the feedback , and w e will share it. The customer care line has worked with several employees who had issues getting a match on info rmation . What we've found is some folks were successful if they used a private b rowser outside of work due to firewalls. Employees can c all customer care 24/7 at 866.600.4984 .

Otherwise, if there is no age limit or date limit on it, the eligibility extends through the month the dependent turns 26 . o Higher Ed: Is there a way to find o ut which employees have enrolled in Optum Bank before 11/10? Another similar question: Is there a report ABCs can get to see the employees and what they enrolled in through Optum Bank so we can send to payroll?

Especially for emp loyees whose forms were entered manually by ABCs . Answer: We are working on preparing a list of people who made changes.

Any changes made to other coverage during Ann ual Enrollment will be on the Dec. check for Jan. coverage. LOCAL EDUCATION QUESTIONS o Local Ed: If an employee brings me their paperwork for Annual Enrollment, do I just upload it thru Zendesk? Also, can a spouse be removed during Annual Enrollment without any kind of documentation? Answer: If the employee provides you with a paper enrollment for Annual Enrollment , you would either need to complete a Benefit eForm for the employee or ask the employee to submit his/her own elections through Employee Self Service in Edison. Yes, a dependent can be removed during Annual Enrollment with no docu mentation needed. o Local Ed: If I have a payroll person who isn't an ABC and needs to attend the Optum Workshop, is this ok? Can this person just click the same link that I usually click on as an ABC to attend? Answer: Yes, that would be great. They are more than welcome. It will be the same link as you would normally use for an ABC meeting. o Local Ed: How does an employee get their password when there is not an email address for them in Edison? Answer: It depends on if they have set up a security profile or not. If the employee has never logged in or if he/she changed agencies since their last login, the employee will need to log in as a New Hire/First Time Login. If they created a security profile while at your agency, the employee will have to contact the Edison help desk at 866.376.0401 to get the password reset. If they don't have an email or if his/her email has changed and not working, they will need to call Edison. o Local Ed: If an employee is going through a divorce but the divorce is not final , can the employee drop that spouse during open enrollment? Answer UPDATE :. Following the call, we reviewed divorce question s with legal counsel. It is now our understanding that: Combined ABC Conference Call Notes Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government October 20, 2020 5 During Annual Enrollment - BA can process an employee's request to remove a spouse. The intent of PD Section 4.02 is to message that it is the employee's responsibility to comply with Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-4-106 Complaint for divorce or legal separation \u2014 Temporary injunctions and \u00a7 56 -7-2366 Notice of termination of coverage for spouses and former spouses . If an employee removes a spouse during annual enrollment in opposition to either one of those sections of the code, they may find themselves in trouble with the courts. We cannot interpret the law or offer legal advice to members. They should consult wit h their legal counsel regarding state law. Outside of Annual Enrollment - BA can't process an employee's request to remove a spouse for divorce UNLESS we receive a final divorce decree. PD Section 4.01 applies - \"Voluntary cancellation of a covered person shall not be permitted outside of the annual enrollment transfer period unless the covered person experiences a special qualifying event, family status change, or other qualifying event as approved by Benefits Administration.\" The Insurance Cancel Reque st Application specifies that in the case of a divorce, the required documentation is a final divorce decree . It doesn't matter if the parties agree to the termination or if they produce a document stating that enrollment is not required. Agreement doesn' t change our requirement that we must have a final divorce decree for mid -year termination. o Local Ed: Just for clarification, if someone has filed for divorce and says they are not required to carry insurance on their spouse, this person CANNOT drop them during open enrollment? Answer UPDATE : BA can process an employee's request to drop a spouse during annual enrollment, but the employee is responsible for compliance with state law. SEE additional details in the answer above . o Local Ed: What if the divorce is final but the employee is having a hard time getting the letter from her former spouse showing insurance for the SQE to enroll? Answer: You would need to contact us at benefits.info@tn.gov so we ca n look at the specific scenario. o Local Ed: When can we open the Optum Bank a ccount? Answer: Employees have until the end of annual enrollment (Oct . 30) to enroll in the Local CDHP/HSA. The State will send a file to Optum Bank that will include all CDHP/HSA enrollments. Optum Bank will open the HSA accounts based on this file and send HSA account holders a welcome kit and debit card in December. Optum Bank will offer training on the following dates for ABCS on how to set up payroll deductions, how to use the portal, and file types accepted by Optum. You will login to the training using the regular ABC conference call link. Local Ed: Nov . 6 at 10 a.m. CT Local Gov: Nov . 6 at 12 p.m. CT Combined ABC Conference Call Notes Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government October 20, 2020 6 o Local Ed: I have an employee who wants to cancel dental and vision . Do I have her fill out cancelation form and upload it in Zendesk? Answer: She would fill out an Enrollment Change Application , then you would submit the changes via Benefit eForm . Or, she can log into ESS and make the changes herself. o Local Ed: Where can we get the dates that need to be used to open the queries like (01/01/2020)? Answer: All of that information can be found on the ABC webpage under Training. There is an Edison Query List and Edison Query Manual . The manual tells you how to run queries . The list includes queries and criteria. o Local Ed: Can we, as the ABC, enroll an employee through Annual Enrollment , on his/her behalf without them going in to self -service themselves? Answer: Yes. You can do so by submitting a Benefit eForm . Instructions are on the ABC webpage under Training. There is a presentation that walks you through it, or you can call the service center , and we can walk you through it. o Local Ed: If an employee brings me their paperwork for Annual Enrollment, do I just upload it thru Zendesk? Also, can spouses be removed during Annual Enrollment without any kind of documentation? Answer: If the employee provides you with a paper enrollment for Annual Enrollment , you would complete a Benefit eForm for the employee . Or, the employee can submit his/her own elections through Employee Self Service in Edison. A dependent can be removed during Annual Enrollment with no documentation needed. STATE QUESTIONS o State: I have questions about the changes with PayFlex and Optum Bank for both FSA and HSA. How will employees be notified on what they need to do? Do we need notify them or is Benefits Administration preparing information for them? I know we s hould encourage them to use their FSAs. For the HSA, they need to select to have funds transferred to Optum Bank, correct? How will this notification go out? Answer: For HSAs : We are going to email all HSA participants for whom we have an email address in Edison and ask them to select yes or no to transfer funds. If they agree, then PayFlex will transfer funds to Optum Bank on March 1, 2021 , and the funds are expected to be available in their Optum HSA by March 5, 2021. Follow up question : If em ployee email addresses are not up to date, will you mail to home addresses? Answer: No. If employees don't respond or if they answer no, the funds will remain with PayFlex , and they will be responsible for the monthly HSA account main tenance fee with PayF lex ($5 per month). We will send three emails during the first three weeks in November. We will try to reconcile at the end of the email campaign for those who did not respond ; however, we will not mail unless we have to. Combined ABC Conference Call Notes Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government October 20, 2020 7 Follow up question: So, we can en courage email information in Edison, we could do that to help? Answer: Yes, it would be great for you to message to employees to get correct emails in Edison - that would help. Answer: For FSAs : We do allow a $500 carryover. Anything over $500 that an employee has not used will be forfeited. For those with $500 or less in their medical FSA or L -FSA, those funds will stay in the PayFlex accounts so they can finish processing those claims. Members can file a paper claim no later than April 30 with PayF lex. After PayFlex has had a chance to process those claims, anything that can be carried over will be transferred to the Optum Bank medical FSA or L -FSA on July 1, 2021. This is why we encouraged all employees in our September 15th email blasts to spend d own all of their funds this year so that they do not have to wait until July 1st for their carryover funds to appear in their Optum FSA or L -FSA. Note, if a person enrolls in a medical or L -FSA for 2021, those funds will go into the Optum Bank accounts and be available in January 2021. Follow up question: With the FSA, any allowable $500 carryover that employees have that they do not use will automatically go to Optum Bank on July 1 with no action on the employee's part? Answer: Yes, but the employee doe s need to elect an FSA program for 2021 for the funds to rollover, and they will not have those <=$500 carried over funds until early July 2021. So we encourage everyone this year to spend down their FSA and L - FSA funds so they don't have to wait. o State: Do we have to re -submit the (security) form if you have been an ABC for several years? Answer: No, you do not have to resubmit again. and the updated security form should be used going forward for new users and for any changes o State: I received the following message from an employee yesterday morning. \"I received an email Friday saying that I didn't submit my changes for my visual insurance. I'm am sure I did. How do I make sure this happened? Answer: You can verify if the employee subm itted their vision elections by running the TN_BA133 query or the TN_BA219 Not Submitted query . The employee can reach out the service center , and we can verify if the election was submitted or not and give instructions on filing an appeal.

As far as HSA funds, we are going to send out a survey three times , on Nov. 5, 12 and 19 , asking existing account holders if they want to transfer their funds to Optum Bank.

LOCAL GOVERNMENT QUESTIONS o Local Gov : I'm having trouble with the queries . I've tried the TN_BA133 with Edison IDs of employees who I know have changed . I've tried the TN_BA265 ( am I putting the wrong schedule ID in the search?) . Both reports return no information in the spreadsheet. Answer: It would be best to send in a Zendesk ticket , and we will have a trainer reach out to you. You can find information on queries under Training on the ABC webpage. There is an Edison Query Manual and Edison Query List. o Local Gov: What are the dates emails (with survey) will go to PayFlex participants? Answer: The emails will be sent to all existing HSA accountholders for whom we have an email address in Edison. These emails will go out on Nov . 5, 12 and 19 in an effort to get everyone to respon d. Those who say no in their response , or who do not respond at all, will have their HSAs remain with PayFlex , and they become responsible for the monthly a dministrative account fee of $5 per month . o Local Gov: I have two participants who are moving out of the CDHP plan. If they opt into Optum Bank , will they have to pay fees since they are no longer HSA eligible? Answer: If they are not staying enrolled in the Local CDHP, then they will not have an Optum Bank HSA. Their existing funds will remain at PayFlex , and yes, they will have to pay the monthly administrative fee that the group insurance program has been paying. This account will become a retail account with PayFlex , and they will deduct $5 per month , each month. So, those who might have $500 in their HSA but they enr oll in the PPO, in addition to those funds staying in the HSA, they can continue to use those funds for eligible healthcare expenses , however, they cannot contribute to the HSA. o Local Gov: For clarification , member PayFlex accounts will be closed on 2/8/21 and their Optum Bank accounts will be active 3/5/21? If so, what happens if I need to access my funds in this \"between\" time? Answer: Your Optum Bank account will be active 1/1/21 , and you can utilize your payroll contrib utions or if the employer offers employer contribution you'll have access to those funds. On March 5, the funds that were in the PayFlex account will be added to the Optum Bank HSA if the member has responded to the BA survey and said \"YES\" . There are a few weeks that the funds that are in the PayFlex account will not be accessible. You can always withdraw funds prior to February 8th to pay for expenses, or you can pay for expenses out of your pocket and once your funds have moved by on Marc h 5, you can pay yourself back. You do have to 5 keep records of any funds that came out of the account were used for qualified health care expenses in case you are audited. o Local Gov: We 'pre\" fund our employee HSA s and have done so for quarter four to PayFlex . We would need to 'pre' fund quarter one 2021 thr ough Optum Bank at the end of December. Will this work the same as PayFlex ? Answer: Any contributions that are for 2021 , you would fund in the H SA account as long as the accounts are open at the end of December . We can process a 2021 file at Optum Bank . o Local Gov: One member has dropped the CDHP for 1/1/21 and signed up for FSA. If he has a balance left in the HSA, can he elect a medical FSA? Answer: Yes, you can select a FSA as long as there are funds in the HSA. Y ou can't do the opposite - you can't open a H SA if there are funds in an FSA. o Local Gov: Will the interest for the first quarter from Optum start on 3/5/21 when transferred balances start? If so, does anyone know if Pay Flex will pay the interest in Jan. and Feb.? Answer: The interest will start on the transferred balance on the day it is transferred and on the money that is in the Optum Bank account. For PayFlex , they will have the interest paid through March 8 before it is transferred out. o Local Gov: If we have an employee add their spouse on Friday, can we go ahead and send in the application without proof of marriage and send the marriage certificate on Monday? Answer: Yes, if you go ahead and have them add the spouse by the deadline and submit partial dependent verification by the deadline, we will give the employee 10 additional days from the Annual Enrollment deadline to submit the remaining documents. For examp le, if the member submits a bank statement by the AE deadline , we will allow the member 10 additional days to provide the marriage certificate. But if the employee doesn't send any dependent verification documents, then the dependent will not be enrolled a nd they would have to file an appeal to try and add the dependent . o Local Gov: Are we still required to complete the ABC checklist if our employees use Edison to sign up for their own benefits? Answer: Yes, you are still required even though employees are signing up in Edison . You should still go over all of the required information with new hires beforehand . o Local Gov: I recently submitted for a coverage change based on divorce for an employee. Will I receive a loss of coverage letter to provide to employee for the ex - spouse or will that be directly mailed to them? Zendesk shows that the activity is solved so I wanted to check. Answer: The COBRA noti fication will be sent either directl y to the ex -spouse or the attor ney. If the contact information is not available for either the ex -spouse or attorney, the notification will go to the home address fo r the employee listed in Edison . o Local Gov: Is the checklist required for annual enrollment or just for new hires? Answer: Just for new hires . 6 o Local Gov: We had a member pass away last week. I termed this person in Edison yesterday with code of term -death. My understanding the dependents will now receive insurance on COBRA for six months. Will they receive any paperwork they must fill out? Anything further I must do? Answer: There isn't anyt hing the surv iving dependents must do as the health insurance is free for six months . They will get a COBRA offer asking if they want to continue on COB RA following this six months. I f enrolled in dental or vision coverage, they will get a COBRA notice as this is not extended for six months . o Local Gov: Did you say the extension (for dependent coverage following an employee death) is only on the health , not the dental and vision? Answer: Correct, it is only for health insurance. If currently enrolled in dental and vision at time of death, the dependents will receive COBRA notices for dental and vision asking if they want to extend dental and vision. o Local Gov: I have an employee changing from one plan to another. The system then requires documentation. Can I move past that step since the documentation was provided upon initial enrollment? I did not complete the change because documentation is on file in the office and I am doing data entr y from home. Answer: If you are completing the enrollment on the Ben efit eForm and you know they are on coverage , then you can bypass that step. We did find an issue that sometime s the system is asking for document ation when it is not required . We should have it fixed in Edison within the next week or two . o Local Gov: What are the que ries to run for A nnual Enrollment ? Answer: You can g o out to our website on t he ABC webpage and you will find query information under the Traini ng section . There is an Edison Query List and Edison query manual .

HIGHER EDUCATION QUESTIONS o Higher Ed: If someone doesn't respond to the survey but has a CDHP again for 2021, the funds won't transfer to Optum? Answer: That is correct. Funds will stay with PayFlex ; however, employees have not lost the opportunity. After January 1 when their Optum HSA is active, employees can log onto the Optum member website and download the HSA Rollover/Transfer Request Form and send it to PayFlex. However, members may avoid this by participating in the \"bulk transfer\" and completing the survey from Benefits Administration now. o Higher Ed: If an employee has a medical FSA in 2020 and has less than $500 in that account with PayFlex at the end of Dec ., and they are switching over for 2021 to the CDHP /HSA, what happens to their PayFlex funds with that FSA that were left over? They can normally carry over up to $500 in the FSA, but if they are switching over to an HSA for 2021 , will those FSA funds be forfeited? Answer: The HSA would not be able to be opened and funded until the medical FSA dollars are down to zero. IRS rules preclude a person from having and contributing to a HSA at the same time they have available dollars in a general - purpose FSA (not a limited purpose FSA, though). This is another reason why we are encouraging all state and higher education employ ees to spend down their FSAs to zero by the end of the year, otherwise their FSA funds will not be available until July 1, 2021. New this year, thanks to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act participants may use their FSA funds to buy over -the- counter medications without a prescription, like Advil, Tylenol or other pain relievers, heartburn medication and allergy relief and more. Funds can also be used for feminine care products including tampons, pads, liners, cups and sponges. o Higher Ed: Will all these timeframes and this information be provided to members in the letters (emails) they will receive? Will emails be sent that include everything that has been discussed in the Optum presentation ? Answer: We did have a presentation that was specific to employees (vendor webinar) , and the timeline was shared with those who participated . They will not receive one comm unication that encompasses all of this information , but they are getting it through different resources. We have included the presentation in the Nov. Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government Combined ABC Conference Call Notes November 10, 2020 5 13 email to all ABCs , and you are welcome to share it with your members. It might be helpful to them . o Higher Ed: I wrote down that the CDHP employees don't have to do anything but they should respond to the survey? But if they are not enrolled in the CDHP next year , the funds stay with PayFlex? Answer: Yes, they should respond to the email with the survey if they are enrolled in the CDHP again in 2021 and want to have their funds transferred from PayFlex to Optum Bank automatically. And yes, if they aren't enrolled in the CDHP in 2021 and won't have a H SA next year , the funds will stay in the PayFlex account and they can continue to save or spend those funds. The account will become a PayFlex retail account , and members will be responsible for any PayFlex fees, including the monthly administ rative account fee which is currently $5 per month. o Higher Ed: If a person enrolls in the CDHP/ HSA and has funds left in their FSA from the previous year, would it become a limited purpose FSA for dental and vision expenses only ? Answer: The member can contact Optum to have the FSA funds converted over to a limited purpose FSA for vision and dental expenses only. This may only occur on ce the carried over funds of $500 or less are transferr ed to Optum around July 1, 2021. The member will need to contact Optum Bank customer care and request the funds be put into a limited purpose FSA (for vision and dental expenses only). Members may not have both a HSA and general -purpose FSA at the same time. o Higher Ed: What about the ABC signature (on the electronic forms) ? Answer: On a form that has multiple signatures , the employee will sign and then they will email to you . Then the ABC will sign , and as the last signature , it will lock the form . o Higher Ed: If the forms are locked after signatures, will the ABCs still be able to make notations for in -house processing? Answer : The forms are locked after the final signature has been added. If you want you can type information into the top of the form , but once the form is locked no information can be added to it. o Higher Ed: So there is personal information on this form. Is there something advising the individual not to send this via regular email? Answer : No, there is not anything on this f orm. For many of your agencies, your IT agencies will automatically have your emails set as secure. You can check with your IT department ; however, there is not anything on the form that says not to email it if it is not secure. It's up to you to communicate to your employees if they should not be emailing it to you. o Higher Ed: Can the new hire send the form without a Social Security number and we just add the Edison ID later? Answer: Yes, the form isn't locked until the ABC signs it so you could add a Social Security number or ID after the emp loyee signs it and before you do . Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government Combined ABC Conference Call Notes November 10, 2020 6 o Higher Ed : Can you all offer a Retirement training at some point? I am taking over many of retiree enrollment duties and there are many nuances . The retirement people at BA have been very helpful, but I hate having to bug them. I need h elp with the Continuing Insurance at Retirement for m and some of the things that go on when retiring with TCRS and ORP, the Medicare form and The Tennessee Plan and all that goes with that. I'm trying to make sure the employee gets all of the information they need. For instance, how long is the process for their insurance ending and then the premiums coming out of their TCRS ? What does that look like? Answer: We do have the Continuing Insurance at Retirement Guide that addresses both TCRS and ORP members, and there is also information on pages 3 and 4 of the Application to Continue Insurance at Retirement on how to complete the form . There are a lot of moving parts between the monetary benefit and the insurance bene fits. If you have retirees, there are many different variables with processing their enrollments. We would like you to call the BA Service Center with your questions ; you are not bothering us at BA. We can also look at ways we can improve the resources. Here is some more information about processing retiree enrollments: We can't enroll a TCRS retiree until he/she is receiving a pension check - the TCRS pension must be approved. We have to pend the application until the pension is approved , and this can take 60-90 days. We pend the application , and we have timeframes when we will check to see if the pension has been approved. And then the application retros back to the original date , back to the original coverage. For example, i f active coverage ended on 10/1 /20, and if retroactively approved back to 9/5/20 on 11/17/20 , we would retroactively enroll coverage back to 10/1/2020 . LOCAL EDUCATION QUESTIONS o Local Ed: If a retiree does not elect to continue insurance at retirement and is a dependent on their spouse's plan through their employer group, can they later elect to choose retiree ins urance if there's a special qualifying event and the employee is losing coverage through spouse's plan or through Open Enrollment for retirees ? Answer: A retiree who does not immediately continue coverage on the retiree plan may only enroll if the retiree meets all of the special qualifying event criteria. Retirees/employees are not eligible to enroll themselves in the retiree group health plan during the Annual Enrollment period, so we would recommend that you contact our Service Center with this scenario as we need to review their eligibility. You can email us at retirement.insurance@tn.gov or call the Service Center at 800.253.9981 and select option 2 . o Local Ed: I received two em ails from BA saying that two employees did not get their dependent verification submitted by the deadline to add dependents to their insurance. Does BA also send notification to these employees as well? Answer: We do not reach out to the emp loyee directly . The notification goes to the ABC , and we ask that you pass this along to the employee . o Local Ed: When will the January collections applied report be available to download in December? Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government Combined ABC Conference Call Notes November 10, 2020 7 Answer: We are working on finalizing the final payroll calendar. You will be able to run the Premiums Due report the first week in Dec. We try to run it earlier so you can get ahead on changes in December. The finalized Collections Applied report will be available the first week in January. o Local Ed: I am still receiving multiple emails from Edison regarding login inst ructions when adding new hires in Edison. Is there an estimated time on when this may be fixed? Answer: We do not have an estimated time line from the Edison tea m. We are checking regularly , but at this point Edison does not know when it will be resolve d; however, they are working on it. o Local Ed: To the Edison issues, I keyed five new hires today and received two Edison log in emails for three of them? Answer: Yes, that is the issue previously mentioned. Edison is aware and trying to correct it. o Local Ed: Is there a time limit on the queries for Annual Enrollment? Answer: The que ries should be able to be run at any time , and we recom mended using the TN_BA 219_AETP _INS_ELECTIONS query as soon as possible as this query may change and results will go away this month . Please run this query now. All other queries can be run at any time . o Local Ed: This enrollment period is the first time we have offered enrollment in the state's dental and vision plans. For new hires in November, how should I handle these enrollments, since their health insurance would be effective 12/1/2020, but dental and vison on 1/1/2021? Answer: For new hires hired after the annual enrollment period , you can send a paper Enrollment Change Application for those interested in dental and vision for 1/1/21 . STATE QUESTIONS o State: We have some employees who have PayFlex cards that expire in Dec. What do they do until March 5? Answer: If employees have PayFlex debit cards that are expiring in Dec., these employees will receive new debit cards in December , which they can use through February 7, 2021 , if they still have funds in their HSA and have agreed through the BA survey to have their funds transferred to their 2021 Optum HSA. Those who did not respond or who said NO will have their PayFlex HSA funds re main at PayFlex and the HSA debit card will continue to be usable for their eligible healthcare expenses. All PayFlex FSA and L -FSA debit cards will be deactivated on 12/31/2020 . o State: Who did the email come from that was sent out to employees who had PayFlex HSA or FSA? I just want to make sure my region goes back and finds that email and responds. Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government Combined ABC Conference Call Notes November 10, 2020 8 Answer: The email was sent to members from the benefits.info@tn.gov account through Outlook. Emails were sent out at 11:50 a.m. on Thursday, Nov. 5, and did not go out to ABCs unless you have a CDHP/HSA and will stay enrolled in this plan next year. o State: I had an employee contact me yesterday who was trying to transfer over her balances and it was not giving her the options for her facility (in the HSA email/survey) . How would that be handled? She was following the steps in the email that she received. Answer: We have had a few instances where an agency was not included . If they are not seeing their exact agency , please let us know through benefits.info@tn.gov . The survey link stays the same . The yes or no in the survey and who is responding is the most important information as we want to know who sent it in . We can add or update the agency in the survey info rmation . We pulled the most recent agency list and we apologize if we missed an agency. o State: For employees who will utilize greater than the seed money ($500) from the state beginning Jan . 1, 2021, what is the recommendation to have access to be able to have monies available from their HSA prior to March 5 to be able to purchase their medications and pay for medical office visits? Answer: Employees cannot spend any funds greater than what their HSA account balance is at any point in time. State employees will receive the state seed funds of $250 or $500 in their Optum HSA sometime the first week of January , and if they are contributing funds through payroll deduction, then those funds will start to be added with the January 15 and January 31 paydays and so on. But only the balance that is in their account at any point in time is all that can be spent. An employee may choose, after January 1, to log on to their Optum HSA account at optumbank.com/Tennessee and download the HSA Rollover/Transfer Request Form and send it to PayFlex. This will initiate a direct transfer of their PayFlex HSA balance directly to their Optum HSA rather than waiting on the state's bulk transfer process to complete in early March. Members who agreed \"YES\" to the BA HSA funds transfer survey will still have access to their PayFlex HSA funds and debit card through February 7, 2021. LOCAL GOV QUESTIONS o Local Gov: Now that Annual Enrollment is over, what reports should we run to confirm employees' selection s? I need to provide my payroll specialist the new premiums that will go into effect 1/1/21. Answer: There are several queries based on whether you wan t to look at just changes made during Annual Enrollment , or if you want all enrollments as of 1/1/21 . At the top of the ABC webpage is a message board , and you will see you will see a tab called Local Ed/ Local Gov Queries that lists the queries you can run and includes a link to the query m anual in case you need additional information on the queries . Higher Education, Local Education, State and Local Government Combined ABC Conference Call Notes November 10, 2020 9 o Local Gov: I have a new employee who will just become eligible for coverage effective 12/1. Do I need to do anything special since he didn't do Annual Enrollment? He hasn't returned enrollment information yet. Answer: You will enter the employee new hire coverage as normal through a Benefit eForm, and if the new hire coverage is what the employee wants to maintain for 2021 , you will not need to do anything else. However , if the employee wants to make changes for 2021 , you can submit a paper application for the new coverage , and we will process it since the hire date was after Annual Enrollment ended. o Local Gov: I had an emp loyee who had a notice to cover insurance for a dep endent per a court order . On the court o rder it says 10/28/20 , and that he was going to have to pay for the whole month of Oct. I called and it was not supposed to start cover age until 11/10/20 - they are going to send me the documentation . What do I need to do when I get the actual form that it was supposed to be effective 11/1 0/20? The court order has been submitted to BA, effective 10/28 /20.

On December 4, Benefits Administration (BA) recommended and the State Insurance Committee voted to give all active state and higher education employees a premium holiday for June 2021 coverage . This means there will be no deduction for the health insuranc e premium this May. The premium holiday is for health insurance (BCBST & Cigna) premiums only and will not include voluntary benefits. The premium holiday is for active employees and COBRA participants only and does not impact retiree premiums. Why? Insurance claims in the state plan have been lower than expected. A premium holiday allows us to give back to our employees some of the surplus money on a one -time basis while maintaining sufficient reserves needed to operate the plan. When? Combined ABC Conference Call Notes Higher Educati on, Local Education, State and Local Government December 8, 2020 3 No p remiums for health insurance will be deducted from: 5/31 paycheck for state employees; A May paycheck for higher education employees (depending on payroll); May direct -bill invoices for state and higher ed employees; and 6/15 draft sent by BA to higher education administration. Additional Information: Departments will not pay the 80% portion for the June insurance premium. Agency budgets will be adjusted to reflect these non -recurring savings in FY 2021. There is no stipulation that an employee has to work a specific amount of time to be eligible. If they are enrolled in coverage, they will not be charged premiums regardless of when their coverage began. The employees WILL NOT show on the premiums due report for medical, unless there is a retroactiv e change for another month ( for Higher Ed ). You may still see charges for medical coverage on the 6/15 draft for any retroactive changes ( for Higher Ed ). Communicating to employees: State employees: Benefits Administration will send an email with a letter to all state employees letting them know that there will be a May premium holiday for their June health coverage. The emails will go out in May before the May end -of-month paychecks. If employees rep ly to these emails, it generates a Zendesk ticket, so we can answer any questions state employees may have. Higher Ed employees : The email/letter we will send to state employees in May will be forwarded to Rob Chance, April Preston and Holly Girgies for them to distribute as they wish. Higher Ed/Local Ed/Local Gov: PPACA (Affordable Care Act) Information : o Information on how to run your PPACA report can be found here: https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/finance/fa -benefits/documents/abc_run_ppaca.pdf (under the training section on the ABC website). o You can run your PPACA report through November now. You can run it for December information after the first of January. Just as a reminder, you will also need to run it again in January/February to pick up anyone that has coverage entered or changed retroactively after the date you ru n the report. o You are responsible for preparing 1095 forms for any retirees of your agency that are enrolled (or have family members enrolled) in Medical coverage. The retirees should automatically show on the PPACA report for the ABC(s) in your agency tha t have security access to your retiree department ID. Please remember that retirees can have dependent -only coverage. This is noted in the coverage code field. There will still be a line for the retiree, but if the coverage code is E, F, I or K then the re tiree is not enrolled in coverage. o BA sent you a list of COBRA enrollees mid -week that are associated with your agency. You must also include them with your 1094/1095 reporting. We will also email you with the information for anyone else that signs up for COBRA after the report is generated.
