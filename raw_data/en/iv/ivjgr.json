Learn about our fact checking process Treehugger / Allison Berler Clean Beauty Products Tips & Techniques Body oils are one of the most versatile types of beauty products you can incorporate into your wellness routine. They can help hydrate and rejuvenate your skin (even taking the place of many lotions), while helping you relax. Here are 10 easy recipes to experiment with, from oils intended for morning and nighttime routines, to summer and winter months, and dry and oily complexions. How to Choose Your Essential Oils To help you choose quality oils, look for information on the purity or other added ingredients. Make sure to buy 100% essential oil with no additives.Avoid buying \"fragrance\" or \"perfume\" oils, which aren't pure essential oils and may contain chemicals. When in doubt, select your essential oil from a reputable company. The Right Combination of Ingredients Treehugger / Sanja Kostic Body oils typically include a combination of carrier oils and essential oils. Carrier oils include plant oils known for their skin benefits, such as apricot oil, almond oil, olive oil, grapeseed oil, coconut oil, and jojoba oil. Essential oils are plant extracts that are made by steaming or pressing the flowers, leaves, bark, or fruits of a plant to extract its essence. Lavender, peppermint, tea tree, and lemon oil are among the most popular types of essential oils, recognized for their topical and aromatherapy benefits. Don't hesitate to get creative and start experimenting with making your own oil recipes by blending carrier oils, essential oils, and maybe even herbs. 1 of 10 Hydrating Hemp Body Oil Treehugger / Sanja Kostic Hydrating body oils help soothe and moisturize your skin, keeping it soft and silky even during the coldest months of the year.

Ingredients 1/4 cup grapeseed oil10 drops peppermint essential oil10 drops lemongrass essential oil1/4 teaspoon liquid vitamin E Fresh peppermint sprig (for decorative purposes) (optional) Combine the oils and add a sprig of fresh peppermint or a small strip of lemon rind to the bottle for decoration. In addition to being one of the least expensive carrier oils, grapeseed oil offers outstanding moisturizing properties. It contains high levels of Vitamin E and omega-6 fatty acid, which hydrate the skin and may protect it from sun damage and reduce inflammation. One downside to using grapeseed oil, however, is the process in which it is made. Most commercial grapeseed oils are made by using a chemical solvent like hexane, which is an air pollutant and neurotoxin. Cold-pressed grapeseed oils don't use chemicals so if you choose to use grapeseed oil, opt for one that is labeled as cold-pressed. Lemongrass is recognized for its calming properties, while the fresh aroma of peppermint can help wake you up and boost mental clarity. 8 of 10 Light Argan Blend for Oily Skin luisapuccini / Getty Images This delicate, antioxidant, and antibacterial-rich blend will help soothe and heal oily complexions.
