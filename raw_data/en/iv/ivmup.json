For the school, that engagement starts as young as middle school and creates relationships that encourage qualified young people to pursue a career in medicine. Keeping students in the pipeline requires a variety of tactics like educating families about the requirements of medical school, helping students with standardized test preparation, and providing mentorship. The cost of medical school frequently discourages young people from pursuing a career as a physician, but Texas has an advantage in that area. \"Texas compared to the rest of the nation has some of the best tuition rates of any state in the nation for health professionals' education,\" he said.
