PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES The Global Commitment to Health Section 1115(a) Demonstration was initiated in September 2005, and is designed to use a multi -disciplinary approach including the basic principles of public health, the fundamentals of effective administration of a Medicaid managed care delivery system, pu blic-private partnership, and program flexibility. In June 2018, the Global Commitment to Health demonstration was amended to include Opioid Use Disorder (OUD/SUD) and recovery services through covering Medication - Assisted Treatment (MAT). This demonstrat ion will provide the state with authority to provide high- quality, clinically appropriate SUD treatment services for short -term residents in residential and inpatient treatment settings that qualify as an Institution for Mental Diseases (IMD). This amendm ent e nsure s the availability of treatment supports that effectively prevent and treat opioid use disorder and other substance use disorders, and promote a comprehensive and integrated continuum of mental and physical health, OUD/SUD treatment, and long -term services and supports for all Vermonters receiving Medicaid services . Under this demonstration these services would allow the state to provide higher levels of care, time ly access, as well as enhance the state's overall comprehensive and evidence -based MAT program . As of January 1, 2017 Vermont extend ed the Global Commitment to Health demonstration to further promote delivery system and payment reform to meet the goals of the state working with the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services an d the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) consistent with Medicare's payment reform efforts in order to allow for alignment across public payers. Specifically, Vermont expects to demonstrate its ability to achieve universal access to health care, cost containment, and improved quality of care. Since 2005, the Global Commitment to Health demonstration has helped reduce Vermont's uninsured rate from 11.4 percent in 2005 to approximately 2.7 percent in 2015 through expansion of eligibility. The demonstration has also enabled Vermont to address and eliminate the bias toward institutional care and offer cost- effective, community -based services. For example, the proportion of Choices for Care participants served in the Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 10 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 community has passed fifty per cent and continues to increase. In addition, Vermont no longer has a waiting list for individuals in the Highest and High Need Groups under the Choices for Care component of the demonstration. While expansion of eligibility is no longer the primary focus of the demonstration, in light of the expansion of eligibility under the state plan pursuant to the Affordable Care Act, the demonstration continues to promote delivery system reform and cost -effective community - based services as an alternative to institut ional services. The state's goal in implementing the demonstration is to improve the health status of all Vermonters by: Promoting delivery system reform through value based payment models and alignment across public payers; Increasing access to affordabl e and high quality health care by assisting lower -income individuals who can qualify for private insurance through the Marketplace; Improving access to primary care; Improving health care delivery for individuals with chronic care needs; and Allowing benef iciaries a choice in long -term services and supports and providing an array of home and community- based alternatives recognized to be more cost-effective than institutional based supports. The state will employ four major elements in achieving the above go als: 1. Program Flexibility: Vermont has the flexibility to invest in certain specified alternative services and programs designed to achieve the demonstration's objectives (including the Marketplace subsidy program); 2. Managed Care Delivery System: Under the d emonstration the Agency for Human Services (AHS) will enter into an agreement with the Department of Vermont Health Access (DVHA), which will deliver services through a managed care- like model, subject to the requirements that would be applicable to a non-risk pre-paid inpatient health plan (PIHP) as defined in STC 24; 3. Removal of Institutional Bias: Under the demonstration, Vermont will provide a choice of settings for delivery of services and supports to older adults, people with severe and persistent mental illness, people with physical disabilities, people with developmental disabilities, and people with traumatic brain injuries who meet program eligibility and level of care requirements; and 4. Delivery System Reform : Under the demonstration, Vermont will support systemic delivery reform efforts using the payment flexibility provided through the demonstration to create alignment across public and private payers. Over the demonstration period, the state , in addition to the overall demonstration goals , will include the following six new goals to support the substance use disorder (SUD) program. Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 11 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 1. Increased rates of identification initiation , and engagement in treatment ; 2. Increase adherence to and retention in treatment; 3. Reductions in overdose deaths, particular ly those due to opioi ds; 4. Reduced utilization of emergency department and inpatient hospital settings for treatment where the utilization is preventable or medically inappropriate through improved access to other continuum of ca re services; 5. Fewer readmissions to the same or higher level of care where the readmission is preventable or medically inappropriate; and 6. Improved access to care for physical health condit ions among beneficiaries. The initial Global Commitment to Health and Choices f or Care demonstrations were approved in September of 2005, effective October 1, 2005. The Global Commitment to Health demonstration was extended for 3 years, effective January 1, 2011, and again for 3 years , effective October 2, 2013. The Choices for Care demonstration was extended for 5 years , effective October 1, 2010, and became part of the Global Commitment to Health demonstration in January 2015. The following amendments have been made to the Global Commitment to Health demonstration: 2007: A com ponent of the Catamount Health program was added, enabling the state to provide a premium subsidy to Vermonters who had been without health insurance coverage for a year or more, have income at or below 200 percent of the FPL, and who do not have access to cost -effective employer -sponsored insurance, as determined by the state. 2009: The state extended Catamount Health coverage to Vermonters at or below 300 percent of the FPL. 2011: The state included a palliative care program for children who are at or below 300 percent of the FPL and have been diagnosed with life -limiting illness that would preclude them from reaching adulthood. This program allows children to receive curative and palliative care services such as expressive therapy, care coordination, family training and respite for caregivers. 2012: CMS provided authority for the state to eliminate the $75 inpatient admission co- pay and to implement nominal co- payments for the Vermont Health Access Plan (VHAP) as articulated in the Medicaid state plan. 2013: CMS approved the extension of the Global C ommitment to Health demonstration which included sun- setting the authorities for most of the Expansion Populations, including Catamount Health coverage, because these populations would be eligible for Marketplace coverage beginning January 1, 2014. The ext ension also added the New Adult Group under the state plan to the population affected by the demonstration effective January 1, 2014. Finally, the extension also included premium subsidies for individuals enrolled in a qualified health plan whose income is at or below 300 percent of the FPL.

The total provider reimbursement is determined by multiplying: a. The provider's \"X units of services\" delivered to an enrollee; and b. The specific reimbursement rate per unit of service. 4. The payment is not for a \"bundle of services.\" 5. For the purposes of distinguishing the concept of FFS in 42 CF R 438.6(c)(1)(iii) versus a \"bundle of services\" in 42 CFR 438.6(c)(1)(i), a payment is considered a \"bundle of services\" when the payment system: a.

Specifically, demonstration participants enrolled in a special service program such as, but not limited to, specialized substance abuse and behavioral health services or a program for home and community- based services may only have access to the providers enrolled under that program, and will not have access to every Medicaid -enrolled provider for services under that program. Such participants will have freedom of choice of providers enr olled in the special service program. No restriction on freedom of choice of family planning provider may be imposed. 29. Contracts and Provider Payments. Payments to providers for Global Commitment will be set by DVHA and approved by AHS and will not be requi red to comply with the payment provisions in the approved state plan. a.

To the extent that DVHA has access to data and information under delegation from AHS that may not otherwise be shared with a non -risk PIHP, AHS must establish administrative, managerial and, technical controls to prevent sharing the data with divisions of DVHA responsible for the managed care -like model acting as a non -risk PIHP. VII. LONG -TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS PROTECTIONS FOR CHOICES FOR CARE 35. Person -Centered Planning. The state agrees to use person -centered planning processes to identify participants' and applicants' long- term service and support needs, the resources available to meet those needs, and to provide access to additional service and support options, such as the choice to use spouse caregivers, and access a prospective monthly cash payment. The state assures that person -centered planning will be in compliance with the characteristics set out in 42 CFR 441.301(c)(1) -(3). 36. Self- Directed Supports. The state agrees to provide resources to support participants or their proxies (e.g., a surrogate, parent or legal guardian/representative) in directing their own care. This support assures, but is not limited to, participants' compliance with laws pertaining to employer responsibilities and provision for back- up attendants as needs arise. The state agrees to assure that background checks on employees and their results are available to participants. State policies and guidelines will include, but not be limited to: criteria for who is eligible to self -direct, a fiscal agent/intermediary, and consultants to assist participants with learning their roles and responsibilities as an 'employer' and to ensure that services are consistent with care plan needs and allocations. Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 29 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 a. Choices for Care program enrollees will have full informed choice on the requirements and options to: self -direct Choices for Care services; have a qualified designated representativ e direct Choices for Care services on their behalf ; or select traditional agency -based service delivery. State and provider staff will receive training on these options. 37. Participant/Applicant Waiting List Monitoring. The state agrees to report on the statu s of the waiting lists for Choices for Care services during regular progress calls between CMS and the state and in reports submitted to CMS by the state. a. The state assures that it has a system as well as policies and procedures in place through which the providers must identify, report and investigate critical incidents that occur within the delivery of Choices for Care Long- Term Services and Supports (LTSS). The state also has a system as well as policies and procedures in place through which to preve nt, detect report, investigate, and remediate abuse, neglect, and exploitation. Providers and participants are educated about this system. Provider obligations include specific action steps that providers must take in the event of known or suspected abuse, neglect or exploitation. The Vermont policies and procedures are specified in Vermont Statute, 33 V.S.A. Chapter 69, available at: http://www.leg.state.vt.u s/statutes/sections.cfm?Title=33&Chapter=069 . 38.

The Choices for Care services are described in Attachment D. 39. Single State Agency LTSS oversight. In its role as single state agency, the AHS will ensure a managed LTSS plan for a comprehensive care model is developed that promotes the integration of home and community- based services, institutional, acute, primary and behavioral health care. 40. Choices for Care Enrollee Access. To support the beneficiary's expe rience receiving medical assistance and long -term services and supports, the state shall assure that all Choices for Care program enrollees have access to independent support services that assist them in understanding their coverage options and in the resolution of problems regarding services, coverage, access and rights. Independent support services will: a. Operate independently from any provider and to the extent possible, services will be provided independently of the state and support transparent and coll aborative resolution of issues between beneficiaries and state government; b. Be easily accessible and available to all Choices for Care enrollees. Activities will be directed toward enrollees in all settings (institutional, residential and community - based) , accessible through multiple entryways (e.g., phone, internet, office) and reach Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 30 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 out to beneficiaries and/or authorized representatives through various means (mail, phone, in person), as appropriate; c.

The state must submit a claiming protocol for this DSHP and the protocol will become Attachment L. IX. MONITORING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 43. Monitoring Calls. CMS will convene periodic conference calls with the state. The purpose of these calls is to discuss any significant actual or anticipated developments affecting the demonstration, including planning for future changes in the program. CMS will provide updates on any amendments or concept papers under review , as well as federal policies and issues that may affect any aspect of the demonstration. The state and CMS will jointly develop the agenda prior to the calls. Areas to be addressed during the monitoring call include, but are not limited to: a. Operations and performance; b. Transition and implementation activities; c. Stakeholder concerns; Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 32 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 d. Enrollment; e. Cost sharing; f.

Progre ss on evaluation activities and contracts; m. Related legislative developments in the state; and n. Any demonstration changes or amendments the state is considering such as the state's section 1115 SUD demonstration amendment. 44. Post-Award Forum . Pursuant to 42 CFR 431.420(c), within 6 months of the demonstration's implementation, and annually thereafter, the state shall afford the public with an opportunity to provide meaningful comment on the progress of the demonstration. At least 30 days prior to the date of the planned public forum, the state must publish the date, time and location of the forum in a prominent location on its website. The state must also post the most recent annual report on its website with the public forum announcement. Pursuant to 42 CFR 431.420(c), the state must include a summary of the comments in the Quarterly Report associated with the quarter in which the forum was held, as well as in its compiled Annual Report. 45. Submission of Post -Approval Deliverables. The state shall submit all required analyses, reports, design documents, presentations, and other items specified in these STCs (\"deliverables\"). The state shall use the processes stipulated by CMS and within the timeframes outlined within these STCs. 46. Compliance with F ederal Systems Innovation . As federal systems continue to evolve and incorporate 1115 waiver reporting and analytics, the state shall work with CMS to revise the reporting templates and submission processes to accommodate timely compliance with the require ments of the new systems. The state will submit the monitoring reports and evaluation reports to the appropriate system as directed by CMS. 47. Deferral for Failure to Submit Timely Demonstration Deliverables. The state agrees that CMS may issue deferrals in t he amount of $5,000,000 (federal share) when deliverables are Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 33 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 not submitted timely to CMS or found to not be consistent with the requirements approved by CMS. a. Thirty (30) days after the deliverable was due, CMS will issue a written notification to the state providing advance notification of a pending deferral for late or non-compliant submissions of required deliverables. b. For each deliverable, the state may submit a written request for an extension to submit the required deliverable. Should CMS agree to the state's request, a corresponding extension of the deferral process described below can be provided. i. CMS may agree to a corrective action as an interim step before applying the deferral, if requested by the state. c. The deferral would be issued against the next quarterly expenditure report following the written deferral notification. d. When the state submits the overdue deliverable(s) that are accepted by CMS, the deferral(s) will be released. e. As the purpose of a section 1115 demonstration is to test new methods of operation or service delivery, a state's failure to submit all required reports, evaluations, and other deliverables may preclude a state from renewing a demonstration or obtaining a new demonstration. f. CMS will consider with the state an alternative set of operational steps for implementing the intended deferral to align the process with the state's existing deferral process, for example the structure of the state request for an extens ion, what quarter the deferral applies to, and how the deferral is released. 48. Cooperation with Federal Evaluators. As required under 42 CFR 431.420(f), should CMS undertake a federal evaluation of the demonstration or any component of the demonstration, the state shall cooperate fully and timely with CMS and its contractors' evaluation activities. This includes, but is not limited to, commenting on design and other federal evaluation documents and providing data and analytic files to CMS, i ncluding entering into a data use agreement that explains how the data and data files will be exchanged, and providing a technical point of contact to support specification of the data and files to be disclosed, as well as relevant data dictionaries and re cord layouts. The state shall include in its contracts with entities who collect, produce or maintain data and files for the demonstration, that they shall make such data available for the federal evaluation as is required by the state under 42 CFR 431.420(f) to support federal evaluation. The state may claim administrative match for these activities. Failure to comply with this STC may result in a deferral being issued as outlined in section IX, STC 47. 49. Cooperation with Federal Learning Collaboration Effor ts. The state will cooperate with improvement and learning collaboration efforts by CMS.

The state will use this information in ongoing monitoring of individual well -being, provider/plan pe rformance, and continuous quality improvement efforts, in addition to complying with CMS reporting requirements. b. The state must maintain data dictionary and file layouts of the data collected. c. The raw and edited data will be made available to CMS within 30 days of a written request. X. GENERAL FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS 53. Quarterly Expenditure Reports. The state must provide quarterly expenditure reports using the form CMS -64 to separately report total expenditures for services provided under the Medicaid p rogram, including those provided through the demonstration under section 1115 authority. This project is approved for expenditures applicable to services rendered during Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 36 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 the demonstration period. CMS will provide FFP for allowable demonstration expenditure s only as long as they do not exceed the pre -defined limits on the costs incurred as specified in section XI (Monitoring Budget Neutrality). 54. Reporting Expenditures Subject to the Budget Neutrality Cap. In order to track expenditures under this demonstration, Vermont must report demonstration expenditures through the Medicaid and Children' s Health Insurance Program Budget and Expenditure System , following routines from CMS -64 reporting instructions outlined in section 2500 of the State Medicaid Manual. All d emonstration expenditures subject to the budget neutrality cap, including baselines and member months, must be reported each quarter on separate Forms CMS -64.9 Waiver and/or 64.9P Waiver, identified by the demonstration project number assigned by CMS (including the project number extension, which indicates the demonstration year in which the expenditure was made). Reporting for expenditures made subsequent to termination of the demonstration must indicate the demonstration year in which services were render ed. Payment adjustments attributable to expenditures under the demonstration must be recorded on the applicable Global Commitment prior quarter waiver form, identified as either CMS -64.9P Waiver (Medical Assistance Payments) or CMS - 64.10P Waiver (Administr ative Payments). When populated, these forms read into the CMS - 64 Summary sheet, Line 7 for increasing adjustments and Line 10B for decreasing adjustments. Adjustments not attributable to this demonstration should be reported on non- waiver forms, as instru cted in the State Medicaid Manual. The term, \"expenditures subject to the budget neutrality cap,\" is defined in subparagraph ( c) below. a. For each demonstration year, separate form CMS -64.9 waiver and/or 64.9P waiver reports must be submitted reporting expenditures subject to the budget neutrality cap. All expenditures subject to the budget neutrality ceiling for demonstration eligibles must be reported. The sum of the expenditures from the separate reports will represent the expenditures subject to the budget neutrality cap (as defined in subparagraph (c) below) . Medical expenditures for the new adult group, as described below, are not subject to the demonstration's budget neutrality cap, but they are subject to a Supplemental Budget Neutrality Test, as defined in STC 65. The Vermont Global Medicaid eligibility groups, for reporting purposes, include the names and definitions described in the table below.

It is understood that individuals receiving Community Rehabilitation and Treatment (CRT) Services are included in MEGs that are reported on the CMS -64. Reporting to CMS will occur via a supplemental information report provided as backup to the CMS -64. This report will be submitted concurrently with the other CMS -64 backup documentation submitted every quarter. c. For purposes of this section, the term \"expenditures subject to the budget neutrality cap\" must include all Medicaid expenditures on behalf of the individuals who are enrolled in this demonstration (as described in subparagraph (a) of this section) and who are receivi ng the services subject to the budget neutrality cap. All Global Commitment to Health program expenditures that are subject to the budget neutrality cap are considered demonstration expenditures and must be reported on line 49 of forms CMS -64.9 waiver and/or 64.9P waiver. The state must continue to report Choices for Care program (nursing facility and HCBS) expenditures on the appropriate service line on the CMS -64. d. Premiums and other applicable cost -sharing contributions from enrollees that are collected b y the state from enrollees under the demonstration must be reported to CMS on the CMS -64 Summary Sheet, Line 9D \"Other.\" In order to ensure that the demonstration is properly credited with premium collections, please indicate in the CMS - 64 Certification \" Footnotes\" section that Line 9D of the Summary Sheet is for Global Commitment Collections only. e. Administrative costs are not included in the budget neutrality agreement. The state must report administrative costs on the appropriate CMS -64 reporting line. Administrative costs associated with investments that are strictly administrative in nature are subject to the budget neutrality limit and are reported on the \"Investments\" or \"DSR investments\" waiver forms. All other administrative costs must be identified on the Forms CMS -64.10 waiver and/or 64.10P Waiver. Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 40 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 f. MBES/CBES Schedule C Reporting Adjustments. The state must submit prior period adjustments subsequent to the routine CMS -64 reporting instructions outlined in section 2500 of the State Medicaid Manual to report actual expenditures incurred for demonstration services in DY9 (CY 2014) through DY11 (CY 2016). The state shall complete these reporting adjustments within 12 months of the date of CMS' approval of this extension and provide written certification of the accuracy of the adjusted expenditures upon completion. The state must provide an update on the progress of these adjustments during the CMS monitoring calls described in STC 43. g. All claims for expenditures subject to the budget neutrality cap (including any cost settlements) must be made within 2 years after the calendar quarter in which the state made the expenditures. Furthermore, all title XIX claims for services during the demonstration period (including any cost settlements and claims incurred during the demonstration but paid subsequent to the end date of the demonstration) are considered allowable expenditures under the demonstration and must be made within two (2) years aft er the conclusion or termination of the demonstration. During the latter two (2) -year period, the state must continue to identify separately net expenditures related to dates of service during the operation of the section 1115 demonstration on the CMS -64 w aiver forms in order to properly account for these expenditures in determining budget neutrality. h. At the end of the demonstration, all investment claims (as defined in STC 82) for expenditures subject to the budget neutrality cap (including any cost settle ments and non-title XIX claims incurred during the demonstration but paid subsequent to the end date of the demonstration) must be made within two (2) quarters (six (6) months) after the calendar quarter in which the state made the expenditures. During the latter six (6) month period, the state must continue to identify separately net expenditures related to dates of service during the operation of the section 1115 demonstration on the CMS -64 waiver forms in order to properly account for these expenditures in determining budget neutrality. i. Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments are not counted as expenditures under the demonstration. 55. Reporting Member Months. The following describes the reporting of member months for demonstration populations. a. For the purpose of calculating the budget neutrality expenditure limit and for other purposes, the state must provide to CMS, as part of the Quarterly Report required under STC 50, the actual eligible member months for each of the Eligibility Groups (EG) described above. The state must submit a statement accompanying the Quarterly Report , which certifies the accuracy of this information. To permit full recognition of \"in process \" eligibility, reported counts of member months may be subject to revision. b. The term \"eligible member/months\" refers to the number of months in which persons are eligible to receive services. For example, a person who is eligible for 3 months Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 41 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 contributes 3 eligible member /months to the total. 2 individuals , who are eligible for 2 mont hs, each contributes two (2) eligible member months to the total, for a total of 4 eligible member/months. c. The state must report separate member months for individuals enrolled in the SUD program and the member months must be subtotaled according to the EG defined below. i. SUD IMD: SUD IMD member months are periods of time of Medicaid eligibility during which the individual is an inpatient in an IMD under terms of the demonstration for any day during the month and must be reported separately for each SUD IMD EG, as applicable. SUD IMD member months must be non- duplicative of any demonstration budget neutrality limit member months. 56. Standard Medicaid Funding Process. The standard Medicaid funding process must be used during the demonstration. Vermont must estim ate matchable Medicaid expenditures on the quarterly form CMS -37 based on the PMPM limit (or a percentage of the PMPM limit) and projected caseload for the quarter. In addition, the estimate of matchable demonstration expenditures (total computable and fed eral share) subject to the budget neutrality cap must be separately reported by quarter for each federal fiscal year on the form CMS -37 for both the medical assistance payments (MAP) and state and local administrative costs (ADM) outside of the PMPM limit. CMS will make federal funds available based upon the state's estimate, as approved by CMS. Within thirty (30) days after the end of each quarter, the state must submit the form CMS -64 quarterly Medicaid expenditure report, showing Medicaid expenditures, c onsistent with the definition of an expenditure in 45 C.F.R. 95.13, made in the quarter just ended. a. Intergovernmental transfers of the individual per member per month fixed amount from AHS to DVHA are not reportable expenditures, but provide funding for reportable DVHA expenditures. CMS will reconcile expenditures reported on the form CMS -64 with federal funding previously made available to the state, and include the reconciling adjustment in the finalization of the grant award to the state. 57. Sources of Non -Federal Share. The state certifies that the source of the non- federal share of funds for the demonstration are state/local monies. The state further certifies that such funds must not be used as the non- federal share for any other federal grant or contract , except as permitted by law. All sources of non -federal funding must be compliant with section 1903(w) of the Act and applicable regulations. In addition, all sources of the non -federal share of funding are subject to CMS approval. a. CMS will review the sou rces of the non -federal share of funding for the demonstration at any time. The state agrees that all funding sources deemed unacceptable by CMS must be addressed within the time frames set by CMS. Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 42 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 b. Any amendments that impact the financial status of the program must require the state to provide information to CMS regarding all sources of the non -federal share of funding. 58. State Certification of Public Expenditures. Nothing in these STCs concerning certification of public expenditures relieves the state of its responsibility to comply with federal laws and regulations, and to ensure that claims for federal funding are consistent with all applicable requirements. The state must certify that the following conditions for non- federal share of demonstration expenditures are met: a. Units of government, including governmentally operated health care providers, may certify that state or local tax dollars have been expended as the non -federal share of funds under the demonstration. b. To the extent the state utilizes certif ied public expenditures (CPEs) as the funding mechanism for title XIX (or under section 1115 authority) payments, CMS must approve a cost reimbursement methodology. The state must receive prior approval from CMS before implementing any CPEs. This methodology must include a detailed explanation of the process by which the state would identify those costs eligible under title XIX (or under section 1115 authority) for purposes of certifying public expenditures. c. To the extent the state utilizes CPEs as the fund ing mechanism to claim federal match for payments under the demonstration, governmental entities to which general revenue funds are appropriated must certify to the state the amount of such tax revenue (state or local) used to satisfy demonstration expendi tures. The entities that incurred the cost must also provide cost documentation to support the state's claim for federal match. d. The state may use intergovernmental transfers as a source of non -federal share to the extent that such funds are derived from st ate or local tax revenues and are transferred by units of government within the state. Any transfers from governmentally operated health care providers must be made in an amount not to exceed the non -federal share of title XIX payments. Under all circumst ances, health care providers must retain 100 percent of the payment for the claimed expenditure. Moreover, no pre -arranged agreements (contractual or otherwise) may exist between health care providers and state and/or local government to return and/or redi rect any portion of the Medicaid payments. This confirmation of Medicaid payment retention is made with the understanding that payments that are the normal operating expenses of conducting business , such as payments related to taxes (including health care provider -related taxes ), fees, and business relationships with governments that are unrelated to Medicaid and in which there is no connection to Medicaid payments , are not considered returning and/or redirecting a Medicaid payment. Intergovernmental transfers are not themselves expenditures, but may be a source of funding for expenditures. Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 43 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 59. Monitoring the Demonstration. The state will provide CMS with information to effectively monitor the demonstration, upon request, in a reasonable time frame. 60. Program Integrity. The state must have processes in place to ensure that there is no duplication of federal funding for any aspect of the demonstration. XI. MONITORING BUDGET NEUTRALITY FOR THE DEMONSTRATION 61. Limit on Title XIX Funding. Vermont will be subject to a limit on the amount of federal title XIX funding that the state may receive on selected Medicaid expenditures during the period of approval of the demonstration. The limit will consist of two parts, Medicaid Eligibility Groups defined in these Terms and Conditions and the New Adult Group, and are determined by using a per capita cost method . The Supplemental Test for the New Adult Group is described in STC 65. Actual expenditures subject to the budget neutrality expenditure limit must be reported by Vermont using the procedures described in the section for General Financial Requirements under title XIX. The data supplied by the state to CMS to calculate the an nual limits is subject to review and audit, and if found to be inaccurate, will result in a modified budget neutrality expenditure limit. CMS' assessment of the state's compliance with these annual limits will be done using the Schedule C report from the Medicaid Budget and Expenditure System/ Children's Health Insurance Budget and Expenditure System (MBES/CBES). 62. Risk. Vermont will be at risk for the per capita cost for demonstration enrollees under this budget neutrality agreement, but not for the number of demonstration enrollees in each of the groups. By providing FFP for all demonstration enrollees, Vermont will not be at risk for changing economic conditions which impact enrollment levels. However, by placing Vermont at risk for the per capita costs fo r demonstration enrollees, CMS assures that the federal demonstration expenditures do not exceed the level of expenditures that would have occurred had there been no demonstration. 63. Budget Neutrality Annual Expenditure Limit. For each year of the budget neutrality agreement an annual budget neutrality expenditure limit is calculated for each EG described as follows: a. An annual EG estimate must be calculated as a product of the number o f eligible member months reported by the state for that EG under the section entitled General Reporting Requirements, times the appropriate estimated per member per month (PMPM) costs from the table in subparagraph (b) below. b. The PMPMs for each EG used to calculate the annual budget neutrality expenditure limit for this demonstration is specified below. Medicaid Eligibility Group Trend Rate DY 12 PMPM CY 2017 DY 13 PMPM CY 2018 DY 14 PMPM CY 2019 DY 15 PMPM CY 2020 DY 16 PMPM CY 2021 Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 44 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 ABD $1,509.69 $1,565.54 $643.26 Each DY, the net variance between the without -waiver cost and actual with -waiver cost will be reduced. The reduced variance, to be calculated as a percentage of the total variance, will be used in place of the total variance to determine overall budget neutrality for the demonstration. (Equivalently, the difference between the total variance and reduced variance could be subtracted from the without -waiver cost estimate.) The formula for calculating the reduced variance is : reduced variance equals total variance times applicable percentage. The percentages for each EG and DY are determined based on how long the associate d population has been enrolled in managed care subject to this demonstration; lower percentages are for longer - established managed care populations. In the Vermont demonstration, the percentages below apply to all EGs in the same manner. DY 12 CY 2017 DY 13 CY 2018 DY 14 CY 2019 DY15 CY 2020 DY 16 CY 2021 Taxes or Donations . The CMS reserves the right to adjust the budget neutrality terms in order to be consistent with enforcement of impermissible provider payments, health care -related taxes, new federal statutes, or with policy interpretations implemented through letters, memoranda, or regulations. CMS reserves the right to make adjustments to the budget neutrality terms if any health care- related tax that was in effect during the base year, or provider -related donation that occurred during the base year, is determined by CMS to be in violation of the provider donation and health care related- tax provisions of section 1903(w) of the Ac t. Adjustments to annual budget targets will reflect the phase -out of impermissible provider payments by law or regulation, where applicable. 65. Monitoring of New Adult Group Spending and the Opportunity to Adjust Projections. For each DY, a separate annual b udget limit for the new adult group will be calculated as product of the trended monthly per person cost times the actual number of eligible/member months as reported to CMS by the state under the guidelines set forth in STC 55. The trend rates and per cap ita cost estimates for the new adult group are listed in the table below. Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 45 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 Medicaid Eligibility Group Trend Rate DY 12 PMPM CY 2017 DY 13 PMPM CY 2018 DY 14 PMPM CY 2019 DY 15 PMPM CY 2020 DY 16 PMPM CY If the state's experience of the take- up rate for the new adult group and other factors that affect the costs of this population indicate that the PMPM limit described above may underestimate the actual costs of medical assistance for the new adult group, the state has the opportunity to submit an adjustment to the PMPM limit, along with detailed expenditure data to justify this, for CMS review without submitting an amendment pursuant to STC 7. In order to ensure timely a djustments to the PMPM limit for a demonstration year, the revised projection must be submitted to CMS by no later than the end of the third quarter of the demonstration year for which the adjustment would take effect. Additional adjustments to the PMPM l imit may be made pursuant to the process outlined in (d) below. b. The budget limit for the new adult group is calculated by taking the PMPM cost projection for the above group in each DY, times the number of eligible member months for that group and DY, and adding the products together across DYs. The federal share of the budget neutrality cap is obtained by multiplying the total computable budget neutrality cap by the federal share. c. The state will not be allowed to obtain budget neutrality \"savings\" from this population. d. If total FFP reported by the state for the new adult group should exceed the federal share of FFP for the budget limit for the new adult group by more than 3 percent following each demonstration year, the state must submit a corrective actio n plan to CMS for approval. 66. Supplemental Budget Neutrality Test 1: SUD Expenditures . As part of the SUD program , the state may receive FFP for the continuum of services to treat OUD and other SUDs, provided to Medicaid enrollees in an IMD. These are state plan services that would be eligible for reimbursement if not for the IMD exclusion. Therefore, they are being treated as hypothetical for the purposes of budget neutrality. Hypothetical services can be treated in budget neutrality in a way that is similar to how Medicaid state plan services are treated, by including them as a \"pass through\" in both the without -waiver and with- waiver calculations. However, the state will not be allowed to obtain budget neutrality \"savings\" from these services. If total FFP for hypothetical groups should exceed the federal share of the SUD Budget Neutrality Test Hypotheticals Cap, the difference must be reported as a cost against the budget neutrality limit described in STC 63.

Composite Federal Share Ratios. The federal share of the budget neutrality expenditure limit is calculated by multiplying the limit times the Composite Federal Share Ratio. The Composite Federal Share is the ratio calculated by dividing the sum total of federal financial participation (FFP) received by the state on actual demonstration expenditures during the approval period, as reported through the MBES/CBES and summarized on Schedule C with consideration of additional allowable demonstration offsets such as, but not limited to, premium collections and pharmacy rebates, by total computable demonstration expenditures for the same period as reported on the same forms. 68. Enforcement of Budget Neutrality. CMS shall enforce budget neutrality over t he life of the demonstration rather than on an annual basis. The budget neutrality test for the demonstration extension will incorporate net savings from the immediately prior demonstration period of October 1, 2011 through December 31, 2016, but not from any earlier approval period. 69. Exceeding Budget Neutrality. If the budget neutrality expenditure limit, as defined in STC 63, has been exceeded at the end of this demonstration period, the excess federal funds , must be returned to CMS. If the demonstration is terminated prior to the end of the budget neutrality agreement, an evaluation of this provision shall be based on the time elapsed through the termination date. 70. Expenditure Review and Cumulative Target Calculation. CMS will enforce budget neutrality over the life of the demonstration, rather than on an annual basis. However, no later than 6 months after the end of each demonstration year, CMS will calculate an annual expenditure target for the completed year. This amount will be compared wi th the actual FFP claimed by the state under budget neutrality. Using the schedule below as a guide, if the state exceeds the cumulative target, they must submit a corrective action plan ( CAP ) to CMS for approval within 30 days of notification from CMS. The state will subsequently implement the approved CAP . Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 47 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 Year Cumulative Target Definition Percentage Year 12 Year 12 budget estimate plus 3 percent Year 13 Years 12 and 13 combined budget estimate plus 3 percent Year 14 Years 12 through 14 combined budget estimate plus 3 percent Year 15 Years 12 through 15 combined budget estimate plus 1.5 percent Year 16 Years 12 through 16 combined budget estimate plus 0 percent XII. EVALUATION OF THE DEMONSTRATION 71. Independent Evaluator. Upon approval of the demonstration, the state must begin to arrange with an independent party to conduct an evaluation of the demonstration to ensure that the necessary data is collected at the level of detail needed to research the approved hypotheses. The independent party must sign an agreement to conduct the demonstration evaluation in an independent manner in accord with the CMS -approved, draft Evaluation Design. When conducting analyses and developing the evaluation reports, every effort should be made to follow the approved methodology. However, the state may request, and CMS may agree to, changes in the methodology in appropriate circumstances. 72. Evaluation Budget. A budget for the evaluation must be provided with the draft Evaluation Design. It will include the total estimated cost, as well as a breakdown of estimated staff, administrative and other costs for all aspects of the evaluation, such as any survey and measurement development, quantitative and qualitative data collection and cleaning, analyses , and report generation. A justification of the costs may be required by CMS if the estimates provided do not appear to sufficiently cover the costs of the design or if CMS finds that the design is not sufficiently developed, or if the estimates appear to be excessive. 73. Draft Evaluation Design. The state's Evaluation Design must be amended to incorporate the SUD component . The state must submit, for CMS comment and approval, a n updated draft Evaluation Design with implementation timeline no later than 180 days after the approval date of the SUD amendment . Any modifications to an existing approved Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 48 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 Evaluation Design will not affect previously established requirements and timelines for report submission for the demonstration, if applicable. 74. Evaluat ion Design Approval and Updates. The state must submit a revised draft Evaluation Design within 60 days after receipt of CMS' comments. Upon CMS approval of the draft Evaluation Design, the document will be included as an attachment to these STCs. Per 42 CFR 431.424(c), the state will publish the approved Evaluation Design to the state's website within 30 days of CMS approval. The state must implement the evaluation design and submit a description of the evaluation implementation progress in each of the Monitoring Reports, including any required Rapid Cycle Assessments specified in these STCs. Once CMS approves the evaluation design, if the state wishes to make changes, the state must submit a revised evaluation design to CMS for approval. 75. SUD Evaluation Questions and Hypotheses. The evaluation documents must include a discussion of the SUD evaluation questions and hypotheses that the state intends to test. The hypothesis testing should include, where possible, assessment of both process and outcome measures. Proposed measures should be selected from nationallyrecognized sources and national measures sets, where possible. Measures sets could include CMS's Core Set of Health Care Quality Measures for Children in Medicaid and CHIP, Consumer Assessment of Health Care Providers and Systems (CAHPS), the Initial Core Set of Health Care Quality Measures for Medicaid -Eligible Adults and/or measures endorsed by National Quality Forum (NQF). 76. Interim Evaluation Report. The state must submit an Interim Evaluation Report for the completed years of the demonstration, and for each subsequent renewal or extension of the demonstration, as outlined in 42 CFR 431.412(c)(2) (vi). When submitting an application for renewal, the Evaluation Report should be posted to the state's website with the application for public comment. a. The interim evaluation report will d iscuss evaluation progress and present findings to date as per the approved evaluation design. b. For demonstration authority that expires prior to the overall demonstration's expiration date, the Interim Evaluation Report must include an evaluation of the authority as approved by CMS. c. If the state is seeking to renew or extend the demonstration, the draft Interim Evaluation Report is due when the application for renewal is submitted. If the state made changes to the demonstration in its application for rene wal, the research questions and hypotheses, and how the design was adapted should be included. If the state is not requesting a renewal for a demonstration, an Interim Evaluation report is due one (1) year prior to the end of the demonstration. For demons tration phase -outs prior to the expiration of the approval period, the draft Interim Evaluation Report is due to CMS on the date that will be specified in the notice of termination or suspension. Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 49 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 d. The state must submit the final Interim Evaluation Report 6 0 calendar days after receiving CMS comments on the draft Interim Evaluation Report and post the document to the state's website. 77. Summative Evaluation Report. The state must submit a draft Summative Evaluation Report for the demonstration's approval period, July 1, 2018 - December 31, 2021, within 18 months of the end of the approval period represented by these STCs. The Summative Evaluation Report must include the information in the approved Evaluation Design. a. Unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by CMS , the state must submit the final Summative Evaluation Report within 60 calendar days of receiving comments from CMS on the draft. b. The final Summative Evaluation Report must be posted to the state's Medicaid website within 30 calendar days of approval by C MS. 78. State Presentations for CMS. CMS reserves the right to request that the state present and participate in a discussion with CMS on the Evaluation Design, the interim evaluation, and/or the summative evaluation. 79. Public Access . The state shall post the f inal documents (e.g., Monitoring Reports, Close Out Report, approved Evaluation Design, Interim Evaluation Report, and Summative Evaluation Report) on the state's Medicaid website within 30 days of approval by CMS. 80. Additional Publications and Presentations . For a period of 12 months following CMS approval of the final reports, CMS will be notified prior to presentation of these reports or their findings, including in related publications (including, for example, journal articles), by the state, contractor, or any other third party directly connected to the demonstration. Prior to release of these reports, articles or other publications, CMS will be provided a copy including any associated press materials. CMS will be given 10 business days to review and comm ent on publications before they are released. CMS may choose to decline to comment or review some or all of these notifications and reviews. This requirement does not apply to the release or presentation of these materials to state or local government officials. 81. Cooperation with Federal Evaluators. As required under 42 CFR 431.420(f), the state shall cooperate fully and timely with CMS and its contractors' in any federal evaluation of the demonstration or any component of the demonstration. This includes, but is not limited to, commenting on design and other federal evaluation documents and providing data and analytic files to CMS, including entering into a data use agreement that explains how the data and data files will be exchanged, and providing a techni cal point of contact to support specification of the data and files to be disclosed, as well as relevant data dictionaries and record layouts. The state shall include in its contracts with entities who collect, produce or maintain data and files for the de monstration, that they shall make such data available for the federal evaluation as is required under 42 CFR 431.420(f) to support federal evaluation. The state may claim administrative match for these activities. Failure to comply with this STC may result in a deferral being issued as outlined in STC 47. Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 50 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 XIII. USE OF DEMONSTRATION FUNDS 82. Use of Demonstration Funds. Since 2005, the state has been able to make expenditures previously referred to as \"Managed Care Organization \" (MCO) investments. As part of the 2017 extension these expenditures will be referred to as \" investments. \" The demonstration provides authority for expenditures within the annual limits specified in STC 84 below and can include expenditures within the following areas: a. Reduce the rate of uninsured and/or underinsured in Vermont; b. Increase the access to quality health care by uninsured, underinsured, and Medicaid beneficiaries; c. Provide public health approaches and other innovative programs to improve the health outcomes, health status and quality of life for uninsured, underinsured and Medicaid -eligible individuals in Vermont; and d. Encourage the formation and maintenance of public -private partnerships in health care, including initiatives to support and improve the health care delivery system and promote transformation to value -based and integrated models of care. 83. Phase -Down of Investments. T he state must follow the phase -down schedule below for the following investments.

Investment Approval Process. The state may spend up to the amounts listed in the above \"Investment Annual Limits\" STC 84 on approved investments during each DY. See Attachment H for a list of approved investments. The state must submit an Investment Claiming Protocol for all current a nd new investments. This protocol will become Attachment M. The annual limits cannot be rolled over to the next DY. If the state chooses to add a new investment, it must meet the criteria specified in STC 82 \"Use of Demonstration Funds\" and must not suppla nt other federal involvement (including meeting a maintenance of effort requirement for any federal grant program) and must not include the following, including other activities CMS determines are unallowable: a. Construction costs (bricks and mortar); b. Room a nd board; c. Animal s helters and vaccines; d. Provider or beneficiary d ebt relief and restructuring; Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 52 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 e. Sheltered workshops; f. Research expenditures; g. Rent and/or utility s ubsidies that are normally funded by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development; h. Prisons, correctional f acilities or services for people who are civilly committed and unable to leave an institutional setting; i. Services provided to individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States or are undocumented; j. Facility closures; k. Unspecified projects; and l. School based programs for children. 86. Accountable Care Organization (ACO) and Medicaid Community Provider Integration Program (\"Medicaid Pathway\") Investments. CMS is making one -time funding available under the above investment structure for the state to assist the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) and Medicaid community providers in one -time, developmental start- up funding. STC 87 establishes that Vermont shall notify CMS of delivery system -related investments that fall within the following categories which requires that the state notify CMS 90 days prior to claiming for any of the proposed new investments. If CMS finds that the proposed investment does not me et the criteria outlined in STC 82 and 86, it must notify Vermont of this finding within 45 days. For investments that do not fall within the categories below, Vermont must follow the notification and CMS review procedures as described in STC 8 8. The state must not include any costs listed in STC 8 5 above. a. Delivery System Related Investment Categories The goal of the delivery system -related investments is to support implementation of Vermont's All- Payer Accountable Care Organization (ACO) model. i. Catego ry #1 projects consist of funding to the Accountable Care Organization(s). Funding under category #1 is limited to development costs only. ii. Category #2 projects consist of funding to providers. b. Vermont may select time -limited, start- up delivery system inve stments in DY one (1) through DY four (4) of the extension period and maintenance investments in DY five (5) of the renewal period. These are time- limited investments that are expected to phase down and out at the end of five (5) years. There may not be st art-up investments in DY five (5) of the extension period. c. A project plan is required for each project and shall include an explanation of how the project will provide a return on investment over the demonstration extension period and how the project coul d be sustainably funded or phased out by the completion of the five (5) year demonstration extension period. The state must Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 53 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 include metrics for all projects and the metrics are required for all years that the project receives funding. Detailed requirement s are listed in A ttachment I. d. Vermont may include one -time, development start -up funding for its ACO and \"Medicaid Pathways\" program as an investment as long as the projects meet the criteria in A ttachment I. For such projects, Vermont will follow the new investment notification requirements in STC 87 below. 87. New Investment Notification. The state must notify CMS of any new investments. Investments must meet the criteria in STC 82 above and must not include any of the activities listed in STC 85 above. The s tate must submit information regarding new investments following the template in Attachment J. The state may also choose from a menu of time - limited, start- up, one -time delivery system activities listed in A ttachment I and must indicate if the proposed investment is strictly administrative in nature. The state must notify CMS 90 days prior to claiming for any of the proposed new investments. CMS reserves the right to not approve new investments if they do not meet the criteria above or if CMS and the stat e cannot agree to a phase- down schedule for the Vermont Psychiatric Care Hospital and other IMD costs. If CMS finds that the proposed investment does not meet the criteria above, it must notify Vermont of this finding within 45 days. If CMS notifies the st ate with concerns, the proposed investment will be considered under review as outlined in STC 88 below. 88. Requirement for Approval of Investments That Do Not Meet Criteria. The state may request to add an investment that that does not meet the requirements of STC 85 or the menu of delivery system projects in Attachment I. In this instance, the state must submit a letter to CMS at least 120 days prior to the proposed implementation explaining the investment and providing justification for the investment, including how the investment advances the goals of the Medicaid program and demonstration. CMS will review the investment and will issue a disapproval or approval within 60 days of receipt of the state's letter. 89. IMD Evaluation Requirements. CMS is continuing time -limited expenditure authority for costs not otherwise matchable, subject to the cap described in STC 84 for costs of care to eligible individuals at a specific group of facilities (listed in STC 8 3) that are IMDs. Given this unique previously approved authority, CMS is asking the state to perform an extensive evaluation of the IMD expenditure authority (in addition to the evaluation that is required under the SUD program approved in the SUD amendment ) on individuals with severe mental illness as well as individuals in need of acute mental health and substance use disorder services in the context of system -wide service, payment, and delivery system reforms. The evaluation will help inform broader policy discussions about Medicaid funding for IMD services. 90. Phase -Down Plan for Vermont Psychiatric Care Hospital and IMD Expenditures. No later than December 31, 2018, the state must submit a phase -down schedule for the Vermont Psychiatric Care Hospital and other IMD expenditures. The state must prop ose a lower amount for the IMD expenditures for Calendar Year 2021 (DY five (5) of the demonstration extension). The reduced IMD expenditures must start January 1, 2021. IMD expenditures must phase down to $0 by December 31, 2025. If the state does not submit the phase -down Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 54 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 plan by December 31, 2018, the default percentage for DY five (5) of the extension period (DY 16) is 0 percent. 91. Application Process for Use of Demonstration Funds . AHS will use a standardized approach to evaluate new investment applicati ons. Documentation of new and proposed investments will be posted on the state's Global Commitment to Health register website. Where specific program statistics for Medicaid, uninsured, or underinsured members are not available, the state will apply a prox y percentage for allowable expenditures based on the most recent reliable and valid state survey information such as the Vermont Household Health Insurance Survey. Monitoring and evaluation of approved investments will be performed and submitted to CMS in the quarterly and annual reports to ensure that expenditures advance the goals of the demonstration and the Medicaid program and do not violate the restrictions listed in STC 85. 92. Administrative Investments. The state may only receive the 50 percent adminis trative matching rate for investments that are strictly administrative in nature. The following investments have been found to be strictly administrative in nature: a. Green Mountain Care Board; b. Health Research and Statistics; c. Patient Safety Adverse Events; and d. Area Health Education Centers (AHEC). XIV. MEASUREMENT OF QUALITY OF CARE AND ACCESS TO CARE 93. Comprehensive State Quality Strategy (CQS). The state shall expand upon the managed care quality strategy requirements at 42 CFR 438.340 and adopt and impl ement a comprehensive, dynamic, and holistic continuous quality improvement strategy that integrates all aspects of quality improvement programs, processes, and requirements across the state's Medicaid program. This comprehensive quality strategy (CQS) mus t address quality improvement for all components of the state's Medicaid state plan and its section 1115 demonstration. The CQS must meet all the requirements of 42 CFR 438 and must include LTSS and HCBS quality components. a. CQS Elements . The CQS must also address the following elements , as well as those identified in 42 CFR 438.340(b): i. Goals . Building on the requirements at 42 CFR 438.340(b)(2), the state's goals for improvement, identified through claims and encounter data, quality metrics, and expenditur e data. The goals should align with the three -part aim but should be more specific in identifying pathways for the state to achieve these goals. Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 55 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 ii. Responsibilities . The CQS must identify Single State Agency and public managed care responsibilities. The Single State Agency retains ultimate authority and accountability for public managed care responsibilities and adherence to the CQS, including monitoring and evaluation of the public managed care model's compliance with requirements s pecific to the MLTSS assurances identified in STC 93(a)(v)(2) below as well as the health and welfare of enrollees. iii. Performance Improvement Projects (PIPs) . Building on the requirements at 42 CFR 438.340(b)(3)(ii), the associated interventions for improvem ent in the goals. All performance improvement project (PIP) topics, tied to specific goals, must be included in the CQS. iv. Performance Measures . Building on the requirements at 42 CFR 438.340(b)(3)(i), the specific quality metrics for measuring improvement in the goals. The metrics should be aligned with the CMS Child and Adult Core Measure Sets for Medicaid and CHIP, and should also align with other existing Medicare and Medicaid federal measure sets where possible and appropriate. The metrics s hould go beyond Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS \u00ae) and Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) data, and should reflect cost of care. 1. Levels of Aggregation. Metrics should be measured at the following levels of aggregation: the state Medicaid agency, specific health care program (such as Choices for Care), if applicable, and potentially at each direct health services provider. The state will work with CMS to further define metrics, as appropriate, for collection. 2. Benchmarks and Targets . The specific methodology for determining benchmark and target performance on these metrics. v. Populations . Specific metrics related to each population covered by the Medicaid program, including children, pregnant women, non- disabl ed adults (including parents), individuals receiving HCBS services, and individuals receiving LTSS. 1. HCBS performance measures in the areas of: level of care determinations, person- centered service planning process, outcome of person- centered goals, health and welfare, outcomes, quality of life, effectives process, community integration, and assuring there are qualified providers and appropriate HCBS settings. 2. The CQS must include a special focus on MLTSS populations and address the following: Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 56 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 a. A self -assessm ent of MLTSS adherence to state and federal standards of care to include: i. Assessment of existing initiatives designed to improve the delivery of MLTSS, including performance . ii. Examination of processes to identify any potential corrective action steps toward improving the MLTSS system. b. Person -centered planning and i ntegrated care settings c. Comprehensive and i ntegrated s ervice packages d. Qualifications of providers e. Participant protection vi. Timeline . The CQS should include a timeline that considers metric deve lopment and specification, contract amendments, data submission and review, incentive disbursement (if available), and the re -basing of performance data. vii. Monitoring and Evaluation.

Effective upon CMS' approval of the OUD/SUD Implementation Protocol, as described in STC 95, the demonstration benefit package for Vermont Medicaid recipients will include OUD/SUD treatment services, including services provided in residential and inpatient treatment settings that qualify as an Institution for Mental Diseases (IMD), which are not otherwise matchable expenditures under section 1903 of the Act. The state will be eligible to receive FFP for Vermont Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 58 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 Medicaid recipients residing in IMDs under the terms of this demonstration for coverage of medical assistance, including OUD/SUD benefits that would otherwise be matchable if the beneficiary were not residing in an IMD. Vermont will aim for a statewide average length of stay of 30 days in residential treatment settings, to be monitored pursuant to the SUD Monitoring P rotocol as outlined in s ection X below, to ensure short -term residential treatment stays. Under this demonstration component , benefi ciaries will have access to high - quality, evidence -based OUD and other SUD treatment services ranging from medically supervised withdrawal management to on- going chronic care for these conditions in cost - effective settings while also improving care coordin ation and care for comorbid physical and mental health conditions. The coverage of OUD/SUD inpatient, residential treatment and withdrawal management services in IMDs will expand Vermont's current OUD/SUD benefit package available to all Vermont Medicaid r ecipients as outlined in Table 1. Room and board costs are not considered allowable costs for residential treatment service providers unless they qualify as inpatient facilities under section 1905(a) of the Act.

The state may not claim FFP for services provided in IMDs until CMS has approved the Implementation Protocol. With this amendment, CMS is also approving the SUD Implementation Protocol and it has been incorporated into the STCs, as Attachment N and, may be altered only with CMS approval. After approval of the Implementation Protocol, FFP will be available prospectively, not retrospectively. Failure to submit an Implementation Protocol will be considered a material failure to comply with the terms of the demonstration project as Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 59 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 described in 42 CFR 431.420(d) and, as such, would be grounds for termination or suspension of the OUD/SUD program under this demonstration. Failure to progress in meeting the milestone goals agreed upon by the state and CMS will result in a funding deferral. At a minimum, the OUD/SUD Implementation Protocol must describe the strategic approach and detailed project implementation plan, including timetables and programmatic content where applicable, for meeti ng the following milestones which reflect the key goals and objectives of the SUD component of this demonstration program: a.

SUD Monitoring Protocol. The state must submit a SUD Monitoring Protocol within 150 calendar days after approval of SUD program under this demonstration. The SUD Monitoring P rotocol must be developed in cooperation with CMS and is subject to CMS approval. Once approved, t he SUD Monitoring Protoc ol will be incorporated into the STCs, as Attachment O . At a minimum, the SUD Monitoring Plan Protocol will include reporting relevant to each of the program implementation areas listed in STC 43. The protocol will also describe the data collection, repo rting and analytic methodologies for performance measures identified by the state and CMS for inclusion. The SUD Monitoring Protocol will specify the methods of data collection and timeframes for reporting on the state's progress on required measures as p art of the general reporting requirements described in STC 50 of the demonstration. In addition, for each performance measure, the SUD Monitoring Protocol will identify a baseline, a target to be achieved by the end of the demonstration and an annual goal for closing the gap between baseline and target expressed as pe rcentage points. Where possible, baselines will be informed by state data, and targets will be benchmarked against performance in best practice settings. CMS will closely monitor demonstration spending on services in IMDs to ensure adherence to budget neutrality requirements. Progress on the performance measures identified in the Monitoring Protocol will be reported via the quarterly and annual monitoring reports. Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 61 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 97. Mid-Point Assessment.

The assessor must collaborate with key stakeholders, including representatives of MCOs, SUD treatment providers, beneficiaries, and other key partners in the design, planning and conducting of the mid- point assessment. The assessment will include an examination of progress toward meeting each milestone and timeframe approved in the SUD Implementation Protocol, and toward closing the gap between baseline and target each year in performance measures as approved in the SUD Monitoring Protocol. The assessment will also include a determination of factors that affected achievement on the milestones and performance measure gap closure percentage point s to date, and a determination of selected factors likely to affect future performance in meeting milestones and targets not yet met and about the risk of possibly missing those milestones and performance targets. The mid -point assessment will also provide a status update of budget neutrality requirements. For each milestone or measure target at medium to high risk of not being met, the assessor will provide, for consideration by the state, recommendations for adjustments in the state's implementation pla n or to pertinent factors that the state can influence that will support improvement. The assessor will provide a report to the state that includes the methodologies used for examining progress and assessing risk, the limitations of the methodologies, its determinations and any recommendations. A copy of the report will be provided to CMS. CMS will be briefed on the report. For milestones and measure targets at medium to high risk of not being achieved, the state will submit to CMS modifications to the S UD Implementation Protocol and SUD Monitoring Protocols for ameliorating these risks subject to CMS approval. a. SUD Evaluation. The OUD/SUD Evaluation will be subject to the same requirements as the overall demonstration evaluation, as listed in sections IX General Reporting Requirements and X II Evaluation of the Demonstration of the STCs. b. SUD Evaluation Design. The state must submit, for CMS comment and approval, a revision to the Evaluation Design to include the SUD program with implementation timeline, no later than 180 days after the effective date of these amended STCs.

The state must implement the evaluation design and submi t a description of its evaluation implementation progress in each of the Quarterly and Annual Reports, including any required Rapid Cycle Assessments specified in these STCs. Once CMS approves the evaluation design, if the state wishes to make Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 62 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 changes, the state must submit a revised evaluation design to CMS for approval. 98. Evaluation Questions and Hypotheses Specific to OUD/SUD Program. The evaluation documents must include a discussion of the evaluation questions and hypotheses that the state intends to te st. Each demonstration component should have at least one evaluation question and hypothesis. The hypothesis testing should include, where possible, assessment of both process and outcome measures. Proposed measures should be selected from nationally recognized sources and national measures sets, where possible. Measures sets could include CMS's Core Set of Health Care Quality Measures for Children in Medicaid and CHIP, Consumer Assessment of Health Care Providers and Systems (CAHPS), the Initial Core Se t of Health Care Quality Measures for Medicaid -Eligible Adults and/or measures endorsed by National Quality Forum (NQF). 99. SUD Health Information Technology (Health IT ). The state will provide CMS with an assurance that it has a sufficient health IT infras tructure/\"ecosystem\" at every appropriate level (i.e. state, delivery system, health plan/MCO and individual provider) to achieve the goals of the demonstration\u2014or it will submit to CMS a plan to develop the infrastructure/capabilities. This \"SUD Health I T Plan,\" or assurance will be included as a section of the state's \"Implementation Plan\" ( see STC 95) to be approved by CMS. The SUD Health IT Plan will detail the necessary health IT capabilities in place to support beneficiary health outcomes to address the SUD goals of the demonstration. The plan will also be used to identify areas of SUD health IT e cosystem improvement. a. The SUD Health IT section of the Implementation P lan will include implementation milestones and dates for achieving them . b. The SUD Health IT Plan must be aligned with the state's broader State Medicaid Health IT Plan (SMHP) and, if applicable, the state's Behavioral Health (BH) \"Health IT\" Plan. c. The SUD Health IT Plan will describe the state's goals, each DY, to enhance the state's prescription drug monitoring program's (PDMP) . 1 d. The SUD Health IT Plan will address how the state's PDMP will enhance ease of use for prescribers and other state and federal stakeholders. 2 This will also include plans to include PDMP interoperability with a statewide, regional or local Health Information Exchange. Additionally, the SUD Health IT Plan will describe ways in which the state will support clinicians in consulting the PDMP prior to prescribing a 1 Prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMP) are electronic databases that track controlled substance prescriptions in states. PDMPs can provide health authorities timely information about prescribing and patient behaviors that contribute to the \"opioid\" epidemic and facilitate a nimble and targeted res ponse. 2 Ibid.

The SUD Health IT Plan will, as applicable, describe the state's capabilities to leverage a master patient index (or master data management service, etc.) in support of SUD care delivery. Additionally, the SUD Health IT Pla n must describe current and future capabilities regarding PDMP queries \u2014and the state's ability to properly match patients receiving opioid presc riptions with patients in the PDMP. The state will also indicate current efforts or plans to develop and/or utiliz e current patient index capab ility that supports the programmatic objectives of the demonstration. f. The SUD Health IT Plan will describe how the activities described in (a) through (e) above will support broader state and federal efforts to diminish the likelihood of long-term opioid use directly correlated to clinician prescribing patterns. 3 g. In developing the Health IT Plan, states should use the following resources : i. States may use resources at Health IT.Gov (https://www.healthit.gov/playbook/opioid- epidemic -and-health -it/ ) in \"Section 4: Opioid Epidemic and Health IT.\" ii. States may also use the CMS 1115 Health IT resources available o n \"Medicaid Program Alignment with State Systems to Advance HIT, HIE and Interoperability\" at https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/data -and- systems/hie/index.html . States shou ld review the \"1115 Health IT Toolkit\" for health IT considerations in conducting an assessment and developing their Health IT Plans , found at https://www.healthit.gov/topic/advancing- interoperability -medicaid . iii. States may request from CMS technical assistance to conduct an assessment and develop plans to ensure they have the specific health IT infrastructure with regards to PDMP plans and, more generally, to meet the goals of the demonstration h. The state will include in its SUD M onitoring P rotocol (see STC 96) an approach to monitoring its SUD Health IT Plan which will include performance metrics provided by CMS or State defined metrics to be approved in advance by CMS. i. The state will monitor progress, each DY, on the implementation of its SUD Health IT Plan in relationship to its milestones and timelines \u2014and report on its progress to CMS in in an addendum to its Annual Reports ( see STC 50). 3 Shah, Anuj, Corey Hayes and Bradley Martin.

GLOBAL COMMITMENT TO HEALTH OVERVIEW The Vermont Global Commitment to Health Medicaid Section 1115(a) Demonstration was originally approved on September 27, 2005, and implemented on October 1, 2005. The Global Commitment to Health Section 1115(a) Demonstration is designed to use a multi -disciplinary approach to comprehensive Medicaid reform, including the basic principles of public health, the fundamentals of effective administration of a Medicaid managed care delivery system, public - private partnership, and program flexibility. As of January 1, 2017, Vermont and CMS extended the Global Commitment to Health Demonstration to further promote delivery system and payment reform to meet the goals of the State working with the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services, and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI). Consistent with Medicare's payment reform efforts the Demonstrations allow for alignment across public payers. Specifically, Vermont expects to demonstrate its ability to achieve universal access to health care, cost containment, and improved quality of care. Since 2005, the Global Commitment to Health Demonstration has reduced Vermont's uninsured rate from 11.4 percent in 2005 to approximately 2.7 percent in 2015 through expansion of eligibility and other A ffordable Care Act reforms. The Demonstration has also enabled Vermont to address and eliminate bias toward institutional care and of fer cost -effective, community -based services. For example, the proportion of Choices for Care participants served in the community has passed fifty percent and continues to increase. In addition, Vermont no longer has a waiting list for individuals in th e Highest and High Need Groups under the Choices for Care component of the Demonstration. Due to the expansion of eligibility under the Vermont State Plan, pursuant to the Affordable Care Act, expansion of eligibility is no longer the primary focus of the Demonstration. However, the Demonstration continues to promote delivery system reform and cost -effective , community - based services as an alternative to institutional care. The State's goal in implementing the Demonstration is to improve the health status o f all Vermonters by: o Promoting delivery system reform through value -based payment models and alignment across public payers; o Increasing access to affordable and high- quality health care by assisting lower -income individuals who can qualify for private ins urance through the Marketplace; o Improving access to primary care; o Improving the health care delivery for individuals with chronic care needs; and o Allowing beneficiaries a choice in long- term services and supports and providing an array of home and communit y-based (HCBS) alternatives recognized to be more cost- effective than institutional based supports. Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 98 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 The State employs four major elements in achieving the above goals: 1. Program Flexibility : Vermont has the flexibility to invest in certain specified alternative services and programs designed to achieve the Demonstration's objectives (including the Marketplace subsidy program). 2. Managed Care Delivery System : Under the Demonstration, the Agency for Human Services (AHS) executes an annual agreement with t he Department of Vermont Health Access (DVHA), which delivers services through a managed care -like model, subject to the requirements that would be applicable to a non- risk pre -paid inpatient health plan (PIHP) as defined by the Special Terms and Conditions (STCs). 3. Removal of Institutional Bias : Under the Demonstration, Vermont provide s a choice of settings for delivery of services and supports to older adults, people with se vere and persistent mental illness, people with physical disabilities, people with developmental disabilities, and people with traumatic brain injuries who meet program eligibility and level of care requirements. 4. Delivery System Reform : Under the Demonstration, Vermont supports systemic delivery reform efforts using the payment flexibility provided through the Demonstration to create alignment across public and private payers. The initial Global Commitment to Health and Choices for Car e Demonstrations were approved in September of 2005 and became effective October 1, 2005. The Global Commitment to Health Demonstration was extended for three (3) years, effective January 1, 2011, and again for three (3) years, effective October 2, 2013. The Choices for Care Demonstration was extended for five (5) years , effective October 1, 2010, and became part of the Global Commitment to Health Demonstration in January 2015. The following amendments have been made to the Global Commitment to Health Demo nstration: o 2007: A component of the Catamount Health program was added, enabling the State to provide a premium subsidy to Vermonters who had been without health insurance coverage for a year or more, have income at or below 200 percent of the FPL, and who do not have access to cost -effective employer -sponsored insurance, as determined by the state. o 2009: The State extended Catamount Health coverage to Vermonters at or below 300 percent of the FPL. o 2011: The State included a palliative care program for children who are at or below 300 percent of the FPL and have been diagnosed with life -limiting illness that would preclude them from reaching adulthood. This program allows children to receive curative and palliative care services such as expressive therap y, care coordination, family training and respite for caregivers. o 2012: CMS provided authority for the State to eliminate the $75 inpatient admission co- pay and to implement nominal co- payments for the Vermont Health Access Plan (VHAP) as articulated in th e Medicaid state plan. o 2013: CMS approved the extension of the Global Commitment to Health Demonstration , which included sun-setting the authorities for most of the Expansion Populations, including Catamount Health coverage, because these populations would be eligible for Marketplace coverage beginning January 1, 2014. The extension also Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 99 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 added the New Adult Group under the State Plan to the population affected by the Demonstration effective January 1, 2014. Finally, the extension also included premium subsidies for individuals enrolled in a qualified health plan whose income is at or below 300 percent of the FPL. o 2015: In January 2015, the Global Commitment to Health Demonstration was amended to include authority for the former Choices for Care Demonstration. In addition, the State received section 1115 authority to provide full Medicaid State Plan benefits to pregnant women who are determined presumptively eligible. A. Demonstration Goals The State's high -level goal for all health reforms is to create an integrated health system able to achieve the Institute of Medicine's \"Triple Aim\" goals of improving patient experience of care, improving the health of populations, and reducing per capita cost. 5 This is supported in the Global Commitment to He alth Demonstration through supporting innovative delivery system reforms, including Medicaid Accountable Care Organizations (ACO) and the development of progressive in- home and community- based services and supports that are cost -effective and support persons who have long- term care service and support needs, and complex medical, mental health and/or substance use disorder treatment needs. Overarching Demonstration goals are described below: o To increase access to care: All enrollees must have access to com prehensive care, including financial, geographic, physical, and communicative access. This means having health insurance, appropriate providers, timely access to services, culturally sensitive services, and the opportunity for second opinions as needed. o To contain health care cost : Cost -effectiveness takes into consideration all costs associated with providing programs, services, and interventions. It is measurable at the category -of-service, individual enrollee, aid category, and aggregate program levels. o To improve the quality of care : Quality refers to the degree to which programs/services and activities increase the likelihood of desired outcomes. The six domains necessary for assuring quality health care identified by the Institute of Medicine (IOM, 2001) are: Effectiveness : Effective health care provides evidence- based services to all who can benefit, refraining from providing services that are not of benefit. Efficiency : Efficient health care focuses on avoiding waste, including waste of equipment, supplies, ideas, and energy. Equity : Equal health care provides care without variation in quality due to gender, ethnicity, geographic location, or socioeconomic status. Patient Centeredness : Patient- centered care emphasizes a partnership between provider and consumer. Safety : Safe health care avoids injuries to consumers from care that is intended 5 Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century.

Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 100 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 to help. Timeliness : Timely health care involves obtaining needed care and minimizing unnecessary delays in receiving care. o To eliminate institutional bias: By allowing specialized program participants choices in where they receive long -term services and supports and by offering a cost -effective array of in -home and community services for older adults, people with se vere and persistent mental illness, p eople with developmental disabilities and people with traumatic brain injuries who meet program eligibility and level of care requirements. B. Public Managed Care Delivery System, Investments and All -Payer Model Vermont operates the Demonstration using a managed care -like model that complies with federal regulations at 42 CFR P art 438 that would be applicable to a non- risk PIHP, including beneficiary rights and protections such as independent beneficiary support s ystems and formal grievance and appeal procedures. In addition to the Demonstration, beginning in 2018, the State has also begun implementation of the Vermont All- Payer Accountable Care Organization (ACO) Model ( All-Payer Model) under section 1115A of the Social Security Act through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI). The All -Payer Model and the Global Commitment to Health Medicaid Demonstration are expected to complement each other to support systemic delivery reform efforts. Using the payment flexibility provided through the Demonstration and the Model , alignment across public and private payers is expected. A brief description of the Medicaid public managed care -like model and current reform efforts is provided below. Public Managed Care -Like Model The Agency of Human Services (AHS), as Vermont's Single State Medicaid Agency, is responsible for oversight of the managed care -like Medicaid delivery system. The Department of Vermont Health Access (DVHA) operates the Medicaid program as if it were a Managed Care Organization in accordance with federal managed care regulations. Program requirements and responsibilities are delineated in an inter -governmental agreement (IGA) between AHS and DVHA. DVHA also has sub -agreements with the other State entities that provide specialty care for Global Commitment (GC) enrollees (e.g., mental health services, developmental disability services, and specialized child and family services). As such, since the inception of the GC Dem onstration, DVHA and its IGA partners have modified operations to meet Medicaid managed care requirements, including requirements related to network adequacy, access to care, beneficiary information, grievances, quality assurance, and quality improvement. Per the External Quality Review Organization's annual findings, DVHA and its IGA partners have achieved exemplary compliance rates in meeting Medicaid managed care requirements. Departments of Vermont State government that participate in the provision of covered services to enrollees under the Demonstration are outlined, in brief, below. Department of Verm ont Health Access (DVHA): DVHA, which operates the Medicaid program as if it were a public MCO under Global Commit ment Demonstration, has a threefold missio n: Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 101 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 To assist beneficiaries in accessing clinically appropriate health servi ces; To admini ster Verm nd ef fectivel y; and To collaborate with other health care system entities in bringing evidence-based practi ces to Verm ont Medicaid beneficiaries. Department of Ment al Health (DMH): The miss ion of DMH is to promote and improve the mental health of Vermont ers and to provi de Vermo nters with access to effective preve ntion, early interv ention, and mental health treatment and supports as needed to live, work, learn, and participate fully in their communities. DMH consists of two programm atic divisions: Adult Mental Health Servi ces Divi sion and the Child, Adolescent, and Family Mental Health Servi ces Division. DMH has prim ary responsibil ity for overse eing the quality of psychiatric and mental health care provide d for two of Vermo nt's Special H ealth Needs populations defined under the Global Co mmitment Demonstration, including persons with a severe and persis tent mental illness and children who are experi encing a severe emotional disturbance. Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independe nt Living (DAIL ): DAIL assists older Vermo nters and people with dis abilities to live as independently as possible. It provi des supp ort to families of children with disabilities to help maintain them in their home. It helps adults with disabil ities find and maintain meaningful employme nt, and it ensures quality of care and life for individuals receiving health care and/or long-term care servi ces from licensed or certified health care providers. DAIL also protects vulnerable a dults from abuse, neglect, and exp loitation and provides public guardianship to elders and people with devel opmental disabilities. DAIL operates the several specialized Medicaid programs under the Demonstration, including Choi ces for Care, Developmental Disability Services and Traumatic Brain Injury Services. Verm ont Dep artment of Health (VDH): VDH 's goal is to have the nation's premier s ystem of public health, enabling Verm onters to lead healthy lives in healthy communi ties. VDH lea ds the state and communities in the deve lopment of system atic approaches to health prom otion, safety, and disease preventi on. VDH continuously asses ses, vigorously purs ues, and documents measurable improve ments to the health and safety of Vermo nt's population. VDH w ill succeed through excellence in individual achievement, organizational competence, and teamwork within and outside of VDH. VDH's division of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs supports the innovated Medicaid Health Home program for Medication- Assisted Opioid Treatment in partnerships with DVHA, as well as extensive outpatient and residential treatment and recovery support for alc ohol and other drugs use disorders. Department for Children and Families (DCF): DCF prom otes the social, emotional, phys ical, and economic well-being of Vermont's children and familie s. It achieves this mission by providi ng Vermont ers with protective, devel opmental, therapeutic, proba tion, economic, and other support services. To this end, DCF works in statewide partnership with familie s, schools, businesses, communi ty leaders, and service provide rs. DCF offers specialized Medicaid services to children and families at risk of or experiencing trauma and early childhood intervention for families with children from birth to age six with developmental needs. Agency of Education (AOE ): The AOE is responsible for overseeing coverage and reimbursement under the School -Based Health program. The Special Education Medicaid Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 102 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 School -Based Health Services Program is used by the State to support health- related services provided to special education students who are enrolled in Medicaid and receive eligible services in accordance with their individualized education plans (IEPs). The AOE is established as an \"Organized Delivery System\" under Medicaid and is responsible for the program adherence to all State and Federal Medicaid and Education laws and regulations. Delivery System Investments Under the public managed care -like model, the Demonstration provides the State with flexibility to invest in health care innovations that: a. Reduce the rate of uninsured and/or underinsured in Vermont; b. Increase the access to quality health care by uninsured, underinsured, and Medicaid beneficiaries; c. Provide public health approaches and other innovative programs to improve the health outcomes, health status and quality of life for uninsured, underinsured and Medicaid - eligible individuals in Vermont; and d. Encourage the formation and maintenance of public -private partnerships in health care, including initiatives to support and improve the health care delivery system and promote transformation to value -based and integrated models of care. In addition, CMS has provided the State with one -time spending authority to support Accountable Care Organizations and Medicaid community providers in delivery syst em reform through activities such as, but not limited to: Infrastructure improvement; Quality and heath improvement information development and dissemination; Community -related population health projects; Socio -economic risk assessment and mitigation; and Provider integration to build integration across physical health, mental health substance use disorder treatment and long- term services and supports. Investment awards are expected to give preference to activities that promote collaboration, build c apacity across the care continuum, consider social determinates of health, and promote an integrated health care system consistent with the framework set forth in the Vermont All-Payer Accountable Care Organization Model Agreement (All-Payer Model Agreemen t) and the Global Commitment Demonstration. Specifically, the State would like to encourage ACO - based , provider -led reform that features (a) collaboration between providers, (b) reimbursement models that move away from Fee -For-Service payment, and (c) rigo rous quality measurement that aligns with the All- Payer Model quality framework. Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 103 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 All-Payer Model Alignment The All -Payer Model A greement between the State and the Federal government was signed by the Green Mountain Care Board on October 26, 2016 and signed by the Governor and the Secretary of Human Services on October 27, 2016. The All -Payer Model A greement includes a target for a sustainable rate of growth for health care spending in Vermont ac ross Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial payers, and would build on past programs like Vermont's Medicaid and commercial s hared s avings programs . The All -Payer Model will include, beginning in 2019, the Vermont Medicare ACO I nitiative, which will focus on a set of health care services roughly equivalent to Medicare Parts A and B ( e.g., hospital and physician services) , and will include design elements similar to the Next Generation ACO Model, including quality and performance measurement , benefit enhancement s, and certain alternative payment mechanisms . The State will provide a plan in 2019 for integrating any institutional long- term services and supports in the total cost of care in the next Demonstration period. The All -Payer Model Agreement and Global Commitment Medicaid Demonstration are complementary frameworks that support Vermont's health care reform efforts. Each agreement provides federal support to further Vermont's strategic goal of creating an integrate d health care system, including increased alignment across payers and providers. C. Eligibility, Benefits and Cost Sharing Eligibility under the Demonstration includes the following Medicaid and Demonstration groups: Population 1: Mandatory State Plan populations (except for the new adult group). This group receives benefits as described in the Medicaid State Plan and may receive HCBS benefits described in the STCs if they meet additional program eligibility standards. Population 2: Optional State Plan populations. This group receives benefits as described in the Medicaid State Plan and may receive HCBS benefits described in the STCs if they meet additional program eligibility standards. Population 3: Affordable Care Act new adult group. This group receives benefits as described in the Medicaid State Plan and may receive HCBS benefits described in the STCs if they meet additional program eligibility standards. Population 4: Individuals receiving home and community- based waiver (HCBW) -like services who meet t he clinical standard in the Choices for Care program for the Highest Need Group. This group receives benefits as described in the Medicaid State Plan and Choices for Care program benefits as described in the STCs. Population 5: Individuals receiving HCBW -like services who met the clinical standard in the Choices for Care program for the High Need Group. This group receives benefits as described in the Medicaid State Plan and Choices for Care program benefits as described in the STCs. Population 6: Individuals who are not otherwise eligible under the Medicaid State Plan and who would not have been eligible had the state elected eligibility under 42 CFR 435.217, but are at Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 104 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 risk for institutionalization and need home and community- based services. This group re ceives a limited HCBW -like service benefit including Adult Day Services, Case Management, and Homemaker S ervices in the Choices for Care program as outlined in the (STCs). Population 7: Medicare beneficiaries who are 65 years or older or have a disability with income at or below 150 percent of the FPL, who may be enrolled in the Medicare Savings Program (MSP) but are not otherwise eligible for full benefits. This group receives a limited pharmacy benefit including Medicaid prescriptions, eyeglasses and related eye exams; MSP beneficiaries also receive benefits as described in the Title XIX state plan. Population 8: Medicare beneficiaries who are 65 years or older or have a disability with income above 150 percent and up to and including 225 percent of the FP L, who may be enrolled in the MSP, but are not otherwise eligible for full benefits. This group receives a limited pharmacy benefit including maintenance drugs; MSP beneficiaries also receive benefits as described in the Title XIX state plan. All covered s ervices may be subject to review and prior approval by DVHA and/or its partner departments in the Agency of Human Services, based on medical appropriateness. A complete listing of covered services and limitations are contained in the Vermont approved Title XIX State Plan, Vermont statutes, regulations, and policies and procedures. Premiums and cost -sharing for populations 1, 2, and 3 must follow Medicaid requirements that are set forth in statute, regulation and policy. Standard Medicaid exemptions from cos t-sharing set forth in 42 CFR 447(b) applies to the Demonstration. The state must not apply co -payment requirements to excluded populations (children under age 21, pregnant women or individuals in long- term care facilities) or for excluded services/supplie s (e.g., family planning). Vermont charges premiums for children through age 18 with income above 195 percent of the FPL through 312 percent of the FPL. Premium populations are outlined in Exhibit 1 below.

VPharm2; VPharm3 D. Specialized Programs Under the GC Demonstration, Vermont is authorized to provide an array of cost -effective in - home and community services. Providers of these services must meet designation, certification and/or additional licensing requirements to be approved by the State to serve the most vulnerable of Vermont's citizens. These specialized programs are designed to support a unique group of beneficiaries ; each is outlined below. o Choices for Care : long- term services and supports for persons with disabilities and older Vermonters. The Demonstration authorizes HCBS waiver -like and institutional services such as: nursing facility; enhanced residential care; personal care; homemaker services; companion care; case management; adult day services; and adult family care. o Developmental Disability Services : provides long -term services and supports for persons with intellectual disabilities. The Demonstration authorizes HCBS waiver -like services, including service coordination, residential habilitation, day habilitation, supported employment, crisis services, clinical intervention, respite and self -directed care. o Traumatic Brain Injury Services : provides recovery- oriented and long- term services and supports for persons with a traumatic brain injury. The Demonstration authorizes HCBS waiver -like services including crisis/support services, psychological and counseling supports, case management, community supports, habilitation, r espite care, supported employment, environmental and assistive technology and self -directed care. o Enhanced Family Treatment : provides intensive in- home and community treatment services for children who are experiencing a severe emotional disturbance and th eir families. The Demonstration authorizes HCBS waiver -like services including service coordination, flexible support, skilled therapy services, environmental safety devices, counseling, residential treatment, respite, supported employment, and crisis and community supports. o Community Rehabilitation and Treatment Program : provides recovery oriented, in- home and community treatment services for adults who have a severe and persistent mental illness. The Demonstration authorizes HCBS waiver -like services incl uding service coordination, flexible support, skilled therapy services, environmental safety devices, counseling, residential treatment, respite, supported employment, and crisis and community supports. Through a special provision as a Designated State He alth Program, Community Rehabilitation and Treatment benefits can be extended to individuals with severe and persistent mental illness with incomes between 133 and up to and including 185 percent Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 106 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 of the federal poverty level, under the Demonstration. In addition, the Demonstration authorizes the: o Children's Palliative Care Program : provides care coordination, respite care, expressive therapies, family training, and bereavement counseling for children under the age of 21 years in populations 1, 2, and 3 w ho have been diagnosed with a life - limiting illness that is expected to be terminal before adulthood. o Adult Hospice Program : allows for hospice services to be delivered concurrently with curative therapy to adults in populations 1, 2, and 3. Lastly, as a Designated State Health Program, the Demonstration allows: o Marketplace Subsidies : The State offer subsidies for premiums for individuals with incomes at or below 300 percent of the federal poverty level who are purchasing health care coverage from a Quali fied Health plan in Marketplace. The program is known as Vermont Premium Assistance (VPA) as part of the state -based health benefits exchange. E. Special Considerations for Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Treatment Since its inception, Vermont's Demonstration has included payment flexibilities to support cost - effective alternatives to traditional Medicaid State Plan benefits. The State has used this authority to provide a continuum of treatment programs for persons who need inpatient psychiatric treatment, detoxification and/or residential treatment for substance use disorder. In several cases services are rendered by providers whose bed capacity is over 16 beds. Thus, these programs are considered Institutions for Mental Disease (IMD) fa cilities. CMS is continuing time -limited expenditure authority for services in several facilities that meet the definition of an IMD pursuant to an evaluation of their role and effectiveness in Vermont's Medicaid Demonstration. CMS is asking the State to perform an evaluation of its IMD expenditure authority in the context of system -wide service, payment, and delivery system reforms and the State's extensive investments in cost effective community -based alternatives to institutional care. The evaluation will help inform broader policy discussions about Medicaid funding for IMD and community- based services. In addition to the study of IMD -related services, the State is exploring opportunities and options for delivery system reforms that will promote a co ntinuum of Substance Use Disorder Treatment Services and the State's alignment with CMS's Substance Use Disorder demonstration opportunities SMD letter. The State will include measures in the Demonstration evaluation design that will serve as baseline met rics for monitoring the full continuum of Substance Use Disorder Treatment services in the future. Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 107 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 II. EVALUATION AND PROCUREMENT STRATEGY The evaluation strategy for the Global Commit ment Demonstration is designed to meas ure the degree to which its purposes, aims, goals, and objectives have been achieved. The evaluation is desig ned to not only address the long-term impa ct, but also to provi de intermedi ate and sh ort- term data on its performance through rapid cycle assessments. In addition to assessing its overall impact , the evaluation exami nes the specific effects of the innova tive changes made possible because of the Demonstration. Thus, the plan utilizes both performa nce meas urem ent results (providi ng more real-time data focused on whether a program is achiev ing measurable objectives) and more rigorous program evaluat ion findings that analyzes findings against national benchmarks, changes over time and attempts to isolate key variables influencing outcomes. To ensure that the new aspects of the Demonstration extension are imple mented as intended a nd achieve the related goals/obj ectives and desired out comes, this evaluat ion pl an includes full alignment with the State's Comprehensive Quality Strategy, Rapid Cycle Assessment and Summ ative evaluation desig ns. It will employ qualita tive and quanti tative methods to collect and analyze data. This evalu ation will not focus on out comes exclusivel y, but is inter ested in capturing any evide nce that the Demonstration supports: increased access to care; improved quality of care; cost containment; and stable in- home and community alternatives to institutional care. A. Comprehensive Quality Strategy and Rapid Cycle Assessment Vermont has a Comprehensive Quality Strategy (CQS) that integrates all aspects of quality improvement programs, processes, and requirements across the State's Medicaid program. The CQS is intended to serve as a blueprint or road map for Vermont and its Me dicaid managed care- like operations in assessing the quality of care that beneficiaries receive, as well as for setting forth measurable goals and targets for improvement . As approved by CMS, the CQS is the vehicle for demonstrating Vermont's compliance with the new HCBS regulations (comparable to 'transition plans ' in other states). The CQS meets all requirements of 42 CFR 438 and includes LTSS and HCBS quality components. Key elements addressed in the responsibilities; and evaluation; and performance improvement accountability. The Demonstration's evaluation will align with the goals, measures and monitoring activities outlined in the AHS CQS . AHS will regularly monitor the Demonstration on the key outcome meas ures and performa nce targe ts and make changes as appropriate (obtaining CMS or legisla tive approval where needed). The CQS is reviewed and updated as needed, but no less than once every three years. The State must also routinely evaluate policy changes and new initiatives to rapidly assess effectiveness, promote continuous improvement and to identify success and barr iers without delay. The State will retain responsibility for conducting rapid cycle assessments for any new Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 108 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 payment and service delivery and/or payment reform implemented or supported by the Demonstration (e.g., Next Generation Medicaid ACO) as well as an y new Delivery System Reform Investments. Resul ts from the rapid cycle assessments w ill directly influence decisio n making by giving AHS i nsigh ts into any potential shortcomings, oversigh ts and successes . Documenting the development of new initiatives a nd their operational impact p rovide s an understanding of the reasons for successful or unsuccess ful performan ce, provide s direct ion in shaping program modifications a nd improvement, and provide s information about whether evaluation findings can be general ized. This rapid analysis will be based on grantee reporting, key inform ant information from the AHS, as well as community leaders, admini strators, physician leaders, and others directly responsibl e for, or knowledgeable about, the new initiative or investment. As appropriate, fiscal analysis will be conducted to analyze expenditure information. Reports will be used to provide program staff with specific details for the month, quarter, or year, and/or provide direction in shaping modifications that may be required to support more effective investments. This type of rapid cycle approach blurs some of the classic differentiation between formative and summative evaluation approaches. The selection of similar evaluation methods for diff erent purposes will allow the State and providers to focus on adjusting the process aspects of an innovation - while at the same time improving the impact of the innovation overall. It is important to note that the rigor of the evaluation should not be sa crificed for the sake of speed. To do so, advanced statistical methods to measure effectiveness should be used, including the appropriate selection of comparison groups whenever possible. In practice, this commitment to alignment of performance oversight w ill create a feedback loop across eval uation activities, r apid cycle assessment reports a nd summative evaluation findings. This process of regul arly measuring, monitoring, and ma king changes should result in continuous performance improve ment in terms of achievi ng its performa nce targets and intended outcomes. B. Summative Evaluation In addition to the activities describ ed above, s umm ative evalu ation techniques will be used to measure how the Demonstration has changed or improved the health and well-being of the GC population. The summa tive eval uation will address each of the hypotheses identified in Section III A. Additionally, DVHA and its IGA partners are required to submit a nnual performance measurement data to AHS. These metrics w ill be used to help define and measure progr ess toward the Demonstration 's ability to increase access to care; improve qual ity of care (including outcomes and consumer satisfaction); contain the cost of care ; and support stable in- home and community alternatives to institutional care for enrollees. The required performa nce measu res include HEDIS\u00ae (see S ection III D). DVHA w ill also be required to report enroll ee experience based on the Consumer Assessment of Healthc are Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 109 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 Providers and Systems (CAHPS) or CAHPS-like model, with the potential for findings to be suppl ement ed by targeted surveys for special needs populations. Specifically, the State is exploring the use of CAHPS -Home and Community -Based Services (HCBS) module for participants in several of its specialized programs. Items under consideration for use are outlined in Exhibit 2 on the following page. Exhibit 2: Potential CAHPS -HCBS Performance Measures Potential CAHPS -HCBS M easures Performance Area Metric Quality of Care Percent of enrollees who rate the help they get from staff as very good or excellent Health Percent of enrollees who rate their overall health as good, very good or excellent Courtesy and Respect Percent of enrollees who report that in the last 3 months, staff usually or always treat them with courtesy and respect Case Manager Percent of enrollees who rate the help they get from their case manager as very good or excellent Choice and Cont rol Percentage of people who report that in the last 3 months, their service plan included most or all of things that were important to them Employment Percent of enrollees who report that in the last 3 months, they usually or always could do things in the community that they liked, when they wanted In addition, inpatient and outpatient utilization, cost, a nd quality indicators for GC enrollees before and after their enrollment i n specialized programs and Demonstration initiatives w ill be analyz ed and compared to be nchmarks and/or targets to assess the attainment of these goals. This analysis will determine whether statistic ally significant differences exist year to year in access to care; improved qual ity of care; cost containment; and stable in -home and community alternatives to institutional care. Annual data will be tracked and trended over time (when available). Summative evaluation techniques will also be applied to study the impact and effectiveness of IMD services in the Vermont system of care for persons who are experiencing a psychiatric emergency and/or who have substance use disorder treatment needs. C. Procurement Strategy and Evaluator Qualifications Procurement for an evaluation contractor to assist the State in executing its Demonstration Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 110 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 evaluation plan was pursuant to the State of Vermont Agency of Administration Bulletin 3.5 processes found here . The State retains responsibility for rapid cycle assessment reports, monitoring delivery system and other investments and overall Demonstration performance monitoring. Global Commitment to Health HEDIS\u00ae measures are independently validated by the State's External Quality Review Organization (EQRO). To mitigate any potential conflict of interest, the evaluation contractor is responsible for secondary analysis of the State's findings, benchmarking pe rformance to national standards, evaluating changes over time, isolating key variables and interpreting results. As part of the focused IMD evaluation, the evaluator is responsible for final measure selection, identifying, if viable , other State systems th at may serve as comparisons, conducting all data analysis, measuring change over time and developing sensitivity models as necessary to address study questions. The State anticipates issued one procurement for all summative evaluation activities and the production of required CMS reports. Bidders were given the option of working with a subcontractor on the IMD and/or other components of the design. The successful bidder demonstrated, at a minimum, the following qualifications: The extent to which the eva luator can meet State RFP minimum requirements; The extent to which the evaluator has sufficient capacity to conduct the proposed evaluation, in terms of technical experience and the size/scale of the evaluation; The evaluator's prior experience with similar evaluations; Past references; and Value, e.g., the assessment of an evaluator's capacity to conduct the proposed evaluation with their cost proposal, with consideration given to those that offer higher quality at a lower cost. D. Evaluation Budget and T imeline The State's evaluation budget and timelines are tentative pending data sharing schedules established with the evaluation contractor. The budget may be modified if terms of the current Demonstration agreement are amended during the project period. AHS will report on progress and any known challenges to the evaluation budget, timelines and implementation in its quarterly and annual Demonstration reports to CMS. Appendix 1 provides an overview of the AHS proposed evaluation budget. Outlined below and on the following pages are the expected timelines and major evaluation related milestones.

EVALUATION DESIGN AND METHODS In updating its existing Medicaid Demonstration evaluation strategy as reflected in this document, the State has refined overarching Demonstration hypotheses and identified study populations and levels of stratification for specialized programs and projects. The design identifies additional data sources related to IMD study, reviews general methods and data analytics , and defines on- going reporting requirements for the term of the Demonstration. However, final techniques, tec hnical specifications and study groups will be determined following engagement of the independent evaluator. A. Hypothesis The State has identified the following overarching hypotheses for the Demonstration. The Demonstration will result in improved acce ss to care; The Demonstration will result in improved quality of care; Value- based payment models will improve access to care; Improved access to preventive care will result in lower overall costs for the health care delivery system; Improved access to primary care will result in improved health outcomes; Enhanced care coordination will improve timely access to needed care; The Demonstration will result in increased community integration; and The Demonstration will maintain or reduce spending in comparis on to what would have been spent absent the Demonstration; . B. Study Populations The evaluation will study the impact of the Demonstration on all enrollees e.g., total Medicaid population (enrollees participating in specialized programs (e.g., ID/DD, CFC, C RT, TBI, ACO Attributed), enrollees participating in non- specialized programs) as well as provide stratification for various hypothesis and key measures by specialized program participants. In addition, focused analysis will address: o The impact of M arket place subsidies for Qualified Health Plans on continuity of coverage; if feasible based on sample size, staff and budget considerations, the State will stratify impact by income level; o Access to care for children in families who are required to make premi um payments; if feasible based on sample size, staff and budget considerations the State will stratify impact by income level; o Access, cost and quality for substance use disorder and psychiatric IMD services (See Section IV for more detailed description). An overview of each hypothesis, the research questions and the expected study populations is provided in Exhibit 3 on the fol lowing page.

Data Collection and Assurances Vermont's public managed care- like model is managed by AHS through delegation to DVHA. Encounter, claims and cost data is available through the MMIS and will be made available to evaluators as needed for purpose of evaluation. Existing agreements with depa rtments require that all IGA partners under the Demonstration make data available to support evaluations and performance monitoring efforts. AHS does not anticipate problems with data collection and reporting. AHS will use a variety of sources and methods to test the above hypo theses, including beneficiary surveys and provide r claims data. AHS staff and independent evaluators will also analyze data from third-party sources, such as the U.S. Census Bureau and, if consistent with the terms of the All-Payer Model Agreement, Medicare claims data through the All -Payer Model . Vermo nt data sources used to evaluate perform ance against Demonstration goals will include: o Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) en counter and utilization data from claims o State Medicaid inform ation system files that include eligibility and enroll ment data o VT Health Connect Prem ium Assistan ce (VPA) data files o Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems ( CAHPS) o DAIL Social Assistance Managem ent System (SAMS) o ADAP Substance Abuse Treatment Information System (SATIS) o DMH Monthly Service Reports (MSR) o VT H ealth Care Q uality Rep orts prepared by the state's E xternal Q uality Review Organi zation o Quar terly Ombudsman Repo rts o VT De partment of Financial Regulation Household Health Insur ance Surveys o VT Department of Labor Employment (DOL) o VT Department of Health, Healthy Vermonters 2020 Population Health Outcomes o VT Department of Health, Substance Abuse Treatment Information System (SATIS) o Vermont Health Care Uniform Reporting and Evaluation System (VHCURES) To limit administrative burden on providers, consumers and staff and to eliminate duplicate evaluation efforts, this evaluation will coordinate and compile measures from existing evaluation Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 119 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 and performance monitoring efforts aimed at studying the impact of various health care initiatives under the Demonstration. A preliminary inventory of existing and planned evaluation and performance monitoring projects are provided in Exhibit 4 below. Exhibit 4: Existing and Planned Evaluation and Monitoring Projects Existing or Planned VT Evaluation Projects All-Payer Model Vermont Health Care Innovation Project Medicaid Health Home - Medication -Assisted Opioid Treatment AHS Performance Monitoring Projects Global Commitment to Health Comprehensive Quality Measures, including HEDIS\u00ae AHS Results Based Accountability Scorecards Healthy Vermonters 2020 National Core Indicators Project, Developmental Disability, Aging and Other Disability Programs Medicaid ACO Quality Measures Blueprint for Health Multi -Payer Delivery Reform Initiative D. Performance Measures, Data Source, Frequency and Sampling Methods Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 120 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 This Evaluation Plan incorporates the use of performan ce measures based on the following criteria: 1) evidenced based; 2) potential for improvem ent; 3) prevalence or incidence; 4) substantial impact on health status and/or health outcomes; 5) alignment with national measures; and 6) to the extent possibl e, adaptable measures across various practice settings. The Demonstration uses HEDIS\u00ae and AHS Results Based Accountability Scorecards for most of t he targeted perform ance meas ures. Additionally, the evaluation will align measures and priorities with those collected as part of the All -Payer Model Agreement Appendix 1 found here on page 36, which includes alignment with the development of the Global Commitment to Health Medicaid ACO. Using these measures, AHS will determine whether efforts to improve access (e.g., primary care visits, ED visits, and provi ders accepting Medicaid), enhance quality (e.g., follow -up after hospitalization, medication management for those with asthma, and patient experience of care), contain costs (e.g., budget neutrality, inpatient, and ED) and improve communi ty integration were achieved. Performance meas ures specific to specialized programs and in -home and community services w ill also be included, such as ability of participants to live l onger in their comm unities and exper ience an improve d quality of life, choice and control. The perform ance measures give trend informat ion, which provi des guidance in desig ning focused interventions for quality improve ment. Reported HEDIS rates also can be benchmarked to NCQA Medicaid HEDIS means and percentile s, and compared to results from other states. Current performance targets and national benchmarks are identified in the States Comprehensive Quality Strategy found here . One other impor tant source of inform ation to initiate and guide improve ment efforts is the beneficiary. The most widely used instrument for collec ting reports and ratings of health care servi ces from the beneficiary's pers pective is the CAHPS. CAH PS survey allo ws entities to: 1) analyze performan ce compared to ks; 2) identify changes or trends in performa nce; and/or 3) consider other indicators of performa nce. Verm ont will combine CAHPS data with inform ation collected throug h peri odic surveys of targeted groups of Demonstration enrolle es. Demonstration objectives and performance meas ures for each hypothesis a re present ed in Exhibits 5 through 10 starting on page 119. All Exhibits also address data collection methods for each measure, alignment with other State or National measures, sampling methodology, source of data, and frequency of measurement. Three hypotheses (listed below) will be measured through evaluation efforts associated with the Blue print for Health Multi -Payer Advance Primary Care Practice initiative: Improved access to primary care will result in positive health outcomes; Enhanced care coordination will promote timely access to needed care; and Improved access to primary care wil l result in overall lower cost for the health care delivery system. The Blueprint for Health is a state -led, multi- payer program dedicated to achieving well - coordinated and seamless health services, with an emphasis on prevention and wellness. As such, the Blueprint employs several different approaches to incentivizing delivery system reform and Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 121 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 increased quality and performance through payment reform. The foundation of the Blueprint model is a Multi- Payer Advanced Primary Care Practice (MAPCP) pro gram. Participation is optional for providers, but mandatory for Vermont's commercial payers (with the exception of self-insured plans) and Medicaid. Current participating payers in the Blueprint for Health include Medicaid, Medicare, Blue Cross Blue Shi eld of Vermont, MPV and CIGNA. As such, some measures reflect population health outcomes across payers and are not specifically stratified for Medicaid enrollees. As feasible within available resources, Blueprint performance and evaluation findings may inc lude sub- analysis relative to Medicaid -only participants.

METHODS Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 131 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 Both qualitative and quantitative methods will be used to address the research questions. Quali tative designs will be used to better understand the process of Demonstration implem entation, and w ill include the use of purposeful sampling, interviews, and inductive analysis to discover patterns, themes, and interrelatio nships. Qualitative methods will be employed for new delivery system reforms supported with Demonstration investment funds as a part of a formative study where applicable. Quant itative methods will be used to better understand the im pact of Demonstration implementation (i.e., the relationship that Demonstration participation has on: acc ess to care; quality of care; cost containment; and stable in -home and community alternatives to institutional care) an d will include the use of probability sampling, descripti ve/inferential statistics, and deductive analysis to generat e relationshi ps between varia bles that can be generalized to the broader Medicaid population. Methodological considerations are provided below. ISOLATION FROM OTHER INITIATIVES In general, external fact ors are not expec ted to signi ficantly affect the assessme nt of hypot heses presen ted in this evaluati on pla n. Over the past several years the State sought to align its health care reforms across all populations and payers. The final Medicaid Demonstration extension and All-Payer Model were designed to create a seamless system. H owever, where market conditions and other contextual fa ctors (e.g., provider or geographical differences) c ould have an impact, AHS and its evaluators w ill dev elop approaches to quantify and/or isolate the impact of such factors. The Demonstration supports a comprehensive approach across settings. Based on staff, budget and data considerations, the State will explore the feasibility of comparing outcomes for members who may be attributed to a specific initiative with those who are not involved in the initiative. GENERALIZABILITY OF RESULTS Vermont's small size, statewide model and AHS single state agency 'umbrella' structure supports rapid adoption of programs. This provides an ideal environment for testing innovations that can be brought to scale in other states on a county or statewide level. In several instances, Vermont's health care and long- term service and support programs have become models for other states (e.g., Blueprint for Health, Choices for Care, Self/Surroga te-directed care). It is expected that specific aspects of the Demonstration and its evaluation design will continue to support generalizability. DATA LIMITATIONS & MITIGATION Many participants in Vermont's specialized programs are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. The absence of Medicare claims data presents challenges for certain metrics such as total cost of care, rates of preventive screens, follow -up after hospital ization. Consistent with the terms of the All -Payer Model A greement , the AHS will seek access to Medicare data as part of its involvement in the All -Payer Model. Vermont has been engaged in health care and payment reform since the inception of the Demonst ration in 2005. In many cases, specialized programs no longer employ fee -for-service Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 132 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 claiming and encounter data may be stored in multiple legacy systems across AHS. In cases where programs have moved away from fee -for-service payment models, modified HEDI S\u00ae protocols will be used to assure data is complete and accurately adjusted when stratified for specialized populations. Two data sets available for benchmarking performance are the VDH Hospital Discharge data and VHCURES. These data warehouses provide valuable information on claims over time, however information is de -identified. The Blueprint for Health and the Department of Mental Health have employed various techniques to match data and examine population trends over time and by payer. The DMH techni que involves the use of probabilistic estimation. Probabilistic Population Estimation (PPE) is a statistical technique used by DMH that measures the number of people represented in data sets that do not share unique person identifiers. PPE reports how many people are represented in and across data sets without the need for identifiable protected health information. 14 These estimates are based on a comparison of the observed distribution of dates of birth in HIPAA -compliant \"limited data sets\" with the expec ted distribution of dates of birth. The validity and reliability of this procedure have been demonstrated by Banks and Pandiani (2001). 15 This approach is unobtrusive and it protects the personal privacy of individuals and the confidentiality of medical re cords because it does not depend on personally identifying information16. Through its analytics vendor Onpoint Health Data Blueprint to Health links clinical data to de - identified VHCURES claims data. Onpoint de -identifies the clinical data using the same algorithms to hash the identifiers as was used by insurers for the VHCURES data . Using this method the vendor is able to link records between the two de -identified datasets using the hashed, or encrypted, identifiers. F. DATA ANALYSIS The evaluation data analysis will consist of both exploratory and descri ptive str ategies and incorporate univaria te, bi-variate, and techniques. SAS software will be used to systema tically apply statistical and/or logical techniques to describ e, summarize, and compare data within the state and across time, and to prepare data, wherever possible i n a manner that permits comparison to results from other states applying the same methodology (e.g., HEDIS reports ). Descripti ve statistic s will be used to descr ibe the basic features of the data and what they depict, and to provi de simple summaries about the sample and the measures. Together with sim ple graphics analysi s, the descr iptive statistic s form the basis of quantitative analysis of data. They are also used to provide simple summaries about the participants and their outcomes. An 14 NASMHPD Research Institute, Inc.

Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 133 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 explora tory data analysis is used to compare many variables in the search for organized patterns. Data will be analyzed as rates, proportions, frequencies, meas ures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median, mode), and/or qualitatively analyz ed for themes. Whenever possible the evaluation will use longitudinal methods to measure change over time. As available, from other evaluation efforts related to the Demonstration (See Section III C), evaluators may employ secondary analysis to reexamine existing data to address Demonstration hypothesis or isolate Medicaid enrollees from the general population. Difference in Differences and Interrupted Time Series designs are proposed for various aspects of the design. Difference in differences methods will be used to c haracterize differences between groups when data exists before and after intervention for a group of individuals similar to participants (treatment group) that will not be receiving services/benefits (comparison group). It is anticipated that Accountable Care Organization (ACO) and Blueprint (BP) practice attribution will allow measurement in at least one time period before ACO/BP practice intervention and at least one time period after ACO/BP practice intervention. Appropriate measures associated with va lue based payments, primary care, and enhanced care coordination outlined in this document will be assessed relative to internal comparison groups when available. Anticipated data sources are also identified in aforementioned tables. When using these met hods, the evaluator is expected to consider and address various issues that might compromise the results. If necessary, alternative methods might be required. Time -series methods will be used to characterize differences over time for waiver participants or subpopulations when data for a measure of interest exists sequentially in time at successive equally spaced intervals. The length of the pre/post study periods is expected to be a minimum of 12 months. When employed, this method will look for trends a nd patterns in the data. Appropriate measures of access, cost, and quality outlined in this document will be compared to suitable benchmarks and assessed relative to a baseline to test the associated hypotheses. Anticipated data sources are also identifi ed in the aforementioned tables. It is anticipated that time series methods will be used for measures associated with aggregate demonstration and specialty program populations (including IMD and those impacted by premium payments and subsidies). When us ing these methods, the evaluator is expected to consider and address various issues that might compromise the results. If necessary, alternative methods might be required. Final determination of methods and analytics will be made following the review of sample size and available data points over the life of the Demonstration. Infer ential statistic s will be used to try to reach conclusions that extend beyo nd the immediate data alone. Fundamentals statistics will be used to descr ibe inferences about the populations from which they were drawn. Sensitivity analysis to address IMD study questions will be considered. COMPARISON GROUPS In Vermont's Demonstration, Medicaid eligibility is synonymous with enrollment in the public managed care -like model , making general comparison and/or control groups difficult. Whenever possible matched samples for participants in specialized programs or reform initiatives (e.g., ACO, Blueprint, and Chronic Care Initiative) and those not receiving programs services will be Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 134 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 used to explore differences. Synthetic control techniques17 will be considered if suitable comparison states and/or data exists. When feasible given sample size, sub -sets of program participants may be compared to statewide or national benchmarks. Additi onally, the State will work with its evaluation contractor to determine if neighboring New England or other states may be comparable in size, provider network and reform initiatives. POPULATION STRATIFICATION AND LEVELS OF ANALYSIS Levels of analysis w ill include the total Medicaid population, specialized program recipients , and when appropriate to the study question, major Medicaid aid category group (e.g., Aged Blind Disabled, Adults, Children, and MAGI). Please see Exhibits 5 through 10 for proposed stratification and levels of analysis by specialized program and measure. G. DATA REPORTING In addition to the four evaluation report deliverables listed below, the State will compile data and summarize Demonstration performance to -date for CMS in quarterly and annual reports. An independent evaluator will support all Demonstration evaluation reporting requirements. o Interim Evaluation Report #1 (April 1, 2018) o Interim Evaluation Report #2 (December 31, 2020) o Summative Evaluation Report #1 (April 1, 2021) o Summative Evaluation Report #2 (June 30, 2022) o The independent evaluator will support the State of Vermont efforts to complete rapid cycle assessments for new payment and service delivery reform models including but not limited to ACO model enhancements, efforts to support integration across providers and new delivery system investments.

MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER IMD EVALUATION CMS is cont inuing time -limited expenditure authority during the extension period (January 1, 2017 - December 31, 2021) for services in several facilities that are IMDs. This authority is pursuant to an evaluation of the IMD role and effectiveness in Vermont's Medicai d Demonstration. Vermont has agreed to phase down IMD expenditures in CY 2021 and phase out expenditures by 12/31/2025. The SUD demonstation amendment was approved in June 2018 and includes evaluation requirements. This s ection of the evaluation plan provides an overview of IMD programs and allowances in Vermont, study questions and tentative design components for both psychiatric and substance use disorder treatment programs. A. HISTORY AND BACKGROUND As part of its original 1115 Demonstration for the Vermont Health Access Plan (VHAP) Medicaid Expansion, Vermont received a waiver of the IMD exclusion. This waiver, effective January 1, 1996, permitted Vermont to reimburse IMDs for individuals enrolled under the 1115 Demonstration. The rationale behind this waiver was to permit the use of IMDs as alternatives to potentially more costly, general acute hospital services. The 1115 Demonstration was amended in April 1999 to include the Community Rehabilita tion and Treatment (CRT) program for adults who had a severe and persistent mental illness. The CRT model recognized the Department of Mental Health as a managed care entity, responsible for the provision of all behavioral health services in exchange for a capitated payment. Capitation payments included funding for all inpatient hospital services, including the Vermont State Hospital and the Brattleboro Retreat. Prior to approval of the CRT managed care model, Vermont (like several other states) relied on Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) funding as the mechanism to bring federal Medicaid dollars to support its State Hospital. In 2004, CMS elected to no longer grant IMD waivers under its 1115 Demonstration authority; states with existing IMD waivers (including Vermont) were given a schedule to phase out available Medicaid reimbursement. Under the phase -out terms Vermont was permitted to continue Medicaid reimbursement of IMD services through Calendar Year 2004; reimbursement was limited to 50% of allowable expenditures in Calendar Year 2005. When the former Vermont State Hospital (VT) lost its Medicare certification in 2005, CMS sought assurances that Medicaid funds would not be used to support VT. Vermont removed funding for VT from the CRT capitati on rates in 2005. The IMD waiver was completely phased out January 1, 2006. The Global Commitment to Health Demonstration, approved in 2005, historically enabled Vermont to operate under a statewide, public managed care model. The Global Commitment Demons tration provides the State with additional flexibility regarding health care service financing, including the purchase of health care services that are not traditionally covered by Medicaid. In the past Vermont used this authority to purchase alternative services, provided that: Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 136 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 o Services are determined to be medically appropriate; o Care is delivered by a licensed (and not Medicare de- certified) health care provider; and o Coverage of the service achieves program objectives related to cost, quality and/or access to care in the least restrictive, clinically appropriate setting possible. Since 2005 Vermont has used its \"in lieu of\" authority under Global Commitment to purchase in- state residential substance use disorder and inpatient psychiatric treat ment in lieu of more costly hospital -based care from several private facilities : Brattleboro Retreat, The Lund Home, Valley Vista and Serenity House. In 2011, the former State psychiatric hospital was shut down by Tropical Storm Irene. As part of the plan ning process for building a new 25- bed State psychiatric hospital, post -Tropical Storm Irene, Vermont sought clarification from CMS in 2012 regarding its authority to access Medicaid funding, once certified, to support the new facility. In response to thi s request, CMS indicated that costs of psychiatric inpatient services for individuals between the ages of 21 and 65 residing in an IMD could not be included in the calculating the annual Medicaid managed care PMPM limits. However, Vermont was assured that it had authority under the Demonstration to fund IMD services by using its \"managed care savings.\" Facilities that will be involved in the focused study of mental health and substance use disorder IMD treatment services are described in Exhibit 11 below.

STUDY QUESTIONS, POPULATIONS AND DESIGN The State is seeking to examine variables related to psychiatric and substance abuse treatment in two separate analysis. Analysis from this study will help inform the State's decisions related to next steps for substance use disorder and psychiatric treatment capacity, coverage and limitations in Vermont's system of care. Variables identified for study include, but are not limited to: o Emergency room utilization; o Lengths of stay in emergency rooms; o Access to acute inpatient treatment for mental health and substance use disorders; o Lengths of stay in acute inpatient settings for treatment for those conditions; o Quality of acute mental health or substance use disorder treatment ; o Quality of discharge pl anning in making effective linkages to community- based care; o Readmissions for inpatient treatment; o Cost of treatment for acute mental health or substance use disorder conditions; o Access to care for co -morbid physical health conditions; o Quality of care for co -morbid physical health conditions; and o Overall cost of care for mental health and substance use disorders and co -morbid physical conditions combined. C. IMD REPORT The State recognizes that data from the IMD sub -evaluation is required at the same time as Interim Evaluation Report #1, April 1, 2018. The State and its evaluation contractor will: 1. Implement data collection for any identified IMD data gaps (psychiatric and SUD); 2. Conduct analysis of psychiatric -related , IMD -related data, includin g the four -year period preceding the start of the current demonstration (CY2013- 2016) ; 3. Review preliminary psychiatric IMD findings; 4. Conduct analysis of ADAP and DCF data and refine DMH psychiatric analysis as needed to finalize; 5. Collect, analyze and interpret performance measure data; 6. Prepare IMD sub -evaluation findings as part of Interim Evaluation Report #1 for April 1, 2018; 7. Revise Interim Evaluation Report #1 within 30 days of receipt of CMS feedback post April 1, 2018; 8. Conti nue to collect and analyze IMD related data for the period 2018 - 2020; 9. Prepare final IMD sub -evaluation findings as part of Interim Evaluation Report #2 for December 31, 2020 CMS submission; and 10. Revise Interim Evaluation Report #2 within 30 days of recei pt of CMS feedback post December 31, 2020. Outlined in the following sub- sections are the hypotheses, study questions and design elements Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 138 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 for each of the two IMD target areas, psychiatric and substance use disorder treatment. I. PSYCHIATRIC IMD TREATMENT The State's two inpatient IMDs provided services for persons who are experiencing psychiatric crisis. Persons receiving inpatient treatment may be enrolled in the DMH Community Rehabilitation and Treatment program or be considered for involuntary admission. In both these cases, individuals must undergo a pre -placement screening by designated DMH crisis screeners. Enhanced care coordination and community service planning is also supported by DMH through utilization management staff in the central office and a network of designated and specialized program providers throughout the state. Persons who are receiving services from independent physicians, psychologists and/or other counselors, not overseen by DMH, are prior approved and reviewed for continued stay and discharge planning support by DVHA staff. The following hypotheses and study questions have been identified: Research Question: Will expanded IMD authority support enrollees to receive care in the least restrictive most clinically appropriate setting possible? o The projected elimination psychiatric IMD capacity will negatively impact: emergency room utilization and lengths of stay; access to acute inpatient treatment and length of stay; and cost of community hospital care. o IMD services result in impro ved quality of care and community integration as evidenced by: lower re -admission rates and/or access to primary care. Research Question: Is expanded IMD authority necessary to support Vermont's small size and community hospital system? o There is no capa city in the current community hospital system in Vermont to absorb the downsizing necessary to eliminate IMD claiming. Research Question: Will elimination of federal participation result in reductions in community - based treatment capacity due to increased pressure on that State budget? o The projected impact of removing Federal Financial Participation (FFP) for psychiatric IMD on other services and providers in the community will be negative. PSYCHIATRIC DESIGN, MEASURES AND DATA SOURCES Vermont's IMD facilities are statewide providers. Their state -wideness , coupled with the historic nature of the State's funding and utilization of these programs, make evaluation design options such as pre/post Demonstration extension, regional or other in- state comparison groups difficult. However, due to damage to the state psychiatric hospital, associated with Tropical Storm Irene in August of 2011, the State may be in a unique situation to employ interrupted time series and/or sensitivity analysis related to the provision of psychiatric tre atment services and impact in the community -based system of care pre/post Tropical Storm Irene. Specifically, the former 54 -bed Vermont State psychiatric hospital, funded primarily through the State general fund, was shut down due to damage sustained dur ing Tropical Storm Irene. Patients Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 139 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 and staff were moved into general hospital settings and retrofitted facilities across the State until a replacement facility could be built. During the ensuing 3- year period, the State invested significant resources into mobile outreach, crisis stabilization and psychiatric treatment services in the community. At that time, DMH also initiated a contract for the use of 14 beds at the Brattleboro Retreat. DMH collects data that includes information on increased community hospital payments, emergency room utilization and wait times, and psychiatric inpatient services for persons who would have otherwise been served at the former State hospital and who require additional resources during their hospitalization (known as patients with a \"Level 1\" designation). Additionally, DMH has historic data on hospital and temporary facility staffing needed during Tropical Storm Irene. This data and the information available pre/post Tropical Storm Irene , following the opening of the new 25- bed Vermont Psychiatric Care Hospital in July of 2014, may provide valuable insights into the impact of IMD services on the overall service system. Data may allow for the construction of a mathematical model to support sensitivity analysis related to how future changes in psychiatric bed -capacity may impact cost and utilization of other community mental health services. Data sources available for this analysis are detailed below. o DMH Core Data Elements - Identifiable information on all significant dates and times for adults and children waiting for inpatient care under the custody of the commissioner. Data are generally available mid -month after the month of interest. o DMH Adult Involuntary Tracking - Identifiable information on all inpatient admissions under the custody of the commissioner. Data are generally available one month after the quarter of interest. o DMH Financials - Financial tracking and accounting for all payments, including Medicaid, that are not processed through the MMIS. Data are general ly available one month after the month of interest. o DVHA Adult Inpatient Tracking - Identifiable information on all Medicaid -paid inpatient admissions for adults, including Level 1 inpatient stays. Data are generally available mid - month after the month of interest. o VPCH Electronic Health Record - Identifiable information on all inpatient stays at VPCH, the state -run IMD. VPCH stays are paid by MCO investment and therefore there are no claims presented to Medicaid for those stays. Data are close to real time and would require HIPPA -compliant procedures for access. o Brattleboro Retreat (BR) Electronic Health Record - Identifiable information on all inpatient stays. Data are close to real -time and would require HIPPA -compliant procedures for access. o VHCURES Data Warehouse - Unidentifiable information on all paid claims for medical care in Vermont for insurers covering 200+ lives. Matches possible using probabilistic estimation. VPCH is not captured in VHCURES, but BR is captured. Data are generally availab le one year after quarter of interest. Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 140 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 o DMH Monthly Service Report - Identifiable information from community service providers (Designated Agencies) for all services provided via DMH -funded programs. Data are generally available two months after the month of interest. o MMIS - Identifiable information on all Medicaid -paid claims for care in Vermont. Data are generally available three months after the quarter of interest. o VDH General Hospital Discharge Dataset - Unidentifiable information on all discharges from Vermont hospitals regardless of payer or ability to pay. Data are generally available two to three years after the year of interest. A list of potential measures is outlined in Exhibit 12 on the following page. This Exhibit provides options for psychi atric IMD measurement. It is not expected that all measures will be included in the final design. Follow -up after hospitalization is included as a continuity of care metric in Exhibit 12. Vermont will use the NCQA measure \"Follow -Up After Hospitalization for Mental Illness\" (NQF #0576). Vermont will work with its independent evaluator to ensure that additional relevant and obtainable continuity of care measures are included in the psychological IMD evaluation. Measures will be selected and finalized once evaluators have had an opportunity to review and discuss available data, assess data integrity and determine sample sizes with AHS, DVHA and DMH staff. Once data integrity review is final, the hypotheses, research questions and measures will be clarified and presented in the interim findings report. If feasible based on staff and budget considerations data will be stratified to assess Access, Cost and Quality.

The following hypotheses and study questions have been identified: Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 144 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 Research Question: Will expanded IMD authority support enrollees to receive care in the least restrictive most clinically appropriate setting possible? o IMD capacity has a positive impact on emergency room utilization. o IMD services result in improved quali ty of care and community integration as evidenced by: lower re -admission rates and/or access to primary care. o The projected amount and scope of current IMD services is adequate to meet the need. Substance Use Disorder Design, Measures and Data Sources Vermont's substance use disorder IMD treatment facilities are statewide providers. Their state - wideness , coupled with the historic nature of the State's funding and utilization of these programs, make evaluation design options such as pre/post Demonstration extension, regional or other in- state comparison groups difficult. The IMD evaluation is designed to measure outcomes for persons who receive residential services in an IMD. Wherever possible IMD enrollees will be compared to non- enrollees on standard me asures of cost, quality and access. Measures supporting the review of quality of care, community integration and the projected impact of including substance use disorder IMD services in the Demonstration are provided on Exhibit 13 on the following page. Final measures will be selected once evaluators have had an opportunity to review and discuss available data, assess data integrity and determine sample sizes with AHS, DVHA and ADAP staff. Measure selection will consider continuity of car e metrics such as follow -up after hospitalization, records transfer and medication- assisted treatment while receiving IMD services.

Vermont recognizes that a continuum of services and evidence -based practices include attention to co -occurring mental health disorders and to the physical health impacts of OUD/SUD for persons seeking treatment and recovery services. Vermont intends to build a fully integrated physical health, mental health, OUD/SUD and recovery support continuum. To support this goal, Vermont seeks continued flexible federal funding for residential tre atment programs, and in how the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) and other evidence -based criteria are applied to triage plans of care for persons struggling with addictions and co- occurring mental health and physical health conditions. This t riage includes identifying the settings best suited to serve those enrollees with OUD/SUD and co -occurring conditions. For example, in some cases immediate access and treatment in a residential setting is the best course of treatment, while for others imme diate stabilization of a psychiatric crisis or medically managed withdrawal, in a general hospital or specialized inpatient facility, followed by intensive addiction treatment may be clinically warranted. Under the SUD demonstration opportunity, only stays in IMDs for which SUD treatment is the primary purpose of treatment are allowed. The goal s of Vermont 's section 1115 demonstrat ion are fully aligned with CMS OUD/ SUD demonstration goals, as illustrated in Exhibit A below. Exhibit A - Shared Demonstration Goals Global Commitment to Health Goals OUD/SUD Amendment Goals To increase access to care Increase rates of identification, initiation, and engagement in treatment Improve access to care for physical health conditions among beneficiaries To improve the quality of care Increase adherence to and retention in treatment Reduce overdose deaths, particularly those due to opioids To contain health care cost Reduce utilization of emergency departments and inpatient hospital settings for treatment where the utilization is preventable or medically inappropriate through improved access to other continuum of care services Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 174 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 To eliminate institutional bias Reduce readmissions to the same or higher level of care where the r eadmission is preventable or medically inappropriate Milestones Vermont has initiated programs or met many of the milestones identified by CMS through innovation under the Medicaid State Plan and the Global Commitment to Health Demonstration, however, the State intends to enhance its efforts to include new initiatives and delivery system reforms. Specifically, new initiatives under development include: Implementation of value -based purchasing in alignment with the All -Payer Model Agreement to support access. Development of a centralized triage, intake, and call center for persons seeking OUD/SUD services. Improvement of discharge planning and transitions between care settings. 1. Access to Critical Levels of Care for OUD and Other SUDs Vermont's OUD/SUD system follows the ASAM Level of Care guidelines and consists of the full spectrum of services, as outlined in Exhibit B beginning below. All OUD/SUD providers must be licensed and enrolled Medicaid Providers, including meeting additional State certification standards for OUD/SUD treatment.

SBIRT services are intended to identify individuals with risky alcohol and drug behavior and provide a brief inter vention or a referral to treatment, if necessary. Throughout the life of the grant, SBIRT has provided services to emergency rooms, free health clinics, primary care offices and a student health clinic across the State. ADAP is working with providers and other State partners to sustain and expand the availability of SBIRT services under the Global Commitment to Health Demonstration. Public Inebriate/Crisis Intervention : The Public Inebriate (PI) Program is a crisis intervention program for individuals unde r the influence. The Vermont Public Inebriate Program screens and determines appropriate placement for individuals meeting criteria for incapacitation, due to either intoxication or withdrawal from alcohol or other drugs. Presently there is screening capac ity in all counties with one provider covering two counties. In addition to this screening capacity, there are 19 -20 \"diversion\" beds located in several areas across the state designed as alternatives to confined placements. ADAP continues to work to assur e a safe and effective response to address the need for additional community inebriate services and coordinated community- level collaborations between public inebriate programs, emergency departments, law enforcement and the Department of Corrections. Future State: No changes are expected at this ASAM level of care. Summary of Actions Needed: None Level of Care: 1.0 Outpatient Services Current State: Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 177 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 Outpatient Treatment : Medicaid -enrolled providers currently provide outpatient services to Vermonters throughout each region of the State. Outpatient programs include individual, group and family counseling and provide services specific to elders, adolescents, youth, men and women. Future State: No changes are expected at this ASAM level of care. Summary of Actions Needed: None Level of Care: 2.1 Intensive Outpatient Services Current State: Intensive Outpatient Treatment : ADAP -Certified , Medicaid -enrolled providers offer intensive outpatient (IOP) services to Vermonters throughout each region the State. IOP programs offer nine to 19 hours of treatment activities per week. These activities consist of a combination of case management, individual, group, and/or family therapy sessions. Future State: No changes are expected at this ASAM level of care. Summary of Actions Needed: None Level of Care: 2.5 Partial Hospitalization Current State: Partial Hospitalization: Partial hospitalization is provided to individuals with co -occurring mental health and substance use disorder diagnoses, with the primary diagnosis being mental health. Future State: No changes are expected at this ASAM level of care. Summary of Actions Needed: Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 178 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 None Level of Care: 3.1 Clinically Managed Low -Intensity Residential Services Current State: Clinically Managed Low -Intensity Residential Care : Vermont funds a 10 -bed, low -intensity 3.1 ASAM level residential program in the central pa rt of the state. This program is a step down from a 3.5 ASAM -level program in the same county. Individuals with higher needs can attend the treatment programming and receive MAT at the 3.5- level program. Transportation is provided to individuals between the two facilities. Future State: No changes are expected at this ASAM level of care. Summary of Actions Needed: None Level of Care: 3.3 Clinically Managed, Population- Specific High -Intensity Residential Services Level of Care: 3.5 Clinically Managed , High -Intensity Residential Services Current State: Clinically Managed, High- Intensity Residential Care : Vermont supports several residential programs to provide clinically managed, high- intensity residential services as well as withdrawal management services. This includes women- only, co- ed and specialized programs for adolescents and one for pregnant wom en and mothers with children under the age of five. These programs have access to psychiatric and mental health professionals for consultation and can provide care for individuals with co- occurring needs. All of Vermont's residential programs are required to provide access to medication- assisted treatment (MAT) services as clinically necessary. Future State: No changes are expected at this ASAM level of care. Summary of Actions Needed: None Level of Care: 3.7 Medically Monitored Intensive Inpatient S ervices Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 179 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 Current State: Medically Monitored Intensive Inpatient Care : Vermont offers residential programming for adults that provides medically monitored intensive inpatient services. This program has on- site psychiatric services and provides care to individuals with a wide range of co- occurring conditions, including MAT. Future State: No changes are expected at this ASAM level of care. Summary of Actions Needed: None Level of Care: 4.0 Medically Managed Intensive Inpatient Current State: Medically Managed Intensive Inpatient Care : Vermont funds inpatient services at a specialized psychiatric facility for detoxification. This program is also available to treat persons with co - occurring mental health and psychiatric conditions. Once an individual has completed the detoxification they are transferred to an a ppropriate level of care, typically a community residential program or Specialized Health Home (Hub). Future State: No changes are expected at this ASAM level of care. Summary of Actions Needed: None Level of Care: Opiate Treatment Program Current State: Opioid Treatment (Hub and Spoke Program ): Vermont developed the first -in-the-nation Specialized Health Home focused on expanding evidence -based MAT for OUD, known as the Hub and Spoke Program. Vermont's Hub and Spoke Program has garnered national attention for its effective, responsive, and compr ehensive approach to providing MAT. Vermont accomplishes this through the integration of opioid treatment programs (OTPs), providing higher levels of care (Hubs) with primary care, obstetrics -gynecology, outpatient addiction treatment, and pain management practices (spokes) providing office -based opioid treatment (OBOTs). Regional Hubs offer medication, counseling, case management and health home services to complex Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 180 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 patients. Spokes provide care to individuals who have less complex needs and they provide medication, counseling, case management and health home services. Hubs offer medication, counseling, case management, and health home services to complex patients . Spokes provide care to individuals who have either been stabilized at a Regional Hub or whose needs do not require the intensity of services offered by the Regional Hubs. Spoke staff, supported by enhanced care coordination through the Blueprint for Health Community Health Teams and local Recovery Support services, assure essential clinical and counseling support services are provided. Vermont uses a 21- item checklist (Treatment Needs Questionnaire) to help determine whether a Hub or Spoke setting would be most appropriate for new beneficiaries seeking MAT. In order to determine the need for additional hub and/or spoke services, ADAP, in partnership with the Department of Vermont Health Access (DVHA), monitors the regional utilization of Hub services of Medicaid eligible individuals utilizing the Medicaid transportation benefit as well as capacity and wait time reports from Hubs. Future State: No changes are expected at this ASAM level of care. Summary of Actions Needed None Level of Care: Withdrawal Management Current State: Withdrawal Management : Withdrawal management is available at several settings throughout Vermont depending on the medical needs of the individual. ADAP certifies two residential programs in three locations and a social detoxification program to provide higher - intensity withdrawal management services. In addition, hospitals throughout Vermont provide withdrawal management services for individuals who need the full services of a hospital. For individuals whose needs are less intense, withdrawal management services are available through the Hub and Spoke system, whic h includes health home services. Future State: No changes are expected at this ASAM level of care. Summary of Actions Needed: None Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 181 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 Recovery Support Services Recovery Support services in Vermont focus on the following: helping people find, maintain, and enhance their recovery experience through peer support, sober recreation, and educational opportunities. This includes both 12 Recovery Centers located throughout Vermont and the centralized Vermont Recovery Network. Recovery Centers provide non- clinical services that assist with establishing community connections that lead to employment, housing, and other social supports in a safe, drug- and alcohol -free environment. Recovery Centers are committed to supporting a person's efforts in preventing relapse and , should relapse occur, in quickly returning to recovery. Individual services revolve around the support from the Peer Recovery Coach, an individual in active recovery from substance use disorder who has received Peer Recovery Coach trai ning. The Recovery Centers also offer several groups to support recovery, such as: Evidence -Based Practice (EBP) groups o Making Recovery Easier o Seeking Safety o Wellness Recovery Action Planning (WRAP) Community Groups o Yoga, Meditation, Acupuncture o Age-specific recovery groups o Ongoing 12 Step meetings Exhibit C - Recovery Center Locations (2015) Recovery Housing Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 182 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 Recovery Housing is provided to Vermonters through several transitional housing providers, some connected to a Recovery Center and some independent organizations. ADAP has recently begun a new partnership with the Vermont Foundations of Recovery to add new sober transitional housing beds. These programs offer supports to connect individuals to appropriate community social services and ongoing treatment and recovery resources such as individualized planning and general case management. 2. Use of Evidence- Based SUD -Specific Patient Placement Criteria Patient Assessment Current State: Vermont relies on evidence- based practices and clinical practice guidelines for all aspects of provider development, treatment authorization and recovery. The need for treatment often starts with a screening at one of the specialized providers, community partners, or primary care practices. Vermont promotes integrated screening for co- occurring substance use disorders and for co -occurring mental health issues. All of Vermont's certified OUD/SUD providers (Preferred Providers) are required to use evidence -based screening tools, perform a comprehensive assessment which includes elements specified by the State, and utilize ASAM criteria to determine level of care. All State requirements are outlined in Vermont's Preferred Provider Substance Use Disorder Tre atment Standards. All Preferred Providers have grant agreements with the State outlining their expectations including compliance with the Preferred Provider Substance Use Disorder Treatment Standards (Standards). Assessments include age appropriate elemen ts, such as, but not limited to: history; physical history; social support needs; criminal justice involvement; school history; cultural and spiritual preferences; history; participant strengths, goals and priorities; caregiver status; education; and employment. The Standards require that the assessment process results in a written and dated document that includes diagnosis, co- occurrin g disorders, treatment recommendations, and the risk ratings across the ASAM Criteria. For Preferred Providers to maintain specialty OUD/SUD provider certification in Vermont, they must pass compliance and quality audits conducted by ADAP. These audits a re performed every one to three years on all Preferred Providers and are focused on compliance with standardized screening tools, comprehensive assessments, ASAM Levels of Care and evidence -based treatment standards which are verified through client record reviews and agency documentation. The period between audits is determined by the audit results. Vermont inpatient detoxification and residential levels of care are designated as short -term acute care for the purpose of stabilizing an individual, so the y can successfully transition to clinically appropriate lower levels of care. Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 183 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 ADAP has organized its oversight and management of the Preferred Providers into regions of the State where an individual on the Clinical Services Team is responsible for oversight of all of the Preferred Providers, including residential levels of care, in each region. These individuals, known as Regional Managers, participate in the provider certification process with the compliance team and are included in the compliance and qu ality audits. The Regional Managers also provide oversight and technical assistance throughout each certification period, between audits, with at least yearly on -site visits and ongoing communication regarding the areas of opportunity identified by audi ts as well as Statewide and regionally identified areas for performance or practice improvement. Future State: ADAP has developed a new scoring tool to determine a Preferred Provider's compliance and certification status. The Compliance Assessment Tool (Tool) is a weighted scoring tool to align with the Preferred Provider Standards. The Tool includes separate sections according to the program's ASAM Level of Care and is currently being piloted, with one provider audit completed using the Tool. Accompanying this Tool will be a compliance guide which will outline the scoring of the Tool. The score will determine the provider's compliance status (\"full\" or \"provisional\") and will help inform the length of the time before the subsequent review. The implemen tation of this Tool is more transparent and objective than the auditing process used in the past, which was subject to error and bias, and was not flexible to address the ASAM Levels of Care. Summary of Actions Needed: The Standards are under internal review and will be finalized by the ADAP Quality Unit for implementation by May 1, 2018. ADAP's Clinical Unit and Quality Unit will certify four residential providers using the Compliance Assessment Tool through January 2019.

Residential programs are required to screen and assess appropriateness of admission. All programs utilize the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) multi- dimensional assessment tool. Within 24 hours or next business day of admissi on the Medicaid Utilization Management (UM) unit is notified. By the end of the fifth day the residential programs send the ASI results and other clinical information to the UM team for concurrent review and authorization. The UM team use the nationally recognized McKesson Interqual\u00ae decision support tool to determine continued authorization. Exhibit II -8 provides an overview of Vermont's process for accessing treatment services. Future State: Vermont is developing a value -based payment model for residential programs to align with its All-Payer Model Agreement with CMS. The goal of this value -based design is to incentivize successful transitions of care, improve outcomes, and reduce costs. The value -based payment and enhanced support model is targe ted for implementation in 2018. Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 185 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 The value -based payment model Vermont is pursuing is a case rate- like payment methodology. This methodology will reimburse residential care providers a specific per -admission rate for an individual's care for the entire le ngth of the residential stay, as opposed to a per -day rate, as in the current fee for service per diem, per -person payment model. Paying a per -admission case- like rate instead of a per -day rate will disincentivize residential providers from keeping indivi duals longer than is clinically appropriate as there is no additional reimbursement based on the increase in number of days the individual is in care. The new case rate- like methodology will result in a differential case rate such that admissions for individuals with more complex care needs will be reimbursed at a higher rate than an admission for an individual with less complex care needs. The methodology considers a number of clinical and social determinates of health (such as withdrawal potential, me dical and mental health co - morbidities) that incentivize providers to admit individuals who most closely match the dimensional criteria for admission to the residential level of care based on the ASAM Criteria (i.e. those with higher care needs). The meth odology further disincentivizes the admission of individuals who are less aligned with the dimensional criteria for admission to residential level of care (i.e. those with lesser care needs), thereby helping to ensure only those individuals who clinically need access to residential care are served there. The methodology will complement the already existing expectations that residential providers utilize the ASAM criteria to determine level of care needs and recommended treatment placement by aligning the reimbursement methodology's inherent (dis)incentives with the dimensional assessment of ASAM. The providers' compliance with the utilization of ASAM criteria will be monitored through the compliance and quality audits as well as the ADAP Regional Managem ent Approach described in the next paragraph. ADAP has organized their oversight and management of the Preferred Providers into regions of the State where an individual on the Clinical Services Team is responsible for oversight of all the Preferred Provid ers, including residential levels of care, in each region. These individuals, known as Regional Managers, participate in the provider certification process with the compliance team and are included in the compliance and quality audits and, as a part of th is process, complete chart reviews. Regional Managers also provide oversight and technical assistance throughout each certification period, between audits, with at least yearly on- site visits and ongoing communication regarding the areas of opportunity identified by audits as well as Statewide and regionally identified areas for performance or practice improvement. These Regional Managers will perform periodic chart reviews, outside the audit cycles, to review for and provide any needed technical assist ance regarding the clinically appropriate utilization of residential level of care. To further ensure the appropriate utilization of residential care services, the State will explore performance measures such as readmission rates to the same or higher leve ls of care, initiation and engagement in treatment, and treatment length of stay. These performance metrics will be shared with the providers by the Regional Managers and technical assistance will be provided if indicated. Summary of Actions Needed: Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 186 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 Vermont is currently working collaboratively with the Payment Reform Team at the Department of Vermont Health Access to develop the case rate-like methodology.

Use of Nationally Recognized SUD -specific Program Standards to Set Provider Qualifications for Residential Treatment Facilities Current State: Vermont's new certification process, as indicated above, also includes the certification of residential programs to be designated at an ASAM level of care. Residential providers can receive reimbursement from Vermont Medicaid through grant agreements with the Vermont Department of Health's Division of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs (ADAP). These grant agreements outline the expectations including compliance with the Preferred Provider Substance Use Disorder Treatment Standards (Standards). The Standards outline the specific requirements for a provider to receive certification at an ASAM level 3.1, 3.3, 3.5 or 3.7. These requirements include performance expectations, operations (including hours of operations), staffing, human resources, quality improvement, policies and procedures, intensity of services, discharge planning and billing. Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 187 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 Each provider is audited by the State on a regular schedule to ensure compliance with these requirements. The State utilizes an audit tool with a score for each element along with weighted elements. Final scores determine a full certification or limited certification with corrective action plan. The amount of time between audits is determined by the final score. Future State: ADAP has developed a new scoring tool to determine a Preferred Provider's compliance and certificatio n status. The Compliance Assessment Tool (Tool) is a weighted scoring tool to align with the Standards. The Tool includes separate sections according to the program's ASAM Level of Care and is currently being piloted, with one provider audit completed us ing the Tool. Accompanying this Tool will be a compliance guide which will outline the scoring of the Tool. The score will determine the provider's compliance status (\"full\" or \"provisional\") and will help inform the length of the time before the subseque nt review. The implementation of this Tool is more transparent and objective than the auditing process used in the past, which was subject to error and bias, and was not flexible to address the ASAM Levels of Care. (Note tabs at bottom of spreadsheet) The Tool will include separate sections according to the program's ASAM Level of Care. All of Vermont's residential programs at ASAM level 3.3 or higher offer medication- assisted treatment (MAT) on site. The current grant agreements, expiring June 30, 2018 do not specifically require the residential programs to offer MAT. The new grant agreements beginning July 1, 2018 will clearly require the residential programs to off er MAT in order to receive certification as a Preferred Provider thus allowing them to be reimbursed by Vermont Medicaid. Summary of Actions Needed: The Preferred Provider Substance Use Disorder Treatment Standards are under internal review and will be finalized by the ADAP Quality Unit for implementation by May 1, 2018. ADAP's Clinical Unit and Quality Unit will certify four residential providers using the Compliance Assessment Tool through January 2019.

Sufficient Prov ider Capacity at Critical Levels of Care including for Medication - Assisted Treatment for OUD Current State: Vermont adheres to all Medicaid Manage Care requirements regarding network adequacy and access standards. ADAP collaborates with DVHA to use Medicaid utilization data and non- Medicaid services provider encounter data to explore the patterns of utilization for residential care and care at Specialized Health Homes throughout the State. ADAP has several reporting requirements as a part of the granting process with the Preferred Providers in order to monitor and ensure that the State has sufficient provider capacity for critical levels of care, including access to MAT. Specialized Health Homes \"Hubs\" are required to report within seven days of reaching 90 percent capacity for serving individuals who are intravenous drug users, and provide immediate notice if a pregnant woman is unable to be served. In addition, \"Hubs\" are required to submit monthly summaries of wait times for service and service requests, and census reports with numbers of individuals at each phase of treatment (induction, stabilization, mai ntenance) and numbers of individuals who have been transferred to office -based \"Spokes\". ADAP collaborates with DVHA on Medicaid medical transportation utilization data (e.g., distance to services) to monitor the need for MAT providers statewide. Resident ial programs are also required to submit monthly summaries of wait times for services and daily information to an electronic bed -board , which tracks utilization of and availability of beds across residential programs statewide. Occupancy in Vermont's OUD /SUD residential programs remains under 100 percent, suggesting capacity is at adequate levels. With the addition of a new Specialized Health Home \"Hub\" in 2017, wait time reports from across the Specialized Health Home \"Hubs\" demonstrate timely access acr oss the State. Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 189 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 Exhibit J - Maps of Treatment Locations Outpatient/Intensive Outpatient Facilities Hub and Residential Facilities Because all specialty SUD programs are certified by ADAP, Vermont is able to maintain an inventory of the number of providers at all levels of care. To determine adequacy of access, ADAP reviews the monthly wait list reports to identify areas of increasing or sustained long waiting lists. The State team assesses data points on the wait list such as pla ce of residence, distance of travel, length of time on the wait list and any special needs. By using these data points, in the past year Vermont identified the need for an additional Hub in the northern part of the state and successfully opened a new Hub in 2018 resulting in elimination of the wait list for Hub services. Future State: Vermont will be enhancing its access and evidence- based placement process in 2018 and beyond. To improve timely access to care and placement at the appropriate level of care, the State is in the process of developing a Centralized Intake and Call Center (C enter) for all Vermonters. The Center is under development and start -up is funded through the Opioid State's Targeted Response ( STR) SAMHSA grant. The Center will perform an initial screening of individuals to determine the most appropriate referral. The Center will have current information on provider availability and be able to schedule appointment times, across all levels of care, for comprehensive assessments. Individuals having longer wait times will receive regular calls from the center to maintai n engagement and facilitate initiation into treatment. The Center will maintain data on access to care and manage wait lists for services. The Center will determine availability of treatment at each level of care as well as availability of MAT and County OP IOP Addison 1 Bennington 2 Chittenden 7 3 Franklin 1 Lamoille 2 1 NE Kingdom 2 2 Orange 2 Rutland 2 1 Washington 2 1 Windham 1 1 Windsor 2 2Number of Programs Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 190 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 medi cally supervised withdrawal management throughout the state.

Implementation of Comprehensive Treatment and Prevention Strategies to Address Opioid Ab use and OUD Current State: Through the Medicaid State Plan and the Global Commitment to Health Demonstration, Vermont has developed a continuum of services and supports that provide the foundation to successfully address opioid and other substance use di sorders in Vermont. Vermont's efforts to expand treatment for Vermonters with OUD are broad- based and benefit enormously from the commitment of community leaders, partners, and members to support and speak about the importance of this issue. The dedicati on and commitment of these individuals has resulted in increased treatment capacity in critically needed areas, increased coordination amongst community partners, and focus on treating the factors that contribute to the complexity Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 191 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 of OUD. Opioid Prescribing Guidelines Vermont implemented \"Rules Governing the Prescribing of Pain\" effective July 1, 2017 (see Opioid Prescribing Rul e). This rule provides legal requirements for the appropriate use of opioids in treating pain to minimize opportunities for misuse, abuse, anddiversion, and optimize prevention of addiction and overdose and is consistent with CDCguidelines. Expanded Coverage of, and Access to, Naloxone for Overdose Reversal Vermont began distribution of Naloxone with a pilot in 2013 and has since expandedStatewide. Naloxone is provided free of charge at 27 distribution sites including syringeservices programs, substance use treatment providers, recovery centers, and medicalfacilities. Naloxone is available to persons taking opioids, family members, and othercommunity members who may come in contact with people at risk for overdose. In 2016,pursuant to legislation, all Vermont EMS agencies receive naloxone at no charge. Emergencyuse kits also are offered to individuals being released from a correctional facility who haveidentified previous opioid use or dependency. In August 2016, the Commissioner of Health issued a standing order for naloxone, allowing any pharmacy to dispense the lifesaving drug and bill medical insurance, if available. Newprescribing rules effective July 1, 2017 require an accompanying naloxone prescription foropioid prescriptions >90 MME, as well as when there are concurrent benzodiazepines prescriptions. Implementation of Strategies to Increase Utilization and Improve Functionality of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs The rules implemented July 1, 2017 require that prescribers query the Vermont PrescriptionDrug Monitoring System (VPMS) prior to the first prescription of an extended releasehydrocodone or oxycodone that is not an Abuse-deterrent Opioid; no less frequently thanonce every 120 days for any patient prescribed 40 mg or greater of hydrocodone or 30 mg orgreater of oxycodone per day of an extended release hydrocodone or oxycodone that is not anAbuse-deterrent Opioid as long as the patient possesses a valid prescription for that amount;and no less frequently than as described in the Vermont Prescription Monitoring System rule(see VPMS rule ). All prescribers and pharmacists dispensing S chedule II -IV drugs must register and use the VPMS. Vermont also has been improving functionality of the VPMS through thedevelopment of Prescriber Insight Reports, which compare a prescriber's opioid prescribingpatterns to similar prescribers and Clinical Alerts to notify prescribers when patients'prescription history may be of concern. There has been extensive outreach, technicalassistance, and training for prescribers on opioid prescribing and the use of the VPMS. V ermont Medicaid has several strategies to address the opioid ep idemic through the clinical management of opioids and drugs used to treat substance use disorder. DVHA employs prior Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 192 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 authorization, quantity limits, days' supply limits, and maximum dosages to reduce inappropriate use of these drugs. Management of Short -Acting Opiates Vermont Medicaid has implemented prescription limits for opiates used in treating acute pain to align with rule changes made by the Vermont Department of Health effective July 5, 2017. Initial prescriptions for opioids for patients 18 years of age and older are limited to 50 Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) per day and a maximum of 7 days' supply. Patients 17 years of age and younger are limited to 24 MME per day and a maximum of 3 days' supply. The prescription limits apply only to the first prescription filled in an outpatient setting for a given course of treatment and do not apply to renewals or refills. The limits do not apply to long- acting opioids, as they are not indicated for acute pain. Supply limits can be exceeded with prior authorization. Limits are enforced at point of sale. If no prior opiate prescription is found in the member profile within the past 45 days, the claim will reject if MME or days' supply is exceeded. Management of Long- Acting (LA) Opioi ds Vermont Medicaid requires prior authorization for most long- acting (LA) opioids. Prescribers are notified on Medicaid's Preferred Drug List (PDL) of precautions around prescribing LA opioids. The following statements appear in Medicaid's PDL: \" Long- acting opioid dosage forms are intended for use in opioid- tolerant patients only. These tablet/capsule/topical medications may cause fatal respiratory depression when administered to patients not previously exposed to opioids. LA opioids should be prescribed for patients with a diagnosis or condition that requires a continuous, around- the-clock analgesic. LA opioids should be reserved for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (such as non- opioid analgesics or immediate -release opioids) are ine ffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain. LA opioids are NOT intended for use as 'prn' analgesic. LA opioids are NOT indicated for pain in the immediate post -operative period (the first 12- 24 hours following surgery) or if the pain is mild, or not expected to persist for an extended period. LA opioids are not intended to be used in a dosage frequency other than FDA approved regimens. Patients should not be using other extended release opioids prescri bed by another physician. Prescribers must consult the VPMS (Vermont Prescription Monitoring System) to review a patient's Schedule II - IV medication use before prescribing long- acting opioids.\" Drug -specific criteria is applied to prior authorization re quests. In addition, DVHA has applied system edits for quantity limits and maximum dosages. Abuse -Deterrent Formulations (ADF) Medicaid covers one long- acting, abuse -deterrent opiate formulation on its PDL without prior authorization. Currently, this formulation is Embeda (morphine sulfate/naltrexone) and is limited to two tablets per day. DVHA continues to monitor the clinical and cost benefits of covering additional ADFs. Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 193 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 Management of Drugs used to Treat Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Medicaid covers all buprenorphine -containing drugs and naltrexone to treat opiate dependency. Vermont Medicaid manages outpatient Suboxone and buprenorphine utilization to ensure these highly utilized, high- cost medications are used appropriately. All buprenorphine and Suboxone products require prior authorization and have quantity and dose limits. All patients receiving buprenorphine and Suboxone products must have one \"pharmacy home\" for all prescriptions. Oral naltrexone is available without restriction, and injectable naltrexone is available with a diagnosis of SUD and if oral tolerability of naltrexone has been established. In addition to methadone, Medicaid also covers buprenorphine products for use in our OTP programs. Retrospective Drug Utilization Review Medicaid routinely performs retrospective DUR regarding controlled -substance topics such as methadone use, Long- Acting Stimulant U se, etc. In these initiatives, both medical and pharmacy data is used to identify trends. An upcoming initiative will analyze buprenorphine use with benzodiazepines and/or opiates. Overdose Prevention Medicaid has developed a statewide opioid antagonist pilot program that emphasizes access to opioid antagonists to and for the benefit of individuals with a history of opioid use. Along with the pilot program, a policy was generated for \"Standing Order for Distribution of Naloxone Prescription for Overdose P revention\" which allows Naloxone Hydrochloride (Narcan \u00ae) to be covered without a prescription. This policy can be found at : http://www.vtpharmacists.com/resources/RESPNaloxonestandingorder.pdf This policy is in accordance to Standing Order issued pursuant to 18 V.S.A. \u00a7 4240 (c) (1) and ensures that residents of the State of Vermont who are at risk of opioid- related overdose, along with other persons such as family members and friends, can obtain Naloxone without a prescription. The statue can be found at : http://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/18/084/04 240 . In support of this program and the standing order, Medicaid has available two Naloxone products preferred on the Preferred Drug List (PDL) without any prior authorization requirement: Narcan\u00ae (naloxone HCL ) Nasal Spray with a quantity limit of 4 s ingle -use sprays every 28 State: Vermont currently has two provider and stakeholder groups through which the Vermont Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 194 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 Department of Health (VDH) re ceives feedback and recommendations. These groups are the Controlled Substances and Pain Management Advisory Council and the Prescription Drug Overdose Prevention Stakeholder Workgroup. VDH utilizes these groups to receive feedback on the Prescribing Rul es and identify any changes that may be needed. Vermont is currently in process of finalizing updates to the Rule based on feedback from stakeholders. The ADAP Policy Director's responsibility is to keep current on changes at the national level related t o the field of SUD. The Policy Director will identify areas that may impact the prescribing rules and work with the VDH Senior Policy and Legal Advisor to make changes to Vermont's rules when necessary. On January 5, 2017 Vermont's Governor Phil Scott created the position of Director of Drug Prevention Policy and the Vermont Opioid Coordination Council in his second Executive Order. In the executive order, Governor Scott charged the Council \"to lead and strengthen Vermont' s response to the opiate crisis by ensuring full interagency and intra- agency coordination between state and local governments in the areas of prevention, treatment, recovery and law enforcement activities.\" The Council's first meeting was on May 8, 2017. The Council's first report to Governor Scott includes 22 recommendations for next steps to continue Vermont's progress in addressing the opioid crisis. These recommendations are designed to empower local communities, align the delivery of services withi n state government, and between government and private services, to ensure effective results in: Prevention: Addressing the drivers of demand for opioids, including prescribing practices, education at all levels, and social and community engagement. Treatment: Ensuring timely, affordable and effective treatment is available to all in need. Recovery: Making recov ery from addiction sustainable through support systems, with emphasis on employment, housing, social supports, and engagement. Law Enforcement: Reducing supply through investigation and prosecution; policy changes to address the rising presence of fentanyl , and continued work against the diversion of prescription opioids. The following list includes all recommendations: A. Implement a statewide comprehensive system to deliver school -based primary prevention programs. B. Expand health care education, monitoring a nd screening for providers and patients, including provider participation in the Vermont Prescription Monitoring System (VPMS) ; provider training, and patient education, in alternatives to opioids for pain management including non- pharmacological options ; and expansion of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) in primary care, emergency departments, corrections and schools. Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 195 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 C. Build, replicate and support strong community- based models through multi -sector partnerships, innovation, and research resulting in outcomes that exceed previous, less collaborative efforts. D. Create a comprehensive drug prevention messaging campaign designed to raise public awareness, reduce stigma, provide hope for families, and strengthen resilience in Vermont' s communities. Intervention E. Expand Vermont's syringe exchange programs and services to increase geographic reach and hours of operation. Support access to increased case management services for all participants. F. Supply naloxone and provide training to all Vermont law enforcement, emergency medical services (EMS) and people likely to be near a person who may overdose. Harm Reduction G. Expand drug disposal options and events, and increase public participation across the state. H. Improve sharps collection and disposal with a statewide strategy and community toolkit. Treatment: These strategies build on Vermont's nationally recognized tre atment system and call for assessment and new strategies to make treatment and recovery possible for more Vermonters. A. Support, evaluate and improve Vermont's Hub and Spoke system for opioid treatment to sustain, and expand where needed, Hub and Spoke tre atment services across the state. B. Expand access to medication- assisted treatment (MAT) in all Vermont correctional facilities. C. Maximize the use of non -pharmacological approaches (integrative health care professions) for pain management, and for addiction treatment and recovery. D. Support the Vermont Judiciary's plan to explore expanded access to treatment docket techniques. E. Suppor t efforts to expand Medicare and Medicaid coverage for opioid treatment. Recovery : Vermont's investment in delivering treatment must be reinforced with strong recovery strategies that help Vermonters sustain their recovery. Housing, employment, health care and social supports are essential. A. Ensure Vermont has a strong statewide network of recovery centers, recovery coaches, and supports. B. Expand the availability of and equal access to recovery housing; explore expansion of the Department for Children an d Families' (DCF) Family Supportive Housing Program to ensure individuals and families throughout Vermont have access to a stable home environment. Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 196 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 C. Expand Employment in Recovery. (See \"Overarching/Systemic.\") Enforcement : Enforcement strategies focus on keeping Vermont's roadways safe, interrupting drug trafficking, and ensuring Vermont's law enforcement and first responders have training they need. A. Support research and development of an accurate, cost -effective roadside drugged driving test. B. Increase Vermont's resources for drug trafficking investigations. C. Provide drug recognition training for law enforcement and first responders and increase the number of drug recognition experts (DREs). 6. Improved Care Coordination and Transitions between Levels of C are Current State: ADAP continues to improve coordination between the Hub and Spoke providers and specialty substance use disorder treatment providers (residential) through referral protocols, care coordination, covered benefits, information sharing, etc. These and other collaborations are contributing to stronger relationships between primary care practices and specialty substance use disorder service providers, leading to more effective recovery management of physical and behavioral health s ervices. Through Vermont's health reform initiatives, physicians are educated and trained on enhancing their own screening and referral services, so that more clients are screened and directed to OUD/SUD specialists from primary care practices. Vermont's Preferred Provider Substance Use Disorder Treatment Standards (Standards) include discharge planning expectations for all levels of care. Aftercare planning starts as early as possible in the person- centered treatment planning and service deliver y process. The aftercare plan is to ensure a seamless transition when a person served is transferred to another level of care or prepares for a planned discharge to recovery support. The aftercare plan identifies the person's need for a recovery support system or other types of service that will assist in continuing the recovery and community integration. The plan also includes referral information made for additional services such as appointment dates, times, contact name, telephone number, and location. The referring provider must provide the receiving provider with the most recent assessment upon receipt of a signed release of information. Upon discharge, the provider, when prescribing medications, will document coordination of care with the primary care provider and/or external prescribing professional regarding, at a minimum, what medications are being prescribed and for what diagnoses. These standards are audited during the annual site review through the medical record audit. Should any provider be out of compliance with these standards, a corrective action plan will be required. State staff also are available to provide technical assistance to the provider on improving in this area. With the development of the Centralized Intake and Call Center in 2018, providers will Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 197 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 have enhanced support for ensuring continuity of care during transitions. Future State: Recovery Coach in the Emergency Department (ED) Utilizing funding through the Opioid State's Targeted Response ( STR) SAMHSA grant to cover start-up costs, Vermont is implementing a Recovery Coach in the Emergency Department (ED) program modeled after Rhode Island's Anchor ED program. This program is currently being implemented in three counties and expanding to two additional counties in 2018. Vermont's Recovery Coach in the Emergency Department (ED) initiative connects individuals presenting in the ED or other parts of the hospital with peer -to-peer support provided by Recovery Coaches. Recovery Coaches are on -call to the ED 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The purpose of the interaction is for the Recovery Coaches to offer support, guidance and information on topics such as overdose, treatment and recovery, to both the individual and their family/support system. The Recovery Coach will assis t in connecting the individual to treatment and other community resources, in securing transportation and other supports in order for the individual to engage in SUD treatment as well as necessary medical appointments, and to assist in navigating the syste m of care. The connection initiated in the ED is supplemented by extensive post -ED follow -up by Recovery Coaches such as in- person meetings and phone calls. Centralized Intake and Call Center Vermont will be enhancing its access and evidence- based placement process in 2018 and beyond. To improve timely access to care (including transitions of care), and placement at the appropriate level of care, the State is in the process of developing a Cent ralized Intake and Call Center for all Vermonters. The Center is under development and start -up is funded through the Opioid State's Targeted Response ( STR) SAMHSA grant. The Center will perform an initial screening of individuals to determine the most a ppropriate referral. The Center will have current information on provider availability and be able to schedule appointments times, across all levels of care, for comprehensive assessments. Individuals having longer wait times will receive regular calls f rom the center to maintain engagement and facilitate initiation into treatment. The Center will also be the mechanism for providers to access appointments for individuals transitioning between levels of care. The Center staff will contact individuals who have discharged to remind them of their follow -up appointments and make regular contact with individuals who are waiting for services. The Center staff will ensure individuals have information on community supports and other resources such as recovery ce nters and will assist individuals in making those contacts.

Preferred Providers: Substance Use Disorder Treatment Standards 2. Preferred Providers Compliance Assessment Tool Attachment A - Template for SUD Health Information Technology (IT) Plan Vermont's PDMP, known as the Vermont Prescription Monitoring System (VPMS), was implemented as a result of legislation passed in 2006 with data collection beginning in 2009. Vermont uses the VPMS as a clinical tool to address the epidemic of prescription drug misuse and dependence by tracking the dispensing of controlled substances that are most likely to lead to misuse, addiction, or patient harm. Law enforcement do not have access to this system. The VPMS is overseen by the Vermont Department of Healt h (VDH) Division of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs (ADAP). There is a dedicated program manager and in- house analytic capacity. It is administered through a contract and has changed platforms twice in the past two years, first as a result of a routine State bid process followed by a second change a year later when the chosen vendor was purchased, and all clients were moved to a newly developed platform. Due to these changes, many of Vermont's in- state resources were engaged in planning, transition, and user acceptance testing activities to ensure that the data in the system is accurate and usable by prescribers and pharmacists. All Vermont- licensed pharmacies, including mail -order pharmacies, are required to provide prescription information on all Sche dule II - IV drugs dispensed within 24 hours or one business day of dispensing. In 2017, the upload frequency increased from weekly to daily and the Vermont overall pharmacy upload compliance rate is over 95%. In 2014, Vermont -licensed prescribers of controlled substances were mandated to register for VPMS and query the system under specific circumstances. In 2017, new Administrative Rules were implemented which increased the circumstances under which prescribers were required to query VPMS and added re quirements for querying by pharmacists. Prescribers and pharmacists may appoint delegates to query the system on their behalf. http://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/REG_vpms -20170701.pdf Through the use of VPMS, prescriber education programs, Rule changes, and me ssaging, Vermont has seen a 26 percent decrease in total MME opioid analgesics prescribed in Vermont between 2015 and 2017. Please note that the PDMP measures that Vermont currently uses to monitor the dispensing of S chedule II -IV drugs are as follows: 1. Average daily morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per opioid analgesic prescription 2. Average days supply per opioid analges ic prescription 3. Portion of opioid analgesic prescriptions: a. < 50 MME b. 50-90 MME c. >90 MME 4. Total MME dispensed Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 200 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 5. Percent of the Vermont population receiving at least one prescription for: a. Opioid analgesics b. Medication -Assisted Treatment drug c. Benzodiazepine d. Stimula nts 6. Pharmacy uploading compliance rates 7. Prescribers registered with PDMP 8. Pharmacists registered with PDMP 9. Number of PDMP linkages to other states/health systems 10. Number of system queries 11. Multiple provider episodes for prescription opioids (five or more prescribers and five or more pharmacies in a six -month period) per 100,000 residents 12. Patients prescribed long- acting/extended -release (LA/ER) opioids who were opioid- naive (i.e., patients w ho have not taken opioid analgesics in 30 days). 13. Patient prescription days with overlapping opioid prescriptions (percentage) 14. Patient prescription days with overlapping opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions (percentage) Prescription Drug Monitoring (PDMP) Functionalities Current State: Vermont currently shares prescription data with CT, MA, ME, NH, NJ, NY, and RI. Prescriber and pharmacy delegates are allowed. Delegates are linked to their providers account and can query on their beha lf. This helps to streamline use of VPMS in busy medical settings. Quarterly and annual reports showing state - and county- level prescribing patterns are available on our website for needs assessment and monitoring purposes : http://www.healthvermont.gov/alcohol -drugs/reports/data -and-reports Vermont has evaluated integrating PDMP data into electronic medical records and the health information technology platform and has deter mined that it may be feasible through the currently available tool through PMP Gateway. This has not yet been tested by the State for compliance to state security and audit requirements and there is a cost to the end user that some VT health systems may not be willing to pay. Prescriber Insight Reports, which allow prescribers to compare their prescribing to similar prescriber types and specialties, were implemented March 28, 2018. ADAP, through a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has capacity to provide quality improvement activities to prescribers and as part of the dissemination Prescriber Insight Report process, has highlighted the availability of these services. Future State: Under the guidance of a recently established H ealth Information Exchange (HIE) Steering Committee, the Department of Vermont Health Access is currently working to Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 201 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 develop a statewide Health Information Exchange/Health -IT strategic plan. The plan will address the state's health -IT network and needs, which includes SUD efforts overall, including VPMS. By November 2018, the Steering Committee will produce a final plan for submission to the Green Mountain Care Board, the State's health system regulatory body. The Board is statutorily obligated to review the plan for approval. Vermont's current contract with the PDMP provider includes funding to build connectivity between the VMPS and the RxCheck hub. This hub is a state PDMP -owned and governed solution to data sharing between states or health systems. RxCheck is building the capacity for audit trails of PDMP use, which will address concerns which are preventing current connectivity. Vermont is ready to pursue this, however the VPMS vendor is still working on meeting Vermont's contract -required system funct ionality. This is the top VPMS priority after the project is fully implemented. The program manager participates in the RxCheck governing group. PMP Gateway claims to be able to fulfill all safety and security audits for connectivity to health systems/EH Rs although there are several outstanding concerns. o When querying within the VPMS, close matches of patient names are returned as a \"pick list\" to the provider to ensure the most complete and accurate prescription histories. This functionality does not exist within a Gateway connection, as results for only exact matches of records are populated into the connected health system. This increases the possibility that incorrect prescription records could be populated into the report or that incomplete prescript ion histories would be returned. o Registration within VPMS is required to access the system and is only allowed for certain specific roles and provider types. Gateway must be able to validate that no unregistered users are able to access VPMS system data through their health system and be able to respond immediately to deactivate or discontinue any access that a deactivated VPMS user may have. o The ability to obtain VPMS records through court order is a separate process from that required to obtain medical records. Gateway must validate tha t no record of the VPMS data will be stored within the connected health system. o Audit trails from the system must include records of patients queried, by whom, what results were returned, and when. Currently, the accuracy of the records of which patient da ta was viewed has yet to be validated. o This system also comes at a cost to the health care systems. VT statute requires there be a no -cost option to prescribers, thus the interest in RxCheck hub. Ideally, both options will be available. Connectivity wit h other states is based on the likelihood of people traveling to or from those states. As a tourist destination, Vermont pulls tourists primarily from the New England area, so these areas were connected first. The next priority is Florida, due to Vermonte rs who live there in the winter. After that, states with highest rates of opioid prescribing, closest proximity, and the result of Vermont's assessment of the sharing Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 202 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 states' data controls will be prioritized. Timing is based largely on availability of internal resources. Summary of Actions Needed: ADAP to negotiate data sharing with FL after July 1, 2018 when FL s tatue allows for sharing. By year end, connect a total of at least three new states. ADAP to work with vendor to complete contract deliverables and develop the linkage to RxCheck hub by October 31, 2018. VDH to test PMP Gateway connectivity for compliance with VT safety and security audits by December 31, 2018. Current and Future PDMP Que ry Capabilities Current State: Vermont contracts for the PDMP and because of this, use the vendor's algorithm for patient grouping. The vendor has an automated matching algorithm. However, some groupings are tagged for manual review, which is done rout inely by VPMS program staff. System users also notify the program when they find improperly matched records, and these are also manually corrected. Interstate data sharing queries require an exact or a manually grouped match to pull records. This increases the possibility that incorrect prescription records could be populated into the interstate reports or that incomplete prescription histories could be returned. There is a master patient index developed by the State for patient grouping for analytical and reporting purposes. Future State: In an ideal future state, it would be possible to integrate the VT master patient index with the vendor syst em. Summary of Actions Needed: VDH will explore feasibility of integrating the VT MPI with the vendor system through discussions with the vendor. If deemed possible, determine timing, cost, and process. Discussions to begin by December 31, 20 18. As discussions continue around EHR integration, interstate data sharing, RxCheck and PMP Gateway, be cognizant of the need for an MPI. Use of PDMP - Supporting Clinicians with Changing Office Workflows/Business Processes Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 203 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 Current State: VT statute and rule dictates limits on prescribing that are consistent with CDC prescribing guidelines and went into effect July 1, 2017. http://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/REG_opioids - prescribing- for-pain.pdf VT has a prescribing toolkit and has provided associated training on workflow. The toolkit has been updated to reflect VT rules and the CDC prescribing guidelines. https://www.med .uvm.edu/ahec/workforceresearchdevelopment/toolkits -and- workbooks/opioid_prescribing The PDMP allows querying by delegates as well as batch processing of queries to increase the efficiency of use of the system. VT has held learning collaboratives with pre scribers around prescribing practices and on alternatives to opioids in treating chronic pain. Technical assistance in office workflow and best prescribing practice is available to any prescriber. VDH has provided prescribers with tools and materials to as sist them in working with pain patients. http://www.healthvermont.gov/alcohol -drugs/professionals/resources - patients -and-providers Focus groups and interviews have been conducted to determine the best ways of communicating with prescribers. Future State: See integration into EHR discussion above. Beginning in April 2018, VDH is implementing Project ECHO which is a mechanism to build pain management expertise among primary care physicians through mentorship with experts in the field. Due to high demand, additional sessions will be added. Additional learning collaboratives are scheduled in 2018. VDH is revamping the website to make all prescriber and patient resources easier to find. Ongoing technical assistance is available. Clinical Alerts will be implemented in the system. These alerts provide proactive reporting within VPMS to prescribers to highlight prescribing patterns or concerns of which to be aware. Alerts are available for multiple situations that may indicate an increased risk of overdose, dependence, or misuse. Summary of Actions Needed: VDH is promoting the availability of technical assistance at the prescriber level. Promotion has bee n integrated into the March 2018 implementation of prescriber insight reports listed above and the impact of implementation of the insight reports is being evaluated. Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 204 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 VDH is conducting an impact evaluation of the July 1, 2017 pain prescribing rule change. Planned completion is expected by December 31, 2018. VDH began user acceptance testing of the clinical alerts February 2018 and has a target implementation date of July 1, 2018. Master Patient Index / Identity Management Current State: See discussion of Master Patient index above as it pertains to the PDMP. Improved patient grouping in VPMS allows more accurate identification of patients meeting multiple prescriber episodes. Prescribers are notified of patients with potentially risky opioid use (through a letter or within the system) with instructions to review with patients and refer to external SUD treatment, if needed. The State of Vermont has an established health IT infrastructure that supports the provision of care and measurement of t he health care system and reform initiatives. The State's health -IT infrastructure includes, but is not limited to, a PDMP, public health registries (immunization, births/deaths, and cancer), a statewide health information exchange with supporting data ext raction capabilities, behavioral health registry, an All - Payer Claims Database, and a clinical registry within the Medicaid Agency that is operated by the Blueprint for Health program. Additionally, a care coordination platform supports providers participating in Vermont's All -Payer Model and all of Vermont's hospitals and a considerable number of eligible providers have taken advantage of the Meaningful Use program to adopt electronic health record systems. Incorporation of substance use treatment information will require compliance with 42 CFR Part 2. Some s ystems are integrated, others are not. There are a variety of mechanisms for addressing identity management. Future State: Greater interoperability between existing systems, with appropriate identity management. Increased use of existing and updated sys tems. VPMS threshold letters will be system generated. Summary of Actions Needed: Under the guidance of a recently established Health Information Exchange (HIE) Steering Committee, the Department of Vermont Health Access is currently working to develop a statewide Health Information Exchange/Health -IT strategic plan. The Plan will address the state's health -IT network and needs, including SUD efforts. By November 2018, the Steering Committee will produce a final plan for submission to the Green Mountain Care Board, the State's health system regulatory body. The Board is statutorily Vermont Global Commitment to Health Demonstration Page 205 Approval Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Amended: June 6, 2018 obligated to review the plan for approval. Actions, responsibilities, and timelines will be guided by the strategic plan. VDH is currently working with the VPMS vendor on threshold reporting. This is a contract deliverable and should be available by 12/31/18. Overall Objective for Enhancing PDMP Functionality & Interoperability Current State: VT rules require use of the PDMP by prescribers and pharmacists to prevent overprescribing and identify potentially risky opioid use. VT is also providing training to prescribers and pharmacists on both appropriate prescribing and use of the PDMP. Pharmacists are required to query the PDMP if an individual presents a prescription and does not pay for it with the insurance on file. VT Medicaid has a pharmacy lock in program for Medicaid recipients who may be doctor or pharmacy shopping. Prescriber Insight Reports, listed above, were implemented March 2018. Future State: Vermon t has a fully integrated VPMS with proactive reporting to prescribers and pharmacists to decrease initiation and misuse of prescription drugs. Those Vermonters with opioid use disorders, identified through this and other avenues, are referred to and receive treatment.
