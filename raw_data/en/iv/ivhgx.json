It is also involved in the regulation of emotional and psychological responses. It also controls certain reflex actions like gagging, swallowing, coughing, and vomiting. Acupuncture helps to [balance the nervous system](https://www.morningsideacupuncturenyc.com/blog/acupuncture-and-the-nervous-system), which in turn leads to better health. A regulated nervous system can reduce pain and inflammation, and improve things like sleep and digestion. Acupuncture has been shown to have a beneficial effect on the vagus nerve, and can be used as a complementary therapy to enhance its function. In this article, we will explore the connection between acupuncture and the vagus nerve, and how acupuncture can be used to stimulate and regulate its activity. About the Vagus Nerve The vagus nerve (not vegas nerve, although it is pronounced like vegas from Las Vegas), also known as the 10th cranial nerve, is the longest nerve in the body, running from the brainstem all the way down to the colon. It is composed of both sensory and motor fibers, and has multiple branches that innervate various organs throughout the body. The vagus nerve plays a crucial role in regulating many bodily functions, including digestion, heart rate, breathing, and immune function. It is a major component of the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the body's \"rest and digest\" response, as opposed to the \"fight or flight\" response of the sympathetic nervous system. Activation of the vagus nerve can promote relaxation, decrease heart rate, increase digestion and nutrient absorption, and improve immune function. Dysfunction or damage to the vagus nerve can lead to a variety of symptoms, including digestive issues, heart problems, and immune system dysfunction. According to the [Journal of Clinical Medicine](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/7/10/371/htm), research has linked reduced vagus nerve activity to non-communicable conditions like cardiovascular diseases, cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. \"Vagal nerve activity is related to frontal brain activity which regulates unhealthy lifestyle behaviors. Epidemiologically, high vagal activity, indexed by greater heart rate variability (HRV), independently predicts reduced risk of GBD (global burden of diseases) and better prognosis in GBD. Biologically, the vagus nerve inhibits oxidative stress, inflammation and sympathetic activity (and associated hypoxia).\" The vagus nerve has been found to [help modulate communication between the brain and gastrointestinal tract](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5859128/) ( the \"brain-gut axis\"). It helps activate the parasympathetic nervous system, the \"rest and digest\" part of the nervous system. This balances the sympathetic, or \"fight or flight\" part of the nervous system. Vagus Nerve Stimulation The vagus nerve can be stimulated through various methods, including electrical and manual stimulation. Electrical vagus nerve Stimulation (VNS) is a medical treatment that uses a device implanted in the body to send electrical impulses to the vagus nerve. This treatment is commonly used for epilepsy, depression, and other neurological disorders. Manual vagus nerve Stimulation techniques can also be used to stimulate the nerve. These techniques include breathing exercises, meditation, and acupuncture. Acupuncture is a form of Traditional Chinese Medicine that involves the insertion of fine needles into specific points on the body to stimulate the flow of energy and promote healing. vagus nerve Stimulation can also be done at home through techniques such as deep breathing, gargling, humming, and cold exposure. These techniques have been shown to activate the vagus nerve and promote relaxation, reduce inflammation, and improve mood. While VNS is a medical treatment that should be administered by a healthcare professional, manual and at-home vagus nerve stimulation techniques can be done safely and easily on your own. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before trying any new therapies. Vagus Nerve Reset with Acupuncture How does acupuncture stimulate the vagus nerve? Acupuncture involves the insertion of thin needles into specific points on the body, which can stimulate the vagus nerve. By activating these specific points, acupuncture can regulate the activity of the vagus nerve, promoting its function and increasing its activity. Acupuncture also promotes the release of neurotransmitters and hormones, which can further enhance vagus nerve function. This can help to to promote vagus nerve reset and nervous system balancing. One study showed that acupuncture can [stimulate the vagus nerve](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0151882) to promote anti-inflammatory effects on the body. \"The present study provides evidence that AS (acupuncture stimulation) transmits signals into the vagus nerve and mediates anti-inflammatory responses in the spleen. Using an animal model of acute inflammation, we found that AS attenuated inflammatory responses as measured by TNF- productions in the serum and the spleen. Removal of vagal and splenic nerves significantly abrogated the anti-inflammatory effects mediated by AS.\" Auricular acupuncture (ear acupuncture) is a form of acupuncture that involves needling specific points on the ear, and several of these points are believed to stimulate the vagus nerve. One study found that [auricular acupuncture can provide vagal regulation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3523683/) through the auricular branch of the vagus nerve to affect both the autonomic and central nervous systems. It also concluded that auricular acupuncture may have potential in preventing neurodegenerative diseases by regulating the vagal system. Acupuncture Points for Vagus Nerve Stimulation Several acupuncture points can be used to stimulate the vagus nerve: Conception Vessel 12 (CV 12) - Located on the midline of the abdomen, CV 12 is used to stimulate the vagus nerve, promoting digestion and relaxation. Conception Vessel 17 (CV 17) - Located in the center of the chest, CV 17 can help regulate the vagus nerve, improving respiratory function and reducing stress. Heart 7 (HT 7) - Located on the wrist, HT 7 is a powerful point for stimulating the vagus nerve, promoting relaxation and reducing anxiety. Stomach 36 (ST 36) - Located on the leg, ST 36 can help regulate the vagus nerve, promoting digestion and reducing stress. Pericardium 6 (PC 6) - located on the inner wrist, this point has been found to activate the parasympathetic nervous system and increase vagal activity. Lung 7 (LU7) - located on the wrist, this point is said to have a calming effect on the mind and stimulate the vagus nerve. Governing Vessel 20 (GV 20) - located on the top of the head, this point is believed to help regulate the autonomic nervous system and promote relaxation. Stomach 9 (ST 9) located on the neck, below the Adam's apple and between the two carotid arteries. this point can help to calm the mind, alleviate pain, and benefit the throat. Auricular points - The ear has a number of points that can stimulate the vagus nerve, including the cymba conchae, the tragus, and the cavum conchae. The effects of these acupuncture points in relation to the vagus nerve include regulating the autonomic nervous system, reducing inflammation, improving digestion and immune function, promoting relaxation, and reducing anxiety and stress. It's important to note that while these points are commonly used in acupuncture for vagus nerve stimulation, the effectiveness may vary depending on the individual and the specific condition being treated. It's always best to consult with a licensed acupuncturist for a personalized treatment plan. Benefits of acupuncture for vagus nerve stimulation Acupuncture can be a safe and effective way to stimulate the vagus nerve and promote its function. Studies have shown that acupuncture can reduce inflammation, improve heart rate variability, and regulate autonomic function, all of which are related to vagus nerve function. Acupuncture can also be a useful adjunct to other treatments for conditions related to vagus nerve dysfunction, such as anxiety, depression, and gastrointestinal disorders. Vagus Nerve Exercises Exercises and Techniques to Stimulate the Vagus Nerve There are several exercises and techniques that can help stimulate the vagus nerve. These include breathing exercises, meditation, yoga, and massage therapy. These techniques are non-invasive and can be done at home.

To perform deep breathing exercises, sit comfortably and take slow, deep breaths, focusing on expanding your abdomen with each inhale and relaxing it with each exhale. Meditation: Mindfulness meditation and other types of meditation can help stimulate the vagus nerve. To perform meditation, find a quiet space, sit comfortably, and focus on your breath. Try to clear your mind and focus on the present moment. Yoga: Certain yoga poses can help stimulate the vagus nerve. These include downward-facing dog, child's pose, and fish pose. Massage therapy: Gentle massage around the neck and throat can help stimulate the vagus nerve. Use light pressure and circular motions. It's important to note that these exercises and techniques should not replace medical treatment, and individuals should consult with their healthcare provider before beginning any new exercise or therapy regimen. Vagus Nerve Dysfunction The vagus nerve can have dysfunction for many reasons, leading to a range of symptoms. These symptoms can include digestive problems, heart palpitations, anxiety, depression, and even autoimmune disorders. Injuries to the head, neck, or chest can also damage the vagus nerve, leading to dysfunction. The causes of vagus nerve dysfunction can include chronic stress, inflammation, and nerve damage. Conditions such as diabetes, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular disease can also impact the function of the vagus nerve. Lifestyle factors such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and chronic sleep deprivation can also contribute to vagus nerve dysfunction. Medical treatments for vagus nerve dysfunction can vary depending on the underlying cause. In some cases, medications such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety drugs may be prescribed. In other cases, physical therapy or surgery may be necessary. However, there are also natural treatments such as acupuncture, meditation, and deep breathing exercises that can help improve vagus nerve function and reduce symptoms. Vagus Nerve Symptoms Here is a list of possible vagus nerve damage symptoms: Difficulty swallowing Changes in voice or hoarseness Heart palpitations or arrhythmia Gastrointestinal issues, such as bloating, constipation, or diarrhea Low blood pressure or fainting Chronic cough or throat clearing Impaired gag reflex Anxiety or depression Reduced sweating or dryness of the skin Loss of appetite or early satiety Decreased sense of taste Tinnitus or hearing loss Reduced heart rate variability It's important to note that these symptoms can also be caused by many other conditions, so it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis. Vagus Nerve Disorders vagus nerve Disorders refer to a group of medical conditions that affect the function of the vagus nerve, a long cranial nerve that extends from the brainstem to the abdomen. Damage or dysfunction of the vagus nerve can cause a wide range of symptoms, depending on which part of the nerve is affected. Here are some of the most common vagus nerve Disorders: Gastroparesis: This condition occurs when the vagus nerve is damaged or not functioning properly, causing a delay in stomach emptying. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, bloating, and early satiety. Neurogenic Bladder: Damage to the vagus nerve can also affect the function of the bladder, leading to urinary retention, incontinence, and other bladder problems. Arrhythmia: The vagus nerve plays a role in regulating heart rate and rhythm. Damage to the nerve can result in arrhythmia, a condition where the heart beats irregularly. Tinnitus: Ringing in the ears can be caused by vagus nerve damage or dysfunction. Fibromyalgia: This chronic pain condition has been linked to vagus nerve dysfunction, which may play a role in the development and maintenance of pain symptoms. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): vagus nerve dysfunction has been associated with IBS, a condition characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits. Migraines: Research suggests that the vagus nerve may play a role in the development and treatment of migraines. Anxiety Disorders: The vagus nerve plays a key role in regulating the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the body's \"rest and digest\" response. vagus nerve dysfunction has been linked to anxiety disorders, as well as other mental health conditions. It's important to note that vagus nerve Disorders can be complex and difficult to diagnose, and treatment may vary depending on the underlying cause of the dysfunction. If you suspect you may have a vagus nerve Disorder, it's important to speak with your healthcare provider to get an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
