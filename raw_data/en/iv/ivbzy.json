Christopher Cox, Michael Harris Abstract Survey research was conducted for First Harrison Bank, a local community bank. This research sought to: identify the importance of current bank product offerings, particularly online banking services; evaluate Generation Y banking needs to determine if there is a need for the development of new bank products; identify aspects of customer service that are most important to Generation Y . Introduction Understanding banking practices and preferences among different generations of customers allows banks to make informed decisions about products and services to offer as well as how to effectively market to these different generations. A team of graduate students worked with First Harrison Bank over a two-semester period to help them understand these banking practices and preferences, with particular attention paid to the Generation Y customer. Generation Y is generally regarded as including persons born between 1979 and 1994. Since this is the second-largest generation in United States history, it represents the future growth of the banking industry. These people are facing (or are about to face) first-time financial decisions and tend to do their own research before making decisions. Research shows that this generation is well-educated and technologically literate. [Kuehner] If a bank started today and projected the future earnings of Generation Y , it would find that a new customer from this generation will have a higher lifetime value than the long- term value of a current baby boomer customer. [Ginovsky] While they are also more likely to choose nontraditional financial providers, they still desire in-person interaction with their banks. Given the level of connectivity among Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 2Generation Y , they expect their needs to be met 24/7. [Hoffman] In an effort to reach this generation, banks are utilizing social media outlets such as Facebook. Research shows, however, that static Facebook pages re-directing consumers to the bank website are not effective. Generation Y expects the bank's Facebook page to be an outpost of the bank, tied to products and services. [Sisk] Banks should also take note of this generation's word-of-mouth potential. Research shows that Generation Y will tell an average of 17.8 people about a new favorite TV show or website, compared to 5.9 people told by baby boomers. [Powell] It has been shown that this generation tends to be less loyal to banking institutions than other generations. The challenge for banks is to get the attention of Generation Y and keep them engaged over time. [Johnson] Project Phases The research team met with First Harrison Bank management on multiple occasions to determine their needs and interests. Then the project proceeded in two phases. During phase 1, a series of focus group meetings were held to determine the values and expectations of participants as they related to financial services. Questions were asked about perceptions of banks, motivations for selecting banks, process for selecting banks, level of personalization expected of banks, banking services used, methods for using banking services, and perceptions about community banks. All participants in the focus groups were members of Generation Y and none had prior work experience in the banking industry. The focus group research identified five themes of interest related to banking trends: (1) Online Banking, (2) Customer Service, (3) Transparency, (4) Loyalty, and (5) Potential Innovations. During phase 2, the team met again with First Harrison Bank management to receive specific direction on which aspects of the focus group findings to further explore. Based on this, three research objectives were established:Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 31. Identify importance of current bank product offerings, particularly online banking services. 2. Evaluate Generation Y banking needs to determine if there is a call for the development of new bank products.3. Identify aspects of customer service that are most important to Generation Y . The remaining sections of this paper describe the survey research conducted that was based on these objectives. The Survey Instrument The survey instrument included 21 questions and required an estimated completion time of 10 minutes. The questions were primarily multiple choice and 5-point Likert scale, although there were a few exploratory, open-ended questions. The instrument was pretested and went through several revisions. Recruiting Respondents and Data Collection Several methods were used to recruit respondents. Note that respondents were not limited to Generation Y . It was of interest to see how banking practices and preferences differed across generations. Letters were sent to University professors asking them to administer the survey to their students; flyers were posted throughout campus; announcements were included in monthly First Harrison Bank statements and on First Harrison Bank receipts; an announcement was posted on the First Harrison Bank website, and invitations to participate were sent through Facebook. Survey expenses were funded by First Harrison Bank. As an incentive to participate, all respondents were given a chance to win an iPod. Surveys could be completed on paper or via an external host website. The survey was administered over a three-week period. The total Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 4number of respondents was 1,035, of which 960 were usable. Because First Harrison Bank customers and University students were deliberately targeted, the majority of respondents were First Harrison Bank customers and the predominant age group was Generation Y . Sources of responses were: bank customers 67%, university students 22%, other 11%. The age groups of respondents 4%. The majority of respondents, 65%, were female. Survey Results Respondents were asked what type of banking services they used. Figure 1 shows that all age groups heavily use checking and saving accounts. Figure 1 As one may expect, Generation Y respondents are most likely to have auto loans; middle-aged respondents are most likely to have mortgages; senior citizens are most likely to have certificates of deposit. Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 5Survey respondents were categorized by total household income. Figure 2 It appears from these results shown in figure 2 that Generation Y consumers are not yet at their peak earnings. This further justifies the need to plan for their future banking needs. Web Based Banking A series of questions was asked concerning web based banking. For questions related to the importance of web based banking, response options included very important, somewhat important, neutral, somewhat unimportant, and not at all important. For questions related to level of agreement, response options included strongly agree, somewhat agree, neutral, somewhat disagree, and strongly disagree. Respondents were asked about the importance of availability of electronic bill pay. Nearly half of all respondents across age groups indicated that this service was very important to them. When asked about the importance of the ability to open an account online, with the exception of the 65+ respondents, all age groups rated this Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 6ability as neutral to somewhat important. Surprisingly, those 65+ rated this ability as somewhat important to very important. Asked about the importance of the ability to communicate with a bank representative electronically, thirty-five percent of Generation Y respondents rated this service as somewhat important to them. This is comparable to all other age groups who also rated this service as somewhat important. Dissent, however, was evident within the 46 - 64 age group, as they rated the service as very important. Having all relevant information readily available on the bank website was very important to respondents, with nearly 75% of those in all age groups indicating that this service was very important to them. Further, the vast majority of respondents from all age groups indicated that the ability to access accounts online was very important to them. Respondents were asked about the importance of the ability to transfer funds between accounts online. The responses are similar for all respondent age groups, with nearly 75% of each age group rating this service as very important. The exception is the 65+ age group, with 56% of respondents rating this service as very important. Regarding the importance of receiving account alerts from the bank by email, there is a gap among the age groups indicating that this service may be more important to those in age groups 46-64 and 65+ than those in Generation Y and 33-45. When asked if they would use a web-only bank, responses revealed unexpected results. First, although the data thus far have consistently shown a preference for the ability to utilize web based banking, none of the age groups positively viewed this statement. In fact all groups strongly disagreed with it. For Generation Y this supports earlier research that despite their reliance on technology, this generation still desires personal banking interaction. [Hoffman] Responses to additional questions concerning banking via the web showed that all respondents want to utilize the web for banking research; more than half of each age group respondent checks their account balance online; more than half of each age group respondent wants to receive updates Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 7on new products or interest rate changes through the bank website, and more than half of each age group respondent uses the web for the majority of their banking transactions. Together, these indicate that the bank's website is crucial in managing customer relationships. Mobile Banking A series of questions was asked concerning mobile banking (i.e. banking using a cell phone). For questions related to the importance of mobile banking, response options included very important, somewhat important, neutral, somewhat unimportant, and not at all important. For questions related to level of agreement, response options included strongly agree, somewhat agree, neutral, somewhat disagree, and strongly disagree. Respondents were asked about the importance of the ability to access accounts via cell phone. Figure 3 Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 8As shown in figure 3, a minimum of 25% of respondents from each age group indicated they are neutral when it comes to being able to access their account information via cell phone. While the results did trend towards somewhat important and very important for Generation Y respondents, the response rate for any of the two ratings for Generation Y did not rise above 30%. The data indicate that this service has little importance for those 46-64 and 65+. 34% (65+) and 25% (46-64) indicated that accessing their account via cell phone was not at all important, while 15% of those aged 46-64 and 16% of those aged 65+ indicated the service was very important. When asked about the importance of the ability to transfer funds between accounts using a cell phone, Generation Y respondents primarily rated this service as neutral, as did the three other age groups. Those 65+ were the only group that most frequently indicated this service was not at all important. Concerning the importance of receiving account alerts from the bank by cell phone, none of the four age groups has a high preference for utilizing cell phones for banking. The most frequent response from Generation Y , 33- 45, and 46-64 age groups rated this service as neutral, while the most frequent response of those 65+ indicated this service is not important. Respondents were asked if they would like to do more banking on their cell phone within the next year. Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 9Figure 4 Figure 4 shows that a large portion of respondents from all age groups do not consider cell phones a viable avenue for banking. For this question, the majority of each age group was neutral to the service, with no group committing to the service. In fact, within each group the percentage of those who strongly disagree (Generation Y: 18%, 33-45: 22%, 46-64: 28%, 65+: 33-45: 8%, 46-64: 4%, 65+: 3%). Customer Service Respondents were asked a series of customer service related banking questions. For questions related to the importance of customer service, response options included very important, somewhat important, neutral, somewhat unimportant, and not at all important. For questions related to level of agreement, response options included strongly agree, somewhat agree, neutral, somewhat disagree, and strongly disagree. Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 10When asked if they would rather speak with a person than a recording when calling a bank, there is similarity among the four age groups. Nearly 75% of each group indicated that this service was very important to them. However, the results indicated that speaking with a person is more important to those 46-64 and 65+ as compared to Generation Y and those 33-45. Generation Y and 33-45 each had 72% of respondents indicate that this was very important. Those 46-64 and 65+ responded that speaking with a person has greater importance with 79% (46-64) and 88% (65+) indicating this as very important. The majority of each age group indicated that the importance of the ability to talk face-to-face with a bank representative about bank products is very important. The data indicate that while this is always important, the level of importance increases with the older age groups. Only 59% of those in Generation Y indicated this as a very important service, while the other three age groups responded with much higher percentages indicating very important - 33-45: 65%, 46-64: 73%, 65+: 72%. Respondents were asked how important it is to them that the bank makes them feel like a valued customer. The majority of respondents from each age group strongly agreed with this statement. Over 90% of the customers in each age group somewhat agree or strongly agree. This is likely valuable information for community banks for which the mission is to develop relationships with their customers and their community. Respondents from all age groups somewhat agreed that great customer service is more important than having the lowest rates, indicating that they are not completely willing to sacrifice customer service for lower rates. It is of note that there are no differences among the age groups on their opinion of customer service. When asked if they thought their personal/financial information is safe at the bank, more than 60% of each age group respondent strongly agreed that their information was safe. For those respondents 65+, 75% strongly agreed that their information was safe.Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 11Location & Community Respondents were asked a series of questions related to physical locations and community involvement. Response options included strongly agree, somewhat agree, neutral, somewhat disagree, and strongly disagree. Respondents in each age group strongly agreed that it is important that the bank has a physical location convenient to them. The data suggest that physical locations are more important to those older than Generation Y , as the strongly agree percentages rise as the age of a group increases (Strongly Agree, 18-32: 66%, 33-45: 71%, 46-64: 79%, 65+: 78%). Regardless, more than half of all respondents for each age group still recognize the importance of a physical bank location. Figure 5 illustrates the importance of the bank having many ATMs in the community. Figure 5 Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 12ATM technology is important to all age groups, with more than half (except for those 65+, with 46.9%) of each group indicating that they strongly agree with this statement. There is, however, a difference in the level of importance of ATM locations. Only 1.5% of those in Generation Y indicated that they strongly disagreed that ATM location is important while 15.6% of those 65+ indicated that they strongly disagreed with the statement. Therefore, the data indicate that ATM location is important to all age groups, but more important to Generation Y as compared to those 65+. Respondents were asked how important it is that their bank donates to organizations within their community. Figure 6 Generation Y respondents were primarily neutral to this statement, although they did tend towards somewhat agree, as shown in figure 6. Each of the other three age groups indicated that they somewhat agreed, suggesting that a bank's social responsibility is not something considered as relevant to Generation Y when choosing a bank as it may be to other age groups. Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 13Open Ended Responses Respondents were asked what they liked most and least about their primary current bank. When considering the top four responses to the question \"what do you like most about your primary current bank?\" Generation Y responses were identical to the top responses for other age groups. In order, they listed customer service, branch locations, website, and low fees as the things they liked most. When considering the top four responses to the question \"what do you like least about your current bank?\" Generation Y responses were somewhat different than that of other age groups. Generation Y top four responses, in order, were branch locations, customer service, high fees, and number of ATMs. Other age group top four responses, in order, were branch locations, high fees, high interest rates, and branch hours. Contrary to the predictions that brick-and-mortar banks will soon become obsolete, these survey results indicate that branch locations remain a primary driver of customer satisfaction. Limitations It is possible that the locally surveyed Generation Y consumers may be different from the general Generation Y population. While the results of this study may not be generalizable, they do meet the needs of First Harrison Bank, which initiated this study. Note also that in the time since these data were collected in late 2009, the proliferation of cell phones with Internet connectivity has increased dramatically. With the distinction between web usage and cell phone usage blurring, it is likely no longer necessary to separate the two categories of electronic interaction with the bank. Conclusion This survey research serves to assist the banking industry in better understanding current customers and cultivating future customers. Understanding banking practices and preferences among different generations of customers can guide decision-making and influence product and service offerings. Although Generation Y customers may be early in their need for banking services and still relatively low in their income earned, they Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 14represent an enormous customer base and the future of the banking industry. Banks that seek to understand the banking practices and preferences of Generation Y in advance will be well-prepared to serve them as they mature financially. Since Generation Y customers are characterized as less loyal and more technologically savvy, in some ways, managing relationships with them may require unique strategies. However, this research shows that in several areas, there is little distinction among the various age groups of banking customers. This is particularly noted in web banking and mobile banking practices and preferences. Thus, banks seeking to provide services to Generation Y may actually serve their other age groups through the same services. Another interesting result is that even though Generation Y customers are technologically adept and want banking services available to them 24/7, the opportunity for face-to-face and phone interaction with bank personnel is still very important to them. This information should be regarded as encouraging news for the community banking segment for which personal customer service is such a vital part of its mission.Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 15Bibliography1 Kuehner-Herbert, Katie., Rehm, Barbara A. \"Do Banks Get Their Future Customers?\" American Banker .

Are School Officials and Parents Looking at the Right Measurements for School Success? Ryan Maynard Introduction In the spring of each year, secondary school students across the United States are required to take a standardized achievement test. These examinations are designed to measure and compare students' knowledge of material. For many students, the test may represent nothing more than a week away from traditional instruction but for schools, districts, states, and parents, the results are crucial. Standardized tests have been in existence since Imperial China in the 7 th century. After the invention of the printing press and modern paper, the use of written exams grew. In 1845, public education activist Horace Mann was among the first advocates for standardized tests. In 1926, the Scholastic Aptitude Test, or SAT, was introduced as a multiple-choice test to evaluate college applicants. The multiple-choice format was adopted because of its ease of grading. Beginning in the 1970's, standardized tests were used to rank schools. This practice increased dramatically during the 1980's and 1990's. Then in 2002, George Bush signed the No Child Left Behind law, which increased the importance of K-12 testing dramatically. After the creation of No Child Left Behind, all public school students from grades three through Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 18eight were required to be tested annually. The test results are used to rank schools, with the highest scoring schools receiving additional federal money, while the parents of children in the lowest ranking schools are allowed to move their children to a different school. (Matthews, 2006) At the system and school level, the tests often impact personnel decisions, and as a result, many school systems have fired or transferred teachers based on test outcomes. The focus of this paper is on the elementary schools in the Jefferson County Public School (JCPS) system. JCPS is the school system for Louisville, Kentucky. During the 2008 - 2009 school year JCPS had 99,079 students enrolled and 155 schools. This included 27,356 students in high school, 20,054 in middle, 36,975 in elementary, 7,409 in kindergarten, 4,393 in preschool, and 2,892 special needs students in self-contained classrooms. These students are taught by 7,018 teachers. JCPS has 90 elementary schools, 23 middle schools, 19 high schools, and 24 alternative schools. JCPS is a diverse school district; where Caucasian students are a slight majority 36.6%, More than half (53.7%) of JCPS students receive free or reduced price meals. JCPS worked on a budget of approximately $517 million for the 2009 school year. (Jefferson County Public Schools, 2009) The Jefferson County Public School system was recently faced with the burden of several \"failing\" schools at the middle and high school levels. Kentucky state law requires that changes in teachers and leadership be made in each of the 10 lowest performing schools. In 2010, Jefferson County had six such schools. This study looks at the test results for Jefferson County Public elementary schools to determine what factors may influence test results. There are several potential determining factors that influence the test results of Jefferson County elementary schools. These factors include the number of students enrolled for the school year whether or not the school is a \"special\" school; student to teacher ratios; the education level of each teacher in the school; and the average number of years of experience of the teachers in the school. In addition to the listed factors, data were obtained with basic demographics about the race and socioeconomic status of tested students.Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 19Determining factors that influence test results can be divided into three categories: school related factors, teacher related factors, and race/ socioeconomic factors. School related factors include whether or not a schools is a \"special\" school and student to teacher ratios. Teacher factors include the education level of teachers and tenure. Race and socioeconomic factors include the percentage of students of particular races and family income. In JCPS the district controls the race and socioeconomic factors of schools, deciding which schools are \"special\" , and student to teacher ratios. Schools have control over teacher tenure and teacher education. For this paper, \"special\" schools are those that are labeled as a Montessori school, traditional school or a magnet school. Montessori schools use the Montessori approach to learning, which encourages critical thinking, exploration, and self-directed education. A traditional school is a type of magnet school that focuses on teaching and learning at grade level in a traditionally structured classroom environment. Traditional schools require uniforms, daily homework, and parent involvement. A magnet career academy (MCA) is a type of high school that lets students focus on training for a specific career\u2014in addition to providing the basic courses that all students are required to complete. Some \"special\" schools and programs accept students only from specific areas of the district; others accept students from any home address. (Jefferson County Public Schools, 2010) Teachers in Jefferson County elementary schools may have four different levels of educational attainment: undergraduate degree, master's degree, \"Rank 1\" , or a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.). Teachers may be hired with only an undergraduate degree but must obtain a master's degree within 10 years of hire, as required by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. A Rank 1 is awarded to teachers that have completed 30 hours of graduate level course work beyond a master's degree. Jefferson County incentivizes teachers to obtain additional education by awarding pay increases based on both educational attainment and tenure. Socioeconomic status is measured by the percentage of students that receive free or reduced lunch. Students receive free or reduced lunches based on a sliding scale that uses parent income and dependents as inputs. In JCPS, Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 20a family of four with a household income of $40,793 would receive reduced priced meals, while a family of four with a household income of $28,665 would receive free meals. (Jefferson County Public Schools, 2010). In this study, the percentage of students in a school that receive free or reduced lunch is used as a proxy for income. Methods The data used for this analysis and paper were derived from \"school report cards\" provided by Jefferson County Public Schools (Kentucky Department of Education, 2010) of the 90 public elementary schools in Jefferson County1. Jefferson County tests all third, fourth, and fifth grade students. Third graders are tested in reading and math. Fourth graders are tested in reading, math, and social studies. Fifth graders are tested in reading, math, and science. In order to get the most statistically relevant results, only scores for reading and math were collected. Each school reported the combined percentage of students that scored in either the proficient or distinguished category. The data include the number of students enrolled for the school year, whether or not the school is a \"special\" school, student to teacher ratio, the education level of each teacher in the school; and the average number of years of experience of the teachers in the school. The data also include information about the race and socioeconomic status of each student tested. Results and Implications The regression analysis below shows the impact of \"special\" schools, African-American students, and teacher tenure on test scores in JCPS elementary schools. 1 One was excluded from the study because its results were incorporated with the middle and high school that share the same building.Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 21Readi =70.804+7.968Speciali -.682AAi +1.445Experiencei t = 3.67 -7.909 4.999 R2 = .687 62.216 Mathi=68.177+5.559Speciali -.670AAi+1.423Experiencei t = 2.9097 -6.355 4.033 n = 89 R2 = .571 F = 40.111 Readingi = Percent of students scoring in either the proficient or distinguished category in reading at the ith school Math i = Percent of students scoring in either the proficient or distinguished category in math at the ith school Special i=A dummy variable equal to 1 if the ith school is a \"special\" school and 0 otherwise AAi = Percent of students that are African-American Experiencei= Average years of experience of the teachers at the ith school The results of the regression analysis match the hypothesis many would make. The results indicate that \"special\" schools increase test scores, schools with a high percentage of African-American students can expect to score lower on standardized tests than schools with a high percentage of white students, and teacher tenure increases test scores. It is important to note that the variable for teacher experience in this study may contain bias. Teachers in Jefferson County Public Schools with the most experience tend to teach at schools with a high percentage of 2 Information about race and socioeconomic status was available only for the students that took a standardized test. The demographics of the students tested will serve as a proxy for the demographics of the entire school.Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 22white students and a low percentage of students receiving free and reduced lunch. The average teacher in Jefferson County Public Schools has 11.3 years of experience. 62.8% of elementary students in Jefferson County receive free or reduced lunch. The average teacher experience at schools with more than 62.8% of students on free or reduced lunch is 9.7 while the experience level at schools with less than 62.8% on free or reduced lunch is 13.6 years. The difference in teacher experience increases as the gap between incomes widens. The five elementary schools with the highest percentage of students receiving free or reduced lunch had an average teacher tenure of 8.7 years. The five elementary schools with the lowest percentage of students receiving free or reduced lunch had an average teacher tenure of 12.2 years. Similar results are found as the percentage of African-American students increase. 37% of elementary students in Jefferson County are African-American. The average teacher experience at schools where more than 37% of students are African- American is 9.77 while the experience level at schools where less than 37% of students are African-American is 12.74 years. The five elementary schools with the highest percentage of African-American students had an average teacher tenure of 10 years. The five elementary schools with the lowest percentage of students receiving free or reduced lunch had an average teacher tenure of 14.7 years. The gap in teacher experience between schools may be explained by a variety of reasons. A study of California schools showed that teachers are influenced by school characteristics such as preparation time, facilities, student characteristics, and school leadership. (Loeb, Darling-Hammond, & Luczak, 2005) Teachers also prefer schools and districts similar and geographically close to those they attended in high school. (Boyd, Lankford, Loeb, & Wyckoff, 2005) A study of Georgia elementary teachers indicates that teachers move from schools with higher proportions of minority students and from low performing schools, but the latter is explained by teacher preferences for fewer minority students. (Scafidi, Stinebrickner, & Sjoquist, 2003) A similar study of Texas schools found that teachers prefer higher achieving students after controlling for student racial composition. (Hanushek, Kain, & Rivkin, 2004) A study of New Y ork City school teachers found that teacher race is a factor in teacher transfers. Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 23White and Hispanic teachers are much more likely to leave schools as the proportion of white students falls and the proportion of African-American students increases. It is interesting that for African-American teachers there is little relationship between student body racial composition and retention. The same study found that the proximity of the teachers' previous residence was the largest factor in teacher retention. The result is that urban schools are \"net importers\" of teachers, which increase the likelihood of teachers in urban schools transferring or quitting. (Boyd, Lankford, Loeb, & Wyckoff, 2005) Discussion The results of the regression estimates provide some insight on which factors impact school success as measured by test scores. Schools with a high percentage of white students should expect test scores to be higher than schools with a high percentage of African-American students. Based on this data, one could argue that test scores are more a measure of the race of students in a school rather than the success of the school. Teacher experience increases test scores; however, there is reason to believe that the variable may contain bias. These results are similar to the results found in other studies. Proponents of \"special\" schools should be encouraged by the results of the regression analysis. Students in \"special\" schools, all else equal, are more likely to be ranked either proficient or distinguished than students in \"regular\" schools. There are several theories about why African-Americans do poorly on standardized tests. One theory places the blame on the disruption caused by student mobility. Student mobility is the practice of students making non-promotional school changes, often during the school year. Most student mobility in the United States is a result of families changing residences; however, schools do contribute to student mobility through overcrowding, class size reduction, suspension and expulsion policies, school choice, and the general academic and social climate. (Remberger, 2003) According to data collected through the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) 1998 Math Assessment, 34% of fourth graders changed schools at least once in the previous two years. The incidence of Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 24student mobility varies by race, ethnicity, and family income. For example, data from the 1998 NAEP show that: 45% of African-American fourth grade students changed schools in the last two years compared to 27% of white fourth grade students; 43% of fourth grade students who were eligible for the national school lunch program changed schools in the last two years compared to 26% who were not eligible (Remberger, 2003). Mobile students have lower achievement than stable students (Audette, Algozzine, & Warden, 1993). One national study of third-grade students found that frequent school changes were associated with a host of problems, including nutrition and health deficiencies, below grade level reading scores, and grade retention (U.S. General Accounting Office, 1994). Another theory that has been supported through research is that African-Americans are at a disadvantage in standardized tests due to cultural biases created by their environment. There is a quantitatively important relationship between black relative test scores and the degree of segregation in different metropolitan areas. A move from a highly segregated city to an integrated city is associated with a narrowing of the black-white SAT gap. Neighborhood segregation seems to have more of an impact than school segregation (Card & Rothstein, 2007). Teacher experience, though it may contain bias in this study, may have a positive impact on test scores for some subjects. According to one study, experience is a significant predictor of test scores for both reading and math computation, but not math concepts. The study provided substantial evidence that teaching experience improves reading test scores. Ten years of teaching experience is expected to raise vocabulary and reading- comprehension test scores, respectively, by about 0.15 and 0.18 standard deviations. Interestingly the study also shows evidence that teacher experience has much less effect on math scores (Rockoff, 2004). The study did not evaluate the impact of experience past 10 years of teaching. It is likely that the relationship between experience and increased test scores is not linear but rather polynomial and at some point each additional year of experience would negatively affect test scores. Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 25Conclusion The regression estimates illustrate that test scores are heavily influenced by race, school type, and teacher tenure. These findings are consistent with those found in similar research. Teacher qualifications such as level of educational attainment, length of experience, and licensure scores have little to do with teaching ability (Rivkin, Hanushek, & Kain, 2005). Although, it is not clear what characteristics of a teacher have the most impact on student achievement on standardized tests, the three teacher qualification factors noted above appear to make little difference. Something other than these factors makes certain schools and classrooms a better learning environment than others. The regression estimates presented in this paper omit a very important variable in determining student success: teacher ability. One study found that teachers have three times as much influence on students' academic development as the school they attend (Buddin, 2010). Another study states that a one standard deviation improvement in teacher quality has a greater impact on students than a ten-student reduction in class size (Rivkin, Hanushek, & Kain, 2005). The challenge is that teaching ability does not easily lend itself to quantitative measurement. One form of measurement that has recently gained traction is the value-added approach. The value-added approach measures teachers on their ability to increase a student's relative test score from a previous year. In essence, a student's past performance on tests is used to project his or her future results. The difference between the prediction and the student's actual performance after a year is the \"value\" that the teacher added or subtracted. For example, if a third-grade student ranked in the 60th percentile among all district third-graders, he would be expected to rank similarly in fourth grade. If he fell to the 40th percentile, it would suggest that his teacher had not been very effective, at least for him. If he moved into the 80th percentile, his teacher would appear to have been highly effective. Any single student's performance in a given year could be due to Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 26other factors \u2014 a child's motivation and attention could suffer during a divorce, for example. But when the performance of dozens of a teacher's students is averaged often over several years the value-added score becomes more reliable (Felch, Song, & Smith, 2010). A study using the value-added approach to measure teachers found that students with teachers in the top 10% in effectiveness ranked 17 percentile points higher in English and 25 points higher in math. The study discovered that t eachers with the highest value-added scores can be found in all types of schools and are not concentrated in high income areas (Buddin, 2010). Academic educational research has built a substantial case showing that teacher ability has a significantly greater impact on student success than any other common measure. Unfortunately many teacher unions are reluctant to use the value-added approach, fearing that standardized tests are flawed and do not measure the intangible benefits of good instruction (Felch, Song, & Smith, 2010). There are drawbacks and limitations to the value-added approach to teacher evaluation. In most districts a value-added approach would only allow measurement of a portion of teachers. The value-added approach must have a base-line number for each student in order to measure each subsequent teacher. In Jefferson County Public Schools, for instance, only fourth and fifth grade teachers could be measured using the value-added method. The use of standardized tests as the benchmark for performance provides an incentive to teachers to teach to the test. Another issue arises once the value-added statistics are released; every parent would want their child in the classroom of the best teacher, which is not feasible. It would be very difficult to decide which students are placed with the most effective teacher and even more difficult to explain to parents why their child was placed with an ineffective teacher. Educational technology, special programs, and high test scores can be seductive when faced with the challenge of selecting a school. However, in reality, these things matter very little. Great teachers are what change Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 27the outcome for children. School systems reward teacher credentials and experience even though neither has the impact on student success, as does an exceptional educator. One line of thinking postulates that school systems should reward teachers for their ability to motivate and improve student- learning outcomes. The type of measurement used may be debatable; however, the importance of teacher quality is clear. Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 28Bibliography Audette, R., Algozzine, R., & Warden, M.

Historically, the student population in the high school has lacked substantial racial and ethnic diversity, hosting a predominately white population. In the 2008-2009 instructional year, the school serviced 785 students, 97 percent of whom were white. The remaining population consisted of 1.4 percent multiracial students, 0.5 percent Native American students, 0.4 percent black students, and 0.4 percent Asian students. Of the population, 44 percent of all students receive free or reduced-price lunches. Sixty-two tenth-grade students participated in the study: twenty-seven boys and thirty-five girls. These students vary in achievement levels, ranging from low achieving special needs students to high achieving students. They all spend a forty-nine-minute period in Miller's English class five days each week. Miller has been teaching tenth-grade English at Crawford County High School for all five years of her teaching career. As the students work to improve their writing skills in the English class, they engage in a variety of formative assessments, including in-class assignments, homework assignments, and checkpoint quizzes. One commonly used assessment in the English course is a written composition Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 32that demonstrates the student's level of mastery within a particular genre of writing. Students are required to publish one composition in every nine-week period, and the difficulty level of the composition increases throughout the year, culminating in an independent research project. To prepare for this type of assessment, students engage in model analysis, brainstorming, drafting, revision, editing, and ongoing peer and self-assessments using checklists. Also, students complete quizzes to assess their understanding of the writing skills involved in the unit. Throughout the unit, written and verbal feedback is provided on student performance. At the end of the second grading period, students were consistently making the same types of mistakes in their writing. Specifically, students who were inconsistent in their development of topic sentences continued to be inconsistent in subsequent drafts, despite teacher-provided feedback. According to McMillan (2007), it is realistic to consider that students' underdeveloped writing skills might be due to a teacher's inability to give effective feedback\u2014feedback that is frequent, immediate, specific, and descriptive. McMillan further emphasized that some teachers do not provide feedback for students to process information and encourage neural connection consolidation through learning by rehearsal. In providing feedback on the same day that the work was completed, perhaps the students were not encouraged to experience better information processing and memory retention. According to Goswami (2008), successful neural consolidation occurs through an incremental approach. Applied to the instructional feedback issue, this indicates that feedback which allows students to gradually, methodically gather information may be more effective than immediate, spontaneous feedback. Furthermore, encouraging repeated exposure to learning material through next-day feedback may lead to incremental neural consolidation. This teacher inquiry project was based on the question: Will delayed feedback improve student learning more effectively than immediate feedback?Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 33Literature Review The core concept in this study, the ability of delayed feedback to allow for optimal neural consolidation in an attempt to improve student learning, can be supported by existing research. Current understandings of neural consolidation point to the importance of rehearsal and elaboration in the process of strengthening and consolidating neural connections (Schunk, 2008). According to Woolfolk (2004) and Goswami (2008), people learn through repeated, increasingly in-depth, and incremental exposure to material. When applying this to a classroom setting, rehearsal and elaboration appear to be most effective when they are integrated into the coursework over a period of several days, because when students rehearse their learning for only one day, retention is less successful (Johnson, 2010). This classroom application might be explained by Woolfolk's (2004) description of forgetting: students forget information when new information interferes with remembering or when time delay weakens the memory and weakens the neural connection. Unfortunately, teachers are required to continue introducing new information each day and time must pass before major assessments occur; direct instruction and practice for just one skill or fact cannot be repeated every day. The logical step is to find ways to incorporate learning into the course through the use of feedback. Feedback seems to be one key component in the process of teaching to encourage better information processing through rehearsal and elaboration. Other researchers corroborate that feedback can be effective in providing opportunities for learning. Woolfolk (2004) identifies that frequent reviews and elaborate feedback are among the most important things that lead to improved retention. Additionally, an experimental study of feedback revealed that feedback offers further encoding opportunities (Smith & Kimball, 2010). Upon understanding the power of feedback, it becomes necessary to understand how to use feedback effectively by considering when it should be provided. The commonly held view of feedback is that the timing should be immediate (Brookhart, 2008b; McMillan, 2007; Schunk, 2008). However, Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 34closer examination of the feedback reveals that sooner is not always better. Brookhart (2008b) advocates that in some learning situations, such as when older students are learning complex skills and processes, delayed feedback is actually more useful. Also some research indicates that other factors, such as specificity and descriptiveness of the feedback, are more important than immediacy (Lipnevich & Smith, 2009; Brookhart, 2008a). The reality of teaching seems to tell us that educators cannot provide descriptive, specific feedback to every student immediately after an assessment. In many cases, teachers need to take time to develop and assign meaningful feedback, and in taking this time they may avoid providing useless or damaging feedback for the sake of immediacy. These ideas combine to suggest delayed feedback can be more effective than immediate feedback. Although research on the effectiveness of delayed feedback requires further development, a few studies point to some interesting patterns. One study of the effects of feedback reveals students perform best when they receive detailed delayed feedback that appears to be designed by the instructor (Lipnevich & Smith, 2009). Another study, which focused on strategy use rather than correctness, found individuals who receive delayed feedback in a structured environment more consistently use the same strategy (Golec, 2004). This study is particularly interesting in classrooms where teachers are trying to teach students to internalize a problem-solving or reading strategy. Finally, the Smith & Kimball (2010) study revealed that delayed feedback strengthens the memorization of correct responses by providing encoding opportunities over a period of time. These studies indicate that there is validity to the theory that delayed feedback may be more effective than immediate feedback if the feedback is structured correctly. Instructional Implementation In Miller's class, all students have a desktop computer at their workstation and have access to the online classroom program Moodle (www.moodle.org), which is used to administer most assessments. Moodle has many feedback options teachers can use to communicate with the students. Prior to the instructional week of the experiment, four assessments were created in Moodle, each a multiple choice question. Although writing Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 35skills are best assessed through actual student compositions, an objective assessment method is important to avoid skewing the results with subjective assessments. For the first and second assessments, the immediate feedback option in Moodle was selected. This function allows students to see their point earnings, their percentage, the test item, the correct answer, and a teacher-created explanation of why the option the student selected is correct or incorrect the moment they submit their online assessment. For the third and fourth assessments, the delayed feedback option was selected. This function requires the students to wait until the testing window closes to receive their feedback. The testing window was set to last twenty-four hours so students could not see their results until the day after the assessment. Day 1 A review of topic sentences was conducted in a large group setting. Students viewed sample topic sentences paired with appropriate paragraphs using the Smart Board. The students also practiced creating topic sentences for their own writing pieces. Day 2 At the beginning of class, students used Moodle to participate in the first assessment. They answered a multiple choice question in which they were asked to read a paragraph and then select from the list of options the sentence that works best as a topic sentence for the paragraph. Immediately after the assessment, the students viewed their results and feedback. Day 3 The second assessment was identical to the first. Using Moodle, the students answered the same multiple choice item that was attempted on the first assessment. They received feedback immediately after the attempt. This assessment documented how much retention students demonstrated in response to the immediate feedback provided on day two. Again, topic sentences were not discussed for the remainder of the day. Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 36Day 4 For the third assessment, the students used Moodle to answer an item that was comparable to the first two assessments. Like the first two, the assessment was a multiple choice item and required the students to read a paragraph and select the option that provided the best topic sentence for the paragraph. The content of the paragraph and options was different from the first two assessments. When the students submitted their work, they received no feedback, score, or grade for their work. There was no further mention of topic sentences, though some students expressed their displeasure about the lack of immediate feedback. Day 5 When students arrived to class they were instructed to view their feedback for the previous day's assessment. Then they were instructed to attempt the fourth assessment, which was identical in format and content to the third assessment. Once again they received no immediate feedback and were dissatisfied with this. This fourth assessment documented how much retention the students demonstrated in response to delayed feedback. Results The teacher-researcher studied three different 10th-grade English classes over a span of five days. Each student had a desktop computer at their workstation they used for daily online classroom work. Students used Moodle, an online course management system used to submit class work, homework, or take a test. Moodle allows a teacher to set different parameters for feedback. For our study we used immediate and delayed feedbacks. The immediate feedback was given as soon as the students submitted their answers, and the delayed feedback was given 24 hours after the students submitted their answers. The results were summarized in Figure 1. The data show that delayed feedback resulted in more correct answers. The comparison between percentages of correct answers supports the theory that delayed Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 37feedback is more effective than immediate feedback. Apparently, periods 3, 6, and 7 consistently showed evidence of better student learning. The data imply that delaying feedback provided more opportunities for students to process information through elaboration and rehearsal. Figure 1: Percentage of correct answers after immediate and delayed feedback Reflection of Study The purpose of this study was to answer the question: Will delayed feedback improve student mastery more effectively than immediate feedback? As educators, we want to make sure we are providing adequate feedback to our students in a timely manner. How much time should we provide our students when giving feedback? Are they more likely to be successful with immediate feedback or delayed feedback? At Crawford County High School, students were tested by means of a computer prior to: immediate feedback, twenty-four hours after immediate feedback, before delayed feedback and after delayed feedback. The results show that next-day feedback produced more favorable results than same-day feedback. Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 38The results of the study were useful when determining the amount of time we should wait to deliver feedback in a multiple choice assessment. In the case of the experiment at Crawford County High School, feedback was found to be more beneficial when it was delayed. Miller's English classes showed delayed feedback strengthens the retention of correct responses by offering encoding opportunities over an extended period of time. Delayed feedback can lead to longer knowledge-retention. Immediacy should not be overemphasized. Instead, specificity and appropriateness are found to be more important. While immediate feedback is appropriate in some learning situations, the use of delayed feedback can be more appropriate for complex learning because it allows for extended exposure to the material. When students are exposed to delayed feedback, they are more likely to commit to and internalize a strategy. Along with exploring many other applications of cognitive neuroscience in teaching, this finding coincides with Goswami's (2008) use of the connectionist model to explain the student's experience of incremental learning. Also, giving effective feedback implies that when the process by which neural connections are formed and consolidated is under way, it is important for teachers to emphasize rehearsal and repeated exposure to the learning material. The researchers encourage teachers to provide effective feedback to help students learn. There are benefits in helping students recall their own answers by delaying feedback. The spaced time when processing information tends to favor delayed feedback, which gives more opportunities for students to elaborate and rehearse ideas. The study implies that processing difficulties at the time of decoding information can enhance memory and enable learners to correct more errors. The researchers believe the results of the study contribute to the understanding of how to best help children and adults correct their errors. Sometimes incorrect answers must be allowed to dissipate or they might interfere with the learning of correct responses. Future studies should consider other variables when giving effective feedback. The age of students might influence the ability to process, recall, rehearse, and retain information. Students also have internal and external motivations to correct errors which might have a direct or indirect influence Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 39on responding to a teacher's feedback. Either way, providing feedback is a long-standing component of effective instruction. If teachers want students to learn, then teachers should give meaningful feedback to students' work. This study would like to send a message to all teachers that \"what is learned\" as a result of feedback is not always just the stamping in reinforcement of a response; rather, under some conditions, students can build a cognitive plan that allows them to generate their own internal procedure for acquiring feedback.Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 40Bibliography Brookhart, S.

Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 41Differentiated Instruction and Students Who Struggle with Addition and Subtraction Kristin Vogel Problem Statement This study was conducted at Fairdale Elementary in the Jefferson County Public School district in Louisville, Kentucky. The school population total is 524 students and includes 314 white, 123 African American, 67 Hispanic, 8 Asian/Pacific Islander, and 29 other students. Eighty-four percent of students receive free or reduced-price lunches; 50 percent of them also receive nutritional assistance for home through our Backpack Buddy program. Fairdale Elementary has inherited a diverse culture this school year by becoming an International/Cultural Studies and Language Magnet school. I teach in a fourth-grade classroom containing twenty-four students: eleven male and thirteen female. Three have Individualized Education Programs (IEP), and three have Integrated Learning Therapies (ILT). Five students\u2014 two male and three female\u2014participated in this study. At the beginning of the school year, I administered a math assessment on third-grade standards to pinpoint what knowledge my students bring with them to fourth grade. Based on this information, I create and teach a small unit to review place value to construct a strong foundation for each student in math. We work with manipulatives and I assess student knowledge of place value before we move on to working with addition and subtraction. As the year progresses, we circle back to these foundations through review and by incorporating them into word problems and other applications. A strong mathematical foundation is important for students to process algorithms and to problem solve. I became frustrated and alarmed Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 42when I found that several students in my class did not know their basic addition and subtraction facts, especially when most students have a good foundation with place value. I began to question why they did not have this foundation and began to think of ways to help them develop basic addition and subtraction skills. When we began our unit on addition and subtraction, we started out by discussing the following vocabulary words: addition, subtraction, regrouping, sum, and difference. Next, I modeled how to set up a problem, worked through the problem, and discussed lining up the numbers by place value, how to regroup, and how to add and subtract two-digit and three-digit numbers in each place value while remembering to add any numbers carried over. This was the way I was taught, and as we moved along everyone seemed to understand the skill. After direct instruction I gave the students some problems to work through on their own and discovered they did not understand the concept. After investigating student errors, I found that they were not applying the concept of regrouping when using addition and subtraction. I began researching theories and studies related to this area of mathematical instruction. In an article regarding instructional effects on mathematics, Blote, Burg, and Klein (2009) found a correlation between conceptual understanding and procedural skills among students. From this research the authors determined students must actively build on their own mathematical knowledge, leading me to think about the importance of differentiated instruction as a means for helping my students understand how and why we add and subtract in a way that makes sense to them. I began to see why adding and subtracting could be so difficult for these students because large group instruction had been my teaching approach. From here I was able to frame the following question for my research: How can the implementation of differentiated instruction help students who struggle with addition and subtraction? Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 43Theoretical Framework Differentiated instruction, based on student learning styles, can help provide students with a developmentally appropriate education. Providing students with varied methods to add and subtract allows them to understand concepts through their preferred method. For example, students could use a procedural value listing (PVL) (Blote, Burg & Klein, 2009): 57 + 36 = 93 could be solved as A. 50+30 and 7+6, B. 57+30+6, C. 57+3 and 30+3 or through any combination that makes sense to the student. Lev Vygotsky's zone of proximal development (Subban, 2007) supports the fact that students are developmentally unique at different stages and should be instructed at their level of understanding. The essential key to my study is to determine how students can conceptualize addition and subtraction in a way that allows them to comprehend these skills. Marcy Goins (Personal Communication, 2009), a colleague who uses differentiated instruction in her classroom, helped me realize how showing students different methods of learning allows them to take ownership and make choices about what strategies work for them. After working with K-5 students, Goins found students have fewer behavior issues and are more engaged when they are shown different methods to solve a problem. She explained that when she allows students to work on activities geared to their ability and learning styles, they are more successful. When limiting students to the use of one strategy, some students are less likely to be active participants in their own learning. Using small groups has also proven to be successful because working one-on-one can reveal students' individual learning strengths and weaknesses. When planning lessons for math, I try to incorporate collaborative learning and hands-on activities, as well as direct instruction. Despite the use of engaging activities, there are usually students who struggle with the concepts because they do not understand the skill or they are not developmentally ready. Cox (2008) writes \"differentiated instruction is 'responsive' teaching rather than one-size-fits-all teaching\" and this made me consider how my struggling students were not benefiting from the instruction Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 44that worked for the majority of the class. My instruction for these students should be tailored to their needs and based on their readiness. From here, I considered using tiered activities, based on the same skills, for students to allow them \"routes of access\" (Cox, 2008) to help them learn how to add and subtract. The article \"Creating a Differentiated Mathematics Classroom\" suggests a two-step approach when differentiating instruction: begin with defining specific goals by telling students what they would learn and then helping them to explore why we use the skill and how it works (Strong, Siler & Thomas, 2004). This approach made perfect sense and I realized my struggling students obviously did not understand why and how addition and subtraction are important and therefore they were having difficulties performing these algorithms. I began to see how differentiated instruction was more than just giving students different assignments: differentiated instruction is about \"helping students see themselves in a better light\" by challenging themselves and helping them feel a sense of accomplishment (Strong, 2004). After establishing this core component to my study, I began to look for strategies I could use with this group for addition and subtraction. Instructional Intervention The instructional implementation started with a pre-assessment on student knowledge of two-digit and three-digit addition and subtraction by having them answer 16 questions total. In her study, Flores (2009) explored the teaching strategy of using concrete-representational-abstract (CRA) sequencing. For my study this sequence would allow student use of manipulatives at the concrete level, drawings of place value blocks to symbolize numbers at the representational level, and finally, answering questions from their prior knowledge alone. This would allow me to gain insight on how they make sense of adding and subtracting through each level, while showing me when they are ready to move to the next level. From here students explored different methods of addition and subtraction to ensure they understood the concept before they were asked to apply the skill to a word problem. Teaching to the middle or majority of students' ability was common in most classrooms, but this study allowed students to understand Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 45addition and subtraction in a way that best fits their learning style and ability through the use of differentiated instruction. Below is a description of sequential instruction using the CRA sequence strategy. Day 1 For the first lesson, students began by solving two-digit addition and subtraction problems, without regrouping. Students used cubes and place value mats to manipulate the numbers in each problem. Using the cubes allowed students to visualize the processes of regrouping and carrying. While students were working, I formatively assessed each one of the five students by watching and listening to how they processed information and made sense of at least one problem through one-on-one discussion. Day 2 The lesson for day two was similar to day one; however, I introduced regrouping using the cubes. As we worked though problems, I noticed students were dependent on the cubes to add one-digit addition and subtraction problems. Monitoring students one-on-one revealed they had not mastered or memorized their one-digit addition and subtraction problems. As part of the responsive teaching approach of differentiated instruction, I modified my instruction on the second day and tailored my teaching approach to my students' needs. We practiced solving one-digit addition and subtraction problems using manipulatives and then gradually introduced them to the use of number symbols. I focused on reviewing with them the concept of place values in numbers. One-on-one discussion was arranged and CRA learning sequence was integrated for learning exercises. Assessment of learning was done through practice problems involving one-digit addition and subtraction. Day 3 For the next lesson, students practiced similar addition and subtraction problems, this time using a number strip from 0 to 20. To introduce this lesson, students watched a five-minute video on BrainPOPJr. Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 46(www.brainpopjr.com), which helped to explain how to count up and how it is easier to start with the larger number when counting up. After this, we worked through a few problems and discussed the strategy of counting up and counting down to solve basic addition and subtraction problems. For example, when regrouping and solving 13-6, you can count down 6 times from 13. Starting with 12 then going to 11, 10, 9, 8, 7. We used our fingers to keep track as we counted down. This idea originated after the second lesson when I realized each of the five students struggled with this concept within the two- and three-digit problems. Day 4/Day 5 We started these lessons with number lines to review skills from day three. Instead of continuing with two- and three-digit problems, we focused just on two-digit problems without regrouping. Without being able to practice this skill, more students simply could not continue. After two days of review in small group, as well as similar practice for homework, students were beginning to show mastery. Day 6/Day 7 Students were given two- and three-digit problems and were allowed to use number lines to reinforce counting up and down to solve basic facts that occurred when regrouping. They worked individually as I continued to monitor them within the small group. With the intervention coming to an end, we discussed how they would retake the pretest using their newly obtained knowledge. Critical Friend I am proud of being effective at collaborating with other teachers both on and off grade levels. Education is more successful when people work together. I would say that at Fairdale Elementary a teacher's door is never closed. Marcy Goins has been the one to work closely with me throughout this process and has provided me with great insight on how to differentiate instruction in my classroom. Goins and I both teach on the fourth-grade Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 47team and collaborate on math and science instruction. In previous years, she has been our collaborative ECE teacher and has assisted me with ways to meet the needs of struggling students. Goins was present during my videotaped lesson and afterward assisted me in analyzing the instructional methods I used during my study. Analyzing my lessons throughout this process with Goins proved beneficial to my understanding of how differentiation makes a great difference for individual students. With her ECE background, Goins was a strong resource for me to have during this study. She began by guiding me to resources for my background study and evaluated my methods of teaching, which helped me enhance this study. Analysis of Video The videotaped lesson took place during my third day into the study when the focus was on introducing students to number strips. A key strategy I wanted students to pick up on was how to count up or down when solving simple addition and subtraction problems. Goins and I observed students using the number strips and as the practice continued two students began to internalize this concept. We could see them counting up and down in their head or whispering it to themselves, but without the use of the number strip. We shared in the celebration of this success because these students understood the concept and were not relying on the number strip. As a result, we concluded that differentiation on this concept was crucial for these students and would enable them to be more successful when it came time to master two- and three-digit addition and subtraction. Analyzing the video enabled me to evaluate my teaching methods and means of differentiation, as well as to reflect on student reactions to the lesson. On a positive note, the analysis reinforced that small group instruction, as well as differentiated instruction, was appropriate for this group of students and was needed on a daily basis. All students in the group responded to the use of manipulatives, step-by-step instructions, and one- on-one interaction. Reviewing the video also made me think of how many teachers work with students like this for reading, but why not in math? By Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 48seeing the level of success from this method, I will continue to use these strategies to enable students who struggle with whole-group math instruction. Data Analysis Prior to this study, students were assessed on sixteen two- and three- digit addition and subtraction problems. The assessment included eight addition and eight subtraction problems, some including regrouping. This assessment helped me to determine how I would differentiate instruction for these students, based on the areas in which they struggled. The main issues I saw: students made mistakes with basic addition and subtraction within the main problem, they had difficulty with knowing how to regroup, and some had trouble with knowing to add or subtract the bottom addend from the top addend. After the study, students were given the same assessment; below are the results displayed in various graphs: Figure 1. Scores in the pre- and post-assessments. Figure 1 shows the number of answers students completed correctly out of 16 total on both the pretests and posttests. All five students made tremendous gains after the intervention of this study was concluded. All students answered at least six more correctly on the posttest as compared to the pretest. Student B scored the lowest on the pretest, yet she made the most gains by answering 10 more correctly on the posttest. Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 49Figure 2. Percentage score on the pre- and post-assessments. Figure 2 shows the percentage students scored on the pre- and post- assessments. Each student made comparative gains, which is evident from the lines representing each assessment. There is a positive correlation between each of the post scores and their relationship to the pre-assessment score. Student B made the most gains in questions answered correctly; however, she still scored the lowest on the post-assessment. My formative assessments indicate she still struggles with being consistent in using the strategies we have worked on; however, I am confident that with further one-on-one instruction she will be able to perform on a much higher level as the year progresses. Letter Grade Student A B- Student B D- Student C B+ Student D B+ Student E B- Table 1. Final letter grade after the intervention Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 50Table 1 above shows that all students failed the pre-assessment with each student having a letter grade of an extremely low U. The final letter grade for all students was in the B category, with the exception of Student B, who scored a D-. Student B consistently struggled with the lessons in comparison to the other students in the study. However, there was significant improvement of her performance after the intervention. The results of my instructional intervention show how the implementation of differentiated instruction helps the students who struggle with two-digit and three-digit addition and subtraction. I would consider that the core approaches of focusing on individual students' CRA learning sequence, engaging them in different methods of learning, and responding to their individual needs to help them catch up with lessons are instrumental to the effectiveness of the intervention. Reflection of Study Differentiated instruction is something I use on a daily basis, but after completing this study I learned that using differentiated instruction intentionally for specific students makes the difference for struggling students. The rationale behind this study was to determine how to help struggling students to understand two- and three-digit addition and subtraction concepts. The evaluation of the results led me to conclude students made improvements and therefore will be able to master two- and three-digit addition and subtraction with further practice. The Blote, Burg, and Klein (2009) study concluded that allowing students to find a variety of ways to make connections with addition and subtraction is key to helping students understand these operations. As mentioned in the Strong, Siler, and Thomas article (2004), students had to be able to understand how and why we add and subtract, and this concept proved to be true in my research: all students made gains and now have a better understanding of addition and subtraction skills. To me, this study was a success because I put a great deal of effort into planning, teaching, and reflecting each day. As in any day, I reflected after each lesson and made changes to plans as I saw necessary. Teachers have a tendency to teach the way they were taught. I was taught without Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 51consideration to my individual needs and strengths to learn math. In contrast, through this teacher-research project, I definitely learned that students all learn differently and need opportunities to see learning in different lights. Lev Zygotsky's zone of proximal development helped me to understand all students are developmentally at different stages. This is where my study began in the first place, because these students were not ready for two- and three- digit problems. I had to back up my instruction to find out what they were ready for, which turned out to be basic addition and subtraction problems. Without making this change and helping students with these foundational skills, I doubt they would have mastered these higher-level problems. In conclusion, this teacher action research process provided me with several learning opportunities. It provided me with chances to collaborate with my peers, to reflect on my teaching and plan for instructional interventions using research, and to learn new strategies to better help my struggling students in the classroom. In the future, I feel confident in my ability to research and successfully find answers to questions I have in my classroom. I also feel I have knowledge I could share to better enhance my peers' instruction.

Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 55About as Happy as We Ought to Be: An Evolutionary Perspective on the Pursuit of Happiness Jeffrey Clarke While the topic of happiness has been debated for centuries by everyone from philosophers to farmers, the systematic study of happiness is quite a recent phenomenon. Empirical analyses began to emerge in the 1960s and 1970s with the work of Wilson (1967), Bradburn (1969), and Fordyce (1977), and accelerated in the 1980s with the ground-breaking efforts of Ed Diener, who has since published more than 200 articles on the topic (Eid & Larsen, 2008). In the late 1990s, the study of happiness, or subjective well-being as it is referred to in the psychological literature, became the centerpiece of a new discipline of psychology called positive psychology\u2014the scientific study of what makes life most worth living, namely the uncovering, understanding, and promoting of human strengths and virtues that foster healthier, happier, more productive lives (Peterson, 2006; Snyder & Lopez, 2007). As one point of departure for this new initiative in psychology, early research focused on illuminating the causes and correlates of the happy, satisfied life. Not surprisingly, happy people tended to be physically healthy, employed, and married with many deep, satisfying friendships and a more extraverted personality type (Argyle, 1999; Wilson, 1967). More recently, in addition to delineating the qualities of happy people, researchers have begun to map the neural correlates of happiness (Urry et al., 2004), identify and test strategies for increasing one's happiness (Lyubomirsky, 2008), and determine the proportion of happiness that is influenced by one's genetic heritage (Lykken & Tellegen, 1996). To date, the study of subjective well-being has been almost exclusively devoted to delineating the components of happiness and how these components work. However, notably absent from this impressive Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 56body of work have been efforts to address ultimate explanations for happiness\u2014the question of why happiness exists in the first place. In recent years, this gap in the research is beginning to be addressed by a relatively new field known as evolutionary psychology , which studies the mind and human behavior as a complex assembly of adaptations that evolved as solutions to specific problems repeatedly encountered by our ancestors in the distant past (Confer et al., 2010). Synthesizing the logic and methods of modern evolutionary biology and modern psychology (Buss, 2008; Pinker, 2009), this approach has been utilized to examine the nature and function of happiness, identify domains of critical importance to happiness, and generate novel hypotheses about happiness not produced by other psychological perspectives (Hill & Buss, 2008). The purpose of this paper is to briefly review the literature on subjective well-being from an evolutionary psychological point of view and highlight some of the unique contributions of this approach to the topic. The Concept of Subjective Well-being To better appreciate what evolutionary psychology has to say about happiness, it is critical to understand how subjective well-being is defined and measured in the empirical literature. Psychologists generally conceive of subjective well-being as having two components: an affective (or emotional) component and a cognitive (or evaluative) component (Diener, Suh, Lucas, & Smith, 1999). Within the affective component, emotional experiences are divided into those that feel pleasant when they occur (positive affect) and those that feel unpleasant when they occur (negative affect). Thus, for the affective component of subjective well-being, a person who is deemed to be very happy is generally found to experience many pleasant emotions, such as interest, enthusiasm, and contentment (high positive affect) and few unpleasant emotions, such as hostility, guilt, and fear (low negative affect) (Diener, & Biswas-Diener, 2008). To measure these emotions, research participants are typically provided with a list of emotion words (e.g. interested, guilty, proud) and asked to indicate on a five-point scale (ranging from \"not at all\" to \"extremely\") the extent to which they have felt each emotion over a given period of time (Watson, Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 57Clark, & Tellegan, 1988). For the cognitive component of subjective well- being, research participants are commonly asked how much they tend to agree with statements expressing global judgments about their lives, such as \"In most ways my life is close to my ideal\" and \"I am satisfied with my life\" (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1985). When answering this type of evaluative question, one is generally reflecting on the balance of positive and negative experiences in one's life and comparing the results with one's unique personal values and expectations (Diener, Suh, Lucas, & Smith, 1999; Nettle, 2005). Consequently, based upon these self-report measures, a person is said to have high subjective well-being, or happiness, when he or she is experiencing a high ratio of positive affect to negative affect and appraises his or her life as highly satisfying. Overall, this method of defining and measuring subjective well-being does not see happiness as a mere fleeting feeling but as an enduring state of mind evaluated from one's particular point of view. Put succinctly, it clearly recognizes that \"the final judge of someone's subjective well-being is whomever lives inside that person's skin\" (Myers, 2000, p. 57). Brief and Basic Ideas of Evolutionary Psychology In addition to understanding the basic conception of subjective well- being, it is also essential to be familiar with the fundamental logic underlying evolutionary psychology. (For thorough and accessible discussions of the logic, methods, controversies, and limitations of evolutionary psychology, see Buss (2008) and Confer et al. (2010)). The following brief discussion merely presents the essential tenets of this complex topic based upon these two sources, but it should provide the general reader with enough background to begin to appreciate the evolutionary point of view. As mentioned earlier, evolutionary psychology sees our mind and behaviors as complex assemblies of adaptations formed by the process of natural selection. To clarify the important terms within this definition, adaptations can be thought of as the \"best practices\" of our ancestors, and natural selection can be thought of as the filter that allows these best practices Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 58to continue to exist and be refined over the generations (Dawkins, 2006). The following is a simple form of the logic of evolutionary psychology: 1) Throughout evolutionary time, there have been many ways to address life's challenges and opportunities, but the methods that have endured to this day are the \"best practices\" or adaptations, those that on average worked best to help our ancestors solve problems related to survival and reproduction, thus maximizing their reproductive success. 2) These adaptations were worked out slowly over millions of years to deal with specific problems that occurred over and over again in the environments of our ancestors (referred to as the environment of evolutionary adaptedness , or EEA). 3) These evolved adaptations are efficient, economic, reliable, and flexible. In other words, our ancestors' best practices, the same ones that we are endowed with today, generally involve simple rules that promote quick, decisive action over and over again in response to both threats and opportunities. 4) Although these adaptations make perfect sense for the environments in which they evolved, they often do not make nearly as much sense for dealing with our current environment. A classic example can help illustrate all four of these points (based on Sapolsky, 1999, 2004). Imagine that you are alone on a camping trip deep in the woods and you hear branches rustling in the bushes behind you along with the deep growl of a large animal, probably a bear. Instantly, you feel fear\u2014an emotion that has evolved to help protect you from danger\u2014and the entire \"best practices of fear\" are set into motion. These best practices can be thought of as one unit, or a \"program\" that is executed in life-threatening situations, such as an imminent bear attack. In short, your senses become more acute, blood rushes from your extremities to the large muscle groups used for running and fighting, bodily processes related to reproduction, digestion, and the immune system are turned off, and you are poised to decide to either flee or fight. All of these things make perfect sense if your life Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 59is in danger, and those who lived long ago and had defective or sub-optimal fear programs were likely to be found on the menu back at the bear cave. Obviously, these people were not around long enough to pass on their genes, or if they were, their progeny were likely to perform poorly in the human vs. bear contest, so the sub-optimal fear programs were gradually filtered out by natural selection. Fortunately for our ancestors, the fear program is executed in the blink of an eye in response to threats, and the program wisely turns off energetically expensive long-term projects like reproduction. In other words, the fear program says, \"Ovulate some other day. Now is not a good time. Y our body needs energy for more important endeavors right now, like saving your skin. \" The psychological and physiological cascade induced by the fear program (that persists within our bodies to this day) helped our ancestors to navigate and survive the challenging environments of long ago, and did so on average better than any other variant of the fear program that was available in the past (Dawkins, 2006). Notably, for our ancestors the psychological and physiological changes of the fear program only lasted for as long as the threat was present and were turned off automatically by the body when the threat was absent, facilitating a return to a normal, fear-free state. However, our ancestors did not have income taxes, mortgage payments, and Christmas presents on lay- away to worry about. Today, rather than just turning on the fear program in response to a physical threat, we turn it on for purely psychological reasons and leave it on for extended periods of time, which is detrimental to our health and happiness (Sapolsky, 1999, 2004). The best practice that saved our ancestors from being the main course at the bear family dinner table is now activated in response to our modern perceived psychological threats and has become a contributor to stress-related diseases and enduring negative emotions. Nevertheless, notice how the fear program is efficient (e.g. it acts in the blink of an eye), economic (e.g. it stops bodily processes that are unnecessary at the moment to conserve and mobilize energy), reliable (e.g. the cascade of events happens every time we are threatened), and flexible (e.g. the fear program generalizes from a bear to a snake to a spider to a threat produced purely by our own imaginations).Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 60The sort of logic and analyses just followed for the negative emotion of fear is paralleled in evolutionary analyses of other negative emotions such as jealousy and envy (Buss, 2000; Hill & Buss, 2008). However, it should be made clear that negative emotions are not deemed as \"bad\" and positive emotions are not deemed as \"good\" in any moral judgmental sense. Rather, these categories describe how the emotion feels to the person experiencing it, and merely indicates that either something good or something bad has happened (Nettle, 2005). Therefore, from the evolutionary point of view, a basic general analysis of positive and negative emotions says that both categories evolved in order to indicate that a change has occurred in our environment and to help us regulate three basic tasks: (1) exerting the proper amount of energy to the task at hand, (2) knowing when to stop what we are currently doing and switch to a more important activity, and (3) choosing among alternative activities to find the one that would most enhance our success at survival and reproduction (Nesse, 2005). With this background in place, the remainder of this paper will focus on what evolutionary psychology has to say about the positive emotional aspect of subjective well-being as well as how we might go about increasing the happiness in our lives. The Evolutionary Perspective on Positive Emotions Throughout the history of emotion research, positive emotions have been relatively ignored in comparison with negative ones. This fact makes good sense, since our evolved psychological mechanisms have been designed such that certain aspects of our environment demand our attention more urgently than others. For instance, emotions such as fear, jealousy, envy, and anger can easily overcome us, while happy moments are often less intense by comparison, and far more fleeting in nature (Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Finkenauer, & Vohs, 2001). Although such a design seems contrary to the happy life, without such biases we would not have survived the unforgiving environments of our evolutionary past by avoiding predators and successfully competing for mates so that our genes could be propagated (Buss, 2000; Hill & Buss, 2008). While a particular negative emotion seems to be more well-defined in the way it tends to narrow our perspective down Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 61to a distinct set of behavioral tendencies or urges, researchers have typically seen the positive emotions as less differentiated. Traditionally, positive emotions have been lumped together, with research demonstrating that they have the general functions of (1) prompting the individual to engage in activities and (2) motivating the individual to continue to perform the current activity (Fredrickson, 2006). Notably, both of these functions are seen as evolutionarily adaptive and help explain why most people report being somewhat happy most of the time (Diener & Biswas-Diener, 2008). Without such a bias toward a positive state, our ancestors may have been less motivated to explore their environments and persist at important tasks. While both of these functions are clearly essential to success in ancestral environments, recent work from an evolutionary perspective suggests that positive emotions can be considered in a more differentiated and useful framework. In the late 1990s, Fredrickson (2006) proposed the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions, which states that unlike negative emotions, which tend to narrow our perspectives, the experience of positive emotions tends to open us up to a wider spectrum of thoughts and actions, broadening the range of possibilities available to us. A body of research is accumulating in support of this hypothesis (see Fredrickson, 2006 and 2009, for reviews). For example, when research participants are induced to feel positive, neutral, and negative emotions, those in a positive-emotion condition create longer lists of things they would like to do at the moment than those in negative or neutral emotion conditions (Fredrickson & Branigan, 2005). However, this is not all that the broaden-and-build theory predicts. It also proposes that positive emotions help build personal resources, and from an evolutionary viewpoint, one's resources are critical to survival and reproductive success. Here again, evidence is accumulating in support of the building function of positive emotions. For instance, research has demonstrated that happier people are more successful in critical domains of life such as marriage, friendship, income, and work performance (Diener & Biswas-Diener, 2008). Although successes in these life domains obviously contribute to making people happier, evidence is mounting that how happy one is to begin with may actually cause these successes to accumulate (Fredrickson, 2009; Fredrickson, Cohn, Coffey, 2011 622008; Lyubomirsky, King, & Diener, 2005). In addition, positive emotions have been shown to undo the lingering effects of negative emotions and fuel psychological resiliency (Fredrickson, 2006). When taken together, these pieces of evidence, derived from an evolutionary perspective, provide a compelling case for why happier people tend to be healthier and live longer, more productive lives (Danner, Snowdon, & Friesen, 2001). By this theory, each positive emotion can also serve a somewhat distinct broadening function, complementary to the narrowing function of each negative emotion. For instance, the theory proposes that the emotion of contentment will induce people to seek familiar places and \"...creates the urge to sit back and savor current life circumstances and to integrate these circumstances into new views of self and the world, \" the emotion of interest \"...creates the urge to explore, take in new information and experiences, and expand the self in the process, \" and the emotion of joy \"...creates the urge to play, push the limits and be creative\" (Fredrickson, 2006, p. 89). An interesting example supporting the different influences of unique positive emotions on judgment and behavior was provided by Griskevicius, Shiota, and Nowlis (2010). Taking an evolutionary approach, these researchers tested how the positive emotions of pride and contentment differentially influenced product desirability. When feelings of pride were induced, an emotion felt after an important achievement that motivates public displays and drawing attention to oneself for social gain, research participants desired products that helped achieve this goal, namely products seen as status symbols such as Bulgari watches and Nordstrom shoes. Equally important, the pride condition did not enhance the attractiveness of products used in the home, such as beds, dishwashers, and vacuum cleaners. Quite the opposite was true for contentment. Participants induced to feel content preferred the home products over the public display products. The authors noted that traditional approaches to positive emotion would have predicted that all products would be more attractive no matter which positive emotion was induced. However, by utilizing an evolutionary perspective, this study was able to demonstrate that different positive emotions can have unique functions.Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 63Happiness-Increasing Strategies from the Evolutionary Perspective Moving away from the particulars of positive emotions, the evolutionary approach also has some specific suggestions for how we might increase our subjective well-being. Note that there are three basic routes to increased happiness based on the definition of happiness provided earlier. One can (1) increase the frequency of positive emotions in one's life, (2) decrease negative emotions, or (3) develop more positive evaluations of one's life as a whole. I will present a bit of evolutionary-informed research that touches each of these three areas. However, there will obviously be some overlap, since emotional experiences affect judgments of life satisfaction (Nettle, 2005). These examples will revolve around one unifying theme in the evolutionary psychological literature on the topic of subjective well-being: we will likely be happier if we develop a deeper understanding of our evolved psychologies and we come to appreciate that our present way of living is not the same as it was in the environment in which our psychological adaptations evolved Wright, 1994). Increasing Positive Emotions and Reducing Negative Emotions in One's Life Research has demonstrated that the frequency of positive emotions compared to negative emotions is critical for subjective well-being, while the intensity of emotional experiences is far less important (Larsen, Deiner, & Emmons, 1985). That being the case, the question is how we might use our knowledge of evolutionary psychology to have more positive emotional experiences and fewer negative ones. Evolutionary psychologists have several suggestions in this regard, and here are two of them: Spend more time in nature or exposed to natural environments. Archeological evidence suggests that our ancestors were hunter- gatherers for most of our evolutionary history (Hill & Buss, 2008). Frumkin Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 64(2001) summarizes this timeline with an effective analogy: \"If the last two million years of our species history were scaled down to a single human lifetime of 70 years, then the first humans would not have begun settling into villages until 8 months after the 69th birthday... [hence] for the great majority of human existence, human biology has been embedded in the natural environment\" (p.235). Even from birth we seem to have an affiliation for certain types of natural environments. For instance, when children are shown slides of landscapes, including rainforests, deserts, and savannas, most prefer savannas, which are grasslands with occasional groupings of trees, \"even though they have never been to one\" (Pinker, 2009, p. 376). Researchers generally agree that most of human evolution took place in this type of environment on the savannas of Africa (Buss, 2008; Pinker, 2009). Thus, humans have participated in the natural world of plants and animals for millennia. Plants were critical for survival \"...as a food source, for shelter, and as an indicator of water\" (Grinde & Patil, 2009, p. 2333). Likewise, animals have been a source of food, wonder, and companionship throughout the ages (Buss, 2008). Nevertheless, today we live in cities made of concrete and steel, practically devoid of natural surroundings, and most of us spend over 90 percent of our lives indoors (Woodcock & Custovic, 1998). However, in detailed reviews of the literature concerning our interaction with the natural world, researchers have concluded that having contact with nature has definite physical and psychological benefits (Frumkin, 2001; Grinde & Patil, 2009). Many studies have examined our relationship with nature through such things as having pets, having physical contact with outdoor environments such as parks and gardens, adding natural elements such as plants to our indoor surroundings, and merely having a view of nature through a window or a piece of art. Some of the benefits include reduced stress, decreased fear and anger, better self-reported health, increased pain tolerance, improved mood, improved memory, shorter hospital stays, and even increased longevity (Frumkin, 2001; Grinde & Patil, 2009; Keller et al., 2005). Unfortunately, exactly why contact with plants and animals confers these benefits remains a mystery. For instance, it has been suggested that plants and natural environments may affect us through fragrance, improving acoustics, improving humidity and air quality, or by influencing subconscious Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 65parts of our brain when we view them (Grinde & Patil, 2009). Regardless of this ambiguity, experiencing nature more often, as our ancestors did, may be a simple route to increasing our happiness. Pursue meaningful goals that are related to the adaptive problems of our ancestors. A body of research has established that the perception that one is making progress toward one's goals is an important contributor to one's subjective well-being (Snyder & Lopez, 2007). Pinker (2009) sums this idea up succinctly: \"...improvement is happiness, loss is misery\" (p. 391). However, goal pursuits can be parsed in many different ways, and research has shown that the type of goal that one chooses can also be important for happiness. For example, intrinsic goals are more essential to one's happiness than extrinsic goals, and approach-oriented goals are more important to happiness than goals directed at avoiding undesirable outcomes (Lyubomirsky, 2008). However, evolutionary psychologists point out that what can be problematic to modern humans is the size and duration of our goal pursuits (Nesse, 2005). In the not too distant past, our goals were mainly short term in nature, such as gathering food and caring for relatives. However, today we pursue Ph.D. 's into our forties. Nesse (2005) noted that, \"Our brain regulation systems were never designed to cope with efforts so long in duration, towards goals so large, with all-or-none outcomes that offer few alternatives\" (p. 24). This observation implies that smaller, more immediate goals may be more important for our subjective well-being. Recent research appears to support Nesse's evolutionary perspective on goal pursuits. For instance, it has been demonstrated that pursuing emotion-focused goals\u2014those goals that are directed at feeling states and often involve social relationships\u2014has a greater impact on one's happiness than goals that are directed at gathering information and knowledge (Carstensen, 2006). Emotion-focused goals are the type that we tend to naturally pursue when we consider time to be finite. In other words, when we believe that we have a lot of time to do things, as when we are young, our goals tend to be directed at longer term projects that require gathering Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 66knowledge and may involve delaying some positive emotional events and experiencing some negative affect along the way. However, as our time horizons contract, as when we are older and nearer to our inevitable demise, our goals tend to be directed more toward short-term tasks that have a positive effect on our emotional well-being (Carstensen, 2006; Carstensen, & Mikels, 2005). Thus, the goal orientations of those far along in years would seem to mirror those that likely dominated the everyday lives of our ancestors, namely short-term goals whose success or failure could immediately be assessed. Emotion-focused goals seem to relate directly to solving the evolutionary problems of survival and reproduction since successfully addressing both of these evolutionary challenges is intimately related to the care and maintenance of social relationships. Increasing One's Satisfaction with Life Our judgments of life satisfaction are often strongly linked to how we compare ourselves with our peers (Nettle, 2005). From an evolutionary perspective, this makes sense since the resources one attained were a reflection of one's skill and abilities and thus likely affected success in attracting the best mates. If our ancestors noticed others acquiring more resources, they would be inspired to achieve similar results in order to compete effectively. The psychological term for judging ourselves in relation to others is called social comparison, and comparing ourselves with individuals who earn more income, have more education, or are more attractive than us can lower our self-esteem and arouse the negative emotion of envy, both of which are detrimental to subjective well-being (Hill & Buss, 2008). Notably, in our evolutionary past, our peer group was likely quite small, probably consisting of between 50 and 200 people in a hunter-gatherer society (Dunbar, 1993). However today, with the advent of technological advances in communication and global media coverage, our peer group has become the entire planet. This means that rather than having a pretty good chance of being the best at something in a small group, we are constantly exposed to an almost unimaginable number of people who are better than us in every aspect of our lives (Buss, 2000; Grinde, 2002; Hill & Nesse, 2005; Nettle, 2005; Pinker, 2009). The effects of an increase in comparison group size has been the subject of empirical study, and it has been shown that when comparison group size is larger our life satisfaction decreases (Fujita, 2008). To counter these negative effects upon our life satisfaction, evolutionary psychologists have suggested that we might concentrate our attention on domains where the phenomena of social comparison seem to be irrelevant, such as in the area of \"maintaining a harmonious marital life\" (Hill & Buss, 2008, p. 72). Moreover, we can \"... take control of our comparison groups ... by taking a temporary or long term 'media fast'\" (Hill & Buss, 2008, p. 73), meaning that we can choose to stop reading fashion magazines and watching television programs that highlight domains where the phenomenon of social comparison is rampant, such as those concerning wealth and attractiveness. Conclusion: We Are About as Happy as We Ought to Be What seems apparent from scanning the list of recommendations above (i.e. increase your exposure to the natural world, pursue particular types of goals, and limit your comparison groups) is that evolutionary psychologists seem to have modest expectations for the prospect of increasing happiness. In addition to what has been discussed so far, there are several other good reasons for this cautionary approach that were not detailed in this brief paper, such as how quickly we adapt to positive experiences (Campbell, 1975), how stable measures of an individual's subjective well-being tend to be over time (Nettle, 2005), and how a high proportion of our happiness is influenced by our genetic heritage and personality Even more telling are the quotes that one finds sprinkled throughout the evolutionary psychological literature: \"Natural selection does not give a fig for our happiness. \" Nesse (1999) Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 68\"We are built to be effective animals, not happy ones. \" Wright, (1994) \"We were not designed for happiness. \" Nesse (2005) \"We are designed not for happiness or unhappiness, but to strive for the goals that evolution has built into us. \" Nettle (2005) \"Natural selection doesn't really 'care' about our happiness in the end and will readily countenance our suffering if that will get our genes into the next generation. \" Wright (1994) It seems apparent then that from an evolutionary perspective, \"The foremost reason that happiness is so hard to achieve is that the universe was not designed with the comfort of human beings in mind\" (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990, p. 8). Over the course of millennia, our ancestors had to struggle to meet the multitude of challenges that the environment brought forth, and we are their descendents, left with the adaptive mechanisms that led to their success (Buss, 2000). Dawkins (2006) sums these ideas up nicely: \"... although evolution may seem, in some vague sense, a 'good thing, ' especially since we are the product of it, nothing actually 'wants' to evolve. Evolution is something that [just] happens\" (p. 18). In addition, our general baseline mood, one of being somewhat happy most of the time (Diener & Biswas-Diener, 2008), has been worked out over deep time. This fact supports the argument that merely being somewhat happy is precisely what we are supposed to be, since it has contributed to success in life throughout the ages. Reinforcing this idea is the research that demonstrates that extremes of happiness (mania) and unhappiness (depression) are maladaptive in that they influence poor decision-making and lead to shorter, less productive lives (Diener & Biswas-Diener, 2008; Nesse, 2005). Consequently, in the view of evolutionary psychology, we are probably just about as happy as we ought to be. However, there is also hope stirring within many of the conclusions of evolutionary psychology. Since the human species developed in the challenging environments of our evolutionary past, we may be naturally Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 69inclined to thrive \"...in modern society with its complexities, competition, and choices\" (Veenhoven, 2005, p. 341). Recent research seems to support this contention. A review that considered cross-sectional data from 90 nations, national trends in happiness over the last 30 years, and findings from historical and comparative anthropology suggest that we live longer and are healthier and happier than ever before in human history (Veenhoven, 2005). Such encouraging findings are strengthened by one critical fact: we have developed magnificent brains that provide us with the power to choose when and when not to follow the urges of our evolutionary inheritance. Likewise, our newfound ability to understand our evolved psychologies gives us the power to harness them in ways unimaginable to our ancestors in the distant past. Csikszentmihalyi (1990) summed up our prospects for happiness in this way: \"People who learn to control their inner experience will be able to determine the quality of their lives, which is as close as any of us can come to being happy\" (p.2). As this quotation implies, we have the ability to choose to invest our energies in those evolutionarily relevant goals that modern psychological science has shown us are critical to the happy, satisfied life, namely the pursuits of health, meaningful work, and deep, satisfying relationships (Argyle, 1999; Wilson, 1967). We also have the choice to change our sterile unnatural environments and avoid unrealistic comparison groups. All of these choices are within our reach, if only we will put forth the effort. Moreover, research has demonstrated that simply making progress toward these worthy goals may be all that we need to do to become happier, more fulfilled human beings.Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 70Works Cited Argyle, M.

New Y ork: Pantheon Books.Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 76Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 77Sacred Communion: Recovering Self in the Environment, History, and Community in Gloria Naylor's Mama Day Cindy Myers Gloria Naylor is well known for her use of literary allusion to create powerful representations of African-American history and culture in her novels. Her novel Mama Day is no exception. Mama Day centers on the women of the Day family. The head of the family is Miranda or Mama Day, a feisty old woman who uses her vast knowledge of conjure (a mixture of spiritual and herbal magic) and mother wit to guide the island community of Willow Springs. When Miranda's grandniece Ophelia, also known by her pet names Baby Girl and Cocoa, brings her New Y orker husband George home to meet her grandmother Abigail and Mama Day, the wrath of a jealous woman endangers them all. Miranda must draw upon her powers and her connections to the earth, the ancestors, and the community to save Ophelia and guide her into peace with her identity. At the heart of this story is an important piece of land known as the other place, which consists of an ancestral plantation home, a sealed well, a family cemetery, and a special garden. Much like the Garden of Eden, the power of the other place resonates on many levels. The other place offers a unique area for exploration of the link between land and identity for black women, a minority often denied both land ownership and identity, doubly damned by gender and race. The garden and the entire natural world are transformed into an ancestor for the Days. The connection between Naylor's characters and the natural world represents more than a deed and a design. The Days exist symbiotically with Nature. They do not separate themselves from the natural world; but instead embrace their intertwined identities. Communion with the land unites past and future, self and community, hope and pain. By allowing the natural world a speakerly voice, Naylor alters the relationship between the human and natural worlds, elevating it from mutual Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 78subservience to mutual empowerment. While the significance of the other place is unique to Naylor's novel, the importance of land use in novels and in real life is a key factor in the creation and endurance of personal and cultural identity. Naylor approaches writing with a heavy emphasis on revisionism, the art of redefining previously established boundaries and ideas, because traditional limitations fail to encompass the depth and possibilities of Naylor's craft. She has not only revised the lines between reader and listener, natural and supernatural, past and present, and individual and community, she also redefines the line between nature and culture through her use of Miranda as the means for communion among the ancestors, the environment, and the inhabitants of Willow Springs. Naylor constructs Miranda as a living conduit between history, the natural world, and the supernatural to secure the identity and well-being of Willow Springs as an island and as a people. Naylor creates Miranda as a truly multivocal character. In this case we must not only consider the multiple voices within the text (the characters, the ancestors, the environment), but also the multiple types of communication presented through a single character. Miranda communicates even beyond the realm of words as the necessary link between the earth as an ancestor and the currently living generations, thus accessing the communal history of the island and people. Each relationship must be honored because \"in African American folk healing, the cosmological view connects the physical, emotional and spiritual; ancestors with descendants; nature with humans; humans with one another and the Divine\" (Mitchem African American Healing 113). Ultimately, Miranda allows Naylor to demonstrate the importance of rethinking our relationships with the human and natural world as we construct identity. Failure to recognize the importance of our communion with the ancestors and the earth endangers identity because \"When you kill the ancestor you kill yourself \" (Morrison 344). However by recognizing that \"when we love the earth, we are able to love ourselves more fully\" we may achieve a communion that engenders self recovery and wholeness (hooks 175). Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 79 Miranda's mastery of communion empowers her. Naylor clearly establishes Miranda's strength within her connections to the island which are manifest as place-connectedness, or place-sense. Place-sense is difficult to explain because geographers, historians, and philosophers, among others, all struggle to define place. In the spirit of Naylor's dedication to revisionism, I will examine place through phenomenological deconstruction. Deconstruction, based on the theories of Jacques Derrida, approaches meaning through the attempt to reduce a text (concept, argument, etc.) to its origins, which often reveals contradictions and ultimately seems impossible because of the complexity of such an approach. Every text then contains multiple interpretations that become inextricably linked but impossible to fully explore because of the limits of language. Derrida explores the limited nature of language through his theory of diff\u00e9rance: \"If words and concepts receive meaning only in sequences of differences, one can justify one's language, and one's choice of terms, only within a topic [an orientation in space] and an historical strategy. The justification can therefore never be absolute and definitive. It corresponds to a condition of forces and translates an historical calculation\" (Derrida 70). Derrida argues meaning is phenomenological, constructed in part through human experience or phenomena such as memory or imagination, and is tied to history. In the case of place, which is both a word and a concept, definition must be relative. Or in other words, place then becomes defined by both site and situation so that \"to locate is to relate\" (Lukkerman, qtd. in Casey Representing Place 266). The strongest relationships then occur on multiple levels such as the varied methods of communion Miranda practices with the ancestors, environment, islanders, and past. Place theorist and phenomenologist Edward Casey contends \"where we are ... has everything to do with what and who we are\" (Getting Back xiii). He asserts that place has the \"power to direct and stabilize us, to memorialize and identify us, to tell us who and what we are in terms of where we are (as well as where we are not )\" (Casey Getting Back xv, emphasis original). Naylor certainly demonstrates the empowerment possible through connection with Willow Springs; however, it still remains difficult to define Willow Springs as a place. Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 80Naylor confronts the difficulty of defining Willow Springs through George. When George was alive he felt frustrated with his inability to locate Willow Springs on a map. After he joins the ancestors he realizes reflectively that \"there was nothing [Cocoa or anyone else describing Willow Springs] could have said that would have made any sense to me. I had to be there and see\u2014no, feel\u2014that I was entering another world\" (Naylor 175). George's reaction demonstrates Casey's definition of place as \"descriptive and phenomenological ... we feel the presence of places by and in our bodies even more than we see or think or recollect them. Places are not so much the direct objects of sight or thought or recollection as what we feel with and around, under and above, before and behind our lived bodies\" (Getting Back Into Place 313, emphasis original). George's reaction to Willow Springs demonstrates the strength of experiencing place phenomenologically through his description of the colors coating his nose and mouth as he \"breathed in lungfuls of oak\" and if he had the words, he \"would have said it all smelled like forever\" (Naylor 175). George's reaction also indicates the transformative yet familiar nature of the environment. George's reaction proves place is both encountered and experienced. It is, according to political geographer John Agnew, \"a matter of (social) 'locale, ' (geographical) 'location, ' and 'sense of place' [which] 'combines elements of nature (elemental forces), social relations (class, gender, and so on), and meaning (the mind, ideas, symbols)\" (Buell 60). Or in other words, place has a fully constructed identity whose complexity rivals that of any person. Deconstructing place thus rejects \"conform[ing] to existing rules of how theory should address 'politics' , 'reality' or 'history'\" in favor of an approach which \"demonstrate[s] the necessary instability of meaning and the necessary fluidity of identity\" (Barnett 277-278). Deconstructing place means fully recognizing the identity of a place, which can only be achieved through a developed sense of place-connectedness. Place-connectedness requires understanding a place intimately. It encompasses \"multiple dimensions [and] cultural significances\" (Buell 56). Places become multilocal as they exist on multiple planes. Naylor clearly establishes Miranda's relationship with Willow Springs in multiple Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 81dimensions, including the environment, the supernatural realm, and the human community both past and present. Those who are truly attuned to place-connectedness exhibit awareness of \"landscape as timescape\" (Buell 77). Casey contends that \"every event happens in a landscape that straddles the uneasy boundary between earth and world, thereby engendering history as their middle term\" (Representing Place 266). Thus Miranda's ability to bridge the past with the present through the environment of Willow Springs unifies nature and culture and furthers Naylor's revisionism. Naylor's use of place to revise history demonstrates that the \"alliance between geography and history is often implicit, thus calling for demonstration and interpretation\" (Casey Representing Place 267). Naylor uses Willow Springs to rewrite the horrors of slavery demonstrating the potential for place to act in \"politics of resistance [seeking] to reinscribe place-based territorial identity in opposition to ... place eroding historical forces\" (Buell 58). Sapphira's foundation of Willow Springs as a slavery-free and black-owned ideal community revises the displacement of The Middle Passage (the journey from Africa to slavery in the colonies). Theorists quibble over boundaries between place, space, and time but generally agree they are interwoven. Thus the history of a place must be contextualized because \"places themselves are not stable free-standing entities but continually shaped and reshaped by forces from both inside and outside\" (Buell 67). Through the land, Miranda accesses the past and the ancestors, but she also becomes part of the identity and history of the land. The past remains accessible through the land because \"actions become embedded within the landscape, surviving their actors and remaining in their original location\" (Dodd 181). This connection exists within the communal memory and the natural world. Naylor demonstrates this bond repeatedly as Miranda interacts with the ancestors via the environment. Miranda literally encounters the past during Candle Walk when, as she walks beyond the family cemetery toward the other place: \"a wind ... starts whipping the dry weeds and bushes [leading her] to listen under the wind [to] the sound of a long wool skirt passing. Then the tread of heavy leather boots, heading straight for the main road, heading on toward the east bluff over the Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 82ocean\" (Naylor 118). Miranda literally encounters the memory of Bascombe following Sapphira when she left the island; \"How long did he search for her? Up and down this path... Up and down this path, somehow, a man dies from a broken heart\" (Naylor 118). His actions became absorbed so deeply by the land that Miranda could feel them one hundred and fifty-eight years later. So could the other inhabitants of Willow Springs, which is why they practiced Candle Walk. Miranda eventually learns that in her grandfather Jonah's time Candle Walk \"weren't about no candles, was about a light that burned in a man's heart. And folks would go out and look up at the stars\u2014they figured his spirit had to be there, it was the highest place they knew. And what took him that high was his belief in right, while what buried him in the ground was the lingering taste of ginger from the lips of a woman\" (Naylor 308). The description of Bascombe as a man who believes in right reflects his willingness to free the people of Willow Springs and to love Sapphira in spite of racial, cultural, and class barriers. Bascombe's actions demonstrated great strength of character, yet his character was obscured by time. Several generations of islanders only know him as the white man who originally owned the island as a plantation and as the first recipient of 18 & 23 (18 & 23 refers to the year of Sapphira's assumption of control over Willow Springs and is also used as a metaphor for numerous concepts such as power, potential, revenge, justice, attraction, etc. 18 & 23 cannot be clearly defined or assigned a positive or negative connotation.). Bascombe's name and grave have survived, but his place in the cultural memory has been reduced to the role of Sapphira's dupe. The legends vary about the ways Sapphira murdered Bascombe: smothering him, stabbing him, or poisoning him (Naylor 3). However, these legends are colorful exaggerations because Bascombe was still alive when Sapphira left Willow Springs. He grieved himself to death\u2014dying of a broken heart at only thirty-five years of age. Honoring a slave-owning white man fell away from the traditions of Willow Springs as slavery moved from everyday reality to memory. Once more, time revised history, relegating Bascombe from revolutionary to reactionary. Y et Bascombe also deserves recognition as one of the founders of Willow Springs. Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 83Bascombe continues to exist as an ancestor, communing with the Days and George even though his voice is faint from the passage of time. He can be heard most clearly at his gravesite in Chevy's Pass. Naylor describes Chevy's Pass as \"a right pretty place. Open and flat with the ocean breeze almost always whispering through the hanging moss on a big ancient oak, sitting right in its middle. With the wind in any direction you can smell the saltwater, but when it's coming from the east you can taste it ... sorta like ... dried tears\" (206). Naylor's description demonstrates how history becomes embedded in the landscape. The ancient oak is the oldest tree on the island. It has not only witnessed the island's history, it continues to endure, even through the hurricane. The moss fosters communication with the ancestors and Bascombe so that \"when the wind is right in the trees, you can hear him calling and calling the name that nobody knows\" (Naylor 206). The eastern wind tastes like tears because it blows in from Africa echoing Bascombe's grief. Even Bascombe's tombstone is \"facing due east and still standing erect\" continuing his vigil for Sapphira's return after his death (Naylor 206). George shows more respect for Bascombe than anyone else in Willow Springs. While Cocoa feels shame from a shared ancestry with a white slave owner, George considers it \"a privilege few of us had. We could only look at our skin and guess. At least you knew\" (Naylor 219). George cleans off Bascombe's grave when Miranda first takes him to Chevy's Pass. Later he returns to soothe himself after a fight with Cocoa. Just being in Bascombe's presence helps George feel better because he can identify with Bascombe's unhappiness. George considers Bascombe's feelings as a man instead of just thinking about him as a white man: \"just look at that poor slob buried there\u2014he gave her a whole island, and she still cut out on him\" (Naylor 247). While the hurricane that represents Sapphira begins to churn the ocean in a \"Tireless fury\" that soothes George, he considers \"There had to have been some days like this ... when he stood here and waited for her\" (Naylor 248). George's identification with Bascombe deepens their connection so that \"as the oak branches swished even louder in the building wind [George hears] Waste. Waste. Y es, I looked at his monument; those leaves could easily be crying that. But legend or no, for you that wasn't her name\" (Naylor 248, emphasis original). George hears the interaction between Sapphira and Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 84Bascombe in the environment because of his ability to relate to people and his recognition that there are people behind every legend. Miranda hears Bascombe and Sapphira, and the other ancestors, because she knows how to listen. Miranda experiences the deepest communion with the island and with the ancestors. Miranda uses the environment to access the ancestors by listening for their voices in the wind and the trees. Miranda hears Bascombe following Sapphira under the wind, and after Abigail eventually dies she \"turns her face up into the warm air\u2014 Y ou there, Sister?\u2014to listen for the rustling of the trees\" (Naylor 312). At the family cemetery, she deepens her connections by wearing moss in her shoes. The moss allows her to clearly hear the ancestors although they also speak through the plants such as the ginger vines on Bascombe's grave. Naylor frequently uses connections with the land to foster communication. Plants can communicate history because, as Hans Jones explains, \"with its adjacent surroundings, the plant forms one permanent context into which it is fully integrated, as the animal can never be in its environment\" (qtd. in Casey Getting Back xii). The perpetuity of this connection allows the land to bear witness. Casey claims that \"a plant, having no place to go, is never lost\" (Getting Back xiii). It makes sense then that accessing the natural world helps those who struggle feel rooted again and aids self recovery. bell hooks asserts the healing power of connecting with history and the environment in her claim that \"recalling the legacy of our ancestors who knew that the way we regard land and nature will determine the nature of our self-regard, black people must reclaim a spiritual legacy where we connect our well-being to the well-being of the earth\" (181). Naylor affirms hooks' theory repeatedly with Mama Day . Naylor demonstrates Miranda's devotion to the earth and the ancestors through her caretaking of the family garden. After the 1920 hurricane destroyed the family garden, Miranda \"claimed that garden back, inch by inch, handful of soil by handful of soil\" but it had taken her so long she worries \"if it happens again ... I ain't got another sixty years\" (Naylor 228). Y et she prepares herself by \"walking to remember in case nothing's left\" (Naylor 242-243). The Days must preserve their land and garden in order to Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 85endure. Miranda ties her well-being to the well-being of the land instead of to other forms of comfort or convenience. Her first action after the hurricane is to test the soil: \"crumbling a fistful of earth and then licking at her fingers, she knows there's reason for hope ... there's no salt\" (Naylor 254). It is clear, however, that if the hurricane had salted the land, Miranda would have begun the process of reclaiming it again, thus demonstrating her devotion to the land and the ancestors. Naylor demonstrates the spiritual legacy connecting personal and environmental well-being in the closing lines of Mama Day . Miranda approaches Cocoa while she communes with George next to The Sound: \"Under a sky so blue it's stopped being sky, one is closer to the circle of oaks than the other. But both can hear clearly that on the east side of the island and on the west side, the waters were still\" (Naylor 312). The circle of live oaks encloses the family cemetery and represents the transition from the living generation to the ancestors. Naylor deliberately chose live oaks to encircle and embrace the dead who actually continue to live as ancestors. However, the more important environmental and ancestral feature is Naylor's description of the waters as still. The water on the east side of the island represents Sapphira, her departure from the island, and the breaking of Bascombe's heart. The water on the west side of the island is The Sound, where Miranda's mother, Ophelia, drowned herself. Both women were denied peace and broke the hearts of the men who loved them. George's heartbreak differed from the sufferings of Bascombe and John-Paul because George willingly sacrificed himself for Cocoa so that she could be \"given the meaning of peace\" (Naylor 312). The stillness of the water represents the peace restored to the Day family. It reflects the joining of the past and present, the east and west, and heartbreak and peace. The still waters suggest a wholeness, which could not be fully realized without communion among the living, the ancestors, and the environment. The strongest site for communion and empowerment for the Days is the other place. There Miranda communes most deeply with the ancestors. The physical memory of the ancestors remains present in the design of the house and garden and through their belongings. The spiritual presence of Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 86the ancestors interacts through the wind and through dreams. Miranda's connection with the other place allows her to cross spiritual, natural, and temporal borders because \"the Days were all rooted to the other place\" (Naylor 285). Miranda must reconnect all of the broken relationships throughout the Day legacy in order to restore peace and heal Cocoa, thus supporting Stephanie Mitchem's assertion that \"From a black cultural view of life, human existence is not carved into separate compartments of body and soul, sacred and profane. Instead, all the assorted pieces overlap into a cosmos that is understood as integrated and whole: each portion of life is interwoven, interrelated, and interdependent\" (\"Healing\" 185). In order to heal Cocoa's body, peace must be restored to her soul. When Abigail comes to the other place seeking help for Cocoa, she says \"The Baby Girl is sick, Little Mama\" (Naylor 262). Abigail begins the process of reconnecting the past and present by using old family names. Before Miranda became Mama Day, she was Little Mama; and before Cocoa can grow into the matriarch of Willow Springs, she will have to embrace being the Baby Girl. Miranda looks into the fire to access the family past: \"staring ... past the birth of Hope and Grace, past the mother who ended her life in The Sound, on to the Mother who began the Days. She sees one woman leave by wind. Another leave by water. She smells the blood from the broken hearts of the men they cursed for not letting them go\" (Naylor 262-263). Miranda recognizes the pattern of heartbreak, realizing \"It's gonna take a man to bring her peace\" (Naylor 263). Miranda's power will not be enough. She must also draw from George's strength. George must participate in Cocoa's healing because \"Baby Girl done tied up her mind and her flesh with George\" (Naylor 265). Their relationship has become so strong that \"He's a part of her \" (Naylor 267 emphasis original). This binding of health and flesh reflects the \"view that each human life is interconnected with the other\u2014living and deceased and unborn\u2014as well as with nature and the divine. These relationships have a compelling reality that demands honor and action; failure to do so constitutes a form of sin that damages the physical and emotional, thereby creating illness\" (Mitchem \"Healing\" 185). Cocoa cannot heal, no matter what Miranda and Abigail try, Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 87until George helps too. Miranda does not learn how George can help, until she participates in communion with the ancestors, nature, and the divine. At the other place, Miranda begins her communion by recalling happy memories even though she does not have many. Recalling happier times becomes imperative: \"it's the good times she's gotta call up, or there weren't no reason to come here\" (Naylor 278). There must have been times when the house still held peace and those are what Miranda must access. Naylor allows Miranda to make a physical connection between the past and present by discovering Bascombe Wade's ledger and the bill of sale for Sapphira. However, Sapphira's name did not survive the ravages of time, causing Miranda to attempt to force the name from the magic of the other place. Miranda fails to complete her communion because \"a gift is something that's given, not demanded\" (Naylor 280). Miranda will not be allowed to commune with the ancestors, the natural world, or the divine until she is open to their message instead of her desires. Miranda feels the absence of Sapphira's name as \"a loss that she can't describe ... a missing key to an unknown door somewhere in that house. The door to help Baby Girl\" (Naylor 280). Thus the other place takes on yet another dimension as a metaphoric portal to healing. Miranda can only access that portal through her dreams where she \"opens door upon door upon door\" until she finally meets Sapphira (Naylor 283). Miranda never learns Sapphira's name, but Sapphira greets her as \"Daughter, \" thus healing Miranda's loss of her mother and her childhood (Naylor 283). The comfort of finally being a daughter begins \"to fill up the spaces where there was never no arms to hold her up, no shoulders for her to lay her head down and cry on, no body to ever turn to for answers\" replacing the loss of Ophelia (Naylor 283). Naylor portrays Sapphira's nurturing as a revisionary flood melting away each of Miranda's titles: \"Miranda. Sister. Little Mama. Mama Day. Melting, melting away under the sweet flood waters pouring down to lay bare a place she ain't known existed: Daughter\" (Naylor 283). Naylor even renders Miranda multilocal by referring to spaces and places Miranda didn't know existed. The filling of those places leads to the concept of wholeness. Sapphira heals Miranda's soul and enables her to finally rest within her sleep before Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 88telling her \"to look past the pain [when she must] go out and uncover the well where Peace died\" (Naylor 283). Miranda's communion with Sapphira links the past with the present, the supernatural with the natural, and the spiritual with the physical. At the well, Miranda must root herself within the environment by placing \"her feet tangled in the ground holly, her stomach pressed against the heart-shaped ginger\" before she can \"look past the pain\" (Naylor 284). Miranda's connection with the environment supports bell hooks' assertion that \"when we talk about healing the psyche we must also speak about restoring our connection to the natural world\" (180). Only after she braces herself in \"almost a hundred years worth of rotted moss and tangled creepers\" is she able to access the past (Naylor 283). Even then, she must open herself to a spiritual experience by relying on communion with the ancestors: \"with her eyes clamped shut, she looks at the sounds\" realizing that \"once, twice, three times peace was lost at that well\" (Naylor 284). The loss of peace also resulted in separation from the ancestors. Not one single generation of the Day family remained whole. The Days continue to honor their ancestors, but the loss of peace affects them all. According to Toni Morrison, the \"happiness or success\" of characters is related to the \"presence or absence\" of ancestral figures (343). Since \"healing is effected in repaired and restored relationships, enabling a better future, \" Miranda and Cocoa cannot succeed until peace is restored to the Days (Mitchem African American Healing 113). In order to help Cocoa, Miranda must honor all of the relationships that helped to form her. As Miranda realized when she first returned to the other place, \" All that Baby Girl is was made by the people who walked these oak floors, sat and dreamed out on that balcony\" and all of those people and their dreams must be honored to reclaim her (Naylor 278). Miranda still doesn't know how to heal the past or Cocoa until she \"opens her eyes on her own hands. Hands that look like John-Paul's\" and realizes she must expand her emotions to consider the pain of the heartbroken men in the family, including the often ignored Bascombe Wade (Naylor 285). Miranda can only help Cocoa if she overlaps the entire family history and joins with George at the other place to create a metaphysical bridge in the ultimate act of communion. Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 89Naylor, however, provides George with two ways to heal Cocoa. He can join his strength and faith with Miranda, or he can draw from \"his own place within him\" (Naylor 285). Either way, George's hands and his faith in himself are the key requirements to heal Cocoa. He must feel the same \"hope [as Bascombe and John-Paul carried] in them that the work of their hands could wipe away all that had gone before\" (Naylor 285). George already possesses great faith in himself. After growing up independent of family, community, or a sense of home-place, he can only believe in himself. Although Miranda attempts to join George with Bascombe and John-Paul through their ledger and cane, for George, \"only the present has potential, \" so the symbolic quest is only a waste of time (Naylor 126). He can only laugh bitterly at \" All of this wasted effort when these were my hands, and there was no way I was going to let you go\" (Naylor 301, emphasis original). George's faith in himself heals Cocoa at the expense of his own life. Once George lays his hands on Cocoa, his heart bursts, but they both experience peace. Naylor uses George to caution against spiritual independence and isolation. His sacrifice was unnecessary. George could have healed Cocoa by communing with Miranda and the ancestors at the other place. Miranda tries to lead George to trust her with his faith in himself, to give her his hand \"so she can connect it up with all the believing that had gone before\" spanning the past and present (Naylor 285). This connection can only happen at the other place: \" A single moment was all she asked, even a fingertip to touch hers here at the other place. So together they could be the bridge for Baby Girl to walk over\" (Naylor 285). Miranda could \"guide him safely through that extra mile where the others had stumbled\" over their own stubborn independence if he would only let her (Naylor 285). The magic of the other place, the multilocality of the other place, empowers Miranda to build a spiritual bridge to reconnect the men and women, the past and present, the hope and heartbreak of the Days. Y et George chooses, fatally, to save Cocoa by himself. Still, Naylor does not abandon him. He becomes part of Willow Springs. Each time Cocoa returns to the island, she returns to him. Her commitment to the island reaffirms her commitment to George and strengthens a communion among all three. Finally George belongs to a family, a place, a history, and a community. Indiana University Southeast: Spring 2011 90Naylor's characters, and, one hopes, her readers learn the power of communion. Communion among the environment, the ancestors, the current generation, and self creates the wholeness necessary for a truly full and happy life. As bell hooks asserts, \"self-recovery takes place when we begin to renew our relationship to the earth, when we remember the way of our ancestors\" (182). Mama Day demonstrates the potential for self recovery and points the way to make it happen. By accepting our place within our environment, our community, our history, and ourselves, we can tap into magic. Naylor defines magic as \"the flowering of human potential\" (Cleage 65). That potential includes redefining space and history. It allows us to practice resistance from the margin as well as to transcend every border that ever attempts to confine us. When we finally banish nature and culture as a dichotomy in favor of accepting the earth as an ancestor, we transcend ourselves, completing hooks' idea of self-recovery: \"When the earth is sacred to us, our bodies can also be sacred to us\" (182). Through Mama Day , Naylor demonstrates the empowering benefits of communion with the natural world to recover the sacred within ourselves.Graduate Research Journal Volume 1 91Works Cited Barnett, Clive. \"Deconstructing Context: Exposing Derrida. \" Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers 24.3 (1999): 277-293.
