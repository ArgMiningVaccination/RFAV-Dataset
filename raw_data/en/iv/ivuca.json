While animals also evolved a nervous system (\"email\") to send signals quickly and briefly, even plants also have hormones (\"snail mail) to facilitate communication between parts of an organism. Similarly to convincing women of the 1950's that infant formula was better than breast milk, in the 2000's women were convinced that menopause is a disease that needs to be treated with pharmaceuticals like Premarin (artificial estrogen, \"PREgnant MAre urINe\"), and Fosamax. While the Fosamax Farce continues, (though weakening), the Premarin market fell several years ago when it was revealed that the risks outweighed the benefits. This situation left many women, already hooked on artificial hormones, to go through a severe recurrence of their menopausal symptoms. In addition, women entering peri-menopause and menopause today continue to seek relief in the form of bio- identical hormones (\"BIHs\"). The temptation to use BIHs should be resisted for the reasons to be explained below. What Are BioIdentical Hormones The term \"bioidentical\" means that the hormones are exactly the same as those produced by the body. This is in distinction to synthetic hormones, found in the birth control pill, and those modified from other species, such as Premarin. The most common BIHs are Estradiol, Estrone (two different forms of Estrogen), Progesterone and Testosterone. Because they are made by God, they cannot be patented-- therefore there can be no monopoly on their sale, and no big profit either. This leads to a lack of funding for research. For this and other reasons, most of the assertions about the benefits and risks of BIHs have been made by extrapolating studies of hormones in different ages and disease conditions, and the use of synthetic hormones. Just because BIHs are \"natural\", they are not implicitly benign. Arsenic is also natural and organic. Taking BIHs is a serious long-term strategy that requires a thorough understanding of the short and long-term benefits and risks involved. Many holistic physicians go through a journey regarding the body's complex hormonal systems and develop a mental textbook on \"How Not to Mess with the Body's Wisdom\". Here is a summary of some of my lessons, and the conclusions: Chapter One: A Male With Hot Flashes The first patient who called my attention to this topic was a male in his sixties, who was being evaluated for fatigue and erectile dysfunction, long before the Viagra days. During one of his visits, he was fanning himself, and made the offhand comment, \"I know it sounds funny, but I think I am having hot flashes\". A light went off in my mind--hot flashes in women are caused by declining levels of female hormones--all men and women have both male and female hormones--could his hot flashes be caused by some imbalance of male and female hormones? I quickly ordered tests of his male and female hormone levels. What came back was astounding--his male hormone levels, and others, were near zero. His primary care physician immediately sent him to an endocrinologist. The endocrinologist did a few other tests, ultimately concluded that his testosterone levels were low (!?), and offered to put him on testosterone replacement. He came back to me, dissatisfied with this conclusion, as it didn't answer the whys and seemed unnatural. We found a physician who was a recognized expert in the issue of testosterone in males. After several months and hundreds of dollars of evaluations, the patient was put on testosterone! He began to feel better, \"woody worked better\", and that was the end of Chapter One. Needless to say, I was dissatisfied with this \"solution\", as there was never an explanation, and he needed to stay on hormones for the rest of his life. In addition, when men are given testosterone, their testicles shrink\u2014the work is being done for them. This also happens with the other glands. Chapter Two: A Female with Menopausal Symptoms Approximately a year later, a woman in menopause (defined as no period for 12 months) was having worsening sleep, anxiety, depression, fatigue and aches and pains. Since she needed urgent help with her sleep and mood, I sent her to a holistic colleague who was using hormones rather than drugs to help with such symptoms. With each change in hormone prescription, she would get temporarily better, or worse, but her same symptom pattern would eventually return. After two years of chasing her hormone levels, we concluded that this approach was not working. From this experience, and others, I concluded that the body has a wisdom and intention that is hard to overpower, and should be respected and listened to. Chapter Three: Thyroid Hormones I was also seeing an increasing number of patients, mostly women, complaining of symptoms sounding like hypo-thyroidism (insufficient thyroid function). They include: fatigue, dry skin, cold extremities, hair and eyebrow changes, mild depression, poor immune function, weakness and others. This often began after pregnancy, or around the time of menopause. Tests of the thyroid gland would often reveal \"normal\" thyroid function, or some anti-bodies to the thyroid gland. I would initially refer these patients to endocrinologists, but without laboratory confirmation of thyroid dysfunction, no treatment was offered; and the symptoms continued. Alternative medicine had a growing literature on \"sub- clinical\" hypo-thyroidism--not low enough to show up on tests, but low enough to cause symptoms. Some practitioners measure morning underarm \"basal\" body temperature--but such measures were often not helpful. However, there seemed little harm to give such patients small doses of thyroid hormone--again bio-identical-- the same exact stuff as made by the body. When they responded it was very satisfying. However, only 5-10% of these patients responded--the rest stayed the same, felt worse, or would only derive a temporary benefit. Chapter Four: Work With Adrenal Hormones Over the past few years, I have recognized the prevalence of \"Adrenal Fatigue\". At first, like most medical doctors, I did not believe in this condition, which is hard to measure, even by the saliva tests that are used by many holistic practitioners. However, many of these patients had been under chronic stress, either physiological (surgery or serious illness), physical (an injury), emotional, or a combination. Again, a subset of these patients, 10- 20% would respond to interventions to support or enhance adrenal gland function. It became apparent that supporting the adrenal gland without considering the thyroid, or visa-versa, could cause a worsening in symptoms after a while. 8/7/11-6 bioid_af.doc \"The Hormonal Rut\" M Cheikin MD Page 2 Chapter Five: Endometriosis, PCOS and Diabetes There are also an increasing number of women with endometriosis and \"PolyCystic Ovarian Syndrome\". These conditions, (as well as the increasing prevalence of breast and prostate cancer) are considered to be due to an excess of estrogen and estrogen-like toxins. PCOS also involves the blood-sugar regulating hormones (i.e. there are often hypo-glycemic symptoms and pre-diabetic findings on blood tests). While classic PCOS shows ovarian cysts, menstrual irregularity, obesity, male-pattern hair changes and acne, there is are many women who are slim and have regular periods but still have several of these symptoms. The prevalence of problems with blood sugar control is well-known, and is more complex than the carbs in the diet. Putting It All Together: The Hormonal Loop (Rut) These experiences have shown time and again that our hormonal systems are highly interactive, coordinated, and sensitive. It is virtually impossible to change one without affecting another; and there is a reason for what the body does. Menopause and andropause are normal phases of hormonal shifting. If there is already some dysfunction going on, then these changes may be the \"last straw\" and cause symptoms to manifest for the first time. However, it does not mean that treating with drugs, or even classifying these conditions as dis-eases is logical. Therefore, the approach that many holistic practitioners ultimately advocate is to go slowly and respectfully, working cooperatively with the mind-body-spirit system to assess and gently intervene. As an example, if a third-grade child is having problems in math with division, it is not appropriate to do the child's homework or to remove the child from math for the rest of its life. The best approach is to hire an experienced tutor who can assess the blocks and provide remedial exercises to transform a negative experience to a positive one. When this is achieved, the sense of success, growth, and skills learned can be life transforming. As another example, if you went to a doctor with a limp, he gave you a crutch, and told you to use it for the rest of your life, would you accept this treatment? Working with hormones and body transitions is the same way. The Sociology of Health Care For centuries, women, children, the disabled and the poor have been the victims of poor health care, since they have been disempowered to fund research and advocate for their own needs. Looking over the past century, besides infant formula and Premarin, there has been DES and the birth control pill (which continues for PMS and birth control). Botox, originally developed for serious neurological conditions, has become a very hot commodity, masking emotional expression. Not to mention breast implants, plastic surgery and anorexia as sweet-sixteen gifts. In Texas, they enacted a law requiring young girls to be vaccinated with Guardisil, until it was revealed that the drug company heavily lobbied to that state's politicians. Most young girls and their mothers are being scared into this treatment, though there are risks, and the efficacy is limited. Men are risking blindness to take Viagra. There was a recent recommendation that all men over 55 take Proscar to protect their prostate glands. Babies are now getting vaccinated in the first day of life--a practice that simply makes no sense. Girls are now going through puberty as early as 7 years old; one hundred years ago the average age was 17! Back to Bio-Identical Hormones Putting it all together, here is the logic against BIHs: 1. Hormonal imbalances occur at all ages and are a symptom, not a cause of underlying imbalances. 2. The body is wise and has evolved it's mechanisms over millions of years. 3. We are multi-dimensional, mystical beings, not chemical factories to be manipulated. Chronic dis-ease involves mind, body and spirit. 4. External help should not cause dependency or overwhelm natural systems\u2014it should be subtle, gentle and time-limited. 5. Safety should be proven, not assumed. 6. Alternatives should be considered, especially when symptoms are tolerable and tests suggest a favorable prognosis. 7. Holistic tests will often reveal critical nutritional deficiencies (vitamins, minerals and oils) and toxicities (heavy metal, halides, pesticides, etc) that contribute to hormone imbalance and will enable re-balancing when corrected. What's a Girl and Boy to Do? 1. Be skeptical. Don't listen to the hype of the latest fad or drug commercial. Don't buy into \"diseases\" that affect half the population. Don't buy into treatments that promise unreasonable results. Learn from the recent economic disaster that even the experts are often full of hot hair. 2. Be honest with yourself. Are you chasing an image, expectation, or youth that is incompatible with a balanced life? 3. Go to a real yoga class. Go inside, release your tension, explore your mind, body and spirit. 4. Invest in good preventive health. Drink clean water, buy organic local foods, and get rid of the toxins in your life. 5. If problems persist, work with a holistic practitioner who will do appropriate testing and look at your problems in a multi- dimensional way. \"Alternative\" treatments such as acupuncture, special diets, herbals and gentle support for the hormonal systems can be very effective in re-balancing systems.
