Please do not call us for a vaccine appointment. We are notifying patients individually when they can schedule. [Create a MyChart account](https://activation.nyulmc.org) so we can notify you. Learn more about the [COVID-19 vaccine](https://nyulangone.org/locations/covid-19-vaccine). NYU Langone is preparing to offer the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines to our patients beginning in early 2021. Members of NYU Langone's staff who are at high risk of COVID-19 exposure are starting to receive the vaccine on December 14, 2020, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's emergency use authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. How to Get the Latest Vaccine Information NYU Langone patients can create an [NYU Langone Health MyChart](http://mychart.nyumc.org) account and download the [NYU Langone Health app](https://nyulangone.org/apps/nyu-langone-health-app) to prepare to receive the latest information about the vaccine. We will send our patients information through MyChart and the app about how to receive the vaccine as soon as it becomes available. Please do not contact your doctor at this time to schedule a vaccine appointment. Timing of Vaccine Distribution to Patients \"As we begin to vaccinate our staff, extensive vaccine planning for our patients is also underway,\" says [Michael S. Phillips, MD](https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1699845974/michael-s-phillips), chief epidemiologist for NYU Langone. When we receive vaccines for patients, we will follow [guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html) for who should receive the first doses, including groups such as healthcare workers, first responders, and others who are most vulnerable to COVID-19. \"We expect more and more doses to start to become available rapidly in early 2021, so we will be able to offer the vaccine to patients,\" says Andrew Rubin, senior vice president of clinical affairs and ambulatory care. NYU Langone has also been involved in testing COVID-19 vaccines through clinical trials at our [Vaccine Center](https://med.nyu.edu/centers-programs/vaccine), which is 1 of 10 Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units in the United States funded by the National Institutes of Health.
