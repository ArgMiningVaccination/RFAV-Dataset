It's a good idea to make sure you're getting the recommended amount of vitamins and minerals for your overall health. It's relatively easy to get most vitamins and minerals simply by following a healthy and balanced diet. However, there are some vitamins that aren't found as easily in most food sources. The National Institutes of Health has readily available [fact sheets](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals/) available for different vitamins and minerals. Your body needs these vitamins and minerals for its everyday processes. For example, carrying oxygen to different parts of the body to releasing energy. In terms of vitamins, there are water-soluble vitamins and fat-soluble vitamins. Examples of water-soluble are vitamin B9 and vitamin B12 that help build proteins. Fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin D2 and vitamin K2, improve mental health, build strong bones, and fight diseases. The types of vitamins and minerals you need depend on your goals and any deficiencies you have. For example, if you're vitamin d deficient, then you'll want to improve your vitamin d intake with foods or dietary supplements. If you're on a vegan diet or want better support for your immune system, then you'll need the best sources of vitamin B12. We're going to look at one of the most common vitamin deficiencies: vitamin D deficiency. We'll also look at general benefits of vitamin D, foods that contain vitamin d, and the best supplements. Inadequate levels of vitamin d are caused by a lack of sun exposure, chronic illness, dark skin, or an unhealthy diet. More severe vitamin D deficiency can also affect pregnant women, who also have an increased risk of multiple vitamin deficiencies, or people with kidney issues. Benefits of Vitamin D When you're exposed to direct sunlight, the body produces vitamin D that benefits your: - Brain and nervous systems - Mental Health - Cardiovascular and respiratory systems - Body's ability to manage blood sugar - Immune health - Bone health Yes, vitamin D is the sunshine vitamin for healthy bones. These health benefits are especially important for older adults and developing infants. Their bones need a certain amount of vitamin d for calcium absorption. Adequate vitamin D levels are needed for those with darker skin, work the night shifts, or live in areas with limited exposure to the sun. Unfortunately, the food source for vitamin D is very limited. It doesn't provide the recommended daily value of 800 iu. Unless, of course, you're willing to consume higher-quality foods. The following are the best food sources of vitamin D: - Canned tuna - Egg yolks - Cow or soy milk - Fatty fish, such as salmon The options of good vitamin d food sources aren't very extensive. So, what should someone do if they don't get sufficient exposure to the sun? If you're not getting enough vitamin d, then the next best thing would be vitamin d supplements.
