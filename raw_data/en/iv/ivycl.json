Page updated 4 September 2023 Autumn boosters 2023 (called Winter booster in Scotland) The government has confirmed there will be an Autumn 2023 booster campaign. Those [eligible for an Autumn 2023 booster](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/jcvi-advises-on-eligible-groups-for-2023-autumn-booster) are: - all adults aged 65 years and over - residents in a care home for older adults - people aged 6 months to 64 years in a clinical risk group, as laid out in the [Immunisation Green Book](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-the-green-book-chapter-14a)(this includes people with blood cancer and people with a history of blood cancer) - people aged 12 to 64 years who are household contacts of people with immunosuppression - frontline health and social care workers - people aged 16 to 64 who are carers, and staff working in care homes for older adults. The government has not announced which vaccines will be used yet. We will update this page when we have more details. Autumn booster dates and information Here is what we know so far about the Autumn booster programme: - England - Vaccinations will start on 11 September for those most at risk, including people with immunosuppression. NHS England recommends people should be offered the flu and covid vaccines at the same time. - Scotland - Care home residents, people aged 75+ and people with weakened immune systems are being invited for covid boosters and flu jabs starting from 4 September. Invitations for other groups will follow. People should wait to be invited or prompted to book their jab(s) by NHS Scotland. Over 50s will receive a flu jab in Scotland, compared to only over 65s in England. Flu jabs for 50-64 year olds will start from 4 September. - Wales - the autumn booster programme will start on 11 September. Vaccinations for flu and COVID-19 are to be rolled out to over 65s, at risk groups and those working or living with vulnerable people. - Northern Ireland - the autumn booster programme will begin on 18 September, starting with residents in care homes. We will update this page as we find out more. As well as promoting the autumn booster programme, health authorities are advising people to take [precautions to stop the spread of covid and flu.](#stopping-the-spread-of-covid-and-flu) Shorten your booster wait We know some people are worried about attending busy vaccination centres for their covid vaccines. The NHS in England have sent us [this poster](https://media.bloodcancer.org.uk/images/Shorten_your_booster_wait_full.width-700.jpg), clarifying that you can be fast-tracked if you are immunosuppressed, so you don't have to wait in a busy queue. You may want to [print this out](https://media.bloodcancer.org.uk/images/Shorten_your_booster_wait_full.width-700.jpg) and take it to your vaccination centre, to help you ask for the extra protection. How many doses of covid vaccine have people with blood cancer been offered? The covid vaccine schedule for people with blood cancer up to now has been: - 1st primary dose - from around Jan 2021 - 2nd primary dose - from around April 2021 - 3rd primary dose - from around September 2021 - 4th dose (1st booster) - from around January 2022 - 5th dose (Spring 2022 booster) - from around April 2022 - 6th dose (Autumn 2022 booster) - from around September 2022 - 7th dose (Spring 2023 booster) - from around April 2023 Regardless of which doses you've had so far, you should get your booster doses when they are offered. Getting re-vaccinated after a stem cell transplant If you had the covid vaccine before having a stem cell transplant, you will need to be re-vaccinated after your transplant. Your transplant team will give you information on this, including when to have your vaccinations. The NHS recommends you have a course of three primary doses, followed by a booster dose. NHS England has confirmed that the bivalent vaccines Comirnaty (Pfizer) and Spikevax (Moderna) can be used for both primary and booster vaccinations. Bivalent means the vaccines target two covid variants. Anthony Nolan has more information about [re-vaccination following a stem cell transplant](https://www.anthonynolan.org/patients-and-families/understanding-stem-cell-transplants/coronavirus-covid-19-and-your-stem-cell#revaccination). Blood cancer and immunosuppression Most people who are living with blood cancer and many who are in remission from blood cancer have a weakened immune system, which makes it harder to fight off viruses and other bugs. This is called immunosuppression. Immunosuppressed people are at higher risk of getting seriously ill from covid. That's why, when covid vaccines first become available, people were prioritised for vaccination if they: - had any type of blood cancer (leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloma, MDS, MPN), whether they were on treatment or not - were immunosuppressed as a result of blood cancer in the past - had had a stem cell or bone marrow transplant in the past - had any other underlying condition that meant they were classed as \"clinically vulnerable\" or \"clinically extremely vulnerable\". Because immunosuppressed people are at higher risk from covid, household contacts (people who live most of the time with someone who is immunosuppressed) and unpaid carers were also prioritised for vaccination. Going forward, people who are immunosuppressed, including most people with blood cancer, are being offered extra vaccinations. While covid vaccinations may not work as well for immunosuppressed people, there's evidence that repeated doses can offer better protection. People who are severely immunosuppressed may also be eligible for [new antiviral treatments](/support-for-you/coronavirus-covid-19/covid-vaccine-blood-cancer/covid-antibody-treatment/) if they get covid.

What are the side effects of the covid vaccine? Like all vaccines, the covid vaccines can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Most side effects are mild and should go away within a week. Common side effects include: - a sore arm from the injection - feeling tired - a headache - feeling achy - mild flu-like symptoms - feeling or being sick Each vaccine comes with a patient leaflet that lists all the known workers who administer the vaccine can tell you about any side effects and are trained in what to watch out for. You will also be asked to wait for 15 minutes after your injection to make sure you are OK before you leave. Stopping the spread of covid and flu Practical advice from public health bodies to stop covid and flu spreading includes: - avoiding contact with others when unwell - washing hands frequently with soap and water, or using hand sanitiser - catching coughs and sneezes in a tissue (\"catch it, bin it, kill it\") - wearing a face mask if visiting someone with a weakened immune system - ventilating shared spaces as much as possible - getting vaccinated if you are eligible.
