Surprise Billing Claims Surprise Billing Claims are claims that are subject to t he No Surprises Act requirements: Emergency Services provided by Out -of-Network Providers; Covered Services provided by an Out -of-Network Provider at an In -Network Facility; and Out-of-Network Air Ambulance Services. No Surprises Act Requirements Emergency Services As required by the CAA, Emergency Services are covered under your Plan: Without the need for Precertification; Whether the Provider is In -Network or Out -of-Network; If the Emergency Services you receive are provided by an Out -of-Network Provider, Covered Services will be processed at the In -Network benefit level. Note that if you receive Emergency Services from an Out -of-Network Provider, your Out -of-Pocket costs will be limited to amounts that would apply if the Covered Services had been furnished by an In -Network Provider. However, Out -of-Network cost -shares (i.e., Copayments, Deductibles and/or Coinsurance) will apply to your claim if the treating Out -of-Network Provider determines you are stable, meaning you have been provided necessary Emergency Care such that your condition will not materially worsen and the Out-of-Network Provider determines: (i) that you are able to travel to an In -Network Facility by non - emergency transport; (ii) the Out -of-Network Provider complies with the notice and consent requirement; and (iii) you are in condition to receive the information and provide informed consent. If you continue to receive services from the Out -of-Network Prov ider after you are stabilized, you will be responsible for the Out-of-Network cost -shares, and the Out -of-Network Provider will also be able to charge you any difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Out -of-Network Provider's billed charges. This notice and consent exception does not apply if the Covered Services furnished by an Out -of-Network Provider result from unforeseen and urgent medical needs arising at the time of service. Out-of-Network Services Provided at an In -Network Facility When you receive Covered Services from an Out -of-Network Provider at an In -Network Facility, your claims will be paid at the Out -of-Network benefit level if the Out -of-Network Provider gives you proper notice of its charges, and you give written consent to s uch charges. This means you will be responsible for Out -of-Network cost -shares for those services and the Out -of-Network Provider can also charge you any difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Out -of-Network Provider's billed charges. This requirement does not apply to Ancillary Services. Ancillary Services are one of the following services: (A) Emergency Services; (B) anesthesiology; (C) laboratory and pathology H) Hospitalists; ( I) Intensivists; and ( J) any services set out by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. In addition, Anthem will not apply this notice and consent process to you if Anthem does not have an In - Network Provider in y our area who can perform the services you require. Out-of-Network Providers satisfy the notice and consent requirement as follows: 1. By obtaining your written consent not later than 72 hours prior to the delivery of services; or 2. If the notice and consent i s given on the date of the service, if you make an appointment within 72 hours of the services being delivered. How Cost -Shares Are Calculated Your cost shares for Emergency Services or for Covered Services received by an Out -of-Network Provider at an In -Network Facility, will be calculated using the median Plan In -Network contract rate that we pay In -Network Providers for the geographic area where the Covered Service is provided. Any Out -of- Pocket cost shares you pay to an Out -of-Network Provider for ei ther Emergency Services or for Covered Services provided by an Out -of-Network Provider at an In -Network Facility will be applied to your In - Network Out -of-Pocket Limit. Appeals If you receive Emergency Services from an Out -of-Network Provider , Covered Services from an Out -of- Network Provider at an In -Network Facility , or Out -of-Network Air Ambulance Services and believe those services are covered by the No Surprise s Act, you have the right to appeal that claim. If your appeal of a Surprise Bill ing Claim is denied, then you have a right to appeal the adverse decision to an Independent Review Organization as set out in the \"Grievance and External Review Procedures \" section of this Benefit Book. Provider Directories Anthem is required to confirm t he list of In -Network Providers in its Provider Directory every 90 days. If you can show that you received inaccurate information from Anthem that a Provider was In -Network on a particular claim, then you will only be liable for In -Network cost shares (i. e., Copayments, Deductibles, and/or Coinsurance) for that claim. Your In -Network cost -shares will be calculated based upon the Maximum Allowed Amount. Transparency Requirements Anthem provides the following information on its website (i.e., www.anthem.com ): Protections with respect to Surprise Billing Claims by Providers , including information on how to contact state and federal agencies if you believe a Provider has violated the No Surprises Act. You may also obta in the following information on Anthem's website or by calling Member Services at the phone number on the back of your ID card: Cost sharing information for 500 defined services, as required by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS); and A listing / directory of all In 3 NVLGPPO (1/23 )-EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 In addition, Anthem will provide access through its website to the following information: In-Network negotiated rates; and BS 1 Federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Notices Choice of Primary Care Physician We generally allow the designation of a Primary Care Physician (PCP). You have the right to designate any PCP who participates in our network and who is available to accept you or your family members. For information on how to select a PCP, and for a list of PCPs, contact the telephone number on the back of your Identification Card or refer to our website, www.anthem.com . For children, you may designate a pediatrician as the PCP. Access to Obstetrical and Gynecologica l (ObGyn) Care You do not need a referral from us or from any other person (including a PCP) in order to obtain access to obstetrical or gynecological care from a health care professional in our network who specializes in obstetrics or gynecology. The heal th care professional, however, may be required to comply with certain procedures, including obtaining Precertification for certain services or following a pre -approved treatment plan. For a list of participating health care professionals who specialize in obstetrics or gynecology, contact the telephone number on the back of your Identification Card or refer to our website, Additional Notices Statement of Rights under the Newborns' and Mother's Health Protection Act Group health plans and health insurance issuers generally may not, under Federal law, restrict benefits for any Hospital length of stay in connection with childbirth for the mother or newborn child to less than 48 hours following a vaginal delivery, or less than 96 hours following a cesarean section. However, Federal law generally does not prohibit the mother's or newborn's attending Provider, after consulting with the mother, from d ischarging the mother or her newborn earlier than 48 hours (or 96 hours as applicable). In any case, plans and issuers may not, under Federal law, require that a provider obtain authorization from the Plan or the insurance issuer for prescribing a length o f stay not in exc ess of 48 hours (or 96 hours). Statement of Rights under the Women's Cancer Rights Act of 1998 If you have had or are going to have a mastectomy, you may be entitled to certain benefits under the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 199 8 (WHCRA). For individuals receiving mastectomy -related benefits, coverage will be provided in a manner determined in consultation with the attending Physician and the patient, for: All stages of reconstruction of the breast on which the mastectomy was per formed; Surgery and reconstruction of the other breast to produce a symmetrical appearance; Prostheses; and Treatment of physical complications of the mastectomy, including lymphedema. These benefits will be provided subject to the same Deductibles and Coi nsurance applicable to other medical and surgical benefits provided under this Plan. (See the \"Schedule of Benefits\" for details.) If you would like more information on WHCRA benefits, call us at the number on the back of your Identification Card. Coverag e for a Child Due to a Qualified Medical Support Order (\"QMCSO\") If you or your spouse are required, due to a QMCSO, to provide coverage for your child(ren), you may ask the Group to provide you, without charge, a written statement outlining the procedures for getting coverage for such child(ren). Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act provides for parity in the application of aggregate treatment limitations (day or visit limits) on mental health and substance abuse benefits with day or visit limits on medical and surgical benefits. In general, group health plans offering mental health and substance abuse benefits cannot set day/visit limits on mental health or substance abuse benefits that are lower t han any such day or visit limits for medical and surgical benefits. A plan that does not impose day or visit limits on medical and surgical benefits may not impose such day or visit limits on mental health and substance abuse benefits offered under the Pla n. Also, the Plan may not impose Deductibles, Copayment, Coinsurance, and out of pocket expenses on mental health and substance abuse benefits that are more restrictive than Deductibles, Copayment, Coinsurance and out of pocket expenses applicable to othe r medical and surgical benefits. Medical Necessity criteria are available upon request. 6 NVLGPPO (1/23 )-EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 Special Enrollment Notice If you are declining enrollment for yourself or your Dependents (including your spouse) because of other health insurance coverage, you may in the future be able to enroll yourself or your Dependents in this Plan if you or your Dependents lose eligibility for that other coverage (or if the employer stops contributing towards your or your Dependents' other coverage). However, you must request enr ollment within 31 days after your or your Dependents' other coverage ends (or after the employer stops contribut ing toward the other coverage). In addition, if you have a new Dependent as a result of marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, yo u may be able to enroll yourself and Your Dependents. However, you must request enrollment within 31 days after the marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption. Eligible Subscribers and Dependents may also enroll under two additional circumstances : The Subscriber's or Dependent's Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) coverage is terminated as a result of loss of eligibility; or The Subscriber or Dependent becomes eligible for a subsidy (st ate premium assistance program). The Subscriber or Dependent must request Special Enrollment within 60 days of the loss of Medicaid/CHIP or of the eligibility determination. To request special enrollment or obtain more information, call us at the Member Services telephone number on your I dentification Card, or contact the Group. Statement of ERISA Rights Please note: This section applies to employer sponsored plans other than Church employer groups and government groups. If you have questions about whether this Plan is governed by ERISA, please contact the Plan Administrator (the Group). The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) entitles you, as a Member of the Group under this Contract, to: Examine, without charge, at the Plan Administrator's office and at other specified locations such as worksites and union halls, all plan documents, including insurance contracts, collective bargaining agreements and copie s of all documents filed by this plan with the U.S. Department of Labor, such as detailed annual reports and plan descriptions; Obtain copies of all plan documents and other plan information upon written request to the Plan Administrator. The Plan Adminis trator may make a reasonable charge for these copies; and Receive a summary of the plan's annual financial report. The Plan Administrator is required by law to furnish each participant with a copy of this summary financial report. In addition to creating rights for you and other employees, ERISA imposes duties on the people responsible for the operation of your employee benefit plan. The people who operate your plan are called plan fiduciaries. They must handle your plan prudently and in the best intere st of you and other plan participants and beneficiaries. No one, including your employer, your union, or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a welfare benefit or exercising your rig ht under ERISA. If your claim for welfare benefits is denied, in whole or in part, you must receive a written explanation of the reason for the denial. You have the right to have your cl aims reviewed and reconsidered. 7 NVLGPPO C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request materials from the Plan Administrator and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a federal court. In such case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide you the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials are not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrator. If your claim for benefits is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may fi le suit in a state or federal court. If plan fiduciaries misuse the plan's money or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. It may order you to pay these expenses, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous. If you have any questions about your plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquirie s, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, 250/10%/2250 BS 1 Notices Required by State Law Division of Insurance Inquiries For inquiries about health care coverage in Nevada, please call th e Division of Insurance within the Department of Business and Industry between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday and ask for the Division of Insurance.

Retail Pharmacy (In -Network and Out -of- Network) 90 days Note: A 90-day supply is available at Maintenance Pharmacies. When you get a 90 -day supply at a Maintenance Pharmacy, three (3) Retail Pharmacy Copayments (one for each 30 -day period) will apply. When you get a 30 -day supply, one Copayment per Prescription Orde r will apply.

Please refer to \"Specialty Pharmacy\" in the section \"Prescription Drug Benefit at a Retail or Home Delivery (Mail Order) Pharmacy\" for further details. Also see the \"Drug Cost Share Assistance Programs\" section for information about applicable cost share amounts applicable to Specialty Drugs that are eligible for cost share assistance. Please note that we may increase the cost shares listed above in order to take full advantage of cost share assistance that is available from drug manufacturers. This will lower plan costs but will not increase your cost because any additional cost share will be offset by the cost share assistance. When you get Specialty Drugs from the Specialty P harmacy, you will have to pay the same Copayments / Coinsurance you pay for a 30 -day supply at a Retail Pharmacy. If you do not use the Specialty Pharmacy, benefits will be covered at the Out -of-Network level. Orally administered cancer chemotherapy drugs are covered In-Network with a Member cost share no greater than $100 per prescription in accordance with applicable state law. Note : No Copayment, Deductible, or Coinsurance applies to certain diabetic and asthmatic supplies when you get them from an In -Network Pharmacy. These supplies are covered as Medical Supplies and Durable Medical Equipment if you get them from an Out -of-Network Pharmacy. Diabetic test strips are covered subject to applicable Prescription Drug Copayment BS 1 How Your Plan Works Introduction Your Plan is a PPO plan. The Plan has two sets of benefits : In-Network and Out -of-Network. If you choose an In -Network Provider, you will pay less in out -of-pocket costs, such as Copayments, Deductibles, and Coinsurance. If you use an Out -of-Network Provider, you will have to pay more out -of- pocket costs. To find an In -Network Provider for thi s Plan, please see \"How to Find a Provider in the Network,\" later in this section. In-Network Services When you use an In -Network Provider or get care as part of an Authorized Service, Covered Services will be covered at the In-Network level. If you receive Covered Services from an Out -of-Network Provider after we failed to provide you with accurate information in our Provider Directory, or after we failed to respond to your telephone or web - based inquiry within the time required by federal law, Cover ed Services will be covered at the In -Network level. Regardless of Medical Necessity, benefits will be denied for care that is not a Covered Service. We have final authority to decide the Medical Necessity of the service. In-Network Providers include Pri mary Care Physicians / Providers (PCPs), Specialists (Specialty Care Physicians / Providers - SCPs), other professional Providers, Hospitals, and other Facilities who contract with us to care for you. Referrals are never needed to visit an In -Network Spec ialist, including behavioral health Providers. To see a Doctor, call their office: Tell them you are an Anthem Member, Have your Member Identification Card handy. The Doctor's office may ask you for your group or Member ID number. Tell them the reason for your visit. When you go to the office, be sure to bring your Member Identification Card with you. For services from In -Network Providers: You will not need to file claims. In -Network Providers will file claims for Covered Services for you. (You will still need to pay any Coinsurance, Copayments, and/or Deductibles that apply.) You may be billed by your In -Network Provider(s) for any non -Covered Services you get or when you have not followed the terms of this Booklet. Precertification will be d one by the In -Network Provider. (See the \"Getting Approval for Benefits\" section for further details.) Please read the \"Claims Payment\" section for additional information on Authorized Services. After Hours Care If you need care after normal business hour s, your Doctor may have several options for you. You should call your Doctor's office for instructions if you need care in the evenings, on weekends, or during the 35 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 holidays and cannot wait until the office reopens. If you have an Emergency, call 911 or g o to the nearest Emergency Room. Out-of-Network Services When you do not use an In -Network Provider or get care as part of an Authorized Service, Covered Services are covered at the Out -of-Network level, unless otherwise indicated in this Booklet . It is important to understand that you may be referred by Anthem participating providers to other Anthem providers, who may be contracted with Anthem, but who are not part of your in -plan network of providers. In such case, any claims incurred would be pai d at the Out of Network level of benefits, even though the provider may be a participating provider with Anthem. For services from an Out-of-Network Provider: Except where this Booklet states otherwise, t he Out -of-Network Provider may charge you the difference between their bill and the Plan's Maximum Allowed Amount plus any Deductible and/or Coinsurance/Copayments unless your claim involves a Surprise Billing Claim ; You may have higher cost sharing amounts (i.e., Deductibles, Coinsurance, and/or Copayments ) unless your claim involves a Surprise Billing Claim ; You will have to pay for services that are not Medically Necessary; You will have to pay for non -Covered Services; You may have to file claims; and You must make sure any necessary Precertification is done. (Please see \"Getting Approval for Benefits\" for more details.) Surprise Billing Claims Surprise Billing Claims are described in the \" Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 Notice\" at the beginning of this Booklet. Please refer to that section for further details. Connect with Us Using Our Mobile App As soon as you enroll in this Plan, you should download our mobile app. You can find details on how to do this on our website, www.anthem.com . Our goal is to make it easy for you to find answers to your questions. You can chat with us live in the app, or contact us on our website, www.anthem.com . How to Find a Provider in the Network There are several ways you can find out if a Provider or Facility is in the network for this Plan. You can also find out where they are located and details about thei r license or training. See your Plan's directory of In -Network Providers at www.anthem.com , which lists the Doctors, Providers, and Facilities that participate in this Plan's network. Search for a Provider in our mob ile app. Contact Member Services to ask for a list of Doctors and Providers that participate in this Plan's network, based on specialty and geographic area. 36 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 Check with your Doctor or Provider. Please note that not all In -Network Providers offer all service s. For example, some Hospital -based labs are not part of our Reference Lab Network. In those cases you will have to go to a lab in our Reference Lab Network to get In -Network benefits. Please call Member Services before you get services for more information. If you need details about a Provider's license or training, or help choosing a Doctor who is right for you, call the Member Services number on the back of your Member Identification Card. TTY/TDD services also are available by dialing 711. A special operator will get in touch with us to help with your needs. Continuity of Care If your In -Network Provider leaves our network for any reason other than termination for cause , or if coverage under this Plan ends because your Group's Contract ends , or because your Group changes plans , and you are in active treatment, you may be able to continue seeing that Provider for a limited period of time and still get In -Network benefits. \"Active treatment\" includes : An ongoing course of treatment fo r a life -threatening condition, An ongoing course of treatment for a serious acute condition (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation ther apy and post -operative visits), An ongoing course of treatment for pregnancy and th rough the postpartum period; or An ongoing course of treatment for a health condition for which the Physician or health care Provider attests that discontinuing care by the current Physician or Provider would worsen your condition or interfere with anticipated outco mes. An \"ongoing course of treatment\" includes treatments for mental heal th and substance use disorders. In these cases, you may be able to continue seeing that Provider until treatment is complete, up to 120 days after the Provider has left Our network an d, for pregnant or postpartum Members , up to 45 days following delivery. If you wish to continue seeing the same Provider, you or your Doctor should contact Member Services for details. Any decision by us regarding a request for Continuity of Care is subj ect to the Grievance and External Review Procedures process. Your Cost -Shares Your Plan may involve Copayments, Deductibles, and/or Coinsurance, which are charges that you must pay when receiving Covered Services. Your Plan may also have an Out -of-Pocket Limit, which limits the cost-shares you must pay. Please read the \"Schedule of Benefits\" for details on your cost -shares. Also read the \" Definitions \" section for a better understanding of each type of cost share. Benefit Maximum Some Covered Services ha ve a maximum number of days, visits or dollar amounts that we will allow during a Benefit Period. When the Deductible (if applicable) is applied to a Covered Service which has a maximum number of days or visits, the Benefit Maximum may be reduced by the am ount applied to the Deductible, whether or not the Covered Service is paid by us. Even after you satisfy the Out -of-Pocket Annual Maximum, our reimbursement remains limited by the Benefit Maximums of this plan even after the Out-of-Pocket Annual Maximum h as been reached. See the \"Schedule of Benefits\" for those services which have a Benefit Maximum. If you leave this Plan, and go on to a new Plan with us in the same Benefit Period, Covered Services that have a Benefit Maximum will be carried over to the n ew Plan. For example, if a benefit has a limit of one 37 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 visit per Benefit Period and you received that benefit under the prior coverage, then you are not eligible under the new plan for the same benefit until the Benefit Period ends, as benefits have been e xhausted for your Benefit Period. Crediting Prior Plan Coverage If you were covered by the Group's prior carrier / plan immediately before the Group signs up with us, with no break in coverage, then you will get credit for any accrued Deductible if applicable and approved by us under that other plan. This does not apply to peopl e who were not covered by the prior carrier or plan on the day before the Group's coverage with us began, or to people who join the Group later. Prior credit is not given at other times and is only given as part of the original enrollment of the employer g roup. You must request prior Deductible credit and submit written notification of such charges to our Member Services department no later than 180 days following the Employer's Effective Date with this Plan and submit written notification of such charges t o Member Services . If the documentation provided from the prior carrier gives clear detail that the services were applied to that carrier's in -network, applicable credit will be given to this coverage in -network. If the documentation is not available or is unclear as to the prior carrier's application of the deductible, prior deductible credit will not be given under this Plan. If you or your Group moves from one of our plans to another, (for example, changes its coverage from HMO to PPO), and you were cove red by the other product immediately before enrolling in this product with no break in coverage, then you may get credit for any accrued Deductible if applicable and approved by us. Any maximums, when applicable, will be carried over and charged against t he maximums under this Plan. If your Group offers more than one of our products, and you change from one product to another with no break in coverage, you will get credit for any accrued Deductible if applicable and any maximums will be carried over and ch arged against maximums under this Plan. This Section Does Not Apply To You If: Your Group moves to this Plan at the beginning of a Benefit Period; You change from one of our individual policies to a group plan; You change employers; or You are a new Member of the Group who joins the Group after the Group's initial enrollment with us. The BlueCard Program Like all Blue Cross & Blue Shield plans throughout the country, we participate in a program called \"BlueCard,\" which provides services to you when you are outside our Service Area. For more details on this program, please see \" Inter-Plan Arrangements\" in the \"Claims Payment\" section. Identifica tion Card We will give an Identification Card to each Member enrolled in the Plan. When you get care, you must show your Identification Card. Only a Member who has paid the Premiums for this Plan has the right to services or benefits under this Booklet. If anyone gets services or benefits to which they are not entitled to under the terms of this Booklet, he/she must pay for th e actual cost of the services. 38 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 Getting Approval for Benefits Your Plan includes the process of Utilization Review to decide when s ervices are Medically Necessary or Experimental/Investigational as those terms are defined in this Booklet . Utilization Review aids the delivery of cost -effective health care by reviewing the use of treatments and, when proper, level of care and/or the se tting or place of se rvice that they are performed. Reviewing Where Services Are Provided A service must be Medically Necessary to be a Covered Service. When level of care, setting or place of service is reviewed, services that can be safely given to you i n a lower level of care or lower cost setting / place of care, will not be Medically Necessary if they are given in a higher level of care, or higher cost setting / place of care. This means that a request for a service may be denied because it is not Medi cally Necessary for the service to be provided where it is being requested. When this happens the service can be requested again in another place and will be reviewed again for Medical Necessity. At times a different Provider or Facility may need to be use d in order for the service to be considered Medically Necessary. Examples include, but are not limited to: A service may be denied on an inpatient basis at a Hospital but may be approvable if provided on an outpatient basis at a Hospital. A service may be denied on an outpatient basis at a Hospital but may be approvable at a free standing imaging center, infusion center, Ambulatory Surgery Center , or in a Physician's office. A service may be denied at a Skilled Nursing Facility but may be approvable in a h ome setting. Utilization Review criteria will be based on many sources including medical policy and clinical guidelines. Anthem may decide that a treatment that was asked for is not Medically Necessary if a clinically equivalent treatment that is more cos t effective is available and appropriate. \"Clinically equivalent\" means treatments that for Members, will give similar results for a disease or condition. If you have any questions about the Utilization Review process, the medical policies, or clinical guidelines, you may call the Member Services phone number on the back of your Identification Card. Coverage for or payment of the service or treatment reviewed is not guaranteed even if we decide your services are Medically Necessary. For benefits to be cove red, on the date you get service : You must be eligible for benefits; Premium must be paid for the time period that services are given; The service or supply must be a C overed Service under your Plan; The service cannot be subject to an Exclusion under your Plan; and You must not have exceeded any app licable limits under your Plan. Types of Reviews Pre-service Review - A review of a service, treatment or admission for a benefit coverage determination , which is done before the service or treatment begins or admission date. Precertification - A required Pre -service Review for a benefit coverage determination for a service or treatment. Certain services require Precertification in order for you to get benefits. The benefit coverage review w ill include a review to decide whether the service meets the definition of Medical Necessity or is Experimental / Investigational as those terms are defined in this Booklet. 39 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 For admissions following Emergency Care, you, your authorized representative or Do ctor must tell us within 72 hours of the admission or as soon as possible within a reasonable period of time. For childbirth admissions, Precertification is not needed unless there is a problem and/or the postpartum individual and baby are not sent home a t the same time. Precertification is not required for the first 48 hours for a vaginal delivery or 96 hours for a cesarean section. Admissions longer than 48/96 hours require Precertification . Continued Stay / Concurrent Review - A Utilization Review of a service, treatment or admission for a benefit coverage determination which must be done during an ongoing stay in a facility or course of treatment. Both Pre -Service and Continued Stay / Concurrent Reviews may be considered urgent when, in the view of the treating Provider or any Doctor with knowledge of your medical condition, without such care or treatment, your life or health or your ability to regain maximum function could be seriously threatened or you could be subjected to severe pain that cannot be a dequately managed without such care or treatment. Urgent reviews are conducted under a shorter timeframe than standard reviews. Post -service Review - A review of a service, treatment or admission for a benefit coverage that is conducted after the service has been provided. Post -service reviews are performed when a service, treatment or admission did not need a Precertification, or when a needed Precertification was not obtained. Post -service reviews are done for a service, treatment or admission in which we have a related clinical coverage guideline and are typically initiated by us. Who is Responsible for Precertification? Typically, In -Network Providers know which services need Precertification and will get any Precertification when needed. Your Primary Care Physician and other In -Network Providers have been given detailed information about these procedures and are responsible for meeting these requirements.

How Decisions are Made We use our clinical coverage guidelines, such as medical policy, clinical guidelines, and other applicable policies and procedures to help make our Medical Necessity decisions. This includes decisions about Prescription Drugs as detailed in the section \"Prescription Drugs Administered by a Medical Provider\" . Medical policies and clinical guidelines reflect the standards of practice and medical interventions identified as proper medical practice. We reserve the right to review and update these clinical co verage guidelines from time to time. You are entitled to ask for and get, free of charge, reasonable access to any records concerning your request. To ask for this information, call the Precertification phone number on the back of your Identification Car d. If you are not satisfied with our decision under this section of your benefits, please refer to the \"Grievance and External Review Procedures\" section to see what rights may be available to you. Decision and Notice Requirements We will review requests for benefits according to the timeframes listed below. The timeframes and requirements listed are based on state and federal laws. Where state laws are stricter than federal laws, we will follow state laws. If you live in and/or get services in a state other than the state where your Contract was issued other state -specific requirements may apply. You may call the phone number on the back of your Identification Card for more details. Type of Review Timeframe Requirement for Decision and Notifi cation Urgent Pre -service Review 72 hours from the receipt of request Non-Urgent Pre -service Review 15 calendar days from the receipt of the request Urgent Continued Stay / Concurrent Review when request is received more than 24 hours before the end of the previous authorization 24 hours from the receipt of the request 41 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 Urgent Continued Stay / Concurrent Review when request is received less than 24 hours before the end of the previous authorization or no previous authorization exists 72 hours from the receipt of the request Non-urgent Continued Stay / Concurrent Review for ongoing outpatient treatment 15 calendar days from the receipt of the request Post-Service Review 30 calendar days from the receipt of the request If more information is needed to make our decision, we will tell the requesting Provider of the specific information needed to finish the review.

We will notify you and your Provider of our decision as required by state and federal law. Notice may be given by one or more of the following methods: verbal, written, and/or electronic. Important Information Anthem may, from time to time, waive, enhance, change or end certain medical management processes (including utilization management, case management, and disease management) and/or offer an alternate benefit if in our sole discretion, such change furthers the provision of cost effective, value based and/or quality services. We may also select certain qualifying Providers to take part in a pr ogram or a Provider arrangement that exempts them from certain procedural or medical management processes that would otherwise apply. We may also exempt your claim from medical review if certain conditions apply. Just because Anthem exempts a process, Pro vider or Claim from the standards which otherwise would apply, it does not mean that Anthem will do so in the future, or will do so in the future for any other Provider, claim or Member. Anthem may stop or change any such exemption w ith or without advance notice. You may find out whether a Provider is taking part in certain programs or a Provider arrangement by checking your on -line Provider Directory, or contacting the Member Services number on the back of your ID card. We also may identify certain Provid ers to review for potential fraud, waste, abuse or other inappropriate activity if the claims data suggests there may be inappropriate billing practices. If a Provider is selected under this program, then we may use one or more clinical utilization manage ment guidelines in the review of claims submitted by this Provider, even if those guidelines are not used for all Providers delivering services to this Plan's Members . Health Plan Individual Case Management Our health plan individual case management progra ms (Case Management) help coordinate services for Members with health care needs due to serious, complex, and/or chronic health conditions. Our programs coordinate benefits and educate Members who agree to take part in the Case Management program to help meet their health -related need s. Our Case Management programs are confidential and voluntary and are made ava ilable at no extra cost to you. These programs are provided by, or on behalf of and at the request of, your health plan case 42 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 management staff. Thes e Case Management programs are separate from any Covered Services you are receiving. If you meet program criteria and agree to take part, we will help you meet your identified health care needs. This is reached through contact and teamwork with you and/or your chosen authorized representative, treating D octor(s), and other Providers. In addition, we may assist in coordinating care with existing community -based programs and services to meet your needs. This may include giving you information about external agencies and community - based programs and services. In certain cases of severe or chronic illness or injury, we may provide benefits for alternate care that is not listed as a Covered Service. We may also extend Covered Services beyond the Benefit Maximum s of this Plan. We will make our decision case -by-case, if in our discretion the alternate or extended benefit is in the best interest of you and Anthem and you or your authorized representative agree to the alternate or extended benefit in writing. A deci sion to provide extended benefits or approve alternate care in one case does not obligate us to provide the same benefits again to you or to any other Member. We reserve the right, at any time, to alter or stop providing extended benefits or approving alte rnate care. In such case, we will notify you or your authorized representative in writing. 43 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 What's Covered This section describes the Covered Services available under your Plan.

Important Details About Prescription Drug Coverage Your Plan includes certain features to determine when Prescription Drugs should be covered, which are described below . As part of these f eatures, y our prescribing Doctor may be asked to give more details before we can decide if the Prescription Drug is eligible for coverage. In order to determine if the Prescription Drug is eligible for coverage, we have established criteria. The criteria, which are called drug edits, may include requirements regarding one or more of the following: Quantity, dose, and frequency of administration, Specific clinical criteria including, but not limited to, requirements regarding age, test result requirements, a nd/or presence of a specific condition or disease, Specific Provider qualifications including, but not limited to, REMS certification (Risk, Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies), Step therapy requiring one Drug, Drug regimen, or treatment be used prior to use of another Drug, Drug regimen, or treatment for safety and/or cost -effectiveness when clinically similar results may be anticipated. Use of an Anthem Prescription Drug List (a formulary developed by Anthem) which is a list of FDA- approved Drugs that have been reviewed and recommended for use based on their quality and cost effectiveness. Covered Prescription Drugs To be a Covered Service, Prescription Drugs must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and, under f ederal law, require a Prescription. Prescription Drugs must be prescribed by a licensed Provider and Controlled Substances must be prescribed by a licensed Provider with an active DEA license. Compound drugs are a Covered Service when a commercially avail able dosage form of a Medically Necessary medication is not available, all the ingredients of the compound drug are FDA approved, require a prescription to dispense, and are not essentially the same as an FDA approved product from a drug manufacturer. Non -FDA approved, non -proprietary, multisource ingredients that are vehicles essential for compound administration may be covered. 70 NVLGPPO may be required for certain Prescription Drugs to help make sure proper use and guidelines for Prescription Drug coverage are followed. We will give the results of our decision to both you and your Provider. For a list of Prescription Drugs that need precertification, please call the phone number on the back of your Identification Card. The list w ill be reviewed and updated from time to time. Including a Prescription Drug or related item on the list does not guarantee coverage under your Plan. Your Provider may check with us to verify Prescription Drug coverage, to find out which drugs are covere d under this section and if any drug edits apply. Please refer to the section \"Getting Approval for Benefits\" for more details. If precertification is denied you have the right to file a Grievance as outlined in the \"Grievance and External Review Procedure s\" section of this Booklet. Designated Pharmacy Provider Anthem in its sole discretion, may establish one or more Designated Pharmacy Provider programs which provide specific pharmacy services (including shipment of Prescription Drugs) to Members. An In - Network Provider is not necessarily a Designated Pharmacy Provider. To be a Designated Pharmacy Provider, the In -Network Provider must have signed a Designated Pharm acy Provider Agreement with us. You or your Provider can contact Member Services to learn which Pharmacy or Pharmacies are part of a Designated Pharmacy Provider program. For Prescription Drugs that are shipped to you or your Provider and administered in your Provider's office, you and your Provider are required to order from a Designated Pharmacy Provider. A Patient Care coordinator will work with you and your Provider to obtain Precertification and to assist shipment to your Provider's office. We may also require you to use a Designated Pharmacy Provider to obtain Prescription Drugs for treatment of certain clinical conditions such as Hemophilia. We reserve our right to modify the list of Prescription Drugs as well as the setting and/or level of care in which the care is provided to you. Anthem may, from time to time, change with or wi thout advance notice, the Designated Pharmacy Provider for a Drug, if in our discretion, such change can help provide cost effective, value based and/or quality services. If you are required to use a Designated Pharmacy Provider and you choose not to obtai n your Prescription Drug from a Designated Pharmacy Provider, you will not have coverage for that Prescription Drug . You can get the list of the Prescription Drugs covered under this section by calling Member Services at the phone number on the back of you r Identification Card or check our website at www.anthem.com . Therapeutic Substitution Therapeutic substitution is an optional program that tells you and your Doctor about alternatives to certain prescribed Drugs. W e may contact you and your Doctor to make you aware of these choices. Only you and your Doctor can determine if the therapeutic substitute is right for you. For questions or issues about therapeutic Drug substitutes, call Member Services at the phone num ber on the back of your Identification Card. 71 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 Prescription Drug Benefit at a Retail or Home Delivery (Mail Order) Pharmacy Your Plan also includes benefits for Prescription Drugs you get at a Retail or Mail Order Pharmacy. We use a Pharmacy Benefits Ma nager (PBM) to manage these benefits. The PBM has a network of Retail Pharmacies, a Home Delivery (Mail Order) Pharmacy, and a Specialty Pharmacy. The PBM works to make sure Drugs are used properly. This includes checking that Prescriptions are based on recognized and appropriate doses and checking for Drug interac tions or pregnancy concerns. Please note: Benefits for Prescription Drugs, including Specialty Drug s, which are administered to you by a medical Provider in a medical setting (e.g., doctor's office visit, home care visit, or outpatient Facility) are covered under the \"Prescription Drugs Administered by a Medical Provider\" benefit. Please read that section for important details. Prescription Drug Benefits Prescription Drug benefits may require prior authorization to determine if your Drugs should be covered. Your In -Network Pharmacist will be told if prior authorization is required and if any additional details are needed for us to decide benefits. Prior Authorization Prescribing Providers must obtain prior authorization in order for you to get benefits for certain Drugs. At times your Provider will initiate a prior authorization on your behalf before your Pharmacy fills your Prescription. At other times, the Pharmacy may make you or your Provider aware that a prior authorizatio n or other information is needed. In order to determine if the Prescription drug is eligible for coverage, we have established criteria. The criteria, which are called drug edits, may include requirements regarding one or more of the following: Quantity, dose, and frequency of administration, Specific clinical criteria including, but not limited to, requirements regarding age, test result requirements, and/or presence of a specific condition or disease, Specific Provider qualifications including, but not l imited to, REMS certification (Risk, Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies), Step therapy requiring one Drug, Drug regimen, or treatment be used prior to use of another Drug, Drug regimen, or treatment for safety and/or cost -effectiveness when clinically si milar results may be anticipated.

You or your Provider can get the list of the Drugs that require prior authorization by calling Member Services at the phone number on the back of your Identification Ca rd or check our website at www.anthem.com . The list will be reviewed and updated from time to time. Including a Prescription Drug or related item on the list does not guarantee coverage under your Plan. Your Provider may check with us to verify Prescription Drug coverage, to find out which drugs are covered under this section and if any drug edits apply. Anthem may, from time to time, waive, enhance, change or end certain prior authorization and/or offer alternate benefits, if in our sole discretion, such change furthers the provision of cost effective, value based and/or quality services. 72 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 If prior authorization is denied you have the right to file a Grievance as outlined in the \"Grievance and External Review P rocedures\" section of this Booklet.

Please note: To get the lowest out -of-pocket cost, you must get Covered Services from a Level 1 In - Network Pharmacy. Tier 1 Drugs have the lowest Coinsurance or Copayment.

We may cover one form of administration instead of another, or put other forms of administration in a different tier. Prescription Drug List We also have an Anthem Prescription Drug List, (a formulary), which is a list of Drugs that have been reviewed and rec ommended for use based on their quality and cost effectiveness. Benefits may not be covered for certain Drugs if they are not on the Prescription Drug List. The Drug List is developed by us based upon clinical findings, and where proper, the cost of the D rug relative to other Drugs in its therapeutic class or used to treat the same or similar condition. It is also based on the availability of over the counter medicines, Generic Drugs, the use of one Drug over another by our Members, and where proper, cert ain clinical economic reasons. We retain the right, at our discretion, to decide coverage based upon medication dosage, dosage forms, manufacturer, and administration methods (i.e., oral, injection, topical, or inhaled) and may cover one form instead of an other as Medically Necessary. You may request a copy of the covered Prescription Drug list by calling the Member Services telephone number on the back of your Identification Card or visiting our website at www.anthem .com . The covered Prescription Drug list is subject to periodic review and amendment. We may add or remove drugs on the Prescription Drug List, or move drugs between tiers, to the extent permitted by law. Inclusion of a Drug or related item on the covered Prescription Drug list is not a guarantee of coverage. 76 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 Exception Request for a Drug not on the Prescription Drug List : If you or your Doctor believes you need a Prescription Drug that is not on the Prescription Drug List, please have your Doctor or pharmac ist get in touch with us.

Coverage of a Drug approved as a result of your request or your Doctor's request for an exception will only be provided if you are a Member enrolled under the Plan. Additional Features of Your Prescription Drug Pharmacy Benefit Day Supply and Refill Limits Certain day supply limits apply to Prescription Drugs as listed in the \"Schedule of Benefits.\" In most cases, you must use a certain amount of your prescription be fore it can be refilled. In some cases we may let you get an early refill. For example, we may let you refill your prescription early if it is decided that you need a larger dose. Early refills may also be available for synchronizing Chronic Medications as required by law, and Topical Opthalmic Products as follows: After 21 days or more but before 30 days after receiving any 30 -day supply of the product; After 42 days or more but before 60 days after receiving any 60 -day supply of the product; or After 63 days or more but before 90 days after receiving any 90 -day supply of the product. We may also authorize coverage for less than a 30 -day supply for purposes of synchronizing medications. We will work with the Pharmacy to decide when this should ha ppen. As used in this section, Chronic Medication means any drug that is prescribed to treat any disease or other condition which is determined to be permanent, persistent or lasting indefinitely, or as defined by Nevada law. Topical Ophthalmic Product me ans a liquid prescription drug which is applied directly to the eye from a bottle or by means of a dropper, or as defined by Nevada law.

If you need more than one early refill, please call Member Services at the number on the back of your Identification Card. Therapeutic Substitution Therapeutic substitution is an optional program that tell s you and your Doctor about alternatives to certain prescribed Drugs. We may contact you and your Doctor to make you aware of these choices. Only you 77 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 and your Doctor can determine if the therapeutic substitute is right for you. For questions or issues about therapeutic Drug substitutes, call Member Services at the phone number on the back of your Identification Card. Split Fill Dispensing Program The split fill dispensing program is designed to prevent and/or minimize wasted Prescription Drugs if your Prescription Drugs or dose changes between fills, by allowing only a portion of your prescription to be filled. This program also saves you out of pocket expenses. The Prescription Drugs that are included under this program have been identified as requirin g more frequent follow up to monitor response to treatment and potential reactions or side effects. You can access the list of these Prescription Drugs by calling the toll -free number on your member ID card or log on to the website at www.anthem.com . Drug Cost Share Assistance Programs If you qualify for non -needs based drug cost share assistance programs offered by drug manufacturers (either directly or indirectly through third parties) to reduce the Deductible, Copayment, or Coinsurance you pay for certain Specialty Drugs, the reduced amount you pay may be the amount we apply to your Deductible and/or Out -of-Pocket Limit . In addition, we may also enroll you in a program, the Cost Relief Program, that allows you to further reduce your costs, and may eliminate your out -of-pocket costs altogether. We will work with manufacturers to get the maximum cost share assistance you are eligible for, and will manage enrollment and renewals on your behalf. Please note that Anthem may increase the cost share listed in the Schedule of Benefits in order to take full advantage of cost share assistance that is available from drug manufacturers. Any increase in the cost-share will not be more than 50% of the Maximum All owed Amount. This will lower plan costs but will not increase your cost because any additional cost share will be offset by the cost share assistance. In addition, because certain Specialty Drugs are not classified as \"essential health benefits\" under th e Plan in accordance with the Affordable Care Act, any Member cost -share payments for these Specialty Drugs will not count towards the Plan's Deductible or Out -of-Pocket Limit and will not be paid at 100% of the Maximum Allowed Amount after the Out -of-Pock et Limit is reached. A list of Specialty Drugs that are not considered to be \"essential health benefits\" is available. An exception process is available for determining whether a Specialty Drug that is not an essential health benefit is medically necessar y for a particular individual. Participation in this program is voluntary. If you currently take one or more Prescription Drugs included in this program, we will automatically enroll you in the program and send you a welcome letter, followed up with a phone call that provides specific information about the program as it pertains to your medication. Whether you enroll in the Cost Relief Program or not, any non -needs based cost -share assistance you receiv e will not accumulate to your Deductible or Out -of-Pocket Limit . If you or a covered family member are not currently taking, but will start a new Prescription Drug covered under this program, you can either contact us or we will proactively contact you so that you can take full advantage of the program. Some drug manu facturers will require you to sign up to take advantage of the assistance that they provide. In those cases, we will contact you to let you know what you need to do. The list of Prescription Drugs covered by the Cost Relief Program may be updated period ically by the Plan. Please refer to our website, www.anthem.com , for the -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 Opting Out If you do not wish to participate in this program, you can opt out, and you will be responsible for a portion of the cost of the Specialty Drug as noted in the Schedule of Benefits . Special Programs Except when prohibited by federal regulations (such as HSA rules), from time to time we may offer programs to support the use of more cost -effective or clinically effective Prescription Drugs including Generic Drugs, Home Delivery Drugs, over the counter Drugs or preferred products. Such programs may reduce or waive Copayments or Coinsurance for a limited time. Rebate I mpact on Prescription Drugs You get at Retail or Home Delivery Pharmacies Anthem and/or its PBM may also, from time to time, enter into agreements that result in Anthem receiving rebates or other funds (\"rebates\") directly or indirectly from Prescription D rug manufacturers, Prescription Drug distributors or others . You will be able to take advantage of a portion of the cost savings anticipated by Anthem from rebates on Prescription Drugs purchased by you from Retail, Home Delivery, or Specialty Pharmacies u nder this section. If the Prescription Drug purchased by you is eligible for a rebate, most of the estimated value of that rebate will be used to reduce the Maximum Allowed Amount for the Prescription Drug. Any Deductible or Coinsurance would be calculated using that reduced amount. The remaining value of that rebate will be used to reduce the cost of coverage for all Members enrolled in coverage of this type . It is important to note that not all Prescription Drugs are eligible for a rebate, and rebates can be discontinued or applied at any time based on the terms of the rebate agreements. Because the exact value of the ultimate rebate will not be known at the time you purchase the Prescription Drug, the amount of the rebate applied to your claim will be ba sed on an estimate. Payment on your claim will not be adjusted if the later determined rebate value is higher or lower than our original estimate . 79 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 What's Not Covered In this section you will find a review of items that are not covered by your Plan.

When you receive care from an In -Network Provider, you do not need to file a claim because the In-Network Provider will do this for you. If you receive care from an Out -of-Network Provider, you will need to make sure a claim is filed. Many Out -of-Network Hospitals, Doctors and other Providers will file your claim for you, although they are not required to do so. If you file the claim, use a claim form as described later in this section. Maximum Allowed Amount General This section descr ibes how we determine the amount of reimbursement for Covered Services. Reimbursement for services rendered by In -Network and Out -of-Network Providers is based on this Booklet's Maximum Allowed Amount for the Covered Service that you receive. Please see \"Inter -Plan Arrangements\" later in this sect ion for additional information. The Maximum Allowed Amount for this Booklet is the maximum amount of reimbursement we will allow for services and supplies: That meet our definition of Covered Services, to the ext ent such services and supplies are covered under your Booklet and are not excluded; That are Medically Necessary; and That are provided in accordance with all applicable precertification, utilization management or other requirements set forth in your Bookl et. You will be required to pay a portion of the Maximum Allowed Amount to the extent you have not met your Deductible or have a Copayment or Coinsurance. Except as explained in this Booklet, or under Surprise Billing Claims* , when you receive Covered Ser vices from an Out -of-Network Provider, you may be responsible for paying any difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Provider's actual charges. This amount can be significant. *Surprise Billing Claims are described in the \" Consolidated Appro priations Act of 2021 Notice\" at the front of this Booklet. Please refer to that section for further details. When you receive Covered Services from a Provider, we will, to the extent applicable, apply claim processing rules to the claim submitted for tho se Covered Services. These rules evaluate the claim information and, among other things, determine the accuracy and appropriateness of the procedure and diagnosis codes included in the claim. Applying these rules may affect our determination o f the Maxim um Allowed Amount. Our application of these rules does not mean that the Covered Services you received were not Medically Necessary. It means we have determined that the claim was submitted inconsistent with procedure coding rules and/or reimbursement po licies. For example, your Provider may have submitted the claim using several procedure codes when there is a single procedure code that includes all of the procedures that were performed. When this occurs, the Maximum Allowed Amount will be based on the single procedure code rather than a separate Maximum Allowed Amount for each billed code. Likewise, when multiple procedures are performed on the same day by the same Doctor or other healthcare professional, we may reduce the Maximum Allowed Amounts for t hose secondary and subsequent procedures because reimbursement at 100% of the Maximum Allowed Amount for those 90 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 procedures would represent duplicative payment for components of the primary procedure that may be considered incidental or inclusive. NOTE: We w ill apply the In -Network level of benefits and the Member will not be required to pay more for the services than if the services had been received from an In -Network provider in the following circumstances: Emergency Care provided in a Facility within Nevada; Where in -patient hospital care at an Out -of-Network Hospital is necessary due to the nature of the treatment; Where in -patient hospital care at an Out -of-Network Hospital is necessary due to In -Network Provider Hospital capacity; When a Memb er has received a precertified network exception, under the Authorized Services paragraph below. Provider Network Status The Maximum Allowed Amount may vary depending upon whether the Provider is an In -Network Provider or an Out -of-Network Provider. An In -Network Provider is a Provider who is in the managed network for this specific product or in a special Center of Medical Excellence or other closely managed specialty network, or who has a participation contract with us. For Covered Servic es performed by an In -Network Provider, the Maximum Allowed Amount for this Booklet is the rate the Provider has agreed with us to accept as reimbursement for the Covered Services. Because In -Network Providers have agreed to accept the Maximum Allowed Amount as payment in full for those Covered Services, they should not send you a bill or collect for amounts above the Maximum Allowed Amount. However, you may receive a bill or be asked to pay all or a portion of the Maximum Allowed Amount to the extent you have not met your Deductible or have a Copayment or Coinsurance. Please call Member Services for help in finding an In -Network Provider or visit www.anthem.com . Providers who have not signed any contract with us an d are not in any of our networks are Out -of- Network Providers, subject to Blue Cross Blue Shield Association rules governing claims filed by certain ancillary providers. Except for Surprise Billing Claims, we will calculate the Maximum Allowed Amount for C overed Services you receive from an Out -of-Network Provider using one of the following: 1. An amount based on our Out-of-Network Provider fee schedule/rate, which we have established in our discretion, and which we reserve the right to modify from time to tim e, after considering one or more of the following: reimbursement amounts accepted by like/similar providers contracted with Anthem, reimbursement amounts paid by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the same services or supplies, and other in dustry cost, reimbursement and utilization data; or 2. An amount based on reimbursement or cost information from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"). When basing the Maximum Allowed amount upon the level or method of reimbursement used by C MS, Anthem will update such information, which is unadjusted for geographic locality, no less than annually; or 3. An amount based on information provided by a third party vendor, which may reflect one or more of the following factors: (1) the complexity or severity of treatment; (2) level of skill and experience required for the treatment; or (3) comparable Providers' fees and costs to deliver or 91 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 4. An amount negotiated by us or a third party vendor which has been agreed to by the Provider. This may inclu de rates for services coordinated through case management, or 5. An amount based on or derived from the total charges billed by the Out -of-Network Provider; or 6. An amount required by applicable law. Providers who are not contracted for this product, but are co ntracted for other products with us are also considered Out -of-Network. For this Booklet, the Maximum Allowed Amount for services from these Providers will be one of the six methods shown above unless the contract between us and that Provider specifies a different amount. For Covered Services rendered outside Anthem's Service Area by Out -of-Network Providers, claims may be priced using the local Blue Cross Blue Shield plan's n on-participating provider fee schedule / rate or the pricing arrangements required by applicable state or federal law. In certain situations, the Maximum Allowed Amount for out of area claims may be based on billed charges, the pricing we would use if the healthcare services had been obtained within the Anthem Service Area, or a special negotiated price. Except when you get Covered Emergency Services from an Out -of-Network Provider at a Facility in Nevada, Out-of-Network Provider may send you a bill and collect for the amount of the Provider's charge that exceeds our Maximum Allowed Amount unless your claim involves a Surprise Billing Claim . You are responsible for paying the difference between the Maximum Allowe d Amount and the amount the Provider charges. This amount can be significant. Choosing an In -Network Provider will likely result in lower out of pocket costs to you. Please call Member Services for help in finding an In -Network Provider or visit our websi te at www.anthem.com . Member Services is also available to assist you in determining this Booklet's Maximum Allowed Amount for a particular service from an Out -of-Network Provider. In order for us to assist you, you will need to obtain from your Provider the specific procedure code(s) and diagnosis code(s) for the services the Provider will render. You will also need to know the Provider's charges to calculate your out of pocket responsibility. Although Member Serv ices can assist you with this pre -service information, the final Maximum Allowed Amount for your claim will be based on the actual claim submitted by the Provider. For Prescription Drugs, the Maximum Allowed Amount is the amount determined by us using Prescription Drug cost information provided by the Pharmacy Benefits Manager. Member Cost Share For certain Covered Services and depending on your Plan design, you may be required to pay a part of the Maximum Allowed Amount as your cost share amount (for example, Deductible, Copayment, and/or Coinsurance). Your cost share amount and Out -of-Pocket Limits may vary depending on whether you received services from an In -Network or Out -of-Network Provider. Specifically, you may be required to pay higher cost sharing amounts or may have limits on your benefits when using Out -of-Network Providers. Please see the \"Schedule of Benefits\" in this B ooklet for your cost share responsibilities and limitations, or call Member Services to learn how this Booklet's benefits or cost share amounts may vary by the type of Provider you use. We will not provide any reimbursement for non-Covered Services. You ma y be responsible for the total amount billed by your Provider for non -Covered Services, regardless of whether such services are performed by an In -Network or Out -of-Network Provider. Non -covered services include services specifically excluded from coverage by the terms of your Plan and received after benefits have been exhausted. Benefits may be exhausted by exceeding, for example, benefit caps or day/visit limits. 92 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT are examples for illustrat ive purposes only; the amounts shown may be different than this Booklet's cost share amounts; see your \"Schedule of Benefits\" for your applicable amounts. Example: Your Plan has a Coinsurance cost share of 20% for In -Network services, and 30% for Out -of- Network services after the In -Network or Out -of-Networ k Deductible has been met. You choose an In -Network surgeon. The charge was $2500. The Maximum Allowed Amount for the surgery is $1500; your Coinsurance responsibility when an In -Network surgeon is used is 20% of $1500, or $300. We allow 80% of $1500, or $1200. The In -Network surgeon accepts the total of $1500 as reimbursement for the surgery regardless of the charges. Your total out of pocket responsibility would be $300. You choose an Out -of-Network surgeon. The Out -of-Network surgeon's charge for th e service is $2500. The Maximum Allowed Amount for the surgery service is $1500; your Coinsurance responsibility for the OUT -OF-NETWORK surgeon is 30% of $1500, or $450 after the OUT -OF- NETWORK Deductible has been met. We allow the remaining 70% of $1500, or $1050. In addition , the Out -of-Network surgeon could bill you the difference between $2500 and $1500, so your total Out of Pocket charge would be $450 plus an additional $1000, for a total of $1450 . Authorized Services In some circumstances, such as where there is no In -Network Provider available for the Covered Service, we may authorize the In -Network cost share amounts (Deductible, Copayment, and/or Coinsurance) to apply to a claim for a Covered Service you receive fr om an Out -of-Network Provider. In such circumstances, you must contact us in advance of obtaining the Covered Service. We also may authorize the In -Network cost share amounts to apply to a claim for Covered Services if you receive Emergency services from an Out -of-Network Provider and are not able to contact us until after the Covered Service is rendered. If we authorize an In-Network cost share amount to apply to a Covered Service received from an Out -of-Network Provider, You may also still be liable fo r the difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Out -of-Network Provider's charge unless your claim involves a Surprise Billing Claim . Please contact Member Services for Authorized Services informati on or to request authorization. The following are examples for illustrat ive purposes only; the amounts shown may be different than this Booklet's cost share amounts; see your \"Schedule of Benefits\" for your applicable amounts. Example: You require the services of a specialty Provider; but there is no In-Network Provider for that specialty in your state of residence. You contact us in advance of receiving any Covered Services, and we authorize you to go to an available Out -of-Network Provider for that Covered Service and we agree that the In - Network co st share will apply. Your Plan has a $45 Copayment for Out -of-Network Providers and a $25 Copayment for In -Network Providers for the Covered Service. The Out -of-Network Provider's charge for this service is $500. The Maximum Allowed Amount is $200. Becaus e we have authorized the In -Network cost share amount to apply in this situation, you will be responsible for the In -Network Copayment of $25 and we will be responsible for the remaining $175 of the $200 Maximum Allowed Amount. Because the Out -of-Network Provider's charge for this service is $500, you may receive a bill from the Out-of-Network Provider for the difference between the $500 charge and the Maximum Allowed Amount 93 NVLGPPO NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO your In -Network Copayment of $25, your total out of pocket expense would be $325. Federal/State Taxes/Surcharges/Fees Federal or state laws or regulations may require a surcharge, tax or other fee. If applicable, we will include any such surcharge, tax or other fee as part of the claim charge passed on to you. Claims Review Anthem has processes to review claims before and after payment to detect fraud, waste, abuse and other inappropriate activity. Members seeking services from Out -of-Network Providers could be balance billed by the Out -of-Network Provider for those services that are determined to be not payable as a result of these review processes. A claim may also be determined to be not payable due to a Provider's failure to submit medical records with the claims that are under review in these processe s. Notice of Claim & Proof of Loss After you get Covered Services, we must receive written notice of your claim in order for benefits to be paid. In-Network Providers will submit claims for you. They are responsible for ensuring that claims have the information we need to determine benefits. If the claim does not include enough information, we will ask them for more details, and they will be required to supply those details within certain timeframes. Out-of-Network claims can be submitted by the P rovider if the Provider is willing to file on your behalf. However, if the Provider is not submitting on your behalf , you will be required to submit the claim. Claim forms are usually available from the Provider. If they do not have a claim form, you can send a written request to us, or contact Member Services and ask for a claim form to be sent to you. If you do not receive the claim form, you can still submit written notice of the claim without the claim form . The same information that would be given o n the claim form must be included in the written notice of claim, including: Name of patient. Patient's relationship with the Subscriber. Identification number. Date, type, and place of service. Your signature and the Provider's signature. Out-of-Network claims must be submitted within 180 days . In certain cases, state or federal law may allow additional time to file a claim, if you could not reasonably file within the 180 day period . The claim must have the information we need to determin e benefits. If the claim does not include enough information, we will ask you for more details and inform you of the time by which we need to receive that information. Once we receive the required information, we will process the claim according to the terms of your Plan. Please note that failure to submit the information we need by the time listed in our request could result in the denial of your claim, unless state or federal law requires an extension. Please contact Member Services if you have any questions or concerns about how to submit claims. 94 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 Member's Cooperation You will be expected to complete and submit to us all such authorizations, consents, releases, assignments and other documents that may be needed in order to obtain or assure reimbursement under Medicare, Workers' Compensation or any other governmental program. If you fail to cooperate you will be responsible for any charge for services. Payment of Benefits You authorize us to make payments directly to Providers for Covered Se rvices. In no event, however, shall our right to make payments directly to a Provider be deemed to suggest that any Provider is a beneficiary with independent claims and appeal rights under the Plan. W here permitted by applicable law, w e reserve the rig ht to make payments directly to you as opposed to any Provider for Covered Service, at our discretion. In the event that payment is made directly to you, you have the responsibility to apply this payment to the claim from the Out -of-Network Provider. Paym ents and notice regarding the receipt and/or adjudication of claims may also be sent to an Alternate Recipient (which is defined herein as any child of a Subscriber who is recognized under a \"Qualified Medical Child Support Order\" as having a right to enro llment under the Group's Plan), or that person's custodial parent or designated representative. Any payments made by us (whether to any Provider for Covered Service or You) will discharge our obligation to pay for Covered Services. You cannot assign your right to receive payment to anyone, except as required by a \"Qualified Medical Child Support Order\" as defined by, and if subject to, ERISA or any applicable Federal law. Once a Provider performs a Covered Service, we will not honor a request to withhold payment of the claims submitted. The coverage, rights, and benefits under the Plan are not assignable by any Member without the written consent of the Plan, except as provided above. This prohibition against assignment includes rights to receive payment, c laim benefits under the Plan and/or law, sue or otherwise begin legal action, or request Plan documents or any other information that a Participant or beneficiary may request under ERISA. Any assignment made without written consent from the Plan will be v oid and unenforceable . Inter -Plan Arrangements Out-of-Area Services Overview We have a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensees. Generally, these relationships are called \"Inter-Plan Arrangements.\" These Inter -Plan Arrangements work b ased on rules and procedures issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (\"Association\"). Whenever you access healthcare services outside the geographic area we serve (the \" Anthem Service Area\"), the claim for those services may be processed throu gh one of these Inter-Plan Arrangements. The Inter-Plan Arrangements are described below. When you receive care outside of the Anthem Service Area, you will receive it from one of two kinds of Providers. Most Providers (\"participating providers\") contract with the local Blue C ross and/or Blue Shield Plan in that geographic area (\"Host Blue\"). Some Providers (\"nonparticipating providers\") don't contract with the Host Blue. We explain below how we pay both kinds of Providers. 95 NVLGPPO Eligibility - Claim Types Most claim types are eligible to be processed through Inter-Plan Arrangements, as described above. Examples of claims that are not included are Prescription Drugs that you obtain from a Pharmacy and most dental or vision benefits. A. Blue Card\u00ae Program Under the BlueCard\u00ae Program, when you receive Covered Services within the geographic area served by a Host Blue, we will still fulfill our contractual obligations. But, the Host Blue is responsible for: (a) contracting with its Providers; and (b) handling its interactions with those Providers. When you receive Covered Services outside the Anthem Service Area and the claim is pro cessed through the BlueCard Program, the amount you pay is calculated based on the lower of: The billed charges for Covered Services; or The negotiated price that the Host Blue makes available to us. Often, this \"negotiated price\" will be a simple discount that reflects an actual price that the Host Blue pays to the Provider . Sometimes, it is an estimated price that takes into account special arrangements with that Provider. Sometimes, such an arrangement may be an average price, based on a discount that results in expected average savings for services provided by similar types of Providers. Estimated and average pricing arrangements may also involve types of settlements, incentive payments and/or other credits or charges. Estimated pricing and average pricing also take into account adjustments to correct for over- or underestimation of past pricing of claims, as noted above. However, such adjustments will not affect the price we used for your claim because they will not be applied after a claim has already been paid. B. Negotiated (non -BlueCard Program) Arrangements With respect to one or more Host Blues, instead of using the BlueCard Program, Anthem may process your claims for Covered Services through Negotiated Arrangements for National Accounts. The amount you pay for Covered Services under this arrangement will be calculated based on the lower of either billed charges for Covered Services or the negotiated price (refer to the description of negotiated price under Section A. BlueCard Program) made available to Anthem by the Host Blue. C. Special Cases: Value-Based Programs BlueCard\u00ae Program If you receive Covered Services under a Value-Based Program inside a Ho st Blue's Service Area, you will not be responsible for paying any of the Provider Ince ntives, risk-sharing, and/or Care Coordinator Fees that are a part of such an arrangement, except when a Ho st Blue passes these fees to Anthe m throu gh average pricing or fee schedule adjustments. Additional information is available upon request. Value -Based Programs: Negotiated (non -BlueCard Program) Arrangements If Anthem has entered into a Negotiated Arrangement with a Host Blue to provide Value -Based Programs to the Employer on your behalf, Anthem will follow the same procedures for Value -Based Programs administration and Care Coordinator Fees as noted above for the BlueCard Program. 96 NVLGPPO Taxes/Surcharges/Fees Federal or state laws or regulations may require a surcharge, tax or other fee. If applicable, we will include any such surcharge, tax or other fee as part of the claim charge passed on to you. E. Nonparticipating Providers Outside Our Service Area 1. Allowed Amounts and Member Liabili ty Calculati on When Covered Services are provided outside of Anthem's Service Area by non -participating providers, we may determine benefits and make payment based on pricing from either the Host Blue or the pricing arrangements required by applicable state or federal law. In these situations, the amount you pay for such services as Deductible, Copayment or Coinsurance will be based on that allowed amount. Also, you may be responsible for the difference between the amount that the non -participating provider bills and the payment we will make for the Covered Services as set forth in this paragraph. Federal or state law, as applicable, will govern payments for out -of- network Emergency services. 2. Exceptions In certain situations, we may use other pricing methods, such as billed charges or the pricing we would use if the healthcare services had been obtained within the Anthem Service Area, or a special negotiated price to determine the amount we will pay for services provided by nonparticipating providers. In these situations, you may be liable for the difference between the amount that the nonparticipating provider bills and the payment we make for the Covered Services as set forth in this paragraph. F. Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core\u00ae Program If you plan to travel outside the United States, call Member Services to find out your Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core\u00ae benefits. Benefits for services received outside of the United States may be different from services received in the United States. R emember to take an up to date health ID card with you.

The only amounts that you may need to pay up front are any Copayment, Coinsurance or Deductible amounts that may apply. You will typically need to pay for the following services up front: not arranged through Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core\u00ae; and Outpatient services. You will need to file a claim form for any payments made up front.

You will find the address for mailing the claim on the form. 98 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 Coordination of Benefits When Members Are Insured Under More Than One Plan We coordinate benefits when you have duplicate coverage. Duplicate Coverage - Duplicate coverage exists when you are covered by this coverage and also covered by another group or group -type health insurance or health benefits coverage or blanket coverage, or where permitted by law, an individual insurance policy . The total benefits received by you, or on your behalf, from all coverage's combined for any claim for Covered Servic es will not exceed 100 percent of the total covered charges. Allowable Expense is a health care expense, including Deductibles, Coinsurance and Copayments, that is covered at least in part by any plan covering the Member. When a plan provides benefits in t he form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service will be considered an allowable expense and a benefit paid. An expense that is not covered by any plan covering the Member is not an allowable expense. In addition, any expense that a provider by law or in accordance with a contractual agreement is prohibited from charging the Member is not an allowable expense. The following are not allowable expense: The difference between the cost of a semi -private hospital room and a private hospital room, u nless one of the plans provides coverage for private hospital room expenses. If the Member is covered by two plans that calculate benefits or services on the basis of a reasonable and customary amount or relative value schedule reimbursement method or some other similar reimbursement method, any amount in excess of the higher of the reasonable and customary amounts. If the Member is covered by two plans that provide benefits or services on the basis of negotiated rates or fees, an amount in excess of th e highest of the negotiated rates. If the Member is covered by one plan that calculates its benefits or services on the basis of usual and customary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement methodology or other similar reimbursement methodology and an other plan that provides its benefits or services on the basis of negotiated fees, the primary plan's payment arrangement shall be the allowable expense for all plans. However, if the provider has contracted with the secondary plan to provide the benefit o r service for a specific negotiated fee or payment amount that is different than the primary plan's payment arrangement and if the provider's contract permits, the negotiated fee or payment shall be the allowable expense used by the secondary plan to deter mine its benefits. The amount of any benefit reduction by the primary plan because the Member failed to comply with the Plan provisions is not an allowable expense. Examples of these types of plan provisions include second surgical opinions, precertificati on of admissions, and preferred provider arrangements. If the Member advises Anthem that all plans covering the Member are high deductible health plans as defined by Section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code, and the Member intends to contribute to a health savings account established in accordance with Section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code, any amount that is subject to the primary high deductible health plan's deductible. How We Determine Which Coverage is Primary and Which is Secondary - We will determ ine the primary coverage and secondary coverage according to the following rule: A coverage is primary if it does not have order of benefit determination rules or if it has rules that differ from those permitted by state law. 99 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 The amount that is subject to the Primary high -deductible health plan's deductible, if We have been advised by you that all Plans covering you are high -deductible health plans and you intend to contribute to a health savings account established in accordan ce with Section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Duplicate Coverage on Members - A coverage is primary if the Member claiming benefits is the person in whose name the policy is issued but who is not a Dependent under that coverage (except when covered by Medicare or COBRA). The benefits of a coverage which covers a person as an employee who is not laid -off or retired (or as that employee's Dependent) is primary before benefits of a coverage which covers that person as a laid -off or retired employee (or as that employee's Dependent). When you (including your Dependent family Members) have duplicate coverage carried through two or more employers, the policy that has been in force the longest period of time is primary. The policy that has been in forc e the shortest period of time is secondary. When the coverage through one of the employers is a COBRA policy and one of the coverage's is through active employment, the coverage through active employment is primary. NOTE: Change in plan administrators is c onsidered continuous coverage. Therefore, the Effective Date of the coverage in that group is the Effective Date with the original carrier who provided insurance or the original administrator for self -funded plans, as long as there were no lapses in cover age. Information about coordinating benefits for Members who hold two insurance policies and Medicare may be found under the \"Members with Medicare and Two Group Insurance Policies\" heading in this section of this Benefit Booklet. Duplicate Coverage on Sp ouses - When your Spouse has group coverage through an employer and is actively working, that coverage is primary for the Spouse. When the coverage carried by the Spouse is through retiree or inactive employment, that coverage will be primary over the coverage carried by our Subscriber. When the Spouse's coverage through the employer is a COBRA policy and our coverage is active, then the Spouse's COBRA coverage will be secondary to us. Note: Information about coordinating benefits for Members who hold t wo insurance policies and Medicare may be found under the heading \"Members with Medicare and Two Group Insurance Policies\" heading in this section. Duplicate Coverage on Dependent Children (when parents are not separated or divorced) - If both coverages co ver the child as a Dependent, the benefits of the coverage of the parent whose birthday occurs earlier in the year is primary (\"Birthday Rule\") over those of the coverage of the parent whose birthday falls later in that year. However, if both parents have the same birthday (month and day, not year), then the benefits of the coverage that has covered the parent and Dependent(s) longest is primary over the coverage which has covered the other parent and Dependent(s) for a shorter period of time. If either for m of coverage does not follow the Birthday Rule, the male subscriber's insurance or plan is the primary Plan. Duplicate Coverage on Dependent Children (when parents are separated or divorced) - We require a copy of the divorce decree to establish primacy o n children of divorced parents. 100 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 When the specific terms of a court decree state that one of the parents is responsible for providing health insurance for the child that insurance policy is primary. The insurance policy of the other parent is the secondary coverage. The insurance policy or plan of the parent with legal custody of the child is primary. When the parent with custody remarries, the custodial parent's coverage remains primary. The stepparent's coverage becomes secondary, and the coverage of the parent without custody pays after the stepparent's coverage. The Birthday Rule (benefits of the coverage of the parent whose birthday occurs earlier in the year are primary) applies when the specific terms of the court decree state that the parents share joint custody and both must provide health benefits. The Birthday Rule applies when the specific terms of the court decree state that the parents share joint custody, without stating which parent is responsible for providing health benefits for the child. When the divorce decree states that one of the parents is responsible for providing health insurance and the parents share joint custody, then the parent providing the coverage will be primary. Members with a Stand -Alone Dental Policy - For Covered Service s provided by an Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon, the Plan will be secondary for when the Member is covered under a Stand -Alone Dental Policy. \"Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon\" means a dentist who has been issued a specialist's license to practice oral and m axillofacial surgery pursuant to NRS 631.250 and who provides any of the services described in paragraph (c) of subsection 1 of NRS 631.215. \"Stand -Alone Dental Policy\" means any policy which only pays for or reimburses any part of the cost of dental care, as defined in NRS 695D.030, and is offered or issued separately from a policy of health insurance. How We Coordinate Benefits - When we are the primary coverage, including if you have other coverage under an individual policy of insurance, we pay benefits under the terms of this Benefit Booklet. When we are the secondary coverage, we may pay up to the difference between benefits that would be payable by the primary coverage and the amount that would be payable under this Benefit Booklet in the absence of a Coordination of Benefits provision, so long as that difference is not more than this Plan would normally pay. Benefits provided under any other coverage include benefits that would have been provided had a claim been made for these benefits. Determining P rimacy Between Medicare and this Plan - We will be the primary payer for persons age 65 and older with Medicare coverage if the Subscriber is actively working for an employer who is providing the Subscriber's health insurance and the employer has 20 or mor e employees. Medicare will be the primary payer for persons age 65 and older with Medicare coverage if the Subscriber is not actively working and the member is enrolled in Medicare. Medicare will be the primary payer for persons with Medicare age 65 and o lder if the employer has less than 20 employees and the member is enrolled in Medicare. This Plan will be the primary payer for persons under age 65 with Medicare coverage when Medicare coverage is due to disability if the member is actively working for an employer who is providing the member's health coverage and the employer has 100 or more employees. Medicare will be the primary payer for persons enrolled with Medicare due to disability if the member is not actively working or the employer has less than 100 employees. This Plan will be the primary payer for persons under age 65 with Medicare coverage when Medicare coverage is due to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), for the first 30 months from the entitlement to or eligibility for Medicare (whether or not Medicare is taken at that time). After 30 months, Medicare will become the primary payer if Medicare is in effect (30 -month coordination period). When a Member becomes eligible for Medicare due to a second entitlement (such as age), we remain primary, if we were primary at the point when the second entitlement became effective, for the duration of 101 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 30 months after the Medicare entitlement or eligibility due to ESRD. If Medicare was primary at the point of the second entitlement, then Medicare remains prima ry. There will be no 30 -month coordination period for ESRD. Members with Medicare and Two Group Insurance Policies - If Medicare is secondary to a group coverage (see Medicare primacy rules), the primary coverage covering the Member will pay first, Medicare will pay second, and the coverage covering the Member as a retiree or inactive employee or Dependent will pay third. The order of primacy is not based on the group health insurance subscriber. If Medicare is the primary payer due to Medicare primacy rules, then the rules of primacy for employees and their Spouses will be used to determine the coverage that will pay second and third. The rules of primacy can be found under the heading \"Double Coverage on Spouses.\" Your Obligations - You have an obligation to provide us with current and accurate information regarding the existence of other coverage. Benefits payable under another coverage include benefits that would be payable under that coverage, whether or not a claim is made, and ben efits that would have been paid but were refused because the claim was not sent to the Provider of other coverage on a timely basis. Your benefits under this Benefit Booklet will be reduced by the amount that such benefits would duplicate benefits pay able under the primary coverage. Anthem's Rights to Receive and Release Necessary Information - We may release to, or obtain, from any insurance company or other organization or person any information which we may need to carry out the terms of this Booklet. M embers will furnish to us such information as may be necessary to carry out the terms of this Booklet. Payment of Benefits to Others - Whenever payments that should have been made under this Benefit Booklet have been made under any other coverage, we will have the right to pay to the other coverage any amount we determine to be warranted to satisfy the intent of this provision. Any amount so paid will be considered to be benefits paid under this Benefit Booklet, and with that payment we will fully satisfy our liability under this provision. Right of Overpayment Recovery - If we have overpaid for Covered Services under this provision, we will have the right, by offset or otherwise, to recover the excess amount from you or any person or entity to which, or on whose behalf, the payments were made. 102 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 Subrogation and Reimbursement These provisions apply when we pay benefits as a result of injuries or illness and another party(ies) agrees or is ordered to pay money because of these injuries or when the member has re ceived or is entitled to receive a recovery because of these injuries or illnesses. Subrogation We have the right to recover payments we make on the Member's behalf. Except where prohibited by law or regulation, the following applies: We have a lien for t he full amount of benefits we have paid from any recovery, including, but not limited to, the other party or parties who caused the injuries or illness, the insurer or other indemnifier of the party or parties who caused the injuries or illness, a guaranto r of the party or parties who caused the injuries or illness, or any other person, entity, policy or plan that may be liable or legally responsible in relation to the injuries or illness. We will not seek to recover payments from individual health insuran ce, health insurance under a franchise plan, no -fault automobile insurance, automobile medical insurance or any other first -party coverage of the member. The Member and the Member's legal representative must do whatever is necessary to enable us to exercis e our rights and do nothing to prejudice them. We have the right to take whatever legal action we see fit against any party or entity to recover the benefits p aid under this Benefit Booklet. We are not responsible for any attorney fees, other expenses or costs incurred without our prior written consent. Right of Reimbursement If the Member, the Member's legal representative, or beneficiary obtain a recovery sufficient to satisfy in full the Member's claim against the third party(ies) and we have not been repaid for the benefits we paid on the Member's behalf, we shall have a lien right to be repaid from the recovery in the amount of the benefits paid on the member's behalf and the following apply: Once the Member is made whole, the Member must reimburse us to the extent of benefits we paid on the Member's behalf from any recovery, including, but not limited to, the other party or parties who caused the injuries or illness, the insurer or other indem nifier of the party or parties who caused the injuries or illness, a guarantor of the party or parties who caused the injuries or illness, or any other person, entity, policy or plan that may be liable or legally responsible in relation to the injuries or illness. We will not seek to recover payments from individual health insurance, health insurance under a franchise plan, no -fault automobile insurance, automobile medical insurance or any other first -party coverage of the member. Notwithstanding any alloca tion made in a settlement agreement, we shall have a right of reimbursement against any recovery. The Member's Duties The Member, the Member's legal representative, or beneficiary must notify us promptly of how, when and where an accident or incident resul ting in personal injury or illness to the Member occurred and all information regarding the parties involved or any other information requested by us. The Member, the Member's legal representative, or beneficiary must cooperate with us in the investigation , settlement and protection of our rights.

Appeals While we encourage you to file Appeals within 60 days of the adverse benefit determination, the written or oral Appeal must be received by us within 180 days of the adverse benefit determination. Appeals may be for pre-service denials or post -service denials. We will assign an employee to assist you in the Appeal process. You may send written Ap peals to the following address: Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield Appeals Department 700 Broadway Denver, CO 80273 The Ap peal must state plainly the reason(s) why you disagree with our claim decision, refusal to authorize or cover a requested service or supply, or how we calculated the benefit. You should include any documents not originally submitted with the claim or requ est for the service or supply and any other information that you feel may have a bearing on the decision. Through the Appeal process, you can access two levels of Appeal, and, where appropriate, independent external review. You can designate a representati ve (e.g., your Physician or anyone else of your choosing) to assist you with filing any level of Appeal. In some instances, we may ask you to designate your representative in writing. You or your representative can review the Appeal file on request, and ca n present evidence as part of the Appeal process. If, after our denial, we consider, rely on or generate any new or additional evidence in connection with your claim, we will provide you with that new or additional evidence, free of charge. We will not bas e our appeal decision on a new or additional rationale without first providing you (free of charge) with, and a reasonable opportunity to respond to, any such new or additional rationale. First Level Appeal \u2014 This is an Appeal in which the Anthem Appeal Bo ard reviews the Appeal and makes a determination. The majority of the Appeal Board are Members who receive health care benefits 107 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 from us and who were not involved in the initial adverse benefit determination, but a person who was previously involved with th e denial may answer questions. The Appeal Board will make its determination within 30 days after receipt of the Appeal, unless you agree to a longer period. You will receive written notification of the Appeal Board's determination, with the reasons for its decision. Second Level Appeal \u2014 If the First Level Appeal decision is not satisfactory, you can (but do not have to) file a Second Level Appeal. You have 60 days from receiving the First Level Appeal decisio n in which to request a Second Level Appeal. The panel of the Second Level Appeal Board includes a minimum of three people. The majority of the Second Level Appeal Board are Members who receive health care benefits from us. At the Second Level Appeal, yo u or your representative may appear or be teleconferenced in to present information. We will provide you with a copy of the Second Level Appeal Board's written decision within 30 days after receipt of the Appeal request, unless you agree to a longer period of time. We will provide a copy of the decision to any Provider who submits a Second Level Appeal on your behalf . Expedited First Level Appeal \u2014 You or your representative have the right to request an expedited Appeal when the time frames for a standar d review could: (1) seriously jeopardize your life or health; (2) jeopardize your ability to regain maximum function; or (3) in the opinion of a physician with knowledge of your medical condition, would subject you to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment that is the subject of the appeal. Expedited Appeals will be resolved as quickly as medical circumstances require, but not later than 72 hours after receipt of the request. Except as mentioned below, expedited Appeals are not available when the service or supply in question has already been provided to you. Independent External Review Appeal \u2014 If our decision involved making a judgment as to the medical necessity, appropriateness, health care setting, level of care or effectiveness of the health care service or treatment you requested, you may have the right to Independent External Review, where our decision will be reviewed by health care professionals who have no association with us. You may also request an Independe nt External Review when a claim has been denied based upon a determination that the recommended or requested health care service or treatment is experimental or investigational treatment. Except as noted below, in order to request an Independent External R eview, you must have first completed a First Level Appeal, but you can make such a request either after or instead of choosing to file a Second Level Appeal. But if we fail to respond to a Complaint or Appeal within thirty (30) calendar days, and you have not agreed to an extension, you can request an Independent External Review and you will be considered to have exhausted the internal Appeals process. Also, in some instances, we may (but are not required to) agree to an Independent External Review even i f you have not exhausted the First Level Appeal. If we fail to follow the Appeal procedures outlined under this section the Appeals process may be deemed exhausted. However, the Appeals process will not be deemed exhausted due to minor violations that do not cause, and are not likely to cause, prejudice or harm so long as the error was for good cause or due to matters beyond our control. The request for Independent External Review must be made to the Nevada Office of the Governor, Consumer Health Assistanc e within four months after the adverse benefit determination or our final Appeal determination, whichever is later .

However, if your denial is eligible for Independent External Review, an Independent Review Organization will be assigned to conduct th e review and issue a decision. Expedited Independent External Review Appeals \u2014 An expedited r eview may be requested from the Office of Consumer Health Assistance when: (1) an adverse benefit determination concerns an admission, availability of care, continued stay or health care service for which you received emergency services but have not been discharged from the facility providing the services or care; or (2) failure to proceed in an expedited manner may jeopardize your life or health or your abil ity to regain maximum function; or (3) if the claim has been denied based upon a determination that the service or treatment is experimental or investigational, your treating Physician certifies in writing that the recommended service or treatment would be significantly less effec tive if not promptly initiated. Typically, you must complete a First Level Appeal prior to requesting external review. However, if the adverse determination involves a denial based on a determination that the service or treatment is experimental or investigational and the treating Physician certifies in writing that the service or treatment would be significantly less effective if not promptly initiated, and, if you have a medical condition where the time to complete an Expedited F irst Level Appeal would seriously jeopardize your life, health or ability to regain maximum function, then you or your representative can request Expedited Independent External Review at the same time as requesting an Expedited First Level Appeal. If elig ible for Expedited Independent External Review, the Independent Review Organization assigned to your case will then determine whether the Independent External Review should be decided before your Expedited First Level Appeal . The Office of Consumer Health Assistance shall approve or deny a request for an expedited external review within 72 hours after it receives proof of whether the request qualifies for expedited external review. Upon determination that the request is eligible for an expedited external re view, Office of Consumer Health Assistance shall assign an Independent Review Organization within 1 working day after approving the request. 109 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 We shall provide all documents and information used to make the adverse determination to the Independent Review Org anization within 24 hours after receiving notice from the Office of Consumer Health Assistance assigning the request.

Qualifying events for Continuation Coverage under Federal Law (COBRA) COBRA continu ation coverage is available when your coverage would otherwise end because of certain \"qualifying events.\" After a qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage must be offered to each person who is a \"qualified beneficiary.\" You, your spouse and your De pendent children could become qualified beneficiaries if you were covered on the day before the qualifying event and your coverage would be lost because of the qualifying event. Qualified beneficiaries who elect COBRA must pay for this COBRA continuation coverage. This benefit entitles each Member of your family who is enrolled in the Plan to elect continuation independently. Each qualified beneficiary has the right to make independent benefit elections at the time of annual enrollment. Covered Subscribe rs may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their spouses, and parents or legal guardians may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their children. A child born to, or placed for adoption with, a covered Subscriber during the period of continuation coverage is also eligible for elec tion of continuation coverage. Qualifying Event Length of Availability of Coverage For Subscribers: Voluntary or Involuntary Termination (other than gross misconduct) or Loss of Coverage Under an Employer's Health Plan Due to Reduction In Hours Worked 18 months For Dependents: A Covered Subscriber's Voluntary or Involuntary Termination (other than gross misconduct) or Loss of Coverage Under an Employer's Health Plan Due to Reduction In Hours Worked 18 months Covered Subscriber's Entitlement to Medicare 36 months Divorce or Legal Separation 36 months Death of a Covered Subscriber 36 months For Dependent Children: Loss of Dependent Child Status 36 months COBRA coverage will end before the end of the maximum continuation period listed above if you become entitled to Medicare benefits. In that case , a qualified beneficiary - other than the Medicare beneficiary - is entitled to continuation coverage for no more t han a total of 36 months. (For example, if you become entitled to Medicare prior to termination of employment or reduction in hours, COBRA continuation coverage for your spouse and children can last up to 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement.) If Your Group Offers Retirement Coverage If you are a retiree under this Plan, filing a proceeding in bankruptcy under Title 11 of the United States Code may be a qualifying event. If a proceeding in bankruptcy is filed with respect to your Group, and 118 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 that bankruptcy results in the loss of coverage, you will become a qualified beneficiary with respect to the bankruptcy. Your Dependents will also become qualified beneficiaries if bankruptcy results in the loss of their coverage under this Plan. If COBRA c overage becomes available to a retiree and his or her covered family members as a result of a bankruptcy filing, the retiree may continue coverage for life and his or her Dependents may also continue coverage for a maximum of up to 36 months following the date of the retiree's death. Second qualifying event If your family has another qualifying event (such as a legal separation, divorce, etc.) during the initial 18 months of COBRA continuation coverage, your Dependents can receive up to 18 additional months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 36 months from the original qualifying event. Such additional coverage is only available if the second qualifying event would have caused your Dependents to lose coverage under the Plan had the first quali fying event not occurred. Notification Requirements The Group will offer COBRA continuation coverage to qualified beneficiaries only after the Group has been notified that a qualifying event has occurred. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of hours of employment, death of the Subscriber, commencement of a proceeding in bankruptcy with respect to the employer, or the Subscriber's becoming entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both), the Group will not ify the COBRA Administrator (e.g., Human Resources or their external ve ndor) of the qualifying event. You Must Give Notice of Some Qualifying Events For other qualifying events (e.g., divorce or legal separation of the Subscriber and spouse or a Dependent child's losing eligibility for coverage as a Dependent child), you must notify the Group within 60 days afte r the qualifying event occurs. Electing COBRA Continuation Coverage To continue your coverage, you or an eligible family Member must make an electio n within 60 days of the date your coverage would otherwise end, or the date the company's benefit Plan Administrator notifies you or your family Member of this right, whichever is later. You must pay the total Premium appropriate for the type of benefit c overage you choose to continue. If the Premium rate changes for active associates, your monthly Premium will also change. The Premium you must pay cannot be more than 102% of the Premium charged for Employees with similar coverage, and it must be paid to the company's benefit plan administrator within 30 days of the date due, except that the initial Premium payment must be made before 45 days after the initial election for continuation coverage, or your continu ation rights will be forfeited. Disability ex tension of 18 -month period of continuation coverage For Subscribers who are determined, at the time of the qualifying event, to be disabled under Title II (OASDI) or Title XVI (SSI) of the Social Security Act, and Subscribers who become disabled during the first 60 days of COBRA continuation coverage, coverage may continue from 18 to 29 months. These Subscribers' Dependents are also eligible for the 18 - to 29 -month disability extension. (This also applies if any covered family Member is found to be disabl ed.) This would only apply if the qualified beneficiary gives notice of disability status within 60 days of the disabling determination. In these cases, the Employer can charge 150% of Premium for months 19 through 29. This would allow health coverage t o be provided in the period between the end of 18 months and the time that Medicare begins coverage for the disabled at 29 months. (If a qualified beneficiary is determined by the Social Security Administration to 119 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 be disabled, such qualified bene ficiary must notify the Plan Administrator of that fact in writing within 30 days after the Social Security Administration's determination.) Trade Adjustment Act Eligible Individual If you don't initially elect COBRA coverage and later become eligible for trade adjustment assistance under the U.S. Trade Act of 1974 due to the same event which caused you to be eligible initially for COBRA coverage under this Plan, you will be entitled to another 60 -day period in which to elect COBRA coverage. This second 60 -day period will commence on the first day of the month on which you become eligible for trade adjustment assistance. COBRA coverage elected during this second election period will be effective on the fir st day of the election period. When COBRA Coverage E nds COBRA benefits are available without proof of insurability and coverage will end on the earliest of the following: A covered individual reaches the end of the maximum coverage period; A covered individual fails to pay a required Premium on time; A cove red individual becomes covered under any other group health plan after electing COBRA. If the other group health plan contains any exclusion or limitation on a pre -existing condition that applies to you, you may continue COBRA coverage only until these li mitations cease; A covered individual becomes entitled to Me dicare after electing COBRA; or The Group terminates all of its group welfare benefit plans. Other Coverage Options Besides COBRA Continuation Coverage Instead of enrolling in COBRA continuation coverage, there may be other coverage options for you and your family through the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicaid, or other group health plan coverage options (such as a spouse's plan) through what is called a \"special enrollment period .\" Some of these options may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage. You can learn more about many of these options at www.healthcare.gov . If You Have Questions Questions concerning your Group's health Plan and your COBRA continuation coverage rights should be addressed to the Group. For more information about your rights under ERISA, including COBRA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and other laws affecting group health plans, contact the nearest Regional or District Office of the U.S. Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) in your area or visit the EBSA website at www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa . (Addre sses and phone numbers of Regional and District EBSA Offices are ava ilable through EBSA's website.) Continuation of Coverage Under State Law Total Disability Coverage Coverage may continue for a Subscriber and covered Dependents while the Subscriber is on leave without pay due to a total disability. Coverage under this provision continues until the earliest of the following: Twelve months from the date that cover age began under this provision. 120 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO which the Subscri ber's e mployment is terminated. The date on which the employer master contract is terminated. The date on which the Subscriber obtains other health care ben efits or health care insurance. Continuation of Coverage Due To Military Service Under the Uniformed Servic es Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), the Subscriber or his / her Dependents may have a right to continue health care coverage under the Plan if the Subscriber must take a leave of absence from work due to military leave . Employers mu st give a cumulative total of five years and in certain instances more than five years, of military leave. \"Military service\" means performance of duty on a voluntary or involuntary basis and includes active duty, active duty for training, initial active d uty for training, inactive duty training, and full -time National Guard duty. During a military leave covered by USERRA, the law requires employers to continue to give coverage under this Plan to its Members. The coverage provided must be identical to the coverage provided to similarly situated, active employees and Dependents. This means that if the coverage for similarly situated, active employees and Dependents is modified, coverage for you (the individual on military leave) will be modified. You may el ect to continue to cover yourself and your eligible Dependents by notifying your employer in advance and submitting payment of any required contribution for health coverage. This may include the amount the employer normally pays on your behalf. If your m ilitary service is for a period of time less than 31 days, you may not be required to pay more than the active Member contribution, if any, for continuation of health coverage. For military leaves of 31 days or more, you may be required to pay up to 102% of the full cost of coverage, i.e., the employee and employer share. The amount of time you continue coverage due to USERRA will reduce the amount of time you will be eligible to continue coverage under COBRA. Maximum Period of Coverage During a Military L eave Continued coverage under USERRA will end on the earlier of the following events: The date you fail to return to work with the Group following completion of your military leave. Subscribers must return to work within: \u00ad The first full business day after completing military service, for leaves of 30 days or less. A reasonable amount of travel time will be allowed for returning from such military service. \u00ad 14 days after completing military service for leaves of 31 to 180 days, \u00ad 90 days after completing military service for leaves of more than 180 days; or 24 months from the date your leave began. Reinstatement of Coverage Following a Military Leave Regardless of whether you continue coverage during your military leave, if you return to work your health coverage and that of your eligible Dependents will be reinstated under this Plan if you return within: 121 NVLGPPO (1/23) -EOC.v2 NV2 -LL-LG-SOS_ALT C_PPO 250/10%/2250 BS 1 The first full business day of completing your military service, for leaves of 30 days or less. A reasonable amount of travel time will be allowed for r eturning from such military service; 14 days of completing your military service for leaves of 31 to 180 days; or 90 days of completing your military service for leaves of more than 180 days. If, due to an illness or injury caused or aggravated by your mil itary service, you cannot return to work within the time frames stated above, you may take up to: Two years; or As soon as reasonably possible if, for reasons beyond your control you cannot return within two years because you are recovering from such illne ss or injury. If your coverage under the Plan is reinstated, all terms and conditions of the Plan will apply to the extent that they would have applied if you had not taken military leave and your coverage had been continuous. Any waiting / probationary periods will apply only to the extent that they applied before. Please note that, regardless of th e continuation and/or reinstatement provisions listed above, this Plan will not cover services for any illness or injury caused or aggravated by your military service, as indicated in the \"What's Not Covered\" section. Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 A Subscriber who takes a leave of absence under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (the Act) will still be eligible for this Plan during their leave. We will not consider the Subscriber and his or her Dependents ineligible because the Subscriber is not at work. If the Subscriber ends their coverage during the leave, the Subscriber and any Dependents who were covered immediately before the leave may be added back to the Plan when the Subscriber returns to work without medical underwriting. To be adde d back to the Plan, the Group may have to give us evidence that the Family and Medical Leave Act applied to the Subscriber. We may require a copy of the health care Provider statement allowed by the Act. Benefits After Termination Of Coverage Except as pr ovided below, we will not pay for any services provided after your coverage ends even if precertification was received. Benefits cease on the date your coverage ends as described above.

These Programs may vary in methodology and subject area of focus and may be modified by us from time to time, but they will be generally designed to tie a certain portion of an In -Network Provider's total compensation to pre -defined quality, cost, efficiency or service standards or metrics. In some instances, In-Network Providers may be required to make payment to us under the Program as a consequence of failing to mee t these pre -defined standards. The Programs are not intended to affect your access to health care. The Program payments are not made as payment for specific Covered Services provided to you, but instead, are based on the In - Network Provider's achievement of these pre -defined standards.

Voluntary Clinical Quality Programs We may offer additional opportunities to assist you in obtaining certain covered preventive or other care (e.g., well child check -ups or certain laboratory screening tests) that you have not receive d in the recommended timeframe. These opportunities are called volun tary clinical quality programs. They are designed to encourage you to get certain care when you need it and are separate from Co vered Services under your Plan. These programs are not guaranteed and cou ld be discontinued at any time. We will give you the choice and if you choose to participate in one of these programs, and obtain the recommended care within the program's timeframe, you may receive incentives such as gift cards or retailer coupons, which we encourage you to use for health and wellness related activities or items .
