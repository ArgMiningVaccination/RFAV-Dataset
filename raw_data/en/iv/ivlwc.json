My issues worsened after a trip to Europe, where I encountered a bacterial infection which stayed in my digestive tract. Eating became difficult as everything gave me a stomach ache. I had seen my local doctor and nutritionist. However, the treatments they recommended were not working. I decided to try acupuncture. I would highly recommend Dr. Barnett and Orlando Acupuncture for treating any ailments they have. They are very professional, and highly knowledgeable. Enjoying Life Again Enjoying Life Again Now in October, my hips and back have NO PAIN! It took a few months of intensive treatment but the wait and the work was well worth it! She has helped me greatly with my sleep and pain problems. I am enjoying life again and enjoy being active again. I always look forward to my now monthly visits to the office, and I have always left with a smile on my face. The rest of the staff is also a joy to be around. I have been and will continue to recommend your clinic to anyone who will listen! Pain Free In My Back! Pain Free In My Back! I had some minor back pain for several years. It progressed from minor to major... to the point where I could not even walk without having excruciating pain. The neurologist sent me for a MRI, and after receiving the results, prescribed six weeks of physical therapy. After completing the course of therapy, I was no better. So, I decided to give acupuncture a try. I am now pain-free in my back. I am grateful to Dr. Barnett and his team! If you have problems, I suggest you call Orlando Acupuncture and arrange for a consultation to see if they can help you as they did me. I Can't Say Enough I Can't Say Enough I have seen TMJ specialists, chiropractors, and anyone that would see me; always being told it's not that serious and to eat soft foods. It touched everything in my body, headaches, neck pain, shoulder, and face pain. I had to change my diet and sleep with a night guard. Within 4 treatments with Dr. Barnett I could tell a difference. After about 3 months of treatment my pain was between a 1-2 out of 10! It's awesome and I can't say enough. The treatments and herbs have made drastic changes in my life. Since then I have stayed on their membership program and look forward to my monthly \"tune up!\" Treated for Anxiety Treated for Anxiety My most disturbing symptoms were my lack of sleep, depression and anxiety. I had been on prescription drugs for depression and high cholesterol for 5-7 years. I only found minimal relief with medications and the costs continued to soar! Although physical activity has been beneficial, I wanted a more comprehensive holistic approach. I believe that after 2 months of treatment I am more focused with an ability to be clearer about my goals. I am training myself to envision being on the acupuncture table (here I am at my most relaxed state) whenever my stress buttons rise! Amazed By The Results Amazed By The Results As I rolled up to the front desk on my trusty walker, I was warmly greeted by the office staff, who in the weeks to come proved to be so supportive and friendly. My consultation with Dr. Barnett was very informative and professional. He patiently answered all of my many questions. His encouragement and compassion always gave me hope. In fact, within one month of the six months he prescribed, I was able to trade in my walker for a stylish cane. As treatment progressed so did I. My husband and I were amazed by the results. "}
