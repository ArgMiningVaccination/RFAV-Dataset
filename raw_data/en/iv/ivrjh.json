Talk to your doctor or physical therapist about which exercises will best help you meet your rehabilitation goals. After an injury or surgery, an exercise conditioning program will help you return to daily activities and enjoy a more active, healthy lifestyle. Following a well-structured conditioning program will also help you return to sports and other recreational activities. Strength: Strengthening the muscles that support your knee will reduce stress on your knee joint. Strong muscles help your knee joint absorb shock. Flexibility: Stretching the muscles that you strengthen is important for restoring range of motion and preventing injury. Gently stretching after strengthening exercises can help reduce muscle soreness and keep your muscles long and flexible. Target Muscles: The muscle groups targeted in this conditioning program include: - Quadriceps (front of the thigh) - Hamstrings (back of the thigh) - Abductors (outer thigh) - Adductors (inner thigh) - Gluteus medius and gluteus maximus (buttocks) Length of program: This should be continued for 4 to 6 weeks, unless otherwise specified by your doctor or physical therapist. After your recovery, these exercises can be continued as a maintenance program for lifelong protection and health of your knees. Performing the exercises two to three days a week will maintain strength and range of motion in your knees. Getting Started Warmup: Before doing the following exercises, warm up with 5 to 10 minutes of low impact activity, like walking or riding a stationary bicycle. Stretch: After the warm-up, do the stretching exercises shown on Page 1 before moving on to the strengthening exercises. When you have completed the strengthening exercises, repeat the stretching exercises to end the program. Do not ignore pain: You should not feel pain during an exercise. Talk to your doctor or physical therapist if you have any pain while exercising. Ask questions: If you are not sure how to do an exercise, or how often to do it, contact your doctor or physical therapist. 1.
