Here are 15 traits that reveal you're a spiritual healer (and don't know it)...", "sitename": "Power of Positivity: Positive Thinking & Attitude", "date": "2018-03-25", "cleaned_text": "Now more than ever, we need healers to come forward with their gifts and raise the world's vibration. Healers are a particular group that can help others come out of suffering and into the light. Many people don't have any hope left due to the current state of affairs, but spiritual healers can lift the broken and wounded up and restore their faith in humanity. The worn-out, fear-based programming doesn't work anymore for the majority of people, and so grand healing is now taking place on the planet. You might know a healer in your life or feel like you're one yourself, but sometimes, these gifts present themselves in subtle ways. Here are some signs to look out for in yourself and others that may point to being a [spiritual healer](https://www.powerofpositivity.com/spiritually-gifted-signs/). Here are 15 traits that reveal you're a spiritual healer (and don't know it): Spiritual healers are the ones who heal themselves first and create a ripple outward for others... 1. A spiritual healer will often identify as an empath. This world is oh-so draining for empaths and [highly sensitive people](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/communication-success/201711/24-signs-highly-sensitive-person). The noise, busyness, fast pace, social interactions, greed, violence, and other adverse occurrences leave a spiritual healer utterly exhausted. Empaths and lightworkers absorb the energy of the world around them, which often leaves them feeling frazzled and overwhelmed. Their sensitivity is a blessing because it can help heal the planet, but healers often feel cursed by this trait due to how heavy it can make them feel emotional. 2. You crave alone time often. Healers don't dislike people; they thrive better on their own. As we said, the [world's energy](https://www.powerofpositivity.com/spiritual-energy-drain-mindless/) can drain an empath or spiritual healer, so they need tons of time to recharge and rebalance their energies. 3. You feel that life is more than just paying bills. Spiritual healers feel trapped in this system because it's centered around making money, not following one's purpose. Healers can get quite frustrated with the world because they want to help others, but they feel that making money can get in the way due to time and financial constraints. If you feel trapped in your current job and dream of helping others, you might be a healer. 4. People are always coming to a spiritual healer for advice. People come to your left and right to help them with their problems because they know you'll have the answers. You might not know how to solve the problems in your own life, but you know how to drop everything and listen to someone else's struggles. Because you're highly sensitive, you can easily relate to other people's troubles and help them escape the darkness. 5. You're highly intuitive. A spiritual healer runs on emotions, not logic. Your gut feelings are king in decision-making because they have yet to steer you wrong. You \"know\" when something doesn't feel right, so you follow that instinct and don't question it. If this sounds like you, you're probably a spiritual healer. 6. You've had struggles with mental health. Many spiritual healers suffer from mental disorders because they feel they don't fit in. They don't know where to turn because every path seems to lead to stress and confusion, which can cause anxiety and depression. Spiritual healers are more sensitive to the overwhelming stimuli on the planet, which can cause them to retreat into solitude and avoid the world entirely. Speaking of which... 7. Social situations drain your energy. You feel exhausted afterward, even if it's just going out to do errands. Dealing with traffic, big crowds, your job, and conversations with others can quickly zap your energy and leave you daydreaming about crawling into bed and staying there for a while. 8. You can sense other people's emotions. This is perhaps one of the most evident signs of being a healer. If you can read someone else just by the emotions on their face or their body language, you're probably destined to be a spiritual healer. 9. You feel drawn to healing professions. If you feel drawn to a career in energy work such as Reiki or work that benefits the planet, like environmental sustainability, you are probably a healer. Healers don't do well in careers like sales or management because their talents don't shine in these fields. They prefer jobs that genuinely have a purpose, not just those that are centered on increasing profits. 10. People feel calm or happy around you. Despite your struggles, people can see past them and into your true nature. They say you make them feel centered, balanced, calm, or any other positive emotion. Healers can lift other people and give them hope, so if this sounds like you, you're a truly special soul. 11. A spiritual healer may just feel \"different.\" You can't explain it to people, but you've felt like an outcast your whole life. You don't understand the world's ways because many of them cause suffering, which causes great pain. It almost feels like you have no emotional skin because many things about the world impact you deeply. You don't relate to the shallowness of society, which is why you choose to remain an outcast, and you don't see this as a bad thing. 12. You are an idealist. Your head is always in the clouds because it sure beats being on the ground! You feel like the world could be so simple, but we make it incredibly complicated. Why can't we share our resources instead of fighting over them and destroying them? Why do we build a world that disconnects us from the natural one we were born into? 13. You are a deep thinker. Because you're an idealist, you're also a visionary that can see the bigger picture. You are always contemplating life on this planet to try to make sense of things and work them out in your mind. 14. You feel deeply connected to nature and animals. Humans don't make much sense to you, so you [gravitate toward animals](https://www.powerofpositivity.com/blue-jays-what-means/) and nature to feel peace and serenity. 15. A spiritual healer is a superb listener. You might not like talking much, but you know how to listen. You don't just hear people but tune into what they're saying and their subtle body language. You understand people well, which is why you attract those who need help.
