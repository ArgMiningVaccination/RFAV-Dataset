Benefits of Integrative Medicine Integrative medicine combines traditional and complementary therapies. Our coordinated approach supports healing and addresses all aspects of health. We'll work with you to tailor a plan to help: - Minimize nausea and vomiting, such as while undergoing chemotherapy or after surgery. - Relieve stress, anxiety, and depression. - Lower blood pressure. - Reduce pain, such as after surgery or pain caused by cancer treatment. - Reduce the symptoms of lymphedema. - Help you with insomnia or other sleep issues. - Improve your diet and support your nutrition goals or weight loss efforts. - Quit smoking. - Improve physical fitness or mobility, including for people with arthritis or Parkinson's disease. - Decrease hot flashes. - Decrease inflammation, which is linked to many diseases and health complaints, and improve your immune system. Integrative medicine refers to the use of conventional and complementary therapies together in a coordinated and evidence-based way, to facilitate the healing process. In integrative medicine, we consider the patient as a whole person and develop a plan for healing that addresses all aspects of health.Dr. Tracy Scheller, Medical Director of Integrative Medicine Evidence-Based Care in a Spa-Like Setting When you enter the Graf Center for Integrative Medicine, you'll be struck by its spa-like feel ( [take a photo tour](https://www.englewoodhealth.org/service/graf-center-for-integrative-medicine/photo-tour-of-the-graf-center)). Though it doesn't feel like a hospital, we are fully part of Englewood Health. Our team members are all licensed or certified, and we are overseen by a medical doctor. So you can trust us for safe, evidence-based care. Unlike alternative medicine (a non-mainstream approach used instead of conventional medicine), we may use non-mainstream therapies together with conventional medicine. If you seek Graf Center services while being treated for a health issue, we will work with your own doctor to help tailor a treatment plan. Above all, your safety always comes first. "}
