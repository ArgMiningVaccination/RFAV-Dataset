Complementary to Conventional Medicine: Natural medicine is often used alongside conventional medical treatments as a complementary approach. Research and Scientific Validation: Over the years, there has been an increasing interest in researching the efficacy and safety of natural medicine practices.

This focus on individualized care promotes a deeper patient-practitioner relationship and fosters a sense of empowerment in patients. Mind-Body Connection: Natural medicine recognizes the interplay between mental, emotional, and physical health.
