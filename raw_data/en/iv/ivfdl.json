The location of lesions itself is not an indication for treatment. Treatment decisions should be based on the severity of the presentation. OR - Individuals who may be at high-risk# of developing severe disease due to severe immunocompromise such as: - human immunodeficiency virus with a CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3, or a diagnosis of acquired immune deficiency syndrome for adults or a diagnosis of HIV for children - current treatment for a hematological malignancy such as leukemia or lymphoma - bone marrow/HSCT transplantation in the past 2 years - generalized malignancy (e.g., solid tumor or metastatic cancer) - solid organ transplantation - therapy with severely immunosuppressing agents (e.g., alkylating agents, antimetabolites, radiation, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, high-dose corticosteroids, treatment for graft-versus-host disease or receiving immunosuppressive therapy for an autoimmune disease with immunodeficiency as a clinical component) - Neonates and infants < 1-year-old - Children aged 1-17 years with immunocompromising conditions (e.g., HIV, cancer, currently taking immunosuppressive therapy) - Pregnant persons #Clinical judgement must be used when offering tecovirimat to non-severely ill patients who have been vaccinated with the smallpox vaccine (Vaccinia; Imvamune). Such patients are less likely to develop severe disease; however, the impact of smallpox vaccination in high-risk individuals infected with the recent strain of mpox has not been well characterized. In addition, vaccine timing (recent vs. decades ago) and immune status (during illness and at the time of vaccination) may impact vaccine response and must be strongly considered. The recommended tecovirimat dosing is 600mg PO BID for adults weighing 40-124kg and 600mg PO TID for adults weighing 125kg or more. The recommended duration of initial treatment is 7 days, with reassessment for the possibility of continued therapy for a total of 14 days. Treatment may be stopped after 7 days in those who are not severely ill, who are improving clinically and/or at the clinician's judgement. Treatment should be extended to 14 days in pregnant patients, those who remain hospitalized, those who are not experiencing improvement/experiencing progression, severely immunocompromised individuals exhibiting new lesions while on treatment, and/or at the clinician's judgement. Pediatric dosing is weight-based: 13 to < 25kg: 40kg: and over: refer to adult dosing. Tecovirimat capsules may be opened, mixed with food, or dissolved in liquid and given via feeding tubes. An IV formulation may be applied for through the Special Access Programme for those who are unable to take PO medications or for "}
