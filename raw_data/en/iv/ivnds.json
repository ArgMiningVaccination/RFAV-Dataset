The intent reflects a commitment to the attainment of excellence in practice by designing innovative and challenging educational experiences valuing diversity, providing evidence -based nursing care, and fostering lifelong learning for the professional nurse in a multicultural society. ACCREDITATION New Mexico State University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. The last comprehensive v isit for the Las Cruces and Grants campuses was in 2016 -17 resulting in a recommendation of a ten-year review to be conducted in 2027 -2028. The baccalaureate degree program in nursing, master's degree program in nursing, Doctor of Nursing Practice program , and post -graduate APRN certificate program at New Mexico State University is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, 655 K Street NW, Suite 750, Washington, DC 20001, 202-887-6791. The NMSU School of Nursing's BSN degree program is approved by the New Mexico Board of Nursing. Approval by the New Mexico Board of Nursing is required for graduates to be eligible for the National Council Licensing Examination for licensure as a registere d nurse (NCLEX -RN\u00ae). 3 SCHOOL OF NURSING COMMITMENTS 1.

(Approved 12/2015) 4 BSN DEGREE PROGRAM OVERVIEW The Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree is a 4 -year, 124 -125 credit hour program that prepares graduates to become registered nurses. Successful graduates of the BSN program are eligible to take the National Council of State Boards of Nursing Exam (NCLEX -RN) for licensure as a registered nurse (RN). The NMSU School of Nursing is a full member of the New Mexico Nursing Education Consortium (NMNEC) and has implemented the NMNEC common statewide curriculum within the BSN degree plan. The School of Nursing has partnered with NMSU -Grants and NMSU -Alamogordo , to offer the BSN degree at both campuses. BSN students in Grants and Alamogordo receive classroom instruction via videoconferencing and clinical experiences at local healthcare facilities with NMSU School of Nursing instructors. The NMSU -Grants and Alamogordo BSN programs only accepts the fall semester cohort. TRADITIONAL BSN OPTION This is the traditional path for incoming Freshmen or students without a prior Bachelor's degree. Traditional BSN students coming in as a Freshman can expect to complete at least three semesters of pre -requisite course work prior to starting the five (5) s emester nursing program. Students are designated as 'pre -nursing' until they are admitted to the BSN program. These students complete all of the required nursing pre -requisite and general education courses, applying to the 5 -semester BSN program when they are in the last semester of pre-requisite courses. 2ND DEGREE BSN OPTIONS The School of Nursing offers two options that provide an alternative entry into the BSN program for students who have a minimum of a Bachelor's degree in a field other than nursi ng. The pre -requisites for the second -degree options are different than those required for the traditional BSN path, because students have earned a prior degree. The Road Runner option is a fast -track program that starts in the summer semester and is compl eted in five consecutive semesters (including summer in the second year). The Pathways option is a traditional progression track that starts in the Fall or Spring semester and does not include summer enrollment. 5 BSN EXPECTED PROGRAM OUTCOMES The NMSU School of Nursing follows the New Mexico Nursing Education Consortium (NMNEC) curriculum for the BSN degree. The following program objectives were adopted with the NMNEC curriculum as the NMSU BSN expected program outcomes. The learner will: 1. Engage in professional nursing practice that is patient -centered and culturally appropriate for individuals, families, and communities. 2.

Admission to the BSN program is a competitive process and is based on ranked admission scores. Please be aware that the pre -requisite GPA and HESI A2 scores of accepted students are generally higher than the required minimums. The NMSU BSN Program Admission Score* is calculated as follows: Nursing Program Pre-requisite Course GPA 40% HESI A2 Admission Assessment Score 50% New Mexico residents, military students, 135 Mile Out -of-State Tuition Discount Texas resident 2% Four (4) or more pre -requisite course taken at NMSU 3% Admission Essay Score 5% *BSN program admission score calculations are subject to change. 10 Additional HESI Admission Assessment (A2) Exam Policies: When you are registered in your last semester of pre -requisite courses, contact the School of Nursing Advising Office at nursing@nmsu.edu to confirm your eligibility to apply, and to request a BSN program application and instructions for taking the HESI A2 exam. A maximum of 4 attempts is allowed (2 per application cycle). Exam scores are valid for ONE year. The HESI A2 exam should be taken at least 1 month before the application deadline. BSN PROGRAM ADMISSION POLICIES 1. Candidates selected for admission will be required to notify the SON of their intent to intend the BSN program by the deadline in the admission letter. 2. BSN students are required to attend a 1-day program orientation prior to the start of their first semester in the BSN program. 3. BSN students are required to meet all of the SON's clinical clearance requirements (including criminal background check and toxicology screen) prior to enrolling their Level 1 course. See admission letter for more details. Students who do not meet these re quirements will not be allowed enroll in that semester's courses, which will affect progression or may result in program dismissal. 4. The SON cannot defer admission to a subsequent semester. Applicants who decline admission for any reason are required to re -apply during the next application cycle. Exceptions to this policy may be made for illness or military commitments. 11 TRANSFER POLICIES The NMSU SON is willing to consider the transfer of students who have already started a BSN curriculum at another school. Transfer student must meet all of the admission requirements for the BSN program. The transferring student is required to submit an application with supporting documents (see below) to the SON Ac ademic Advisor to begin the evaluation process. A review of the submitted material by the advisor and the Associate Director for the Undergraduate Program will be conducted for the purpose of determining placement in the program. It is the intent of the program that a student with previous baccalaureate nursing program course work (including clinical experiences) be placed in the program at a level as near as possible to the level of the previous experience. NMSU requirements for the granting of the Bachelor of Science degree will apply in all cases. Supporting Documents The supporting documents will include, but not be limited to, official transcripts of all pre - nursing, nursing and other Bachelor's degree course work, nursing syllabi, standardi zed written examination scores, skills performance checklists, and any other documents that the BSN program administrators request. Standardized nursing content exams (i.e., HESI progression exams) may be used to verify content mastery. In addition, a stud ent transferring from another nursing program is required to provide a letter from the program director at the previous school indicating that the student is in good academic standing and is eligible to return to that program. Admission Criteria for Transfer Students 1. Successfully complete all NMSU nursing pre -requisite courses with a grade of 'C -' or better before the beginning of the semester admitted to the nursing program. 2. Have a minimum of a C- grade in all previous BSN courses. 3. Have a minimum of a 2.75 grade point average in the previous BSN program. 4. Earn a score of 75% or greater in all required categories on the following entrance exam: HESI Admission Assessment (A2). Other entrance exams such as the ATI TEAS or Kaplan are not accepted. 12 Admission Decisions The Associate Director for the Undergraduate Program, with input from the Admission and Progression sub -committee, will decide whether or not to admit the transfer student and recommend as to the placement in the NMSU BSN program (i.e., courses transferred or waived, courses that need to be repeated, and the recommended Level for transfer). This applies to didactic and clinical courses. Students who have received a \"D\" or \"F\" grade in one nursing course another nursing programs may be considered for transfer. This grade will count as the student's first failure in the BSN program. Students who have received a \"D\" or \"F\" grade in two or more nursing courses at other nursing programs are not eligible for immediate transfer. Refer to the NMNEC reapplication policy for additional information. 13 ACADEMIC POLICIES ADVISING Pre-Nursing Students Pre-nursing advising for NMSU Las Cruces campus students is conducted by the NMSU Center for Academic Advising and Student Success (Garcia Center, advising@nmsu.edu , 575-646-2941). Pre-nursing advi sing for NMSU Alamogordo campus students is conducted by the NMSU -A Academic Advising Office (advisingNMSUA@nmsu.edu , 575-439-3600) in consulta tion with the NMSU SON Advising Center. Pre-nursing advising for NMSU Grants campus students is conducted by the NMSU - Grants Academic Advising Office in consultation with the NMSU SON Advising Center. Note : The Lead BSN advisor from the NMSU Main Campus in Las Cruces visits the NMSU -Alamogordo and NMSU -Grants campuses for at least two days a semester to hold individual pre-nursing advising appointments with students on those campuses. Pre-nursing students should contact their advisor for information related to degree planning, course advisement and transfer of credit from other institutions. During the application process, pre -nursing students must contact the SON Advising Center (575-646-3812) to confirm their eligibility to apply to the BSN program, as well as to obtain HESI A2 Entrance Exam information and the BSN program application. BSN Students During the application process and once a student has been admitted, BSN students obtain academic advising through the SON Advising Center (575-646-3812). REGISTRATION The University offers registration online and students are encouraged to register themselves. Assistance with registration is available from the pre -nursing advisors (pre - nursing students) or School of Nursing advisors (BSN students). 14 GRADING POLICIES AND GRADE REQUIREMENTS Evaluation is a critical, continuous process that is an integral component of the School of Nursing and the BSN Program. The faculty perceives the process as a \"two way street\" by which students are afforded input on their progress by the faculty and the students, in turn, offer input relative to the school and program. Course exams, graded assignments, and clinical evaluations are mechanisms to provide feedback to students abo ut their progress in the curriculum. Students can seek feedback by contacting their respective faculty about their course work. The faculty solicits students' constructive suggestions and recommendations for improvement and development. A variety of mechanisms exists to facilitate the evaluation process; for example, during the last week of each nursing course, students are asked to evaluate the course and the professor's clinical and classroom performance via Canvas. SON Graduate Programs Grading Scale The Grading Scale used by NMNEC and the NMSU BSN program is as follows: A = 92 - 100 B = 84 - 91 C = 77 - 83 D = 67 - 76 (failing) F = below 67 (failing) Students must earn a grade of \"C\" or higher in all BSN courses. Students must achieve a written exam average of 77% in order to pass didactic (i.e., non -clinical) courses in the BSN program , independent of scores earned in other areas of the grading rubric. Computation of grades will be outlined in each course syllabus with specific information about how course grades are calculated. There will be no extra credit assignments to improve any grade and the practice of \"curving\" is not used for determining grades in nursing courses. Final course grades are the only grades that are rounded to the nearest 0.1 (e.g. 76.5 is rounded to 77 or 76.4 to 76.) The School of Nursing does not assign + or - to the final letter grades entered into the Banner system. 15 Incomplete Grades The letter grade of I (Incomplete) is assigned for passable work that could not be completed due to circumstances beyond the student's control that develop after the last day to withdraw from the course. In no case is an I grade to be used to avoid the assigning of D, F, or U grades for failing work. The School of Nursing follows the NMSU policy for Incomplete \"I\" grades . When making up an I grade, work submitted for grades in the course cannot be resubmitted. \"I\" grades must to be completed before the student may progress in the DNP or certificate program. ACADEMIC PROGRESSION Progression of a student within the BSN Program is base d on the following policies: 1. The BSN student must remain \"in good standing\" academically with NMSU, maintaining a cumulative grade point average (GPA) in accordance with scholastic standing policies outlined in the current NMSU Undergraduate Catalog. Any nursing student who is placed on academic probation by NMSU must petition the BSN Program Committee for permission to continue to enroll in nursing courses while improving the GPA. 2. All nursing courses and the required nursing elective course in the BS N degree plan must be taken for a grade. Other non -nursing courses may be taken S/U following NMSU policies. 3. Students must achieve an exam average of at least 77% in order to pass non - clinical courses in the BSN program , independent of scores earned in o ther areas of the grading rubric. 4. Students must earn a grade of \"C\" or higher in required course work leading to the BSN degree (this includes General Education courses). 5. BSN students must complete all courses and standardized exams in a given level prior to progressing to the next level. 16 STANDARDIZED TESTING Students are required to take nationally standardized tests and to achieve a satisfactory score on these tests. Course syllabi will provide details about how the exam is graded or scored. PRECLINICAL DOSAGE CALCULATION REQUIREMENTS Prior to participating in clinical experiences in Levels 2 through 5, all BSN students are required to pass a common dosage calculations exam with a minimum score of 92%. See Appendix C or the BSN Virtual Advising Canvas course for more details. Students are allowed two (2) attempts at the exam, which is scheduled during the first week of classes. More information and examples of dosage calculation questions are posted on the S chool of Nursing Home Page under 'Degree Plans.' Choose 'Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) Degree Program' from the drop -down menu, and scroll to the bottom of the page. The link will be in the lower right -hand corner of the page. The Dosage Calculation exam information is sent out prior to every semester and is available in the BSN Virtual Advising Canvas course. If a student does not take the Dosage Calculation Exam at the assigned time, due to unforeseen and extenuating circumstances, the student may be given the opportunity to make up the exam. Documentation to explain why the absence occurred must be submitted to the Clinical Coordinator before a make -up exam can be scheduled. The missed attem pt may be considered a \"Fail\" if the reason for missing the exam is not considered to be an extenuating circumstance by the Associate Director for the Undergraduate Program. Students who does not pass the Dosage Calculation Exam with a score of at least 92% will have an opportunity to view their exam. A second attempt to pass the exam will be scheduled. Any student who does not pass on the second attempt will remediate with the Clinical Coordinator or a faculty designee. Following remediation, a third att empt will be scheduled. No further dosage exam attempts will be offered if the student is unsuccessful on the third attempt. If a student fails the dosage exam three times, the student will be disenrolled from the clinical courses for that semester. The st udent can request to take the clinical courses the following semester by sending a written request to the Associate Director for the Undergraduate Program. 17 COURSE FAILURE/WITHDRAWAL POLICY Level 1 BSN Courses One course failure/withdrawal - student is dismissed from program. The student must then apply for readmission to the program. Applications for readmission are not automatic and are reviewed by the BSN Admission & Progression Subcommittee. Re -admission is based BSN program admission cr iteria, course offerings and space/seat availability. Two course failures/withdrawals - student is dismissed from program. The student may then reapply to the BSN program after two years, per the NMNEC re - admission policies. Levels 2, 3, 4 and 5: Secon d course failure/withdrawal - student is dismissed from the program and may reapply after two years, per the NMNEC re-admission policies. These policies apply to all nursing courses in NMNEC statewide curriculum degree plans. Course failures and withdrawals accumulate from Level 1 through Level 5 and across all NMNEC programs. DISMISSAL FROM THE BSN PROGRAM Dismissal of a student from the BSN program can occur for various reasons: 1. If a student receives a \"D,\" \"F\" or \"W\" (while failing) in any nursing course, the student may repeat that course one time at NMSU or another institution only if there is space available. Any additional \"D,\" \"F,\" or \"W\" (while failing) in any nursing course will result in the student's dismissal from the program. 2. Student may fail a clinical course or be dismissed from the program due to unsafe clinical practice or privacy violations. (See Guidelines for Determining Unsafe Clinical Practice in Appendix K) The NMSU Undergraduate Catalog also contains policies governing \"Scholastic Probation and Suspension\" and \"Disciplinary Probation and Suspension.\" In addition, the \"Student Code of Conduct\" is published in the NMSU Student Handbook . 18 APPEALS AND GRIEVANCES It is recommended that students who wish to question a decision or awarding of a grade exhaust all informal procedures before enacting the formal appeal process. The informal process begins with discussing the issue/co ncern with the individual faculty member. If a resolution is not found, the student and faculty member can seek guidance from the course Faculty of Record. Unresolved issues at this level may then be brought to the attention of the SON Associate Director for Undergraduate Programs. Students who wish to formally appeal a decision or awarding of a grade by a faculty member are advised to follow the Student Academic Grievance Policy outlined in the NMSU Please contact the Associate Director for the Undergraduate Program for assistance with this process. SEQUENCE OF COURSES The BSN curriculum/degree plan follows a specific sequence of nursing courses. Each of the didactic and clinical nursing courses can accommodate only a certain number of students. Students who are following their assigned degree plan at the semester of admission are assured of a place in that cohort as it progresses through the curriculum. In some circumstances, students may not be able to complete the curriculum plan as designed. In each instance, faculty will try to accommodate student needs. However, students who deviate from the degree plan for the class to which they were o riginally admitted (e.g., due to documented illness or pregnancy) must understand that there may not be a place for them in a specific nursing didactic/clinical course at a later date when they are ready to take it. 19 READMISSION POLICY A stu dent, who exits the BSN program prior to completion for personal reasons or has been previously dismissed for course failures, is NOT guaranteed readmission. A student who wishes to be re -admitted to the BSN program must submit a written letter to the Asso ciate Director for the Undergraduate Program to request readmission to a specific course or courses in an upcoming semester. Readmission to the NMSU BSN program is based on a review of the student's academic record and available space, specifically in clinical courses. The BSN Admission & Progression sub -committee will review the letter and supporting documents, and make recommendations to the Associate Director for the Undergraduate Program. Students who are passing nursing courses at the time of withdrawal or interruption of studies will receive first priority for readmission. Students who are not passing nursing courses at the time of withdrawal or interruption of studies will receive the next priority. All potential readmission students will be considered based on cumulative grade point average (GPA) and space available basis. Students will be notified via NMSU email as soon as possible when an opening in the respective semester occurs. Exce ptions to any of the above items will be considered on an individual basis by the Associate Director for the Undergraduate Program upon written request of the student. POLICIES FOR WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS Papers and projects must be the result of each student's individual work and effort. Individual course requirements are outlined in the course syllabi. Students must use the current edition of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Associatio n (APA) as a guide to scholarly work. Students may be referred to the NMSU Writing Center https://towc.nmsu.edu/ for assistance with written assignments. ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT AND PLAGIARISM Students are responsib le for adhering to the policies and procedures related to academic integrity found in NMSU Catalog and NMSU Student Handbook. For further information you may refer to the NMSU Student Handbook, specifically the Student Academic Code of Conduct -Academic Integrity (Policy 5.10) . The School of Nursing follows the university's Procedures to Respond to Allegations of Student Academic Misconduct (Policy 5.11) , including guidelines for sanctions. 20 Cheating Cheating is obtaining something by dishonest or deceitful means. Examples of cheating include copying work from another student, working with another student(s) on an individual assignment and submitting it as individual work, copying from another during individual testing, using electronic devices to obtain information during testing, etc. It is the student's responsibility to authenticate any assignment submitted to a n instructor. If asked, students must be able to produce proof that the assignment submitted is actually the student's own work. Therefore, it is recommended that students keep copies of all drafts of their work, make photocopies of research materials, kee p logs or journals of work on assignments and papers, etc. (http://studenthandbook.nmsu.edu/student - code -of-conduct/academic -misconduct/ ) Plagiarism Plagiarism is the deliberate act of taking the writings and/or ideas of another and representing them as one's own. The direct lifting of a passage or ideas from ano ther book or periodical and including it in a paper as if it were the student's own work without using quotation marks and without proper referencing is the most blatant form of plagiarism. Paraphrasing can be another form of plagiarizing. Essentially, par aphrasing involves taking a passage from another book or periodical and changing some of the words, altering the phrasing but not the meaning. Any time material is paraphrased, it should be indicated with a citation and reference identifying the source. To be absolutely safe, all the outside reading done in preparation for writing a paper should be properly referenced. (http://studenthandbook.nmsu.edu/student -code-of-conduct/academic -misconduct/ ) Disciplinary Action Assignments and other types of submitted student work that contain plagiarism are not acceptable as scholastic work and may, at the very least, result in a zero for submitted work. The SON follows the university's definitions and policies in the NMSU Student Code of Conduct . All incidences of plagiarism and other forms of academic misconduct ( e.g., cheating, misrepresentation, etc.) identified by faculty or administrators will be reported to the NMSU Academic Conduct Officer who will provide guidance on consequences and sanctions. 21 GRADUATION Students who successfully complete the ir plan of study/degree and MSN project are eligible for graduation. Students apply for graduation through their myNMSU account during the graduation application period . Failure to apply for graduation by the University Registrar's deadline will result in delays in degree posting. In some cases, the student may not graduate until the following semester, which can affect their ability to become employed. All students should perform a STAR Audit through their myNMSU student account at the end of the fourth nursing semester to confirm their progress in meeting requirements for the nursing degree. Students are encouraged to consult with the SON advisors about academic concerns or questions related to the nursing degree. The SON advisors should also be informed of any changes in students' plans for program completion. INDEPENDENT STUDY COURSES On rare occasion, it may be necessary and/or appropriate for a student to seek nursing credits via independent study. If the need is identified, a written proposal will be developed by the student and the faculty member and submitted to the Associate Direc tor for Undergraduate Programs for initial approval. If initial approval is granted, the faculty member and student will develop and submit a detailed plan for individualized study. The submission is processed as follows: 1. A Special Studies Permit form for an independent study course must be signed by the BSN faculty member who is the 'Faculty of Record' for the course. 2. A copy of the college's Independent Study/Readings Agreement completed in its entirety, including the specification of requirements and evaluation standards, must accompany #1 above, and both must be signed by the School of Nursing Director prior to taking the forms to the CHSS Associate Dean for Academic Affairs for course registra tion. 22 CLINICAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES CLINICAL CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS Clinical clearance requirements must be approved by the BSN program before any student can participate in clinical activities. Clearances must be renewed annually to meet clinical agency and School of Nursing requirements. The deadlines for submitting clinical clearance documents are: December 15 for Spring Semester, May 15 for Summer Semester, and July 15 for Fall semester . If the clearance documents are not submitted b y the deadline, the student will not be allowed to register for the clinical courses that semester. The student may enroll in non-clinical courses, but cannot progress in the program until the clinical courses are completed. The student may request return for the clinical courses by submitting a petition to the BSN Admission & Progression sub -committee. Continuation in the program is dependent on a space available basis in the clinical course(s). Background and Fingerprint Checks Criminal background and fingerprint checks are required for all nursing students annually by the New Mexico Department of Health and the Texas State Board of Nursing. These requirements are subject to change as federal, state and agency regulations change . Students are responsible for these costs. Some agencies may not allow students with felony convictions to participate in clinical experiences at their sites. The SON administration will review these situations individually to consider alternate clinical placements. All costs of background and fingerprint checks are assumed by the student. Required Screening for Disease and Immunizations It is essential that nurses and student nurses do everything possible to prevent spreading communicable diseases to patients and the community. For this reason, the School of Nursing and the local health care agencies have established guidelines for immunizations for student nurses, faculty, and other health care workers. Immunizations can be ob tained from a primary care provider or through the Aggie Health & Wellness Center for full - or part -time students at NMSU. All costs of immunizations are assumed by the student. 23 Drug Screening Students participating in clinical experience s at healthcare agencies are required to have a 10-Panel drug screening test annually. The School of Nursing is automatically sent a copy of student results; students do not need to hand -deliver or email results to the SON office. All costs for drug screen ing are assumed by the student. The NMSU School of Nursing and affiliated clinical agencies reserve the right to require random drug screening at any time during a students' time in the undergraduate nursing program. Students will not be permitted to attend clinical experiences until results are received and reviewed. If there is a student -caused delay in testing, the clinical time missed by the student will be considered \"unexcused\". (Refer to consequences of \"unexcus ed absences\".) In the event of a \"positive\" test, the student may appeal the findings as outlined by the procedures for the drug testing company or specific health care agency. A student with a substantiated \"positive\" drug test will be referred to the As sociate Director for Undergraduate Programs. A \"failed\" drug test may prevent the student from completing the academic requirements for the clinical course and may result in program dismissal. Health Insurance Students enrolled in the NMSU School of Nursing BSN program are required to obtain a personal health insurance policy. Acceptable health insurance policies are those issued by government authorities (i.e. US military coverage, Medicaid), private insurance obtained as a dependent carried on policies of parents or spouses, or individual policies obtained personally by the student. Information related to health insurance policies available to NMSU students can be found at the Student Health Center website, http://chc.nmsu.edu/ . 24 Summary of Clinical Clearance Policies and Procedures Clinical agencies require that each of the identified clinical clearances be valid through the END of each academic semester (April 30 for Spring Semester, July 31 for Summer Semester, or November 30 for fall semester). Student and faculty clinical clearances are due on the 15th of the mon th PRIOR to each semester beginning (December 15, May 15, or July 15 respectively). This ensures that they are ready to be sent to the clinical agencies at the beginning of each semester (most agencies require 2 weeks to clear students and faculty). The following table is a summary of the BSN program clinical clearance requirements with accepted outcomes and outcomes that may disqualify a student from participating in clinical experiences. Any student who fails to meet the clinical clearance requireme nts will not be registered for the clinical course. In the case of major offenses discovered on the background check and/or a positive drug screen, a student may be dismissed from the BSN program. The School of Nursing uses CastleBranch to process studen t clinical clearance information. Students are responsible for uploading personal documentation to their CastleBranch account by the deadlines stated. Clearance for participation in the program's clinical activities will not be granted until all requiremen ts are complete. Students may be disenrolled from clinical course if unable to complete the clinical clearance requirements. REQUIREMENT ACCEPTED NOT ACCEPTED Background check Clear or minor offenses (e.g., traffic tickets). Students and faculty are screened through the NM DOH Criminal Caregivers program. Major offenses against people (e.g., child abuse, drug trafficking). Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) American Heart Association (AHA) approved Basic Life Support (BLS) for health care providers. American Red Cross (ARC) or other online only certifications. Drug Testing 10 panel test on urine through www.CastleBranch.com . Students are screened at the beginning of the program and annually. A screen with fewer than 10 substances. Positive results (without a validated medical reason). Health Insurance NMSU or private insurance. Students provide proof at the beginning of the program. No insurance. 25 Hepatitis B 3 vaccines (usually the 2nd is given 1 month later and the 3rd is given 4-6 months later) of any of these brand names: Energix B, Recombivax HB, or Twinrix AND a positive titer of antibodies in the blood. Students can begin with 1 or 2 vaccines and then complete the series later. Havarix A vaccine (this is for Hepatitis A). Negative or Equivocal titer requires revaccination of the series but not an additional titer. The student has presumptive immunity after the second series per CDC guidelines. Influenza (flu) Flu immunization (injected or intranasal) every winter (September through March). Pneumonia vaccine (this is for a different organism). The injectable form can be given to pregnant women, but not the intranasal form. If the immunization is declined, then many agencies require personnel to wear a mask. Measles (Rubeola) 2 doses of the MMR vaccine that are at least 28 days apart (if born before 1957, then 1 dose) AND a positive titer to each virus. Note: Titers to all 3 are required. Negative or Equivocal titer to any virus requires revaccination of the series but not an additional titer. The student has presumptive immunity after the second series per CDC guidelines. Note: Rubella vaccine should NOT be given to pregnan t women (a provider note is needed). Mumps Rubella (German measles) Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis (TDaP) A vaccine (or booster) within the last 10 years containing Pertussis. Tetanus and Diphtheria only (continued on next page) 26 Tuberculosis (TB) A 2-step TB Skin Test (TST, PPD, Mantoux) is required every 12 months that is negative (less than 15 millimeters of induration). The 2 - step process is one skin test and reading followed by a second skin test and reading 7 -21 days after the first test; OR a negative blood test (T -Spot TB test or QuantiFERON\u00ae -TB Gold ); OR if person ever had a positive skin test result, then one negative chest x-ray AND a yearly negative screening of TB symptoms. Positive skin test Note: people who had the BCG vaccine can have TB tests. Positive chest x -ray or symptom report. Positive blood test Varicella (Chicken pox) Adults: 2 vaccines that are at least 28 days apart; OR 1 vaccine given before 13 years of age; AND a positive titer Reports from providers or from individuals that they have had the disease. Negative or Equivocal titer requires revaccination of the series but not an additional titer. The student has presumptive immunity after the second series per CDC gu idelines. Varicella vaccine should NOT be given to pregnant women (a provider note is needed). Clinical Agency Orientations Students need to complete orientations and pass quizzes for both Las Cruces hospitals (MMC and MVRMC) and the El Paso city - wide orientation (epcc.edu) annually. Additional orientations may be required for other agencies. No documentation of orientation completion. Clinical clearance requirements at specific clinical agencies may change during the academic year and student s will be advised on what needs to be done to meet any new guidelines. 27 LIABILITY INSURANCE The Risk Management Division of the State of New Mexico provides students with comprehensive liability insurance while performing duties in their stud ent nurse role. Duties are defined as skills and tasks outlined in the NMNEC curriculum and authorized by the SON and University. There is no liability coverage when performing unauthorized duties or duties in a non-student role. UNUSUAL OCCURRENCES Accountability for medication errors and unusual occurrences (i.e. needle sticks, medication errors, accidents, etc.) must be recorded for protection of all parties involved (i.e. student, faculty, patient, staff, etc.). The Unusual Occurrence form is to b e completed by the student, as soon as possible after the event, and passed on to the clinical instructor who signs, adds any additional information, and submits it to the Associate Director for the Undergraduate Program for final signatures. All forms can be found on the BSN Virtual Advising Canvas course. Additional documentation may be required by clinical facilities. PATIENT/CLIENT PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY It is the responsibility of every student nurse to safeguard patient, resident, or client ri ghts to confidentiality in all aspects of care. The patient, resident, or client determines the degree of self-disclosure and to whom. One's nursing practice must honor the element of trust given by patients and clients as they share potentially vulnerable aspects of their lives. All those in healthcare must now comply with the federal regulations of The Administration Simplification Subtitle of the Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). This Act requires that individually ident ifiable patient information be disclosed on a need to know basis only. Care must be taken to minimize incidental disclosures & must disclose only minimal amounts of information necessary to accomplish the task. The minimum disclosure standard, however, doe s not apply to requests for information by a healthcare provider for treatment purposes. For example, if one must administer a medication, you will have full access to the medical record. This is covered by the patient's consent for treatment. 28 HIPAA is a Federal law. Penalties for wrongful disclosure can result in fines &/or imprisonment. Students will be required to sign a document that states that they have read and understand the HIPAA Regulations as it applies to patient/clien t privacy issues. Students should consult with their clinical instructor about any questions or concerns regarding patient/client privacy What does this mean for the nursing student? In order to protect patient/client privacy, all personally identifying i nformation must be removed from student papers prior to the student leaving the facility (e.g., care plans & report sheets). Information to be removed includes, the individual's name, initials, address, phone number, fax number & social security number. St udents may not remove or duplicate any personal or healthcare records from any clinical agency (i.e. photocopies, screen shots, etc.). Students should not take photos, audio - or video -record any activity in clinical settings. Written documents containing p rivate health information must be either carefully stored or shredded to prevent the circulation of confidential patient information. Confidentiality & privacy also extends to oral communications which extend beyond the need to know for treatment &/or educ ational purposes. Elements of patient, resident, or client information can be discussed only within the realm of the appropriate clinical/educational settings (i.e. planning conferences, post clinical conferences, classroom seminar). It is a serious breach of confidentiality to discuss information outside of these areas with family, friends, and on social media sites. Clinical agencies may require students to sign a confidentiality statement p rior to participating in agency activities. A student nurse who breaches privacy or confidentiality is subject to disciplinary action, which could include clinical probation or dismissal from the program . 29 UNSAFE BEHAVIOR OR PRIVACY VIOLATIONS IN THE CLINICAL SETTING A report or observation of unsafe behavior or Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act (HIPAA) violation in the clinical setting may be grounds for immediate removal from clinical activ ities. An inquiry into the reported incident will be conducted by the relevant clinical faculty with information shared with the Faculty of Record in the course (i.e., the course lead) and the Associate Director for the Undergraduate Programs. The clinical agency may also require incident reporting to the clinical agency. The outcome of the inquiry could result in clearance of the concern or disciplinary action, which could include a memo of concern, clinical probation, immediate failure of the clinical course or dismissal from the program. depending on the severity of the incident. Guidelines for Determining Unsafe Clinical Practice Unsafe clinical behavior includes, but is not limited to, the following: 1. Violates or threatens the physical safety of the patient. e.g., neglects use of side rails, restraints; comes unprepared to clinical. 2. Violates or threatens the psychological safety of the patient. e.g., uses nontherapeutic techniques repeatedly in interactions; attacks/derogates individual's beliefs or values. 3. Violates or threatens the microbiological safety of the patient. e.g., unrecognized violation of aseptic technique; failure to perform sterile preps or dressings appropriately. 4. Violates or threatens the chemical safety of the patient. e.g., violates the \"6 Rights in Administering Medications\"; fails to monitor IV infusions safely (count drops, know micro -macro drip ratio). 5. Violates or threatens the thermal safety of the patient. e.g., burns patient with hot packs, heating lamp; fails to observe safety precautions. 6. Violates or threatens the environmental safety of the patient. e.g., fails to leave patient's room in order; fails to remove harmful objects from room when appropria te (including personal medications.) 7. Inadequately and/or inaccurately utilizes the nursing process. e.g., fails to observe and/or report critical data relating to patients/clients/families; makes repeated faulty judgments/decisions in nursing situations. 8. Violates previously mastered principles/learning/objectives in carrying out nursing care skills and/or delegated medical functions. e.g., fails to seek guidance or instructions in the performance of unfamiliar procedures. 9. Assumes inappropriate independence in action or decisions. e.g., performs competencies not tested; fails to seek help in emergency situations. 30 10. Fails to recognize own limitations, incompetence, and/or legal responsibilities. e.g., refuses to admit errors noted by instructor/nursing staff; cannot identify own legal responsibility in specific nursing situation; becomes defensive when corrected. 11. Fails to accept legal responsibility for his/her own actions. e.g., covers own/other's errors or fails to report them 12. Fails to interact effectively with health team. e.g., attitude adversely affects the patient; fails to recall/share necessary information with team; personality conflicts interfere with the efficient functioning of the unit/team. UNIFORMS It is the student's responsibility to be in proper uniform for every clinical experience unless otherwise instructed by clinical faculty. Students not adhering to the uniform policy will not be permitted in the clinical area a nd may be asked to leave facility, resulting in an unexcused absence. When visiting a clinical agency at times other than assigned clinical hours (i.e. to pick up facility ID Badge from Human Resources), students may be required to wear full uniform or dr ess in appropriate business attire with Student Name Tag. Jeans, shorts, mini - skirts, sleeveless tops, bare legs, and open toed shoes are inappropriate attire for the clinical setting. Students may be denied access to clinical experiences if not dressed appropriately. Appropriate uniform attire is a requirement for participation in regularly scheduled education experiences held in the Nursing Skills Lab or during simulation experiences. Faculty may determine exceptions to the uniform policy as necessary . The NMSU Student Nurse uniform consists of the following and may be purchased from a store/online site of the student's preference: 1. Top: The scrub top may be any of these: Cherokee (wine color #65 in styles # 4727 or #4728 Women's, and # 4876 Men's) or Grey's (wine color in styles #0103 -65 or #41101 -65). 2. If a shirt (optional) is worn under the uniform top, it must be a solid color in white, grey, burgundy/wine or black, round -collared, and short -or long sleev ed. No graphics should be visible. 31 3. Pants : The scrub pants may be any of these: Cherokee (pewter color in styles #4020, #4100, or #4200) or Grey's Anatomy (steel grey color in styles #0203 -905 or #4245 -905). 4. Socks : All black crew socks or black hose that cover legs above the ankles so that skin is not showing when moving around. 5. Shoes : All black, including the soles, non -permeable, fluid -resistant shoes with closed toes and heels. Fabric shoes treated with water -resistant products are unacceptable. Mesh -covered shoes that allow for fluids to seep through are also not acceptable. (Can we add pictures) 6. Name Tags : School of Nursing name tags will be distributed to all new students early in the semester and must be wo rn in all clinical settings. Students who lose a name tag or have a legal name change will need to obtain a replacement tag. Students should contact the SON office first for instructions. Name Tags are obtained from Cruces Trophy & Awards Center (575 -522-0426) and may require verification of program enrollment from the SON office. Students may need to cover the cost of the replacement Name Tag. 7. The maroon student Name Tag will have the following engraved in white lettering: (Student's Legal Name) BSN Student Nurse 8. Lab Coat (optional): A white lab coat that has a collar, mid -length (to cover the top), and short or long sleeves is acceptable. No other jacket or sweaters (even those with SON logos) are considered part of the SON uniform and are not permitted during clinical/patient care activities. It is recommended that students have two sets of uniforms, as clinical experiences may be scheduled two days in a row. Students with questions about the uniform requirements should contact their clinical instructor. 32 Accessory items required for clinical experiences (including Skills & Simulation lab): Wristwatch (one with a second hand) that can be fixed securely on the wrist Bandage scissors Pocket -size notebook Black pen Permanent black marker Stethoscope (Provided by the SON at Level 1 student orientation) PERSONAL APPEARANCE Personal appearance is of significant importance in healthcare. The following are requirements for all nursing students: 1. Hair must be clean and worn in a manner that prevents it from falling forward during preparation and performance of client care. 2. Fingernails are to be short and clean. No fingernail polish (including clear top coats) is to be worn in clinical settings. Acrylic, sculptured, or \"fake -type\" nails or nail tips are not allowed in clinical settings. 3. Jewelry is limited to one ring, a watc h, and stud earrings in the lobes only (not the cartilage). No facial or tongue jewelry is permitted. Tattoos are to be covered while wearing the student uniform and during clinical activities. 4. Uniforms, including shoes, must be neat, clean, and in good r epair. Pants should not drag on the floor. 5. Beards must be neat and trimmed. 7. Scented lotions, cologne & perfume are not permitted in clinical settings since patients, family members, staff and other students may have allergies or sensitivities. 8. Gum chewing is not permitted in any clinical setting. Questions regarding specific variances related to agencies and clinical settings should be referred to the individual clinical instructor. Also, clinical facilities may have additional policies regardin g dress, piercings, tattooing, and jewelry that must be followed when at those facilities. 33 When wearing the school uniform, students should follow all dress code requirements (hair, shoes, jewelry etc.) including after clinical hours are finished. If it is necessary for a student to change hairstyle, shoes, jewelry etc. when clinical hours are completed for the day, the student should also change out of the uniform. CLINICAL AGENCY IDENTIFICATION BADGES Some clinical agencies require facility identification badges. Clinical faculty will provide specific instructions on when and how to obtain the badge. Students are expected to wear the SON name tag and the facility identificat ion badge (if applicable) during clinical hours. Failure to return identification badges to the agency at the end of the clinical experience may result in a delay of posting final course grade. Clinical facilities reserve the right to impose requirements related to lost or unreturned identification badges. These requirements may involve the student covering the cost of the lost/misplaced badge. CLINICAL GROUP ASSIGNMENTS Clinical group assignments and rotation schedules are approved by the Faculty of Record for the clinical course and/or the Associate Director for Undergraduate Programs. Clinical group assignments may be changed to accommodate students, faculty, and agencies. Students are not to make schedule changes or clinical group changes themselve s. Any requests for changes should be addressed with the course faculty or the Associate Director for Undergraduate Programs. Changes to clinical groups or sites after clinical clearances have been submitted to a facility or after the clinical rotation has already started will be considered on an individual basis and must be approved by the Associate Director for Undergraduate Programs. TRANSPORTATION Clinical sites, days, and times may vary within a clinical rotation and between different clinical cou rses. Clinical sites may not be in the same location as the School of Nursing. Students must provide their own transportation to and from clinical sites. Students may not transport patients, residents, clients, or faculty to or from clinical sites. 34 CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION Students are to sign their clinical documentation as follows: Student's Name followed by BSN Student Nurse (i.e. Jane Doe, BSN Student Nurse). Abbreviations for student nurse are not to be used (i.e. SN or NS for nursing student). CLINICAL/LABORATORY ATTENDANCE AND PREPARATION Laboratory and clinical experiences are vital components of the educational process in the BSN program. Every scheduled laboratory and clinical day is necessary to achieve course objectives and assure the student of adequate clinical preparation and experience. \"Clinical\" refers to the laboratory sessions (including simulation) and to assigned experiences at clinical agencies (i.e. hospitals, clinics, wellness centers, schoo ls, home health agencies, support groups, etc.). Students are expected to be prepared and on time to all laboratory sessions and clinical experiences. If the student is not prepared or arrives too late to engage in clinical activities, the student may be dismissed from the clinical/laboratory experience, and receive an unexcused absence for that day. Students must satisfactorily complete all course requirements as determined by the course instructor. The student will receive a letter grade for the clinica l course based on overall clinical performance and graded assignments. Additional information on clinical experiences will be specified in individual course syllabi. Clinical Absence Policy A clinical absence pertains to all scheduled clinical experiences (i.e. on -campus laboratory and skills sessions, simulation experiences, off -campus clinical experiences and scheduled clinical conferences). Students are expected to be at all scheduled clinical experiences. It is the student's responsibility to be prepared and dressed appropriately with all necessary equipment and to arrive at the correct time and place. It is the student's responsibility to notify course faculty, prior to the start of the c linical experience, if they are going to be absent/tardy from clinical experiences. 35 Definitions of Excused and Unexcused Absences : 1. A clinical absence is defined as \"excused\" when the student personally notifies the instructor prior to the absence (notification method is at the discretion of the faculty). Examples of excused clinical absences include, but are not limited to : personal illness, family death, unexpected life emergencies. The determination of what constitutes an excused absence is at the discretion of the assigned clinical faculty member. 2. An unexcused clinical absence is defined as a) a student being absent without prior notification to the instructor facilitating that clinical experience, b) a student who is sent home for being unprepared or violating any policies for participating in clinical experiences, c) tardiness or late arrival that may result in an excused or unexcused absence at the discretion of the clinical instructor. Consequences of Absences : 1. Excused Absences: Prior notification to clinical faculty is useful for avoiding an unexcused or late penalty. However, even excused absences may impact a student's grade for that course. Multiple absences may make it impossible for the studen t to meet the clinical course requirements and may result in course failure. 2. Unexcused Absences: One unexcused absence results in a 10% reduction of the course grade. More than one unexcused absence results in an \"F\" for the final course grade. 3. Tardiness : Tardy is defined as more than 5 minutes late to class without notification made to the instructor. One (1) incident of tardiness will result in a warning; subsequent incidents may result in an unexcused absence. Patterns of lateness or habitual tardiness will be documented on clinical evaluations as unprofessional behavior. Clinical Make -ups: 1. Clinical experiences are a requisite part of nursing education. Therefore, all clinical absences, whether excused or unexcused, must be made up. Clinical make -up opportunities are generally made available at the end of the semester and may involve an additional day in the clinical setting or time spent in the lab doing skills and/or simulation. Open Lab may be available for missed laboratory experiences. Please be aware that there is no guarantee that absences > 1 clinical day can be made up. 36 2. Clinical or lab experiences not made up will be counted as an unexcused absence. 3. Clinical faculty may set a timeframe for the make up experiences to occur. Students who do not make up the clinical or lab experience within this timeframe will not be able to return to the clinical or lab experience, which may result in course failure. Clinical Absences related to Illness/injury : 1. Faculty shall review possible alternatives when a student is absent from the clinical setting due to illness or injury. These include, but are not limited, to the following: a) Clinical objectives b) Student's progress to date c) Anticipated date of return d) Written physician release when applicable e) Comply with the standards of the clinical agency f) Withdraw from the program when the student misses more than 15% of clinical contact hours g) Request for continuation when illness, injury, or personal problem is resolved h) In the case of pregnancy, the student is responsible for clearance from their obstetrician to be in the clinical areas. 2. Should a student with an injury or illness not be able to fulfill the scheduled clinical activities at the assigned agency, the clinical activities may be accomplished per the clinical instructor's discretion though alternate methods. The clinical instructor, in conjunction with the Faculty of Record and the Associate Director for the Undergraduate Program will determine options based on the individual situation. Options may include: a) rearrangement of clinical schedule b) use of virtual clinical training experiences (cost to be assumed by student) c) alternate assignment that meets the clinical objectives Specific abilities are required for certain tasks in order to protect the students and the patients from injury or illness. See \"Essential Eligibility Requirements for Participation in the School of Nursing.\" 37 COVID -19 SAFETY PROTOCOLS The following section provides guidance for safely completing clinical training in the School of Nursing Skills & Simulation Center and in clinical facilities. These guidelines coupled with our strict use of facial coverings, personal p rotective equipment (PPE) and limited close contact is our strategy to mitigate the spread of COVID -19. The School of Nursing is aware that faculty are not able to monitor students' behavior outside of the classroom. We strongly urge all nursing students t o keep their fellow classmates, faculty/staff and patients in mind when making decisions that may in fact place them at risk for COVID -19. Students not adhering to these or other university guidelines will be subject to disciplinary measures as outlined in the NMSU Student Handbook Code of Conduct . Check in Procedures Nursing Skills & Simulation Center Students will be asked to report to their assigned lab or classroom of the Health & Social Services (HSS) building on their scheduled dates and times. Students entering the building must wear a cloth or surgical mask, respond to a series of check in questions about COVID -19 exposure and symptoms, and have a temperature check. After being cleared, the student will proceed to their assigned space in the lab or classroom. Students must wear a mask may be required to wear a face shield in lab if close contact with the instructor and classmates is unavoidable. At this time, any student who may have a qualifying event listed below will not be allowed to attend their hands -on skills lab activity. Once a student has met the criteria in this document, they must contact Dr. Le\u00f3n, Associate Director for the Undergraduate Program ( tleon@nmsu.edu ) and request to be allowed back to lab. Students unable to attend a lab or simulation may have the opportun ity to attend online using their iPad and Zoom. The School of Nursing will work with all students to complete the necessary hands -on/clinical hours required for graduation. 38 Qualifying Events for Quarantine Qualifying events to preclud e students from campus activities and clinical rotations are as follows: 1. Travel a) To a COVID -19 high -risk area in the state of New Mexico - this currently includes San Juan and McKinley counties. b) Out of state (not to include El Paso, TX) c) By commercial airline 2. Participation in a social gathering of more than five individuals, or one that does not adhere to most current social distancing guidelines. 3. Exposure to an individual with known or suspected COVID -19 infection. We are fully aware that many of ou r students/faculty may live with an essential employee who is at higher risk and will encourage safe practices, recognizing that our in -class practices, such as use of cloth and surgical masks, face shields, gloves, and continuous hand washing and help further mitigate spread. 4. A positive COVID -19 test result: Positive test results must be reported to Dr. Le \u00f3n, Associate Director for the Undergraduate Program ( tleon@nmsu.edu ) and the Aggie Health & Wellness Center . 5. COVID -19 symptoms, without a positive test, to include, but not limited to: Chills or Fever of 100.4 degrees or higher Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Fatigue Muscle or body ache Headache New loss of taste or smell Sore Throat Congestion or runny nose Gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea/vomiting and/or diarrhea) 39 If a faculty member and/or a clinical site partner suspects these symptoms, they can send a stud ent home until they meet one of the following criteria listed the next section of this document. We are also aware that a student may exhibit some of these symptoms and have other conditions, we encourage students to discuss these with their faculty and co me to an agreement about how to respond to the questionnaire. This may involve providing a doctor's note which points to a condition other than COVID19. Quarantine and Return to Lab/Clinicals Following Quarantine Procedures The School of Nursing follows NMSU policy for quarantine and return to campus following quarantine. In the presence of a qualifying event, students may be precluded from skills lab and clinical rotations until they have a negative test result, or: 1. For symp toms: The person is symptom free without the use of fever reducing medications for 72 hours and 10 days have passed since initial onset of symptoms. 2. For positive test results: a) (Time -based strategy ) 10 days have passed since the date of the first positive COVID -19 diagnostic test assuming they have not subsequently developed symptoms since their positive test. If symptoms have developed then test -based strategy should be used. b) (Test -based strategy) Negative result of an FDA Emergency Use Authorized COVID -19 molecular assay for detection of SARS -CoV-2 RNA from at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected at least 24 hours apart. 3. For travel: A 14 -day self -isolation pe riod, beginning the day they return to Las Cruces or their place of residence. 4. For suspected exposure defined as 'having close contact (< 6 feet) for > 15 minutes)' with an individual who has tested positive for COVID -19 or is suspected to have COVID -19: a) A 14-day self-isolation period, beginning the most recent day of potential exposure. b) The isolation period may restart if the student has additional exposures during that time. 40 GRADING IN CLINICAL COURSES Clinical performance is graded as Pass/Fail. Failing the clinical performance component of the course will result in a grade of 'F' regardless of the points achieved on other assignments. Passing the clinical component of the course requires that the student achieve a 'Satisfactory' rating on the final NMNEC Summative Clinical Evaluation tool as determined by the clinical instructor. Specifically, the student must achieve a 'Satisfactory' rating on the item 'Met Course Clinical Expectations.' If the clinical experiences occur at more than one site, the student must achieve a 'Satisfactory' rating on the clinical evaluation at each site (if applicable). Clinical Probation A student may be placed on clinical probation by the BSN Admissions and Progre ssion sub-committee or Associate Director for the Undergraduate program for any of the following reasons: 1. Inability to maintain a grade of at least 77% on clinical assignments or demonstrates unsatisfactory clinical performance at mid-term. 2. Meeting one or more of the criteria listed under Guidelines for Determining Unsafe Clinical Practice (see next section) Based on the seriousness of the unsafe clinical behavior or privacy violation, faculty can recommend immediate removal of a student from a clinical site, which may result in failure of the course. The student will then be referred to the Associate Director for Undergraduate Programs, who will then make a recommendation to the SON Director regard ing retention or program dismissal. Written notification of any probationary status shall be given to the student. During the probationary period, the faculty member and student will meet on a weekly basis to evaluate progress toward meeting conditions of probation. Each week the student will be reevaluated and the probationary status will be removed or continued. A student who does not meet the conditions of probation will not be allowed to continue clinical practice and will receive a failing grade for the course. 41 OPEN SKILLS LABORATORY The School of Nursing maintains an \"Open Lab\" schedule for students to practice nursing skills on their own or with assistance from a graduate assistant, nursing lab tutor, or a faculty member. The lab serv es as a resource center for practicing skills learned in nursing classes and is open to any student registered with the NMSU Nursing Program. Students may also be referred to the lab by nursing faculty when a need to enhance skills or to repeat or make up a specific skill return demonstration (form posted in the BSN Virtual Advising Canvas course).

Expected Outcomes Prior to the beginning of each semester, the student is expected to: Interpret medication orders and standard abbreviations needed for dosage calculations; Translate between military and regular time Convert within and between these selected measurement systems: Metric o Convert weight between micrograms, milligrams, grams and kilograms o Convert volume between milliliters and liters o Convert metric to household Household o Convert weight between pounds and kilograms o Convert volume between ounces and milliliters o Convert volume between teaspoons and milliliters Calculate dosages for administration of medications by common routes o Calculate dosages of solid oral medications from 0.5 to 3 tablets. o Calculate oral liquid volumes from 0.001 to 30 mL. o Calculate injectable medication volumes from 0.0001 to 3 mL. Calculate infusion rates and times for intravenous administration. o Calculate volumes between milliliters per hour and drops per minute. o Calculate total/end infusion times for intravenous fluids. o Calculate amounts/times to administer IV push medications. 57 o Calculate infusion rates/times for intermittent intravenous (piggyback) infusions. Calculate dosages for administration of medications in tightly controlled situations. o Determine dos ages based on a patient's clinical data (Weight, vital signs or lab results) o Determine if an ordered amount is within a safe/recommended range. o Contrast different concentrations of solutions/ratios. o Calculate rates/amounts for intravenous medication drips. Other requirements for exam problems will include: o The calculations may require conversions as part of the problem o The amounts may range from fractions/decimals to thousands of units. o There will not be information needed or questions about speci fic pharmacology of medications, administration techniques or nursing implications in the preclinical dosage/calculation exam. These topics will be covered in theory and/or clinical applications. Specific Requirements Students are expected to do their own individual work. Observed acts of cheating - including but not limited to signaling or messaging between students, use of additional notes or other materials - will result in the student(s) dismissal from the testing session and loss of the testing oppo rtunity (1st or 2nd). Calculation exams will be given via electronic media using ExamSoft on an iPad or laptop. Students may use only the School's simple calculator (no programmable electronics or other devices may be used). Students must show their work and write down their own answer. Scratch paper will be provided with the test. There will be 25 questions involving calculations following the blueprint below. A maximum of 60 minutes are allowed to complete the test. The following dosage/calculation rules will be followed for this exam: o Amounts less than 1 will be written with a zero to the left of the decimal. o Extra zeros will NOT be placed at the right of the decimal point at the end. o All tablets are scored in half, so round tablets to the nearest half of a tablet. 58 Retakes o For dosages greater than 10, round answers to the nearest whole number. o For all weights, the final answer if rounded to the nearest tenth. o With pediatric patients, round dosage answers to the nearest hundredth. o All IV hourly rates round the nearest tenth. With pediatric patients round the IV hourly rates to the nearest hundredth. o All IV drops per minute rates round to the nearest whole number. Students will have two attempts to achieve the required 92%. A time and date will be announced for students to review their exam results prior to a retake. Students are responsible for their own remediation prior to retaking the e xam (see faculty for resources). A third attempt is possible after documentation of remediation and at the discretion of the Clinical Coordinator. If it is necessary for students to retake the exam, a time and place will be determined within the same week by the Clinical Coordinator. All versions will follow the same requirements, outcomes, and blueprint. If a student misses the first exam attempt for any reason, the only other attempt will be during the scheduled \"retake\" session. The missed attempt counts as a failure.
