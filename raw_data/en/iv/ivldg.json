It is exactly this biological diversity 1 and the shared ancestries of organisms that have interested (evolutionary) biologists for more than a century and that still form the main pillars of evolutionary biology as research field. The evolution of the field of evolutionary biology To study (the evolutionary processes underlying) the diversity of life forms surrounding us, many tools, theories and methods have been generated. Some of these fundamental ideas, discoveries and theories date back several centuries. Already before his influential book on the origin of species in 1859 (Darwin 1859) and joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace in 1858 (Darwin & Wallace 1858), in which the theory of natural selection was presented, Charles Darwin's grandfather Erasmus put forward the idea of descent from a common ancestor (Darwin 1818). Half a century later Gregor Mendel discovered the typical inheritance patterns of dominant and recessive traits in pea plants (Mendel 1866). So both the original theory of natural selection and the first empirical proof of a mechanism of inheritance date back to the 19 th century, although a broad acceptance and integration of the two would last until the 20th century. The field of evolutionary biology greatly revolutionized in the 20 th century with the discovery of e.g., the molecular structure of DNA in 1953 (Watson & Crick 1953) and the introduction and development of statistical genetics and population genetics (e.g., Fisher 1919; Haldane 1932; Wright 1932). It was now possible -and customary- to study gene mutations, their effect on phenotype and their distribution throughout, mostly, populations in the laboratory. 1 Biodiversity or biological diversity is defined as the variability among living organisms from all resources including inter alia, terrestrial marine and other aquatic systems and the ecological complexes of which they are part [ ] (Convention on Biological Diversity, Article 2. United Nations Conference on the Environmen t and development, 'The Earth Summit' 1992.) 7 Within the last decade, further integration of subfields, such as evolutionary developmental biology, bio-informatics and genomics, together with the development of new technologies, such as more efficient sequencing techniques (i.e., Next Generation Sequencing, Third Generation Sequencing) made it possible to study a broad range of questions directly in wild populations. In the 21 st century evolutionary biology is a truly interdisciplinary field, from field ecology to comparable genomics. With these technological advances and integration of different subfields, the main focus of the field is shifted towards understanding and finding the exact changes in the genome underlying a particular natural occurring phenotype of interest. By doing this, scientists are now able to explain the differences not only between populations or species, but ultimately also between two individuals. Well -studied examples of this approach focus on adaptive traits in response to new or altered environments, such as the colonization of novel freshwater lake and stream habitats by marine three-spined sticklebacks ( Gasterosteus aculeatus) after the last Ice Age and the colonization of newly formed islands in the Gulf of Florida and of the Atlantic coast by the oldfield mice ( Peromyscus polionotus). These species are known for their phenotypic adaptations to the novel environments. Freshwater sticklebacks have evolved a reduction in armor plates and pelvic skeleton, possibly through lowered predation pressure, compared to their marine relatives. The mice inhabiting the light beach habitats have reduced pigment patterns in comparison to the melanic pigment patterns of the inland mice . In both cases the underlying genetic basis of the adaptive phenotype has been largely determined (Shapiro et al. 2004; Colosimo 2005; Steiner et al. 2007; 2009; Chan et al. 2010; Jones et al. 2012). The focus of evolutionary biologists nowadays, is not only aimed at determining the genetic changes underlying (adaptive) phenotypes, but also on disentangling the effects and contribution of different evolutionary processes (i.e., migration, mutation, genetic drift and selection) on the genome-wide genetic diversity of both wild and laboratory populations in response to specific environmental conditions. For instance, migration rates can be estimated from multilocus sequence data to give insight into (ongoing) gene flow between populations inhabiting divergent habitats or between sympatric species (see e.g., Hey & Nielsen 2004; Rosenblum 2006). In addition, direct measurements of predation pressures on mice showed that natural selection, through visual hunting predators, is responsible for the cryptic coat color of Peromyscus mice inhabiting both the light-substrate beach habitats and the dark-substrate inland habitats along the Gulf of Florida (Vignieri et al. 2010). These approaches, thus, facilitate the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of populations, the roles of the evolutionary processes during adaptations to new environments and ultimately in the evolution of species and biological diversity. Since one of the major goals of evolutionary biology is to understand the processes shaping natural populations, many studies focus on organisms other than the traditional laboratory model systems such the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the brassicacaen Arabidopsis thaliana and the house mouse Mus musculus (see e.g., Abzhanov et al. 2008). Natural populations that (convergently) adapted to new or altered conditions are particular suitable systems to study (the genes involved in) adaptation and speciation. Besides the three-spined sticklebacks and Pero myscus 8 mice, great scientific interest has been shown in e.g., Mimulus monkey flowers, Poecilia guppy, and Heliconius and Bicyclus butterflies (see e.g., Abzhanov et al. 2008). Furthermore, species originating from an adaptive radiation, which is described as the evolution of ecological diversity within a rapidly multiplying lineage (Simpson 1953; Schluter 2000), are particular interesting model systems, since they comprise many closely-related species with a broad diversity in ecological and phenotypic traits. Most compelling examples of adaptive radiations are the Darwin finches on the Galapagos islands (Grant & Grant 2011), the Anoles lizards of the greater Antilles (Losos et al. 1997; Butler et al. 2007; Losos 2009) and the cichlid fishes of the East African great lakes (Kocher 2004; Seehausen 2006; Salzburger 2009). The cichlid fishes as model system for evolutionary biology \"I' VE NEVER MET AN ANIMAL , O R P L A N T F O R T H A T M ATTER , T H A T WASN 'T INTERESTING , B U T S O M E S T A N D O U T AS SPECIAL . CICHLID FISHES ARE RIGHT UP THERE .\" - George Barlow, 2000- In my PhD thesis I use cichlid fishes as model system to study the evolutionary genetics of naturally and sexually selected traits. As the above quote of Barlow (Barlow 2000) illustrates, cichlid fishes are remarkable animals that have furthermore been proposed as model systems for evolutionary biology (Kornfield & Smith 2000; Kocher 2004; Salzburger 2009). The latter is caused by the fact that there are thousands of cichlid species that are characterized by a great diversity in phenotypic and ecological traits. Cichlid fishes (Cichlidae) are ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) belonging to the Teleostei. They are found in numerous lake and river systems across Africa and Madagascar, Central and South America, the Middle East, India and Sri Lanka (see (Salzburger & Meyer 2004; Salzburger 2009). This biogeography corresponds with an initial Gondwanan distribution (excluding Australia and Antarctica) and its following fragmentation of landmasses, which is furthermore, supported by phylogenetic and biogeographic studies (Sparks & Smith 2004; 2005). However, species numbers in these regions are not equally distributed. The most basal and species-poor lineages are found in Asia, Madagascar and the Middle East (3, 32 and 7, respectively), while the lineages in Central and South America are relatively species-rich (110, 450; Turner 2007). Notably, the African lineages are particularly species-rich, with estimated species numbers of 180-250 in Lake Tanganyika, 600-700 in Lake Malawi, around 500-700 in Lake Victoria, plus another 300 in the remainder of the African continent (Turner et al. 2001; Turner 2007). 9 1.1. Lake Tanganyika and its cichlids' diversity. Lake Tanganyika (left) is a huge rift valley lake in East Africa. It is bordering Zambia in the south, Tanzania in east, Burundi in the no rth and the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the west and is inhabited by roughly 200 different species of cichlid fish. Displayed in the right part of the figure are eight of the Lake Tanganyikan lineages. The represented species vary in e.g., their body shape and size, coloration, diet and reproductive behavior. [Photographs by the Salzburger Lab] The exceptional high numbers of species in the East African Great Lakes, Malawi, Tanganyika and Victoria, are thought to have evolved within the last 10 million years (Kocher 2004; Sturmbauer et al. 2011), although some estimates are as low as 12,000 years for Lake Victoria (Johnson et al. 1996; Fryer 1997). These geologically and evolutionary short time periods together with the species-richness are proof for explosive and rapid speciation events. Interestingly, virtually all species from Lakes Malawi and Victoria belong to the haplochromine cichlid lineage (Fryer & Iles 1972; Greenwood 1979; al. 1990) and phylogenetic reconstructions based on mitochondrial DNA have shown that these species, as well as the haplochromines of Lake Tanganyika (in this case Tropheini), are ultimately derived from Lake Tanganyikan ancestors (Salzburger et al. 2005). Lake Tanganyika is furthermore known for its diverse radiation, the primary lacustrine radiation, that resulted in the phylogenetic distinct Sturmbauer et al. 2011; see Figure 1.1). As a consequence of these events and the occurrence and/or colonization of several non-radiated lineages (i.e., Tylochromini, Tilapiini, Boulengerochromini and Hemibatini), Lake Tanganyika is now populated by fifteen different lineages (Salzburger et al. 2002; Day et al. 2008; Sturmbauer et al. 2011). Within these different lineages an astonishing high level of morphological, phenotypical and behavioral diversity evolved (Kornfield & Smith mutagenic screen' (Kocher 2004) that offers great opportunities to study the genetic basis of speciation and adaptation. Examples of such studies are given in later chapters as well as elsewhere (Salzburger 2009; Santos & Salzburger 2012). 10 Invertebrates Scale eaterRock Zooplankton AufwuchsAlgae filaments PiscivorusLeaf chopper Plant scraper Sand digger Figure 1.2. Variation in cichlid mouth morphologies which corresponds with diet. After Fryer & Iles 1972 One of the traits that is particular diverse is the cichlids' mouth morphology (Figure 1.2). The main parts of the trophic apparatus are the oral jaws and the pharyngeal jaws, which have evolved from highly modified parts of the gill branches. It has been hypothesized that by processing the food items with the pharyngeal jaws, the oral jaws were freed to evolve diverse specialization in respect to the collection of these items (Liem 1973). The cichlids' mouth morphology (including the pharyngeal jaw) highly correlates with its diet (see Takahashi & Koblm\u00fcller 2011 for references; Muschick et al. 2012), which ranges from algae, insects, other fish, other fishes' scales or eyes to mollusks (see also Figure 1.2). Furthermore, it has been shown that diet or mode of feeding can change the pharyngeal jaw shape, implying that the trait is plastic and can respond quickly to an alternative food source (Hellig et al. 2010; Muschick et al. 2011). Pigmentation is also highly diverse in cichlid fishes (Figure 1.1). Especially, body coloration and patterns between sexes or between sympatric species can be highly different. While female body coloration is often dull, males are characterized by bright coloration, which forms the basis of many behavioral experiments in which typically female mate choice gets studied. These studies revealed that the female mate choice contributes to reproductive isolation and ultimately to speciation (see e.g., Turner et al. 1995; Knight & Turner 2004; Deutsch 2008). Interestingly, another pigmentation trait is believed to play a role in the mating behavior of the most species-rich cichlid lineage: the mouth brooding modern haplochromines (Wickler 1962; Hert 1989). The males of these species possess colorful spots, resembling real eggs - to some degree - on their anal fins close to their genital opening. It is thought that after the female has laid a clutch of eggs, the male presents her the egg-spots on his anal fin, to which the female reacts by picking up the eggs with her mouth. At this point, the male releases sperm and the eggs get fertilized in the female's mouth. Variation in size, number and color of egg-spot might be evolutionary important and its function can be studied with e.g., mate choice experiments (see e.g., Hert 1989; Couldridge 2002; Egger et al. 2011; Theis et al. 2012). 11 A third highly diverse trait among cichlid species is breeding behavior, including courtship and parental care systems. For instance, the above mentioned haplochromine lineage is characterized by maternal mouthbrooding behavior. This means that the fertilized eggs, and later on the fry, are kept in the female's mouth. Mating systems across species range from monogamy to harem polygyny, while parental care in mouthbrooding, biparental substrate-breeding and cooperative breeding (Sefc 2011). Remaining traits and the role of natural and sexual selection on all of them, are described elsewhere (e.g., Salzburger 2009; Takahashi & Koblm\u00fcller 2011; Sturmbauer et al. 2011) as well as in the next chapters. Thus, cichlid fishes of the East African lakes, as well as several lineages in Central and South America, are characterized by great ecological and phenotypical diversity that evolved in rapidly multiplying lineages, which are the two main components of the classical definition of adaptive radiations (Simpson 1953; Schluter 2000). Cichlid fishes are great examples of adaptive radiations and excellent model systems for the study of adaptation, speciation and evolutionary innovation (Kornfield & Smith 2000; Kocher 2004; Seehausen 2006; Salzburger 2009). Research goals of my doctoral thesis Several traits of cichlid fishes such as; the pharyngeal jaw apparatus, haplochromine maternal mouthbrooding, egg-spots and color polymorphisms have been proposed as evolutionary key innovations (Liem 1973; Salzburger et al. 2005). Key innovations are described as novel traits that allow its bearer to exploit new ecological niches, and are considered as one of the possible causes leading to an adaptive radiation (Schluter 2000; Gavrilets & Losos 2009; Losos 2010). Furthermore, these traits could (partly) be responsible for the evolutionary success of cichlid lineages. Besides these key innovations, other adaptive traits could also have increased the fitness of an individual and subsequently spread within a population. These adaptive traits can be of a morphological, behavioral as well as physiological kind and are eminent candidates to study the genetic basis of adaptation and diversification. Furthermore, they can be used to determine the role of natural and/or sexual selection in adaptive processes (see Salzburger 2009; Sturmbauer et al. 2011). In my doctoral work I studied the molecular evolutionary genetics of candidate gene families that are associated with either key innovations or other adaptations in cichlids or specific lineages thereof. The goal was to get a better understanding of the sequence evolution and type of selection (i.e., neutral, purifying or positive selection) acting upon genes that are involved in evolutionary important traits. Furthermore, functional implications of these loci can then be validated by means of e.g., expression assays. The goal of the second part of my thesis was to unravel the genetic basis of a particular adaptation: the thick-lipped phenotype observed in multiple cichlid lineages. Here, the aim was to generate a candidate gene list of loci that are putatively involved in the evolution of this particular adaptation. Therefore, the overall objective 12 of my thesis was to obtain further insights into the evolutionary genetics of naturally and sexually selected traits in cichlid fishes. Outline of the thesis My thesis is divided in two main parts: the first part (i.e., chapter 2 through 4) focuses on characterizing candidate gene families, while in the second part (i.e., chapter 5 and 6) genomic approaches are described. In chapter 2 I present the molecular characterization of the endothelin family of ligands and receptors. The genes of this family are putatively involved in the development and evolution of two key innovations in cichlids: the pharyngeal jaw apparatus of all cichlids and the egg-spots of haplochromines. These loci are thus candidate genes for evolutionary innovations. I found elevated rates of protein evolution in the two studied ligands compared to the receptors and relative high expression levels of the two studied developmental pathways in two evolutionary key innovations. These results suggest that the endothelin ligands and receptors are indeed involved in the morphogenesis of naturally and sexually selected traits in cichlids. In chapter 3 I discuss another gene family which is putatively involved in the same evolutionary novelties; the pharyngeal jaw apparatus and the anal fin egg-spots: the distal-less homeobox gene family. These loci are widely known for their crucial roles in the development (of components) of the nervous system, craniofacial skeleton and connective tissue, and in the formation of appendages and have been implicated with evolutionary novelties in other species such as; butterflies, other insects and vertebrates. They are thus, renowned candidate genes for morphological diversification across the animal kingdom, including cichlid fishes. In this chapter I show that the dlx repertoire of cichlid fishes is shaped by differential selection pressures and rates of evolution after gene duplication, and I try to relate this to their presumed crucial roles in the development of several morphological traits. The results of a third gene family study, called the Hivep gene family, are highlighted in chapter 4. Here I combined molecular characterization of separate loci with an immune challenge to show the presumed immune-related roles of paralogs. The results revealed that exposure of the cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni to a vaccination with Vibrio anguillarum bacteria provoked an immune response and significant positive correlations between the expression levels of several Hivep paralogs and the lymphocyte/monocyte ratios. These results suggest a role for Hivep paralogs in the immunological parasite defense of A. burtoni. Furthermore, I hypothesize that immune genes might have been particular important during cichlid radiations, in which contact to novel pathogenic environments is likely to have left signs of adaptive protein evolution in genes, of which Hivep is a prime example. Top-down, or whole genome, approaches can facilitate the generation of candidate gene lists and with the current revolution of sequencing techniques it becomes more and more feasible to perform such studies in non-model organisms. Chapter 5 illustrates this development specifically in the field of molecular ecology. It is a 13 meeting review of the one-day symposium organized by the journal Molecular Ecology in 2012, which illustrates that Next Generation Sequencing approaches are extremely useful in many different subfields of molecular ecology. One such technique, RNA Sequencing was used to determine the genetic basis of a convergent thick-lipped phenotype observed in both African and Nicaraguan species. These results, along with several other ecological analyses are presented in chapter 6 . In this work, I was merely involved in the RNAseq and gene expression assays parts. A comparative Illumina RNA sequencing approach was used that involved thick and 'normal' lip tissue and a set of 141 differentially expressed candidate genes was identified. Six of these genes were further studied by means of comparative quantitative real-time PCR. Three strong candidates, Actb, Cldn7 and Copb were identified. Interestingly, similar trends in gene expression were found between African and Central American thick-lipped species, indicating that an overlapping set of genes was independently recruited to build this particular phenotype in both lineages. As closing chapter of this thesis, the work presented here is discussed in chapter 7. 14 References Abzhanov A, Extavour CG, Groover A, et al. (2008) Are we there yet?

Diepeveen Walter Salzburger Received: 7 September 2011 / Accepted: 4 January 2012 / Published online: 21 January 2012 /C211Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012 Abstract The adaptive radiations of cichlid shes in East Africa have been associated with the acquisition of evo- lutionary novelties as well as the ecological opportunitiesexisting in the East African Great lakes. Two remarkable evolutionary innovations are the pharyngeal jaw apparatus, found in all cichlid species, and the anal n egg-spots ofmouthbrooding cichlids. Based on their conserved func- tions during the development of both the jaw apparatus and pigmentation, the endothelin ligands and receptors form aputative link between these naturally and sexually selected traits. Here we study the evolutionary history of four members of two endothelin pathways (Edn1/EdnrAa andEdn3b/EdnrB1a) to elucidate their possible roles during the evolution and development of key innovations in East African cichlids species. The analyses performed on partialsequences (ca. 6,000 bp per taxon) show that all four endothelin family members evolved under purifying selection, although both ligands are characterized by anaccelerated rate of protein evolution in comparison to the receptors. In accordance with earlier ndings, we show that the mature protein sequence of Edn1 and Edn3 are highly conserved, also in cichlids, whereas the preproendothelin parts are variable indicating relaxed selective constraints.In the receptors, nonsynonymous substitutions were mainly found in the ligand-binding domains suggesting functionaldivergence. Gene expression assays with Real-Time PCRindeed reveal that the two studied endothelin pathways are expressed in the cichlid pharyngeal jaw and in the haplo-chromine egg-spot (among other pigment-cell containing tissues), suggesting their involvement during morphogen- esis of naturally and sexually selected traits in cichlids. Endothelin receptor /C1Pigmentation /C1 Pharyngeal jaw /C1Neural crest innovation The spectacular adaptive radiations of cichlid shes pro- vide a unique model system to study evolutionary pro- cesses. No other vertebrate family consists of such a greatnumber of species (at least 3,000 species worldwide), such a degree of phenotypic diversity and such a rapid diversi- cation rate. Above all, the species flocks of cichlids in theEast African Great Lakes show the greatest variation in morphology, coloration, ecology, behavior, and the cichlids' occurrence in various geographic regions (Africa, India, Sri Lanka, and Central and South America) and the independent (and repeated) colonizationof multiple African lakes (e.g., lakes Malawi, Tanganyika, and Victoria) form the basis for some outstanding cases of parallel evolution within and between lakes and regions(Duftner et al. 2007; Elmer et al. 2010; Kocher et al. 1993). According to the ecological opportunity hypothesis, fast divergence of lineages can occur when available andunderutilized niches are being lled (Schluter 2000). This Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00239-012-9483-6 ) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. E. T. Diepeveen ( &)/C1W. Salzburger ( &) for cichlids that colonized and subsequently radiated in large rift lakes with their diversity in habitats (e.g., surge habitat, shallow rocky shores, sandy ground, mud floor, benthic water) and foodresources (e.g., algae, plants, small invertebrates, and other sh). New niches can also become accessible when novel traits, so-called evolutionary key innovations, evolve withwhich so far unaccessible niches can be exploited (Gavri- lets and Losos 2009; Schluter 2000). The evolutionary success of cichlids in general, and the explosive radiation of the East African haplochromine lineage in particular, have been associated with the acquisition of such evolu-tionary innovations (Fryer and Iles 1972; Liem 1973; 2005). The pharyngeal jaw apparatus (Fig. 1a), for instance, is found in all cichlids and isthought to underlie diversication with respect to feeding ecology (Fryer and Iles 1972; Hunter 1998; cichlid pharyngeal jaw morphology (andthe teeth on there) directly correlates with the diversity in diet, from algae to whole shes (Liem 1973). Even though other groups of teleost shes are characterized by thepresence of pharyngeal structures that aid the passage of food into the esophagus, cichlid shes show the greatest diversity in pharyngeal jaw morphology resulting in theefcient manipulation of a great variety of food. Thus, the pharyngeal jaw apparatus is thought to play an important role in niche specialization and, hence, speciation incichlids (Liem 1973; Muschick et al. 2011; Salzburger2009). Sexual selection is the other major factor that is likely to have contributed to the cichlids' species-richness (see, e.g.,Meyer & Burrows 1995), as indicated by the occurrence ofmultiple color morphs and sexual color dimorphism. Thisis particularly obvious in the most species-rich group of cichlids, the haplochromines. The haplochromines exclu- sively consists of maternal mouthbrooders, which the anal ns of male haplochromines and other C-lineage tribes has been proposed as yet another key innovation (Salzburger et al. 2005, 2007; Fig. 1c). Varia-tion in size, number, and color of the egg-spots has been observed both between and within species (Salzburger et al. 2007). Egg-spots appear to play a prominent role inmating behavior (Wickler 1962), although their exact function remains elusive (Egger et al. 2011; Theis et al. 2012). The above-mentioned evolutionary key innovations of cichlids share a developmental origin. Both the mouthapparatus (including the pharyngeal jaws) and pigmenta-tion (body coloration and Kocher 2006; Gans and Northcutt 1983; Hall 1999 ; Slack 2001), which is\u2014by AD B C Fig. 1 Three putative key innovations and the genetic pathways involved in neural crest cell differentiation. aThe lower pharyngeal jaw, which is a fusion of the fth ceratobranchials, is responsible for grinding the food and is present in all cichlids. bA mouthbrooding haplochromine female.

Photographs taken by M. Muschick, A. Theis,and C. Heule. Pathways based on, 2002; J Mol and Northcutt 1983; Shimeld and Holland 2000). Neural crest cells originate in the neural folds, and migrate away from the neural tube to form a wide varietyof cell types across the whole body including neuron cells, pigment cells, craniofacial bones, Schwann cells, and smooth muscle cells (Chung et al. 2009; Slack 2001). Thegenetic and developmental basis of the neural crest-derived tissues and specically those involved in evolutionary key innovations is, hence, of great importance for the study of cichlid evolution (Salzburger 2009). Within the last decade several studies have focused on the genetic basis of naturally and sexually selected traits incichlids (reviewed in Salzburger 2009). Albertson et al. (2005), for example, showed that bmp4 is involved in craniofacial diversity and that it has the potential to change the mandible shape of cichlids. It had previously been shown that this gene underwent adaptive protein evolutionin East African cichlid species (Terai et al. 2002b). More recently, Fraser et al. (2009) showed that similar genetic pathways underlie the tooth formation on both the oral andthe pharyngeal jaws in cichlids. Seven Hox genes and several genes from a previously described dental gene network (Fraser et al. 2008) were shown to be expressed indeveloping pharyngeal jaw tissue in two Malawi cichlid species (Fraser et al. 2009). Apart from jaw-related genes, several candidate coloration genes have been studied incichlids. Terai et al. (2003), for example, showed that cichlids express multiple alternatively spliced hagvariants and that species-rich lineages feature more splice variants than species-poor ones. Also for this gene an accelerated rate of protein evolution was determined (Terai et al. 2002a). The Pax7 locus appears to be involved in the formation of the orange blotch phenotype (Roberts et al. 2009). Finally, it has been shown that csf1ra is involved in the development of the colorful egg-spots on the male anal n (Salzburger et al. 2007). One specic family of candidate genes for neural crest- derived structures and, in particular, two prominent evo-lutionary innovations of cichlids (i.e., the pharyngeal jaw and coloration) is the endothelin (Edn) family. Endothelin 1 was discovered in 1988 as vasoconstrictor by Yanagis-awa et al. (1988). Later, more members of this gene family were found and their functions annotated, so it is now evident that the endothelin system is involved in the for-mation of craniofacial structures, enteric ganglion neurons, pigmentation, and vasoconstriction in both mouse (Bay- nash et al. 1994; Clouthier et al. 1998; Hosoda 1994; Ozeki et al. 2004; Yanagisawa et al. 1988) and zebrash (Miller et al. 2000; Parichy et al.2000). The active gene product of the endothelin genes isonly 21 amino acids long and obtained via two steps ofcleaving from the inactive precursors preproendothelin andbig endothelin, respectively (Masaki 2004). The Edn family arose in the vertebrate lineage from an ancestral signaling peptide and a G protein-coupledreceptor. Subsequent expansion took place by three rounds of whole genome duplication (i.e., the two vertebrate- specic whole genome duplications and a sh-specic one), each followed by functi onal divergence and coevo- lution of the ligands and receptors (Braasch et al. 2009).Also, the range of interactions between the ligands and the receptors expanded with each round of genome duplica- tion, since all endothelin receptors can\u2014theoretically\u2014bind all ligands, albeit with different afnities (note that this has not yet been examined in teleosts). Braasch et al. (2009) showed that functional changes in the receptorswere mainly due to shifts of evolutionary rates and less to radical changes in amino acids. Furthermore, the sites where these changes were observed are mainly found in theextracellular loops or ligand-binding domains of the receptors and not in the intracellular domains where interaction with the G protein occurs. This indicates thatwith the expanding repertoire of the ligands, the receptors co-evolved by slightly changing the ligand-receptor bind- ing afnity and selectivity. Since the third round of wholegenome duplication took place in the lineage leading to the ray-nned shes (Meyer and van de Peer 2005), the most abundant number of endothelins and receptors are found intoday's teleost shes. Six endothelin genes and ve stickleback, while zebrash, medaka, spotted green puffersh, andtorafugu are all characterized by a species-specic gene loss, resulting in a lower number of either receptor or ligand (Braasch et al. 2009). The aim of this study is to elucidate the molecular evolutionary history of the endothelin family in EastAfrican cichlids and its possible role during the evolutionand development of evolutionary key innovations. There- fore, two components of the endothelin core system (the ligand and receptor of two endothelin signaling pathways)were studied in a phylogenetic ally representative set of East African cichlids: the Edn1/EdnrA pathway, which isinvolved in the development of craniofacial structures(Miller et al. 2000; et al. Larue 2003; Fig. 1d), and the Edn3/EdnrB pathway, which is involvedin the development of pigment cells (Pla and Larue 2003;Fig. 1d). We determined partial DNA sequences of ligands and receptors in 26 cichlid species from Lake Tanganyika (total sequence length per species: ca. 6,000 bp) and per-formed analyses to determine the evolutionary history of these loci. We show that the endothelin family members evolved under purifying selection and that they are indeedexpressed in pharyngeal jaw egg-spot tissue.J Mol Evol (2011) 357 123 22Materials and methods Tissue Sampling and DNA/RNA Extraction In this study, we analyzed two components of the endo- thelin system in 26 species of cichlid shes from Lake Tanganyika, East Africa, belonging to 14 different tribes,thus representing a great portion of the diversity of East African cichlids (Salzburger et al. 2002, 2005). The sam-ples were collected during two consecutive expeditions toLake Tanganyika in 2007 and 2008 (see Supplementary Table 1 for specimen information). Genomic DNA was extracted from white muscle tissue and digested with Proteinase K followed by sodiumchloride extraction and ethanol precipitation (Bruford et al. 1998). RNA was extracted from male adultAstatotilapia burtoni (laboratory strain) in order to ana- lyze the expression pattern of the studied loci (see below).Animals were kept under standard conditions (12 h light,12 h dark; 25 /C176C). Twelve types of tissues were dissected (brain, liver, gonads, muscle, pharyngeal jaw, maxilla,mandible, skin, anal egg-spotand non-egg-spot tissue independent], caudal n, eyes, and whole juveniles were used as positive control) and ground using a mortar and a pestle, followed by an RNAextraction procedure with Trizol (Invitrogen). Hereafter, genomic DNA was removed from the samples by DNase treatment following the DNA Free protocol (Ambion Inc, Austin, TX). The RNA concentration was measured with a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientic,Wilmington, DE) in order to use the recommended amount of RNA in the subsequent reverse transcriptase (RT) step (see below). Reverse Transcription and Real-Time PCR Reverse transcription of the cleaned-up RNA samples was performed with the High capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's 3-phosphat -dehydro ) was used under standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conditions with Amp-litaq DNA polymerase (see below) to test if the extraction and following steps were successful. Subsequent Real- Time PCRs were conducted on a StepOnePlus Real-TimePCR System (Applied Biosystems) following the manu- facturer's protocol. Final cDNA and primer concentrations of 0.5 ng/ ll and 900 nM, respectively, were used together with the SYBR Green master (Rox) dye (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Comparative C Texperiments were used to quantify the level of expression with juvenile tissue as reference tissue and Actin (see Supplementary Table 2 forprimer info) as endogenous control. Measurements ofexpression levels in target tissues were normalized using the endogenous control. Each reaction was replicated three times. Loci, PCR Amplication, and Sequencing ). These loci based on the availability of their teleost orthologous sequences in public databases, the quality ofthe subsequent alignments and the quality of the PCR products. Also we choose to study only one paralog per endothelin pathway. PCR primers for both the DNA andcDNA samples are listed in Supplementary Table 2 and were initially designed based on 2009). tested on A. burtoni DNA. Resultant A. burtoni sequences were blasted using a translated nucleotide query. Based on these sequences an additionalset of cichlid-specic primers was designed. Standard12.5ll PCR reactions were on 2720 thermal cycler and/or a Veriti 96-well thermal cycler (both with 9Taq buffer, 0.8 mM dNTP mix, 0.0125 units REDTaq DNA polymerase (all Sigma, Saint Louis, MO), 0.2 lM of each primer, 0.5 mM MgCl 2, and 20 ng of template DNA. For initially unsuccessful ampli- cations the following, modied, protocol was used: 1 9 Taq buffer, 0.25 units Amplitaq DNA polymerase (bothApplied Biosystems), 0.8 mM dNTP mix (Sigma), 0.2 lM of each primer, 0.1 mM MgCl 2and 20 ng of template DNA. Amplication consisted of an initial denaturationstep at 94 /C176C (2 min), 30-40 cycles of 94 /C176C (45 s), 47-57 /C176C (45 s), and 72 /C176C (60-120 s) followed by a nal extension at 72 /C176C (10 min). All PCR products were visualized with ethidium bro- mide PCR-product was puried ExoSAP-IT following themanufacturer's instructions (USB, Cleveland, OH). Thesubsequent sequencing reactions for both forward and reverse sequences separate were performed with 1 ll Terminator Ready Reaction Mix 3.1 (Applied Biosystems), 0.625 lM primer and the puried amplication products. The conditions of the cycle sequencing reaction were asfollowed: 94 /C176C (1 min), 25 cycles of 94 /C176C (10 s), 52 /C176C (20 s), and 60 /C176C (4 min). The nal purication step was performed with the BigDye X-Terminator system (Applied Biosystems). SAMsolution (22.5 ll), X-Terminator beads (5 ll) and H 2O (14.5ll) was added to each sample and mixed (2,000 rpm)358 J Mol Evol (2011) 73:355-368 123 23for 30 min, followed by a nal spin down (1,500 rpm, 2 min). The DNA fragments were visualized on a 3130 xlcap- illary sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Sequences of theDNA samples were used in subsequent analyses (see below), while sequences from the cDNA samples were only used to conrm the respective locus. All sequenceshave been deposited into GenBank under accession num- bers JQ309683-JQ309786 (see Supplementary Table 1). Cloning Since one PCR reaction for the EdnrB1a locus did not result in a clear signal in the sequencing reaction, PCR products were cloned with a TOPO TA cloning kit(Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. PCR reactions were performed directly on the clone products with the M13 primer pair that was supplied by the manu-facturer. After conrmation of the proper insert size (i.e., again with visualization with ethidium bromide on a 1.5% agarose gel), PCR products were cleaned-up with a GenElute PCR clean up kit (Sigma) followed by the normal sequencing protocol (see above). A minimum of six colo- nies were sequenced for each sample and aberrant nucle-otide positions due to PCR errors and only observed in one of these sequences, were removed before the analyses. Molecular and Phylogenetic Analyses Sequences were aligned and edited using Codon Code Aligner 3.5.6 (CodonCode Corporation, Dedham, MA). Exon/intron boundaries were determined by homology comparisons with ve teleost orthologs (see Braasch et al.2009). First of all, we constructed phylogenetic trees consisting of both cichlid and other teleost sequences were translated into sequences and aligned with the other teleost EdnandEdnr sequences (i.e., D. rerio ,O. latipes , and G. aculeatus ; see Braasch et al. 2009 for references) using TCoffee (Notredame et al. 2000; Poirot et Strimmer 2001; Guindon and Gascuel 2003) was used to select the most appropriate model of protein evo-lution, which was then used in the phylogenetic analysis onthe RAxML server (Stamatakis et al. 2008). Three different data sets were constructed from the cichlid endothelin sequences: a whole data set (wds), aprotein-coding data set (c od), and a non-coding data set (noncod). The number of segregating sites ( S)a n dt h e K a/Ksvalues for the wds and the cod were conducted with the software package DnaSP 5.10 (Librado and Rozas 2009 ). For the cod data sets, sliding windowanalyses of the Ka/Ksratio were also performed with the same program with a window s ize of 25 and an overlap of 10 bp. This comparison w as performed between dif- ferent groups dened on the basis of existing phyloge- nies (e.g., outgroup gines, and ectodines; see, e.g., Salzburger et al. 2002, 2005, 2007) and the remaining samples. Phylogenetic analyses were performed for three data sets per locus: wds, cod, and noncod along with one con- catenated data set. The concatenated data set includes the four endothelin family member data sets plus one addi-tional non-endothelin, autosomal coding gene to increase the total length to 9,451 bp (Diepeveen and Salzburger unpublished data). Due to inconsistent results for theCyprichromini Edn1 sequence, this single sequence was omitted from the concatenated data set in an additionalanalysis. Likelihood ratio tests information criterion and corrected Akaike information criteria were used to determine thebest-tting models of nucleotide substitutions. These models were used in the maximum likelihood (ML) search in PAUP* 4.0 (Swofford 2002 )w i t h T. polylepis and O. tanganicae as outgroup species (see Salzburger et al. 2002). To test the robustness of the resulting topologies, weconducted bootstrap analyses with 100 replicates. BayesianInference of phylogeny was conducted in MrBayes 3.2 with 10.500.000 generations in total and T. polylepis outgroup species (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist 2001; Ronquist and Huelsenbeck 2003). To determine whether the Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis had run long enough, we applied the Are We There Yet (AWTY) system(Nylander et al. 2008). To test if the studied loci evolved under non-neutral selection, we analyzed the synonymous (silent; K s) and nonsynonymous (amino acid-changing; Ka) substitution rates of amino acid sequences within and between the 26species. First, we ran the data on the Selecton Server(Doron-Faigenboim et al. 2005; Stern et al. 2007). LRTs were conducted between the M8 model ( bandx sC1), which enables positive selection, and the M8a ( band xs=1; no positive selection) and M7 (only purifying selection) models. Furthermore, we applied a Bayesian approach to predict whether a site is undergoing positiveselection, as implemented in Selecton. Next, a branch test was performed using HyPhy (Kosakovsky Pond et al. 2005) to test whether specic branches showed signs of adaptive sequence evolution. Both the obtained ML phylogeny (see above) and an independent tree based on sequences of the mitochondrialND2 gene (Salzburger et al. 2002, 2005) were used for reconstructions of the d n/dsratios on the branches of theJ Mol Evol (2011) 73:355-368 359 123 24phylogeny. The adaptation selection tool was then used ( P=0.05) to visualize the dn/dsratios on a branch-scaled tree. This method also indicates sites evolving under non-neutral evolution. The program Codeml from the PAML (Phylogenetic Analysis by ML) 4.2 package (Yang 1997, 2007)w a s subsequently used to test bo th site- and branch-specic adaptive evolution of coding sequences. Tests of positive selected sites were conducted by performing LRT of the following model comparis ons: M1a (Nearly Neutral) with M2a (Positive Selection), and M8a ( b&xs=1) with M8. The comparison b e t w e e nM 0( o n e - r a t i o )a n dM 3( d i s c r e t e )w a su s e da sa test of variable xamong sites. The na \u00a8ve empirical Bayes (NEB; Nielsen and Yang 1998;Y a n ge ta l . 2000 ) and the Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB; Yang et al. 2005 ) criteria were used to calculate the posterior probabilities for site classes and to identify sites under positiveselection in case the LRT was signicant. In addition to the site models, the branch model ( free-ratios model withxallowed to vary) was app lied to detect positive selection acting on particular lineages (Yang 1998 ;Y a n g and Nielsen 1998). Finally, we studied the observed nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions in more detail. For this, we compared ourdata with the information known about the protein domains of both human ( Homo sapiens ) and mouse ( Mus musculus ) of the proteins studied here (source: The Uni- versal Protein Resource database http://www.uniprot.org/).Results RNA Expression Pattern The gene expression levels an d patterns of the endothelin family members are depicted in Fig. 2(Real-Time PCR- results) and Supplementary Fig . 1 (PCR-results). Overall the four endothelin family memb ers are widely expressed with Edn3b expression not being detectable in three tissues (i.e., liver, muscle, and pharyngeal jaw). The ligand-receptor pair Edn1 andEdnrAa are co-expressed craniofacial (i.e., mandible, and pharyngeal jaw) with athree-fold increase of EdnrAa expression in the pharyngeal jaw, although up to three-fold in creases are also found in liver, muscle, maxilla, skin, and anal n (Fig. 2a). The combination ofEdn3b andEdnrB1a expression is found in the pigment containing tissues (i.e., skin and n tissues), for which also the highest levels of Edn3b expression were detected (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, all genes that are expressed in the anal n are also expressed in both egg-spot tissue and non-egg-spot tissue. Sequencing Results and Orthology AssessmentThe total length of the captured regions for EdnrAa was 963 bp (of which 246 bp were protein coding (cod)), 2091 bp (528 bp cod) for EdnrB1a ,2 4 4 9b p( 5 4 0b pc o d ) forEdn1 ,a n d5 1 2b p( 1 9 5b pc o d )f o r Edn3b (see Table 1).

For both analyses, juveniles were used as reference sample (Rf) and Actin as endogenous control. Error bars indicate the maximum and minimum expression levels determined by a 95% condence is more closely related to their teleost orthologs than to other teleost par- alogs (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). This indicates that the obtained cichlid sequences are indeed the presumed endothelin genes. Phylogenetic AnalysisThe wds consensus Bayesian phylogenies (BAY) with ML bootstrap values and BAY posterior probabilities aredepicted in Supplementary Fig. 3a-e. In most data sets, both ML and BAY methods revealed a similar topology that is largely in agreement with available species trees(Salzburger et al. 2002, 2005, 2007). This topology consists of and Trematocarini being placed in a basal position with respect to the substrate spawning Salzburger et al. 2002, 2005; Takahashi 2003). Although, relationships between tribes are generally not recovered by the individual gene trees (e.g., Edn3b tree; Supplementary Fig. 3c), the data sets do contain an ade-quate amount of phylogenetic signal to group members of a tribe together. This is further conrmed by the moderate to high support values for the monophyly of the major lin-eages, while support was typically low for many interspe- cic relationships\u2014reflecting a limited number of variable sites and in the case of Edn3b a small size of the data set(ca. 500 bp). As in previous phylogenetic analyses, the position of Eretmodus cyanostictus remains unclear (Clabaut et al. 2005; Day et al. 2008; Salzburger et al. 2002); either unresolved as part of a major polytomy (Supplementary Fig. 3b-d) or even at a derived position within theC-lineage (Supplementary Fig. 3a). A similar observation was made for Cyprichromis leptosoma; a position as sistergroup to the perissodines was alternated with polytomous positions and even a position within the Lamprologines in the Edn1 phylogeny. Although this clustering was not supported by the cod and noncod analyses (data notshown), the same signal was retrieved when the wds was re-analyzed in parts of 800 bp, indicating that convergence via, e.g., lateral gene transfer or an hybridization eventcould have occurred. Segregating Sites and K a/KsValues The number of segregating sites ( S) and the Ka/Ksvalues for each of the studied loci are depicted in Table 1. The lowest value for Swas observed for the EdnrB1a cod data set, while the EdnrB1a wds data set was characterized by the highest value for this parameter.

If the latter is the case, differences in the strength of the selection pressurebetween lineages are to be expected, especially for the Edn3b/EdnrB1a pathway, since not all species possess egg- spots and/or colorful body patterns. Table 2summarizes the results of the various tests that were performed to infer sites and/or lineages under non-neutral evolution. Negatively selected sites were found in all loci. None of the LRT's of the PAML (BEB) and Selecton analyses for the endothelin family members weresignicant, suggesting that these loci evolved under puri- fying selection. Trends toward signicance were found for EdnrAa and Edn1 with Selecton; while with NEB in PAML 23 and 15 positively selected sites were identied forEdn1 andEdn3b , respectively. Positive selected branches were found with HyPhy for all loci except EdnrAa (Table 2). In EdnrAa , only one species ( C. macrops around zero in EdnrB1a except for three Tropheini/Haplochromini species (L. labiatus ,S. and C. frontosa, for which elevated dn/dsratios were detected. Nonetheless, other species of the Tropheini and Perissodini did not show elevated dn/ds ratios. In the branch-specic PAML analysis, no signs ofpositive selection were found in EdnrB1a. Besides species-specic increases of K a/Ksand dn/ds ratios the analysis of the Edn1 data set also showed line- age-specic increases. All major branches towards the derived clades showed increased Ka/Ksanddn/dsratios. Both lineage and species-specic increases of Ka/Ksand dn/dsratios were also found in Edn3b . Again severalinternal branches showed increased Ka/Ksanddn/dsratios. The results for the internal branches were not unambiguous due to incongruent results of the separate analyses. The Perissodini were the only clade that consistently showedthe same strong signal (i.e., positive selection) in all analyses. Furthermore, the Edn3b sequences of the following species showed signs of positive selection; G. permaxillaris ,N. pulcher ,B. microlepis ,T. nigrifrons S. diagramma andP. curvifrons . Sliding Window Analysis The results of the sliding window analyses are depicted in Fig. 4.For EdnrAa there is only one region found with elevated omega values ( K a/Ks) in all analyzed groups. Two regions of weakly elevated omega values were observedfor EdnrB1a. It seems that the Haplochromini have the highest omega value at the rst peak, while the second peak is found in more groups (i.e., the two outgroup spe-cies, Haplochromini, Lamprologini, and Perissodini). Nonsynonymous the transmembrane and the extracellular and cytoplasmicdomains of both the endothelin receptors (see also Sup- plementary Table 3). For the Edn1 and Edn3b data sets, several peaks were identied in the preproendothelin for which all groups surveyed show elevated omega values for at least one ofthese peaks. In all groups, we have found species or line- age-specic nonsynonymous substitutions that coincide with these peaks. For both endothelins, the highest scoresare found for the outgroup species T. polylepis . Further- more, the results for the Perissodini show strong peaks,caused by two lineage-specic substitutions. One remark-able nonsynonymous substitution is found in E. cyanos- tictus ; a transversion led to a Threonine-Serine substitution at the second amino acid position of the functional protein.A Serine at this position is also observed in the Edn1, 2, and 4 proteins. Discussion In this study, we investigated the molecular evolution of two endothelin ligand-receptor pairs (Edn1-EdnrAa and Edn3b-EdnrB1a) in East African cichlid shes. We per- formed a variety of phylogenetic and molecular analyses ina set of 26 species and assessed the expression of the genes under study in twelve different tissues of a reference spe- cies. Here we discuss our results with respect to theobserved gene expression pattern, selection pressure, and their functional and evolutionary implications.Table 2 Overview of selection pressure on sites 0 2 Ectodini 0 2 Lamprologini 0 10 23 43 63 83 103 123 143 310 330 350 370 390 410 430 462 482 502 522 T.polylepis 0 3 Haplochromini 0 10 Perissodini 0 2 Lamprologini 0 10 13 23 33 52 62 72 82 92 102 112 122 132 142 152 162 172 182 187 Outgroup 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260 280 300 320 340 360 380 400 420 440 460 480 500 520 540 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260 280 300 320 340 360 380 400 420 440 460 480 500 520 0 0.6 Haplochromini 0 0.6 Ectodini 0 0.6 Lamprologini 0 3 58 67 77 87 97 107 117 127 137 147 157 167 177 187 197 207 217 227 235 Outgroup 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190 200 210 220 230 240 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260 280 300 320 340 360 380 400 420 440 460 480 500 520 0 0.4 115 135 155 175 195 215 235 255 275 295 315 335 355 375 395 415 435 455 475 495 515 Outgroup 0 0.4 Haplochromini 0 0.4 Lamprologini 0 0.4 Big Edn1 Preproendothelin1 \u00a4 Edn3b Preproendothelin3b TM VI TM VII ED ID ID TM III TM IV TM V TM VI TM VI ED ID ED ED Fig. 4 Sliding window plots of the endothelin ligands or receptors Species-specic nonsynonymous substitutions are displayed by lled circles in the sliding window plots, while lled triangles depict lineage-specic nonsynonymous substitutions.

Most studied and described functions of the endo-thelin system are related to the blood pressure regulation functions of Edn1 in adult vertebrates (e.g., Yanagisawa et al. 1988) and the functions during early development of neural crest derivatives (e.g., Miller et al. 2000; Parichy et al. 2000). Yet, the endothelin system is not limited to vasoconstriction or early development, since several neuralcrest derivatives such as pigmentation and the (dentition on the cichlids') pharyngeal jaws are produced and maintained throughout adulthood. Here we show that the two endo-thelin pathways under study are differently expressed in the pharyngeal jaw apparatus and anal n egg-spots. We nd are co-expressed in the anal n and egg-spot tissue (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 1). This isin agreement with previously described endothelin func-tions: EdnrB1 /EdnrB2 duplicates and Edn3 are known to be involved in pigmentation in a range of vertebratesincluding zebrash (e.g., Parichy et al. 2000; Pla correlation between Edn1 ,EdnrA dupli- cates and the pharyngeal bone development has zebrash (Kimmel et al. 2003; Pla and Larue2003). Deciphering the Selection Pressure Acting Upon the Endothelin Family Members in Cichlids Patterns of DNA sequence variation are important indica- tors of the mode of selection acting upon a locus. In par- ticular, the ratio of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site ( K a) to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site ( Ks) is considered a powerful tool in the study of adaptive evolution (Hughes 1997). Under neu-trality synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions areassumed to occur at equal rates, resulting in a ratio close to one. Purifying selection will remove deleterious mutations, thus, leading to a decrease of the K a/Ksratio, while positive selection will favor advantageous mutations, which is characterized by a Ka/Ksratio exceeding one. Theory pre- dicts that both positive and purifying selection can occur after gen(om)e duplication events. Although the fate of most duplicated genes is nonfunctionalization (e.g., Ohno 1970; Zhang 2003), models of adaptive evolution by gene duplication (Hughes 1999) predict that soon after a dupli-cation event positive selection acts on mutations that leadto new or enhanced functions (i.e., neofunctionalization).Subsequently, once having evolved, these functions aremaintained by purifying selection acting at the gene level. Neofunctionalization is, however, not the only outcome that leaves a signature of purifying selection in the genesafter a duplication event. Selection against deleterious mutations could also occur subsequent to subfunctional- ization. Subfunctionalization is known to have paralogs, which have partially redun- dant functions during lower jaw formation (Nair et al.2007). Here we show that the endothelin ligand and receptor family members evolved under purifying selection. Inter-estingly, substantial variation between loci was observed in theK a/Kscomparisons. While we detected very low Ka/Ks values for the two endothelin receptors, the two endothelin ligands showed elevated rates (Table 1), even when com- pared to genome wide comparisons between two mouthb- rooding species from Lake Tanganyika (Fig. 3). Theaccelerated rate of protein evolution observed in the ligands is similar to what has been observed for bmp4 by Terai et al. (2002b). In both type of genes, the variation accounting for the elevated rate of protein evolution is not observed in the functional protein domain, but rather in the pro-domain/preproendothelin parts. Therefore, the matureproteins are likely to be functional, although posttransla- tional regulation or cleavage efciency could have been affected (see next section; Terai et al. 2002b). Implications on the Functional Level of Endothelins and Their Receptors in Cichlids As mentioned before, the extracellular section and loops of the endothelin receptors are used for ligand binding, whileinteraction with the G protein takes place at the intracel- lular loops (Masaki et al. 1999; Orry and Wallace 2000). The extracellular part can be further divided into an''address'' (ligand-receptor selectivity) and a ''message'' (ligand-receptor binding) part (Masaki et al. 1999; Sakamoto et al. 1993). In both endothelin receptors understudy, almost all non-synonymous changes (detected in macrops and O. tanganicae ) were conned the ''address'' region. The additional substitution in EdnrB1a (specic for A. burtoni ) concerns the cytoplasmic part (G protein interaction). Thus, most changes in theendothelin receptors of cichlids are found in the partsresponsible for ligand-receptor interaction, supporting the co-evolution theory of Braasch et al. (2009). The majority of the changes in the ligands affected the preproendothelin part with only two exceptions: one sub-stitution occurred in the big endothelin 1 of N. furcifer and one in the Edn3b mature protein part of E. cyanostictus . This last substitution is found at the second amino acid ofthe mature protein, a site that is also variable among other364 J Mol Evol (2011) 73:355-368 123 29endothelins (Braasch et al. 2009 ). A serine at this position is commonly observed in the Edn1, 2, and 4 proteins among teleost and other vertebrates, but\u2014so far\u2014not in any of the Edn3 duplicates. Because of the particular way of protein maturation (preproendothelin [big endothelin [endothelin), it might be speculated that the observed mutations in the prepro-endothelin part could affect posttranslational regulation. At least for endothelin 1 , it is known that the regulation is ultimately controlled by the rate of transcription. Cis-acting elements both in the promoter and further upstream, epi- genetic mechanisms and several other types of regulatoryinteractions (e.g., calcium levels, extracellular hypertonic- ity) do play an important role, too (reviewed in Stow et al. 2011). It was further shown that several regulatory inter-actions take place directly on the Edn1 mRNA (e.g., through GAPDH, microRNA), which can either be stimu-lating or repressing (Stow et al. 2011). The observed changes in the preproendothelin parts could\u2014in principle\u2014also affect the cleaving process. Wefound that the pairs of basic amino acids, where the actualcleavage takes place, stay unaffected in cichlids. However, substitutions in the preproendothelin part could still affect the efciency of cleavage and with that the concentrationof the mature protein (the mature protein itself stays unaffected and would function normally). Denite con- clusions about the functional effects of the nonsynonymouschanges can, however, only be made on the basis of functional assays (e.g., Hoekstra et al. 2006). Evolutionary Implications The pharyngeal jaw apparatus and anal n egg-spots are two putative evolutionary key innovations of cichlids. A key innovation is a novel trait in evolution that enables the exploitation of new niches and, hence, could initiateadaptive radiation (Gavrilets and Losos 2009; Schluter 2000; Simpson 1953). In this way, the trait is directly responsible for the evolutionary success of a radiatinggroup. Little is known, however, about how the relation- ship between trait evolution and organismal diversication is reflected in the genes and genetic pathways underlyingsuch innovations. Often it is assumed that genes underlying (ecologically) important traits show signs of non-neutral evolution. In cichlids, for example, the downstream colorgene csf1ra , which is expressed in egg-spots, appears to have evolved adaptively in the direct ancestor of the egg-spot bearing haplochromines (Salzburger et al. 2007). An accelerated protein evolution has also been found in bmp4 , which is involved in (pharyngeal) bone formation (Fraseret al. 2009; Terai et al. 2002b). It is unclear how common such signatures of positive selection are in the genes underlying evolutionary innovations. Obviously, manymore genes are likely to be involved in the evolution of a novel trait than the single/few positively selected genes in the above-mentioned examples. Also, in cases where genes underlying a novel trait are part of a conservative pathwaythat is co-opted, one would expect a signature of purifying rather than positive selection. This scenario could have happened with the endothelin family members. Forinstance, when the conserved pathway involved in the development of neural crest-derived tissues was co-opted during the evolution of key innovations in cichlid shes. Speciation and organismal diversication can be greatly facilitated by the concurrent action of natural and sexualselection. This is particularly the case when an ecologically important, hence naturally selected trait, is at the same time the target of mate choice. In sticklebacks, for example, ithas been shown that body size, which is influenced by the foraging habitat, also acts as trigger in mate preference (Hateld and Schluter 1999; Nagel and Schluter 1998).Feulner et al. (2009) suggested that the electric organ discharge of weakly electric sh is a magic trait serving for both electrolocation (foraging) and mate recognition (matechoice). Another single trait that is both under disruptive natural selection and acts as a cue for assortative mating is the color patterns of the coral reef shes of the genusHypoplectrus (Puebla et al. 2007 ). Just as natural and sexua l selection are both affecting a single trait in these examples, the endothelin family as awhole might be affected by both natural and sexual selection. The endothelin family members, thus, form a link between a naturally selected trait (mouth morphology,including the pharyngeal jaws) and a sexually selected one (coloration)\u2014via their underlying genes and genetic path- ways. This makes the endothelin gene family a strongcandidate for a more thorough functional, developmental, and evolutionary examination in cichlid shes. Conclusions In this work, we studied the molecular evolution of two ligand-receptor pairs of the endothelin system (Edn1/Ed- nrAa and Edn3b/EdnrB1a) in a representative set of 26East African cichlid species. Sequences of the endothelin family members show signs of purifying selection in cichlids, a common force observed after gen(om)e dupli-cation events. The two ligands show an accelerated rate of protein evolution in comparison to the receptors, most likely caused by the highly variable preproendothelin parts.No evidence was found for one of the endothelin pathways to have evolved under positive selection in one or more lineages. While the amino acids of the mature endothelinsare rather conserved in cichlids, the Evol (2011) 73:355-368 365 123 30We also found several changes in the endothelin receptors that could possibly affect the ligand-receptor binding functions. Future functional studies should test these hypotheses. Expression pattern analyses conrm that Edn1/EdnrAa are co-expressed at a relatively high expression level in the pharyngeal jaw tissue, whereas Edn3b/EdnrB1a at relatively high levels in skin and anal n tissue(including the anal n egg-spots). Because of their pated function during the morphogenesis of the (pharyn- geal) jaw apparatus and coloration and pigmentation, the endothelin gene family members form an important link between these naturally and sexually selected traits incichlids.

The diverse and species-rich lineage of teleost fishes is a renowned example of this scenario, because of the fish-specific genome duplication. Gene families, generated by this and other gene duplication events, have been previously found to play a role in the evolution and development of innovations in cichlid fishes - a prime model system to study the genetic basis of rapid speciation, adaptation and evolutionaryinnovation. The distal-less homeobox genes are particularly interesting candidate genes for evolutionary novelties, such as the pharyngeal jaw apparatus and the anal fin egg-spots. Here we study the dlxrepertoire in 23 East African cichlid fishes to determine the rate of evolution and the signatures of selection pressure. Results: Four intact dlxclusters were retrieved from cichlid draft genomes. Phylogenetic analyses of these eight dlxloci in ten teleost species, followed by an in-depth analysis of 23 East African cichlid species, show that there is disparity in the rates of evolution of the dlxparalogs. Dlx3a and dlx4b are the fastest evolving dlxgenes, while dlx1a and dlx6a evolved more slowly. Subsequent analyses of the nonsynonymous-synonymous substitution rate ratios indicate thatdlx3b ,dlx4a and dlx5a evolved under purifying selection, while signs of positive selection were found for dlx1a ,dlx2a , dlx3a and dlx4b the dlxrepertoire of teleost fishes and cichlid fishes in particular, is shaped by differential selection pressures and rates of evolution after gene duplication. Although the divergence of the dlx paralogs are putative signs of new or altered functions, comparisons with available expression patterns indicate that the three dlxloci under strong purifying selection, dlx3b ,dlx4a and dlx5a , are transcribed at high levels in the cichlids ' pharyngeal jaw and anal fin. The dlxparalogs emerge as excellent candidate genes for the development of evolutionary innovations in cichlids, although further functional analyses are necessary to elucidate their respective contribution. Keywords: Distal-less homeobox gene, Molecular evolution, Cichlid fishes, Teleost fishes, Positive selection, Differential selection, Gene duplication, dN/dS Background Teleost fishes (Teleostei) are among the most diverse lineages on Earth and with nearly 30,000 species the most species-rich vertebrate group. This is in stark contrast to the more basal non-teleost ray-finned fishes that arecharacterized by small number s of species.

It has been hypothesized that the FSGDhas laid down the genetic conditions necessary for the evolution of phenotypic diversity [5], although the exact causes of diversification of such a large clade are likely tobe more complex and most probably also include other factors [6]. The Hox gene clusters, which evolved through both tan- dem and whole genome duplications, represent illustra-tive examples for the contribution of duplicated genes to morphological evolution across the animal kingdom(see e.g., [7-9]).

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2013, 13:153 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/13/153 43Hox genes play a crucial role in the development of the multicellular body plan (e.g., anterior-posterior pat- terning; [10]). Furthermore, Hox genes are known to beinvolved in the development of evolutionary novelties, such as walking limbs and the wings of insects [11-15]. It has been shown that different mechanisms such as cis- regulatory evolution, changes in protein function and post- transcriptional regulation of the Hox genes contribute to morphological diversification (reviewed in e.g., [8,15,16]). East African cichlid fishes show a remarkable level of phenotypic diversity between closely related species andconstitute the most diverse adaptive radiations known[17-21]. Although several smaller radiations of cichlid fishes exist outside of Africa (e.g., in Central and South America), an astonishingly high number of cichlid species (close to1900 species [22]) evolved in and around lakes Malawi, Victoria and Tanganyika in the last few million to several thousand years [23,24]. The various cichlid species differin body shape, coloration, reproductive biology and mouth morphology [25-27] - traits which are thought to, at least partly, underlie the evolutionary success of cichlidfishes [18,27,28]. Furthermore , several morphological inno- vations are unique to cichlids o r specific lineages thereof. The highly modified and morphological diverse pharyngealjaw apparatus, for example, correlates with the diversity in foraging strategies exploited by the different cichlid species [27-29]. The occurrence of several color morphs withinspecies, sexual color dimorphism and anal fin egg-spots are three characteristic features of the extremely species- rich and mouthbrooding haplochromine lineage [30]. As a result of their great phenotypic diversity and high number of species, cichlid fishes provide an ideal set upto examine the genetic basis of rapid speciation, evolu-tionary innovations and adaptation [21,31-37]. An import- ant strategy is the study of so-called candidate genes, i.e., genes with known functions in development in otherorganisms such as zebrafish. For example, it has been shown that csf1ra , which was identified as xanthophore marker in zebrafish [38,39] is involved in the morpho- of the egg-spots of haplochromine cichlids [31]. Furthermore, species-specific jaw shapes of different cich- lid species correlate with differences in early bmp4 ex- pression patterns, a gene which has also the potential tochange the mandibular morphology in zebrafish [40].Many of these candidate genes belong to larger gene families such as the endothelin family of ligands and re- ceptors that are putatively involved in the morphogen-esis of the pharyngeal jaw apparatus and pigmentation [36], and the above mentioned Hox gene clusters [41]. Recently, Renz et al. [35] characterized seven distal-less homeobox (dlx) genes and examined their expression pat- terns in the developing pharyngeal arches and/or haplochromine cichlid The vertebrate dlxgenes are widely known for theircrucial roles in the development (of components) of the nervous system, craniofacial skeleton and connective tis- sue and in the formation of appendages [reviewed in 42].These functions seem to be conserved across a wide range of animal taxa. For example, the vertebrate dlxgenes are homologs of, and share several functions with, the single Distal-less (dll)g e n eo f Drosophila dlx homologs is similarin early development [35,42-45]. At the same time, dlx genes have been implicated with evolutionary novelties such as the eyespots in various butterfly species [46-48], the insect antenna [49,50] vertebrate dlxgenes suggest that the extant dlxrepertoire has evolved by an initial tandem duplica- tion, followed by two rounds of whole genome duplica-tion in the lineage towards vertebrates and a third one inthe lineage towards teleost fishes, the FSGD [35,44,45,52]. These duplication events resulted in multiple so-called dlx clusters, in which two dlxgenes are located in a tail-to-tail arrangement on the respective chromosome. Linked dlx genes are transcribed coincidently due to shared cis- regulating elements in the intergenic regions [35,42,43]. Four of these dlxclusters fied in the cichlid A.burtoni , where they are expressed in tissues that make up putative evo lutionary innovations [35]. Here, we analyzed the dlxrepertoire and diversity in detail in a phylogenetically representative set of 23 East African cichlid species in order to study the molecular evolution of this prominent developmental gene family.To this end, we first performed phylogenetic compari- sons of the dlx proteins including the sixty amino acids long homeobox domain in a range of teleost fishes incombination with blast search es of these sequences against the draft genomes of four cichlid species. Teleost andcichlid-specific phylogenies were examined to comparethe rate of evolution of both between and within dlx gene trees. Several studies have shown that loci putativelyinvolved in evolutionary innovations are characterized by adaptive protein evolution in cichlids [31,36,53]. There- fore, all loci were screened for elevated rates of proteinevolution by means of d N/dSanalyses.

Methods Dlx protein al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2013, 13:153 Page obtained from Ensemble (release 68, July 2012; see Additional file 1 for accession numbers). Dlx2b was excluded from all further analyses, due to its lineage-specific loss in percomorphs, to which all studied speciesbelong except D. rerio and G. morhua (see [35]). Se- quences were aligned with Tcoffee [54,55], were and tblastx searches were unpublished see Additional file 1 for scaffold numbers). To deter- mine the rate of evolution for each of the dlx proteins, phylogenetic analyses were performed in PAUP* 4.0 [56]under parsimony settings and the number of amino acid changes was obtained. D. rerio orG. morhua was used as outgroup species and bootstrap analyses with 100 replicates were conducted to test the robustness of the obtained topologies. Next, the sixty amino acids long homeobox domain was extracted from the sequences and alignedto the homeobox domain of [Ensemble: FBgn0000157] [57] for closer inspection of the con-servation of the domain and to identify gene-specific substitutions. Cichlid samples and genomic DNA sequencing White muscle and/or fin clip samples were collected during fieldwork in Zambia in 2007 and 2008 using astandard operating procedure described in [29]. In total 23 Lake Tanganyikan cichlid species were included in this study (Additional file 2). Genomic DNA was extractedfollowing a standard Proteinase K protocol [58]. Cichlid- specific PCR primers were designed on available and/or draft genomic and transcriptomic cichlid sequences,which were identified by tblastx searches of publicly available dlxsequences from other teleost species (see Additional file 1 for species and accession numbers). This was done for primer sequences). Standard PCR reactions, purifi-cation steps and sequencing reactions were set up and performed as described elsewhere [36]. PCR products of the partially sequenced loci were GelRed(Biotium) on xlcapillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Partial sequences inspected using Codon Code Aligner 3.7.1 (CodonCode Corporation, Dedham, MA). Exon/intron boundaries were determined by hom- ology comparisons with the sequences from the otherteleost species. All generated cichlid dlxsequences have been deposited into GenBank [GenBank: KC285366-KC285546] (Additional file 2). Phylogenetic analyses of cichlid samples Individual gene trees were constructed using maximum likelihood in PAUP* 4.0 [56] and Bayesian model of nucleotidesubstitution was determined with the corrected Akaike information criteria and likelihood ratio tests conducted in jModeltest 0.1.1 [61,62]. Bootstrap analyses with 100replicates were performed MrBayes was run for 10.500.000 generations. Oreochromis Phylogenetic ana- lysis of a concatenated dataset of 9.2 kb was performed as described above in PAUP* to generate a common in- put tree file (treeBASE submission 14433) for the subse-quent analyses. Coding sequence data of the 23 cichlid species (treeBASE submission 14433) was assessed with both site- and branch-site models as implemented in the program Codeml of the software package PAML (Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood) 4.3 [64,65]. The following parame-ters were estimated for all eight dlxdatasets under differ- ent models: the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitutionrate ratio, , the proportion of sites assigned to an cat- egory, p 0,1,2,a n dt h e pandqparameters of the distri- bution. Tests of positively selected sites were conductedby performing Likelihood Ratio Tests (LRT) of the fol-lowing model comparisons: M1a (Nearly Neutral) with M2a (Positive Selection), M7 ( )w i t hM 8( & s1), and M8a ( &s= 1) with M8. The comparison between M0 (one-ratio) and M3 (discrete) was used as a test ofvariable among sites. The na\u00efve empirical Bayes empirical [68]) criteria were used to calculate the posterior probabilities for site classes and the BEB was used to identify sites under positive selection when the LRT was significant. To test whetherthedlxgenes evolved under non-neutral evolution in spe- cific lineages a LRT between the null model ( s=1 ) a n d the alternative model ( s1) was performed in the branch- site analyses. Branches of interest, or so-called foreground branches, were chosen based on the results of the phylo- genetic analyses and branch tests performed in Hyphy([69], following [36]). Additional tests of positive selection on the partial dlx sequences were performed with the Sitewise LikelihoodRatio estimation of selection program (SLR; [70]) v1.3. The common input tree file was used (see above) and the significance level was set to 95%. Amino acid substitutions were screened for possible ef- fect on protein function with the program SIFT (SortingIntolerant from Tolerant; [71].Diepeveen et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2013, 13:153 Page 3 of 12 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/13/153 45Results Dlx protein sequence comparison in teleost fishes The tblastx searches of the teleost dlx proteins resulted in the retrieval of eight dlxgenes in all four cichlid spe- cies. Furthermore, the genomic locations of these dlx loci (Additional file 1) indicate that four dlxclusters other teleost species examined contain this full set of genes, except zebrafish,in which dlx3a could not be located, and medaka, in which dlx4b is missing, as previously noted [35,44,45]. Interestingly, in contrast to Renz et al. [35] we do find evidence for the existence of dlx3a in cichlids, including A. burtoni (Figure 1, Additional file 4). The sixty amino acid long homeobox domain of the eight teleost dlx proteins are highly conserved among teleost fish and even between teleosts and the single Dll protein of D. melanogaster (Additional file 4). Despite the high level of conservation, several locus-specific amino acid substitutions are present in the paralogs, making itpossible to distinguish between individual dlx homeo-box domains. Phylogenetic analyses of the dlx protein sequences were performed to examine the rate of evolution of the dlxparalogs in teleost fishes. The overall and relative longest trees were found for dlx4b anddlx3a , while for dlx1a and dlx6a the shortest tree lengths were observed (Figure 1 and Table 1). Typically the longest branches were observedin the two basal species D. rerio andG. morhua .I n t e r e s t - ingly, relatively long branch lengths for the branch towards the four cichlid species were observed for dlx3a anddlx6a , indicting elevated rates of molecular evolution.

The gene trees of the obtained partial cichlid dlxsequences resulted in various polytomies (Additional file 5), probably due to the limited size of some of the datasets (minimum of 0.7 kb). Although for each gene tree specific branches were observed with relative long branches, there is not a particular species or clade thathas evolved under faster rates of evolution in all of the dlxloci examined. Interestingly, three branches have relative long branch lengths in multiple topologies: the branch towards (dlx1a and dlx6a ). The relative tree lengths (Additional file 5 and Table 2) of these gene trees reveal similar results as the teleost protein trees, with dlx4b anddlx3a evolving fastest and dlx1a anddlx6a evolving more slowly. Observed signatures of selection pressure in cichlid dlxloci To investigate signatures of selection pressure in the dlx loci, we performed detailed analyses of the dN/dSratios. Maximum likelihood parameter estimations for ,p0,1,2 andpandqunder different evolutionary models can be found in Table 3 for all eight dlxloci. Estimations of under the M0 model suggest that the dlxgenes evolved under purifying selection dlx2a ). A of sites,0.00001-24.2%, was estimated to have evolved neutrally(= 1) under the M1a model. By using models that allow to vary among sites, 0.7-12.3% of sites was detected with >1i n dlx1a ,dlx2a ,dlx3a ,dlx4b and dlx6a .O v e r a l l , most sites are estimated to have evolved under purifying selection, with highest proportions found in dlx3b ,dlx4a anddlx5a . Likelihood ratio tests of the subsequent model com- parisons (Table 4) resulted in the rejection of the nullmodels in only the following comparisons per loci: dlx1a (all four comparisons), dlx3a (M0-M3; M8a-M8) and dlx4b (all four comparisons). Positively selected sites were detected with the BEB in dlx2a (5 sites), dlx3a (1 site) and dlx4b (3 sites; see Table 4, Figure 2). The less constraining analyses with the NEB resulted in twomore putative positively selected sites in dlx1a (1) and dlx2a (1; Figure 2). Fewer positively selected sites were the LTRs of the branch-site analyses were significant (1 p0.20) indicating that although the ratios do vary among sites (see above), the ratios do not vary significantly among lineages. Amino acid substitutions and their predicted effect on function Next, the individual amino acid substitutions were ex- amined in more detail. The total protein length and the number of amino acid substitutions per locus are shown in Table 5 (see also Figure 2 and Additional file 6). Arelative large number of substitutions was observed in dlx2a (13), dlx3a (16) and dlx4b (10), while in dlx5a no substitution was found. Most of the amino acid substitu- tions are species-specific (i.e., observed in a single species), although lineage-specific substitutions the observed amino acid substitutions have a predicted effect on theprotein functions (see Tabl e 5), although two substitu- tions were observed in the homeobox domain of dlx2a (Figure 2). Selection regimes on the dlxclusters It is known that the paired members of each of the fourdlxclusters (Additional file 4) are transcribed concur- rently [35,42-45]. To characterize if the members of the same dlxcluster evolved at similar rates and under simi- lar selection regimes, we had a closer inspection of these paired genes. First, the teleost dlx protein and cichlid gene trees show that overall and relative tree lengths (or the rate of evolution) differ between the two genes withina cluster. Loci with the highest ( dlx3a : dlx1a : 0.366/0.483 and dlx6a : 0.227/0.542) tree lengths are never observedTable 1 Overall and relative tree lengths of teleost protein phylogenies dlx paralog Length (# amino 254 93 0.439 dlx6a 247 56 0.227 Table 2 Overall and relative tree lengths of cichlid dlx gene trees dlx paralog Length (# 13:153 Page 5 of 12 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/13/153 47Table 3 Site model parameter estimates generated by the CodeML analyses for the eight dlxparalogs Locus Parameter estimates under different models M0 proportions of sites assigned to an category or to a beta distribution with p and q as parameters. ratios greater than one and their corresponding proportions are depicted in bold.Diepeveen et al.

Furthermore, the mode of selec- tion seems to differ between members of the same dlx clusters as well. While strong purifying selection wasobserved for dlx4a dlx3a and dlx6a show sign of elevated -values. A notable exception to this observation is the dlx1a-dlx2a cluster. For both genes a proportion of sites was found with elevated -values (note that the propor- tion is considerably bigger for dlx2a ). These observations indicate that although clusters are transcribed concur- rently, selection seems to act on the individual gene level rather than on the level of the dlxgene clusters. Also the observed patterns are not in concordance with the two groups of homeobox domains that emerged from the initial tandem duplication (see [52] and Additional file 4). Discussion In this work, we present a detailed evolutionary charac-terization of the dlxgene repertoire in East African cichlid fishes. Previously, Renz et al. [35] studied the embryonic expression patterns of dlxgenes in cichlids and showed that they are expressed in e.g., the developing jaw appar- atus and anal fin, tissues that contribute to two putative evolutionary innovations: the pharyngeal jaw and theegg-spots on the anal fin of the cichlid A. burtoni . Here, we study the molecular evolution of dlxgenes in a rep- resentative set of 23 East African cichlid species. Weperformed comparative phylogenetic analyses and de- tailed screens of nonsynonymous-synonymous substitu- tion rate ratios to determine the selective pressure actingupon these candidate genes for evolutionary novelties in cichlid fishes. Dlx3a did not get lost in the cichlid lineage Our phylogenetic analyses of dlx proteins extends previous analyses (e.g., [35]) by the inclusion of cod [72] and fourdifferent cichlid A. burtoni andP. nyererei ; BROAD Institute). Although our results agree with most of the available hypotheseson the evolutionary loss of dlxgenes in specific teleost lineages (i.e., dlx3a in zebrafish and dlx4a in medaka), we did detect dlx3a in cichlids and thus refute the cichlid-specific gene loss hypothesis of dlx3a put forward by Renz et al. [35]. Not only were we able to locate this gene in all four cichlid genomes examined (Additionalfile 1), we also gathered partial gene sequences for this locus in all 23 cichlid species included (Additional files 4 and 6). Furthermore, in-house tblastx searches of thisnewly identified paralog against preliminary cichlid EST libraries (BROAD Institute, unpublished data) resulted in multiple hits, providing proof of its expression in -at least - Astatotilapia to gene duplication events Gene-wide estimates of the dN/dSratios indicate that all loci evolved under purifying selection ( < 1), indicating strong selection against deleterious mutations, commonlyobserved in functional proteins. Additional analyses ofindividual codons indicate that the sequenced regions dlx5a evolved under purifying selec- tion, while positive selection acting on specific codons was detected for a small proportion of sites (i.e., up to 12%) for dlx1a ,dlx2a ,dlx3a and dlx4b (i.e., a smaller number of positively selected sites was found with more stringent SLR analyses for dlx2a ,dlx3a and dlx4b ). Plausible reasons for the excess of nonsynonymous muta-tions in these loci are either lowered functional constraintsor directional selection, as Sumiyama and colleagues sug- gested for Dlx7 in mouse [73]. Different modes of selec- tion are thus found to have acted on the dlxparalogs in cichlids after the genome duplication events. Differential selection after gen(om)e duplication is a commonly observed phenomenon and is associated with the fate of the gene duplicates i.e., non-, sub- or neofunc- tionalization. Sub- and neofunctionalization are adaptive processes by which either spatial or temporal partitioningof the ancestral function or the evolution of complete new functions take place [5,74-76]. While ancestral functions can be maintained by retaining the protein sequences andpreventing deleterious mutations through purifying selec- tion, relaxed selection on the other duplicate can lead to the introduction of mutations and subsequent divergenceTable 4 Likelihood ratio test (LTR) statistics of site model comparisons for dlx1a ,dlx2a ,dlx3a and dlx4b Locus M8 comparison LRT values, p-values and positively selected sites identified by the BEB (p < 0.01 (in bold) and p < 0.05 (in italic); CodeML) are shown.Diepeveen et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2013, 13:153 Page 7 of 12 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/13/153 49[5,75,76]. Most of these changes are deleterious and are followed by the loss of the gene over time (i.e., nonfunc- tionalization). On rare occasions the mutations can leadto an altered function of the protein (i.e., neofunctional- ization; change within the protein) or altered expression pattern (subfunctionalization; change in regulatory regions),which can be characterized by elevated values and the maintenance of the mutations results in divergence of thetwo duplicates.Many studies have focused on duplicated genes in rela- tion to divergence of duplicates (see e.g., [77-80] and refer-ences therein). An interesting case of subfunctionalizationwas described in leaf-eating Colobine monkeys, in which the pancreatic ribonuclease gene ( RNASE1 ), necessary to digest its specialized diet, was duplicated [81,82]. Al- though the two gene-products are used in the same process (i.e., digestion of b acterial RNA), the duplicate gene shows many substitutions, while the ancestral locusFigure 2 Secondary structure and positively selected sites for four partially sequenced Astatotilapia burtoni Dlx proteins.

Similar patterns of heterogeneity in amino acid substitutions or differential selection werealso observed by Dermitzakis and Clark [83] between duplicates of several developmental gene families (e.g., Notch ,Bmp and Hox9 ) in mouse and human. Interest- ingly, differential selection regimes acting on paralogs were also found in the murine Dlx3 -Dlx7 cluster, with Dlx7 evolving more rapidly than Dlx3 [73]. Our results of differential selection acting on the cichlid dlxparalogs are thus comparable to previously studied cases of du- plicated genes. We even detect a similar pattern asSumiyama et al. [73], with dlx4b evolving more rapidly than dlx3b (i.e., relative tree length 0.937 vs 0.609). The adaptive protein evolution as observed in dlx1a , dlx2a ,dlx3a and dlx4b together with the evolutionary history of the gene family, could thus be a sign of pos-sible new or altered functions of these dlxparalogs in cichlids. Although we did not observe amino acid substi- tutions with predicted apparent effect on the protein function in our partial sequences, other mechanisms, suchascis-regulatory evolution might have altered the expres- sion patterns after gene duplication. Gene expressionanalyses in cichlid and zebrafish indicate that clustersare often transcribed concurrently and that the dlxdu- plicates exhibit overlapping expression patterns in par-ticular during the development of brain and pharyngeal arches [35,44,45]. This co-expression of the dlxclusters is controlled through intergenic cis-regulatory regions [35,42,43]. While mutations in these regions are expectedto affect the expression of both paralogs, changes in the coding regions of the dlxloci are likely to affect the individual dlx locus 'function, which could lead to neofunctionalization. Selection pressure on dlxparalogs in relation to evolutionary innovations We found an interesting pattern comparing our dN/dS results with the expression patterns found by Renz et al.[35] in relation to evolutionary novelties in cichlids. In the developing pharyngeal teeth and the anal fin dlx3b, dlx4a (not in anal fin) and dlx5a , the exact loci for which we found strong patterns of purifying selection,are expressed at high levels. Although this observation seems to contradict other cases in which candidategenes showed accelerated rates of protein evolution (see [31,53,84]), they do not sta nd alone (see e.g., [36]). It has been shown that minor changes in the complex gen- etic pathways underlying the development of morpho- logical structures can lead to the evolution of novelties (see e.g., [85]). Furtherm ore, many cases of morpho- logical adaptation are driven by cis-regulatory evolution (reviewed in [86]). Several intergenic cis-regulatory ele- ments have been identified in dlxclusters in A. burtoni by Renz et al. [35], but the functional characterization in cichlids is yet to be performed. It is thus possible thatonly a small fraction of genes involved in the evolution-ary novelties in cichlids show signs of adaptive evolution and that the three dlxloci were co-opted for their an- cestral functions. According to Renz et al. [35], the five dlxgenes for which we found signatures of positive selection, are either not expressed at all or at low levels during pharyngealteeth and anal fin development in the cichlid A. burtoni . Low levels of gene expression were observed for dlx2a in the developing pharyngeal teeth in cichlids [35], whilehigher dlx2a expression levels in other teleost species [33,44,45]. Dlx4b and dlx6a expression has previously been shown in the developing pharyngealteeth of zebrafish and/or medaka [44,45], but has not been observed in cichlids (yet). Furthermore, multiple dlxgenes, including loci with signatures of positive selection, appear to be expressed in the developing anal fin tissue at time points coinciding with egg-spot development in A. burtoni (E. Santos, personal communicat ions). Therefore, it is likely that several dlxparalogs, for which we found signs of positive selection, are involved in the development of evolutionary innovations in cichlids, in contrast to theinitial findings of Renz et al. [35]. Future detailed and extended functional analyses should be conducted toelucidate their role in the development of these evolu- tionary important traits in cichlid fishes. Conclusions In this study, we provide an in depth molecular evolu-tionary analysis of the dlx gene repertoire in teleost fishes. We located and generated partial sequences for dlx3a in 23 East African cichlid species, refuting hy- pothesis of Renz et al. that dlx3a got lost in the cichlid lineage. Phylogenetic analyses of the teleost dlx gene repertoire show that substantial differences exist in the rate of evolution among teleost dlxparalogs. In addition, analyses of the nonsynonymous-synonymousTable 5 Amino acid substitution and their predicted effect on function for the eight cichlid dlxloci Locus L S E dlx1a 144 1 Tolerated dlx2a 255 13 Tolerated dlx3a 222 16 Tolerated dlx3b 160 4 Tolerated dlx4a 96 1 Tolerated dlx4b 167 10 Tolerated dlx5a 271 0 - dlx6a 236 2 Tolerated Length of obtained protein sequence (L), the number of amino acid substitutions (S) and the predicted effect of the substitutions on the functiongenerated by the SIFT analyses (E) are shown.Diepeveen et al.

Although differen- tial selection pressure after gene duplication is a puta- tive sign of new or altered functions, we observed a link between the dlxloci under strong purifying selection, in particular, and high expression levels in two cichlids 'nov- elties; the pharyngeal jaw and anal fin. This indicates thatother mechanisms than adaptive protein evolution arelikely to be involved in the co-option of these genes. Fur- thermore, several (preliminary) studies found that at least three other dlxparalogs, for which we found signs of positive selection, are actuall ye x p r e s s e di nt h ed e v e l o p i n g pharyngeal teeth and/or haplochromine anal fin. Hence,thedlxparalogs appear as candidate genes for the devel- opment of evolutionary innovations in cichlids, although further functional analyses should elucidate the role of positive selection therein.

Diepeveen,*,1,2Olivia Roth,and Walter Salzburger* *Zoological Institute, University of Basel, 4051 Basel, Switzerland, andEvolutionary Ecology of Marine Fishes, Helmholtz Centre of Ocean Research Kiel (GEOMAR), D-24105 Kiel, Germany ABSTRACT Immune-related genes are often characterized by a daptive protein evolution. Selection on immune genes can be particularly strong when hosts encounter novel parasites, for instance, after the colonization of a new habitat or upon the exploitation of vacant ecological niches in an adaptive radiation. We examined a setof new candidate immune genes in East African cichlid shes. More speci cally, we studied the signatures of selection in ve paralogs of the human immunode ciency virus type I enhancer-binding protein (Hivep )g e n e family, tested their involvement in the immune defense, and related our results to explosive speciation and adaptive radiation events in cichlids. We found signatures of long-term positive selection in four Hivep paralogs and lineage-speci c positive selection in Hivep3b in two radiating cichlid lineages. Exposure of the cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni to a vaccination with Vibrio anguillarum bacteria resulted in a positive correlation between immune response parameters and expression levels of three Hivep loci. This work provides the rst evidence for a role of Hivep paralogs in teleost immune defense and links the signatures of positive selection to host - pathogen interactions within an adaptive radiation.KEYWORDS positive selection immune response adaptive radiation molecular evolution The interplay between hosts and their parasites ( i.e., macroparasites, bacteria, and viruses) represents one of the strongest biological inter- actions (Haldane 1949). Pathogens impose strong selection pressureson their hosts and have the potential to rapidly change the genotypic composition of host populations, which may ultimately alter the struc- ture of entire ecosystems (Thompson 1988; Ebert and Hamilton 1996;Keesing et al. 2010). To counteract the permanently evolving pathogen virulence, hosts evolve resistance through diverse immune responsemechanisms (Hamilton 1980). These include the discrimination be-tween self and nonself, facilitating the recognition of pathogen-derivedepitopes (Altizer et al. 2003; Boots et al. 2008). Invertebrates andvertebrates share the architecture of the innate immune system, i.e., a conserved immediate defense mechanism including Toll-like recep-tors, lysozymes, and cellular defenses (Janeway et al. 2001). Immune memory, however, is the hallmark of the adaptive immune system of vertebrates (Cooper and Alder 2006; Flajnik and Kasahara 2010). somatic of receptors of immunoglobulin [ i.e., V(D)J recombination] mediates a matic the number of foreign pathogen epitopes that theadaptive immune system can remember and attack (Janeway et al. 1996; Zhu et al. 2012). Because of the constant interplay between host -parasite adaptation and counteradaption, immune genes are commonly characterized bysignatures of positive selection through elevated rates of adaptive pro-tein evolution (Hughes and Nei 1988; Hughes and Nei 1989; Jansa et al. 2003; Schlenke and Begun 2003; Sawyer et al. 2004; Nielsen et al. 2005; Jiggins and Kim 2007; Sackton et al. 2007; Tschirren et al. 2011). Selection on immune system diversi cation can be particularly strong when hosts encounter novel pathogens that induce primary immune challenges. This is the case after the colonization of a new habitat orupon the exploitation of vacant ecological niches (Scharsack et al. 2007; Matthews et al. 2010; Jones et al. 2012). For instance, it has been shown that migratory birds that encounter two or more differentparasite faunas have larger immune defense organs ( e.g., bursa and spleen) than closely related resident birds (M\u00f8ller and Erritz\u00f8e 1998). Freshwater sticklebacks differ in their immune competence potential depending on their ecotype ( e.g., lower parasite diversity in rivers thanCopyright \u00a9 2013 Diepeveen et al. doi: 10.1534/g3.113.008839 Manuscript received July 30, 2013; accepted for publication October 7, 2013; published Early Online October 18, 2013.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the CreativeCommons Attribution Unported License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ ), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Supporting information is available online at http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/ suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.113.008839/-/DC1All generated cichlid Hivep sequences have accession nos.

Given the recognized evolutionary importance of the immune system (Janeway et al. 2001; Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2012) and the range of available functional and theoretical knowledge, the next stepwould be to assess to which degree immune genes contribute to, oreven trigger, macroevolutionary events such as divergence, rapid spe-ciation, and adaptive radiation. East African cichlid shes are a classic example of adaptive radiation (Schluter 2000). Because of their great numbers of closelyrelated endemic species and their high levels of phenotypic and eco- logical diversity, cichlids are an important model system to study the genetic basis of diversi cation, adaption, and studies of cichlid adaptive radiations have mainly focused on the understanding of ecologically importanttraits (and their genetic basis), such as the feeding apparatus (Terai et al. 2002b; Albertson et al. 2005; Fraser et al. 2008; Fraser et al. 2009; Muschick et al. 2011; Muschick et al. 2012), as well as on sexually selected traits such as coloration and pigmentation (Terai et al. 2002a; Terai et al. 2003; Salzburger et al. 2007; Roberts et al. 2009). Fewer studies have addressed the evolution of the immune system or, more generally, physiology in relation to diversi cation and rapid speciation in cichlids (Blais et al. Gerrard and Meyer 2007; Dijkstra et al. 2011). Dijkstra et al. (2011), for example, showed that divergence in coloration is accompanied by differentiation in immune function inLake Victoria cichlids, and divergence in alleles of the MHC has pre- viously been proposed as trigger of speciation in Lake Malawian cichl- ids through MHC-mediated mate choice (Blais et al. 2007). Several genes related to the immune system, including MHC loci, have been found to show signs of positive selection in East African cichlids (Gerrard and Meyer 2007), suggesting a role for immune genes duringcichlid adaptive radiations. In this study, we focused on the function and molecular character- ization of a novel family of immune genes in (cichlid) shes, which have been implicated to have immunological and developmental functions inmammals and insects (Seeler et al. 1994; Wu et al. 1996; Torres-Vazquez et al. 2001). In a previous study that focused on a candidate gene family for neural crest-derived structures in cichlids ( i.e., the endothelin family of ligands and receptors), we detected strong signatures of positive selection in a gene adjacent to one of the focal loci, the zinc nger protein human immunode ciency is a transcrip- tion factor with functions in a variety of biological and developmentalprocesses, e.g.,HIV-1g ene expression (Maekawa et al. 1989; Muchardt et al. 1992; Seeler et al. 1994), in the Decapentaplegic signaling pathway important for cell fate speci cation during embryogenesis (Grieder et al. 1995; Dai et al. 2000; Marty et al. 2000; Torres-Vazquez et al. 2001), in V(D)J recombination of immunoglobulins (Wu et al. 1993; Wuet al. 1996), and in MHC enhancer binding (Baldwin et al. 1990; William et al. 1995). Although a single copy of this gene is found in Drosophila, mammals are typically characterized by three copies (Hicar et al. 2001; D\u00fcrr et al. 2004). Teleost sh, however, possess up to ve duplicates (see Braasch et al. 2 0 0 9 ) ,w h i c hi si na c c o r d a n c ew i t ht h e3 R hypothesis of a teleost-speci c genome duplication event the 2R duplications vertebrate linage (Sidow 1996; Taylor et al. 2003; Meyer and Van De Peer 2005; Volff 2005). The goal of the current study was threefold. First, we characterized the signatures of selection ( i.e.,dN/dSratios) in the veHivep paralogs in 40 East African cichlid sh species to determine whether adaptiveprotein evolution is commonly observed in the Hivep gene family. To this end, we performed phylogenetic analyses of the Hivep loci and estimated dN/dSratios on both codon sites and in individual cichlid lineages. Second, we examined the role of the Hivep paralogs in the immune defense in the cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni . We evaluated the functional connection between Hivep expression levels and several cellular immune parameters after an experimental vaccination withVibrio anguillarum bacteria. This sh pathogen was chosen to simu- late a novel immune challenge, as the host was expected to be immu- nologically na\u00efve against these Vibrio bacteria. Finally, we examined putative pleiotropic developmental functions through analyses of cis- regulatory regions to obtain insights into other functions of the Hivep paralogs in teleosts that could be linked to the observed signatures of adaptive protein evolution and related our ndings to the explosive speciation events in East African cichlid shes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sampling, DNA and RNA extraction, and housing conditions Samples for the DNA analyses were collected during two expeditions to Lake Tanganyika in 2007 and 2008 using a standard operating procedure described by Muschick et al. (2012). In total, 40 different cichlid species from 14 different lineages, including all major cichlid lineages in East Africa (so-called tribes) (Muschick et al. 2012) were examined (Supporting Information, Table S1 ). RNA for the gene ex- pression assays was extracted from gill, brain, and liver tissue of adultA. burtoni (laboratory strain, both sexes; see Experimental Vaccination section). DNA and RNA extractions were performed as describedelsewhere (Diepeveen and Salzburger 2011), with one exception: thetissue homogenization during the RNA extraction was performed ona BeadBeater (FastPrep-24; MP). Animals being part of the experi- mental vaccination study were kept under standard conditions (12 hr light, 12 hr dark, 25 /C176) in the animal facilities at the Zoological Institute in Basel before transportation to the Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, where they were kept under the following conditions: 14 hr light; 10 hr dark; and 25 /C176for$38 hr before the start of the experimental vaccination. Loci, PCR ampli in teleost shes (Braasch et al. 2009). Ensemble (versions 61 and 67) sequences from the following species were downloaded: loci, we in-house tblastx searches on the server of the Zoological Institute (University ofBasel) to determine Hivep protein sequences in the preliminary cichlidgenomes A. burtoni, Neolamprologus brichardi ,a n d Pundamilia (BROAD Institute, unpublished data). These teleost and were aligned exon -intron structure and to design cichlid- specicp r i m e r s( Table S3 ). Subsequent PCR and sequencing reactions were performed as described Salzburger agarose Sequen- ces were and visually inspected using Codon Code Aligner 3.7.1 (CodonCode Corporation) and exon/intron boundaries obtained other sequenced regions protein-coding regions, and concatenated E. T. Diepeveen, O. Roth, and W. Salzburger 78(TSRs of all ve loci) data sets were constructed. All generated cichlid Hivep tests for selection pressure Phylogenetic analyses and tests for selection pressure were performed as described elsewhere (Diepeveen and Salzburger 2011; Diepeveen et al. 2013). In short, models of nucleotide substitution were chosen based on likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) conducted in jModeltest 0.1.1(Guindon and Gascuel 2003; Posada 2008) and used in likelihood searches in PAUP /C3(Swofford 2002) and individual paralog and for the concatenated dataset. Bootstrap analyses with 100 replicates were performed in PAUP/C3and MrBayes was run for 10,000,000 generations. Tylochromis polylepis and/or Oreochromis tanganicae were used as the outgroup in these analyses (Salzburger et al. 2002). The consensus tree based on the concatenated dataset was used as a common input tree in thesubsequent analyses. Both site and branch-site models, as implemented in Codeml, Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood (PAML) 4.2 (Yang1997; Yang 2007), were used to test for selection pressure. The non-synonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio, vord N/dS,t h ep r o - portion of sites assigned to an vcategory, the p0,1,2, and the pandq parameters of the bdistribution were estimated for all ve datasets under different models. LRTs of the following model comparisons were performed to detect sites under positive selection: M1a (nearly neutral) with M2a (positive bandvs= 1) with M8. The comparison between M0 (one ratio) and M3 (discrete) was used as a test of variable vamong sites. Posterior probabilities for site classes were calculated with theBayes empirical Bayes (BEB) (Yang et al. 2005). Next, LRTs between the null model ( v s= 1) and the alternative model ( vs$1) were performed to determine if focal, or foreground, lineages evolved undernon-neutral evolution. These foreground branches were chosen basedon the results from the phylogenetic and PAML analyses. Subsequent sliding window analyses (window size = 20) were performed with TreeSAAP (selection on amino acid properties) 3.2(Woolley et al. 2003) for the four loci for which positively selected sites were observed with the PAML analyses ( Hivep1 ,Hivep2b ,Hivep3a ,a n d Hivep3b Amino acids were categorized based on 31 physicochem- ical properties to identify regions of positive selection. Selection onamino acids was subsequently screened for positive destabilizing se- lection by means of categorizing the substitutions into eight categories (categories 1 -8) based on the magnitude of radicality ( i.e., 1 is the most conservative amino acid substitutions and 8 is the most radical). The three highest categories (6 -8;P#0.001) were used as indicative of radical amino acid substitutions. Next, these substitutions were analyzed with the program SIFT (sorting intolerant from tolerant) (Ng and Henikoff 2003) to screen for possible effect on protein function. Analyzing cis-regulatory regions TheveHivep sequences from A. burtoni were compared with the obtained teleost sequences of O. niloticus ,O. latipes ,Tr u b r i p e s , T. nigroviridis ,a n d D. rerio with mVISTA (Mayor et al. 2000; Frazer et al. 2004). Sequences were globally aligned with Shuf fle-LAGAN (Brudno et al. 2003) and the minimum sequence similarity was set to 50%. Intragenic conserved noncoding elements were predicted and analyzed with rVISTA (Loots et al. 2002) to identify potential tran- scription factor binding sites.Experimental vaccination and immuneresponse measurements To examine the expression patterns of the Hivep paralogs after an experimental vaccination, we exposed adult cichlid sh of the species A. burtoni toVibrio bacteria following Roth et al. (2011). V. anguillarum was physically isolated from the stomach of freshly caught broad-nosed pipesh (Syngnathus typhle )( R o t h et al. 2012). Strain con rmation was performed via sequencing of the 16S rRNA ,recA,a n d pyrH loci (GenBank reference numbers provided in Roth et al. 2012). On day 1 oft he experiment, sh of both sexes were randomly assigned to either the experimental treatment (12 individuals) or the control treatment(11 individuals) and injected intraperitoneally with either 50 mlh e a t - killed (60 min at 65 /C176)V. anguillarum (phylotype S6M4; 10 6cells/ml dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), i.e.,e x p e r i m e n t a lt r e a t - ment) or 50 mlP B S( i.e., control treatment), respectively, according to the methods of Roth et al. (2012). Fish were tagged subcutaneously with visible implant elastomer tags (Northwest Marine Technology)according to treatment and kept in a single aquarium system. After/C2421 hr of exposure, sh were killed with MS222 and weight and standard length were noted as in Birrer et al. (2012). Blood was collected from the caudal vessel in heparinized capillaries (Na-heparinized; BrandGMBH + Co. KG), followed by extraction of the head kidneys andspleen, which were forced through a 40- mm nylon sieve to prepare cell suspensions for subsequent cellular immune measurements. All stepswere performed on ice. Cells were washed twice with RPMI medium(10 min, 600 rpm, 4 /C176) and resuspended in a nal volume of 450 ml. The number of lymphocytes and monocytes (as proxies for immune response in the form of in flammation and/or stress to the treatment) were measured in blood, head kidneys, and spleen tissues by meansofflow cytometry (FACSCalibur; Becton Dickinson) with pre-assessed cichlid-speci c typ e. The proportions of mono- cytes, lymphocytes, and the lymphocyte/monocyte ratio were calculated.Furthermore, the activity of the relative number of lymphocytes in the G 2-Mand synthesis (S) phases of the proliferation cycle compared to the relative number of lymphocytes in the G 0-1phase was measured by killing cells in ethanol and subsequent labeling of the DNA withpropidium iodide (Sigma Aldrich) as described by Roth et al. (2011). Lymphocytes were identi ed by their characteristic FSC/SSC pattern (i.e., cell volume and inner complexity). Proliferating cells in the G 2-M phase were distinguished from G 0-1and S phase cells by a more intense redfluorescence because of their higher DNA content. To test whether the obtained data were normally distributed, D 'Agnostino and Pearson omnibus normality tests as implemented in GraphPad Prism version 5 . 0 af o rM a cO SX( http://www.graphpad.com ) were conducted. Out- liers with values outside 2 SDs from the mean were removed ( i.e.,u pt o three individuals per treatment group and tissue type). The experiment was performed according to current national legislation of the Ministerium \"Effects of global change on the immunological interaction of pipe sh and cichlids with their natural bacteria communities \"). One sh from the control treatment died during the experiment. Gene expression assays and analyses Gill, brain, and liver tissues of the 22 e xperimental animals were extracted and directly stored in RNA later (Invitrogen). RNA extraction and reverse-transcriptase were conducted as described elsewhere (Diepeveen and Salzburger 2011). Subsequent gene expression analyses were per- formed by means of quantitative PCR on a BioMark HD systemat the Genetic Diversity Centre of the ETH Zurich, following the manufacturer 's protocol. Levels of gene expression were measured in Volume 3 December 2013 | Hivep Gene Family in Cichlids | 2207 79Figure 1 Phylogenetic hypotheses based on maximum likelihood for the concatenated dataset and the individual Hivep loci consisting of 40 taxa.

Primers were designed and tested for the ve focal Hivep loci, two housekeeping 3 ( RpSA3 )] (Colombo et al. 2013) and four control loci with demonstrated immune-related functions [ i.e., receptor-like 1 (F2RL1), in flammation visualized, ampli cation plots were checked, and outliers were removed with the Fluidigm Real-Time PCR analysis software version 3.1 (Fluidigm). Further comparative analyses were performed with the qBasePLUS2software package (Biogazelle). EF1 andRpSA3 were used as reference targets for the multiple reference gene normalization approach as implemented in qBasePLUS2software (Biogazelle). Three different positive controls were included in thisstudy; RNA was extracted from whole nonexperimental A.burtoni juveniles and two mixes composed of nine samples (gill, liver, andbrain tissues of three randomly chosen individuals) each for the con-trol group and the experimental group separately. Variation betweenPCR replicates and deviation of normalization factors were checked and outliers with values outside 2 SDs from the mean were removed. Data were controlled for inter-run variation. Unpaired ttests were performed for the control immune genes expression levels between the control and experimental treatmentgroups with the qBase PLUS2software (Biogazelle). To test for a corre- lation between the expression of Hivep paralogs [ i.e., quality-controlled and normalized relative quantities (CNRQ, here just RQ)] and theimmune response measurements, Pearson correlations were calculatedin GraphPad Prism in the control and experimental treatment groups. RESULTS Phylogenetic analyses of cichlid Hivep sequences To examine the molecular evolutionary history of the Hivep paralogs, we performed maximum likelihood and Bayesian Inference phyloge- netic analyses based on the total sequenced region per locus, and theconcatenated dataset including and the concate- nated dataset of 13.5 kb are displayed in Figure 1, A -F. Generally, the observed topologies of the gene trees, and the concatenated tree inparticular, correspond with the available species trees (Salzburger al. 2002; Takahashi 2005; 2012), polylepis , O. tanganicae ,B. graueri ,B. microlepis ,a n d T. nigrifrons as most basal species, followed by the Lamprologini, the Eretmodini, and the speciesbelonging to the \"C-lineage \"(Salzburger et al. 2002; Clabaut et al. 2005; Day et al. 2008) (Figure 1). As previously observed (Diepeveenand Salzburger 2011), E. cyanostictus was found at a different position within the C-lineage, whereas this species has been commonly re- solved outside the C-lineage in previous studies (Salzburger et al. 2002; Clabaut et al. 2005; Day et al. 2008). Also, the relationships between the individual lineages of the C-lineage altered between theindividual gene trees. Long branches were observed for T. polylepis , the lamprologines, individual lamprologine species, different branches within the ectodines in several gene trees, and for the haplochrominesinHivep2b andT. nigrifrons in the Hivep3a gene tree. Selection pressure on sites and branches To investigate signatures of selection pressure in the Hivep paralogs, we used site and branch-site models (Yang 1997, 2007) to obtain, e.g., nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratios ( d N/dS). The maximum likelihood parameter estimations for v,p0,1,2and p,a n d qunder different evolutionary models can be found in Table 1 for all veHivep loci. Estimations of vunder the one ratio model (M0) suggest that the Hivep genes evolved under purifying vranging from 3 sites, 1.4% o1 1 . 8 estimated to have evolved neutrally ( v= 1) under the neutral model (M1a). By using models that allow vto vary among sites (M2a, M3, and M8), up to 4.3% of sites were detected to have evolved with v.1i n Hivep1 , Hivep2b ,Hivep3a ,a n than 89.4% of sites evolv- ing under purifying selection. Likelihood ratio tests of several model comparisons (Table 2) were performed to detect positively selected amino acids. This approach resulted in the rejection of the null models in the M1a vs.M2a, M7 vs. M8, and M8a vs.M8 comparisons for loci except Hivep2a .P o s i - tively selected sites were detected with the BEB for Hivep1 (16 sites), Hivep2b (2 sites), Hivep3a (18 sites), and Hivep3b (13 sites). LRTs of the branch-site analyses were performed to test whether focal lineages evolved under non-neutral evolution. Signi cant LRTs were only observed for Hivep3b (Table 3), indicating that although the vratios do vary among sites for three of the other four Hivep loci, they do not seem to vary signi cantly among lineages. For Hivep3b , the following two branches were observed with v.1: the derived lineages (excluding the ve the haplo- chromines ( P= 0.031) 3 and Figure 1). Sliding windows and amino acidsubstitution characteristics To visualize regions with elevated d N/dSvalues and to connect such regions with the physiochemical properties of the respective amino acid substitutions, we performed sliding window analyses. The sliding window plots of Hivep1 ,Hivep2b ,Hivep3a ,a n d Hivep3b are depicted in Figure 2, A- D. Regions of positive selection (z-score $3.09 corre- sponding with P#0.001) were observed for highest values. (C) Hivep2a (3143 bp; TIM2+G). The lamprologines plus the ve most species are found basal of the C-lineage plus Eretmodini. All major lineages except the Cyphotilapiini. (D) Hivep2b (1517 bp; TrN+I+G). Mostly tree with a basal polytomy, excluding the two outgroup species from all other species. Polytomous relationships were further found for the haplochromine and ectodine lineages. (E) Hivep3a (2142 bp; TPM1uf+G). The plus the ve most lamprologines are positioned within the C-lineage. Black arrows represent the two branches for which v.1 was found in the branch-site analyses and their lineage-speci c amino acid substitutions. Bootstrap values (PAUP/C3) and Bayesian posterior probabilities (MrBayes) .50% are shown, respectively, above and below the branches. Cichlid lineage names and a color key for the six cichlid lineages with more than one species included in this study are provided in the gray box in (A). Abbreviations of species names consist of the rst three characters of the genus name followed by the rst three characters of the species name (Table S1 shows full species names). Branch lengths ofT. polylepis were shortened by 50% in all phylogenies and for T. nigrifrons in (E).

Interestingly, not all of these retrieved regions of positive selection correspond with the obtained positively selected sites as identi ed by the PAML analyses and vice versa . Rel- ative few regions of positive selection are observed in the ZAS domains that contain the zinc ngers that bind speci c DNA motifs. Notable exceptions are the ZAS-N domain of Hivep2b and the ZAS-C domain ofHivep3b (Figure 2); the latter is furthermore characterized by a pos- itively selected site identi ed by the PAML analyses. Most commonly observed positively selected amino acid properties among the four paralogs affect the alpha-helical tendencies, the compressibility, theequilibrium constant (ionization of COOH), and the surrounding hydrophobicity. The SIFT analyses of the observed substitutions to screen for possible effect on protein function showed that all sub-stitutions are tolerant and thus have no predicted damaging effect on function (data not shown). Analyzing cis-regulatory regions We investigated noncoding regions within the Hivep paralogs for potential cis-regulatory elements to determine possible binding sites for transcription factors, indicative of putative functional involvement in signaling pathways. Vistaplots of Hivep1 ,Hivep2a ,Hivep2b ,a n d Hivep3b are depicted in Figure S1 ,A-D. Because of a limited number of retrieved teleost sequences for Hivep3a , the Vistaplot was not in- formative for this locus and was therefore excluded from further anal-yses. For all four analyzed loci, conserved noncoding elements (CNEs)were observed in A.burtoni . Interestingly, a similar pattern of two CNEs surrounding a single exon was observed in all loci (arrows inFigure S1 ). Although this pattern forHivep1 andHivep2a , for Hivep2b andHivep3b restricted to cichlid shes ( O.niloticus is the reference sequence in these analyses). A third cichlid-speci c CNE was observed in a sub- sequent intron in both Hivep1 andHivep2a ,w h e r e a sf o r Hivep3b two more cichlid-speci c CNEs were identi ed. Because the particular pattern of two CNEs surrounding an exon was observed in all four analyzed loci, the subsequent search for potential tran scription factor binding sites was mainly focused on these regions to determine any overlap in possible function of these regions. The analyses resulted in similar hits among Hivep paralogs and suggested a possible association between the Hivep paralogs and different types of signaling pathways involved in, e.g., sex determination [ androgen receptor (AR); pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1 ( PBX1 ); sex- determining region Y protein (SRY )], immune system [ B-cell lymphoma 6p r o e i protein ( Msx1 )], and several members of the paired box protein Pax (PAX) and bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) pathways. Experimental vaccination and immuneresponse measurements We performed experimental vaccinations to test whether the Hivep paralogs are involved in an induced immune response. The experimen- tal vaccination was realized by exposure to heat-killed V. anguillarum for/C2421 hr, following the methods of Birrer et al. (2012). Several immune response measurements were performed to determine induc-tion of immune defense dynamics. The lymphocyte/monocyte ratio and the relative number of lymphocytes in the G 2-Mand S phases of the proliferation cycle were measured in blood, spleen, and head kidney (Figure 3). Data were normally distributed. The experimental treatment resulted in an elevated lymphocyte/monocyte ratio in bloodnTable 1 Site model parameter estimates for the veHivep paralogs Parameter Estimates models for all veHivep loci. Estimations of vunder the one ratio model (M0) suggest that the Hivep genes evolved under purifying selection. A small proportion of sites was estimated to have evolved neutrally ( v= 1) under the M1a model in all loci.

A higher proportion of lymphocytes in the S and G2-Mphases was found in the head kidney of the experimental group (P= 0.005), indicative of induced lymphocyte proliferation. Gene expression assays We measured the expression levels of four control immune loci, AIF1 , F2RL1 ,IL10,a n d TLR5 in liver and gill tissues. These relative expres- sion levels are depicted in Figure 4. For AIF1 and TLR5 ,w ef o u n d signicantly higher levels of relative expression in liver ( P=0 . 0 P=0 . 0 0 6 )i nt h e experimental treatment group. To analyze the effect of Vibrio exposure on the expression levels of theHivep paralogs in detail, we assessed their expression levels inrelation to an immune response parameter ( i.e.,l y m p h o c y t e / m o n o - cyte ratio) per treatment group ( i.e., control and experimental). Four correlations were signi cant between the lymphocyte/monocyte ratio of the spleen and the relative expression of Hivep1 (liver; Pearson , P= 0.007) (Figure 5). In these cases, the expression level of the Hivep paralogs thus correlates positively with the level of the immune re- sponse parameter. DISCUSSION In this study, we examined the molecular evolutionary history of theHivep gene family members in relation to their presumed immune- related function in a renowned model system for evolutionary biology,the East African cichlid shes.

We show, for the rst time to our knowledge, that the Hivep paralogs play a putative role in the response to vaccina- tion in sh, and that they are characterized by signatures of long-term positive selection. Our ndings regarding the Hivep paralogs indicate that they are important candidate genes for immune-related functions in teleost sh and suggest broader implicati ons in relation to speciation events, such as the adaptive radiations in East African cichlid shes. Exposure to V.anguillarum causes an immune response inA. burtoni To test whether the exposure to a vaccination with heat-killedV. anguillarum resulted in an upregulation of the cellular sh immune response, we measured lymphocyte/monocyte ratios, the proportionsof proliferating lymphocytes, and the expression levels of four controlimmune genes with demonstrated functions in the in flammatory re- sponse and immunity (Watano et 2007; Rothmeier and Ruf 2012) (see Materials and Methods section). Consistent with an elevated immune response upon Vibrio vaccination, we found an in- creased lymphocyte production in the head kidney, the organ whereclonal lymphocyte production takes place (Rombout et al. 2005; Abdel-Aziz et al. 2010). We also found a higher proportion of lym- phocytes both in blood and spleen, indicating lymphocyte migration toward peripheral organs. Although lymphocytes are transported via blood, the spleen is the major lymphoid tissue associated with theclearance of blood-borne antigens (Press 1999; AIF1 andTLR5 in theVibrio -exposed group indicates activation of the (Watano et al. 2001; Janeway and Medzhitov 2002; Akira et al. 2006). However, we did not nd a signi cant upregulation for two other immune genes with demonstrated functions in the immune response, Figure 2 Sliding window plots and radical amino acid properties for four Hivep paralogs. (A) For Hivep1 , multiple sliding windows were observed with z-score $3.09. For several positively selected sites identi ed with PAML, no radical substitutions were found and vice versa . (B) In Hivep2b , four regions of positive selection are observed of which two correspond with positively selected sites identi ed by the PAML analyses. (C) The observed regions of positive selection for Hivep3a are characterized by many different physicochemical properties. (D) Many radical amino acid substitutions were found for Hivep3b that correspond with most of the positively selected sites identi ed by PAML analyses. Each physicochem- ical amino acid property is individually color coded (see Figure S2 for details). Black diamonds ( ) represent positively selected amino acid sites obtained by the PAML analyses and red circles around them represent positively selected radical nonsynonymous substitutions (category 6-8). The dotted line at z-score = represents P= 0.001, whereas z-score = 1.64 represents P= 0.05. Red 1998; Savan et al. 2003; Rothmeier and Ruf 2012). These were possibly missed by the choice of our measuring time point (21 hr after vaccination), as suggested by Savan et al. (2003), who found elevated IL10 expression in carp liver tissue after LPS stimulation only within the rst 6 hr of incubation. Hivep expression levels correlate with cellular immune response parameters in an East African cichlid sh Although several functions of the Hivep paralogs have been demon- strated in the fruit fly,Xenopus frog, human, and mouse (Wu 2002), theHivep paralogs have, so far, not been examined in teleost shes. We tested, for the rst time, whether there is a correlation between immune response parameters and the expression level of the Hivep paralogs in sh as an indicator of putative function(s) in the immune response. Although our study does not determine the exact function of the Hivep paralogs within the immune response, the positive correlations between the lymphocyte/monocyte ratio and the expression levels of three Hivep paralogs indicate that the expression of \u2014at least\u2014 Hivep1 ,Hivep2a ,a n d Hivep3b is upregulated upon the experimental vaccination. This implies that Hivep paralogs play a role during the immune response of sh. These results provide, to our knowledge, the rst indication of an immunological function of the Hivep paralogs in teleost sh, which is congruent with preliminary ndings in pipe sh (O. Roth, personal communication). The Hivep gene family thus offers a potential novel family of immune genes for teleost sh that, when their functions are characterized in more detail, can be used infuture immunological screens.Other functional implications The experimental vaccination did not lead to upregulated expression levels of all veHivep paralogs. We found no correlation between the expression levels of Hivep2b andHivep3a and the immune response measurements. These paralogs either have immunological functionsbeyond the scope of our experimental design or are not involved int h ei m m u n er e s p o n s ei nt e l e o s t shes. Previously, it had been shown that Hivep genes are involved in functions other than the immune sys tem in insects and vertebrates, e.g., in murine osteoclastogenesis (Liu et al. 2011), in BMP /Dpp signaling (Grieder et al. 1995; Dai et al. 2000; Marty et al. 2000; Torres-Vazquez et al. 2001; Yao 2006; Saita et al. 2007; Yin et al. 2010), and in the development of the nervous system (Campbell and Levitt 2003; Takagi et al. 2006). Interestingly, several of the potential transcription factor binding sites identi ed within the observed CNEs correspond with these known functionsofHivep paralogs. For instance, we found multiple hits for compo- nents of the BMP signaling pathway, as well as several other devel- opmental patterning loci, suggesting a putative role of the developmental patterning and bone formation in cichlidshes. Hivep paralogs have been found to play a role in the speci - cation of Drosophila wing and halter discs (Torres-Vazquez et al. 2001), multiple patterning events of both Drosophila ectoderm and mesoderm al. 1995), and male tail patterning inCaenorhabditis elegans (Liang et al. 2007). The roles of Hivep in theBMP pathway, possibly through alternative splicing (Hicar et al. 2001; Hong and Wu 2005; Yin et al. 2010), together with several indications of functions in appendage speci cation and patterning make them candidate genes for n patterning and anal n egg-spot Figure 3 Immune response measurements after the experimental vaccination in A. burtoni adults.

Future detailed expression and functional analyses should elucidate whether the Hivep paralogs are involved the development of egg spots in haplochromine cichlidshes. Implications of positive selection on Hivep paralogs, immune genes, and speciation events Positive selection, or adaptive sequence evolution, is the hallmark of evolutionary change and molecular adaptation. By comparing the nonsynonymous substitution rate ( d N) to the synonymous substitu- tion rate ( dS) of protein coding genes, the selection regime ( i.e.,n e u - tral, purifying or positive) per amino acid can be inferred (Yang andBielawski 2000). This method is widely used and has led to the iden-tication of many cases of positive selection (Yang and Bielawski 2000). Genes involved in (evading) defensive systems or immunityare typically found with signatures of positive selection (Endo et al. 1996; Yang and Bielawski 2000; 2011). As discussed, several func- tions within the immune response have been described for the Hivep paralogs in other species, and our detailed inferences of the d N/dS ratios provide evidence for positive selection acting on four out of veHivep paralogs. Interestingly, signs of positive selection have been found before in vertebrate Hivep paralogs. Hivep2 has been found with a signature of positive selection in Tetraodon (Montoya-Burgos 2011) and the cow lineage (Toll-Riera et al. 2011), whereas Hivep3 showed signs of positive selection in the human lineage (Vamathevanet al. 2008). At least for the human Hivep paralog, it has been sug- gested that the immune function is the cause for the signature of positive selection. Together, these results indicate that it is likely that the immune-related functions of the Hivep paralogs are the cause for the elevated d N/dSratios observed across vertebrate lineages, including the 14 cichlid lineages examined here.

Signi cant correlations were only observed O. Roth, and W. Salzburger 86Positively selected genes are typically only loosely connected to reproductive isolation in Drosophila (Wu and Ting 2004). This is in contrast to the vertebrate MHC loci, known for their signatures of positive selection (Hughes and Nei 1988; Hughes and Nei 1989; Yangand Bielawski 2000; Montoya-Burgos 2011), have been pro- posed as pleiotropic speciation genes (Eizaguirre et al. 2009). Because these genes are involved in adaptation to novel habitats in response to different pathogenic communities and assortative mating via matechoice, their pleiotropic effects are hypothesized to induce and accel- erate speciation (Eizaguirre et al. 2009). Our work shows that several of the Hivep paralogs also have putative pleiotropic roles in immune defense and an important sexually selected trait \u2014the anal ne g g - s p o t in East African haplochromine cichlids \u2014s u b j e c tt om a t ec h o i c e( H e r t 1989; Couldridge 2002; but see Theis et al. 2012). Mate choice for the most attractive male anal n could thus select a certain Hivep geno- type and thereby facilitate adaptation to pathogenic environments at the same time. Similar to the MHC loci, the Hivep paralogs might have played important roles during the explosive speciation events of cichlid shes and therefore are exciting new putative speciation genes. Hivep3b : Selective patterns in haplochromines and other derived cichlid lineages That we found evidence of lineage-speci c positive selection acting on Hivep3b indicates that this locus underwent adaptive protein evolu- tion in both the derived cichlid lineages, including the lamprologines, eretmodines, and the C-lineage, and the most species-rich cichlid lin-eage, the haplochromines. Adaptive protein evolution underlies the adaptive evolution of traits and is thus ultimately responsible for species divergence and evolution ary innovation (Yang 2006). Interestingly, the elevated d N/dSratios were observed in lineages that are characterized by explosive speciation and diversi cation events (Salzburger et al. 2005; Day et al. 2008), which can be seen as further support for the hypoth- esis that the pleiotropic functions of the Hivep paralogs\u2014Hivep3b specically\u2014can be linked to speciation events. During such events genes could have been recruited to perform altered functions to gen-erate novel or modi ed traits, which ultimately may have played a role in the divergence between species. A lineage-speci c amino acid sub- stitution in Hivep3b was observed for all the haplochromines (position 112 G/R) and the derived lineages (position 87 E /D), as well as several substitutions in a subset of the species belonging to these lineages. Functional analyses are now needed to test whether these substitutions have a tness advantage for these species and, above all, their function in these cichlid lineages.

MEETING REVIEW 97NEWS AND VIEWS MEETING REVIEW Two Decades of Molecular Ecology: where are we and where are weheading? EVELINE T. DIEPEVEEN* and WALTER SALZBURGER* *Zoological Institute, University of Basel, Vesalgasse 1, 4051 Basel, Switzerland The twentieth anniversary of the journal Molecular Ecology was celebrated with a symposium on the current state and the future directions of the eld. The event, organized by Tim Vines and Loren Rieseberg, took place on the opening day of the First Joint Congress on Evolu-tionary Biology organized by the American Society ofNaturalists (ASN), the Canadian Society for Ecology and Evolution (CSEE), the European Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB), the Society for the Study of Evolution(SSE) and the Society of Systematic Biologists (SSB) in Ottawa (Canada) from 6 -10 July 2012. The get together of these ve societies created a truly international and exciting \"Evolution conference\" and the ideal framework for the Molecular Ecology symposium. Its thirteen talks were grouped into the ve different subject areas of the journal: Speciation and Hybridization; Landscape Genetics,Phylogeography and Adaptation; Kinship, Parentage and Behav- iour; Ecological Interactions. Each session was followed bya panel discussion on the future direction of the subeld. That more than 300 colleagues registered for this special symposium illustrates the broad interest in, and apprecia-tion of, molecular ecology -both the eld and the journal. Keywords : ecological genomics, ecological interactions, lands- cape genetics, molecular adaptation, phylogeography, speciation Received 24 August 2012; revised 14 September 2012; accepted 19 September 2012 Next-generation (Sequencing in the eld of) Molecular Ecology The overlapping and dominating theme of almost all sessions (except maybe Kinship, Parentage and Behaviour)was next-generation sequencing (NGS). Taking the sympo-sium as a snapshot of what is going on in the community,then it seems as if NGS has 'conquered' the eld ofmolecular ecology (see also Fig. 1). At the same time, thedifferent talks exemplied the broad applicability of NGS and the various questions that can be addressed using NGS technologies. In the following, we summarize the symposiumby focussing on how NGS is used in each of the subelds. Alex Buerkle (University of Wyoming) presented some recent work on reproductive isolation in Lycaeides butterflies andManacus birds based on genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) screens of both parental species andhybrids (see Gompert et al. 2012). They found that many loci show signs of extreme introgression along hybrid zonesand that there are many ne-scaled genomic footprints of differentiation and reproductive isolation, calling into ques- tion the genomic island view of speciation. Alex Widmer(ETH Zurich) talked about his work on a hybrid zone in Silene . Previous amplication fragment length polymor- phism (AFLP) genomic scans revealed that outlier markers were typically found on the sex chromosomes. In the absence of a reference genome, they built a reference transcriptome to determine gene expression differencesbetween sexes. This way they were able to show that dosagecompensation does occur in Silene by overexpression of the X-chromosome in males when the Y-chromosome is down-regulated (Muyle et al. 2012). Tatiana Giraud (University of South Paris) used NGS to sequence expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries of four Microbotryum species -fungal pathogens specialized on different host plants (Caryophylla- ceae). These libraries were subjected to a genome-wide dN/ dS analysis, which revealed 42 loci under positive selection that could be implicated with functions in the host -parasite interactions (Aguileta et al. 2010). In the second session, Rose Andrew (University of British Columbia) talked about her research on dune sun-flowers ( Helianthus ) in which she applied RAD sequencing to twenty subpopulations to identify putative adaptive loci. Several strong peaks of F SToutliers were detected, leading to the conclusion that seed mass and vegetation cover were both associated with the same genomic region. Next, Victoria Sork (University of California, Los Angeles) stated that NGS is the essential tool for the development of a newsubeld: landscape genomics. With NGS, the wholegenome can be screened for adaptive genetic variation in relation to geographic patterns, making candidate gene approaches somewhat redundant. Furthermore, massiveNGS genome scans provide valuable information on neu- tral loci that can be used for, for example, inferring demo- graphic processes. The eld of ecological genomics and molecular adapta- tion has gained tremendously from the NGS revolution.Jon Slate (University of Shefeld), for instance, showed not (2012) 98only that NGS allows associating loci to phenotypes, but that we now have the tools to distinguish between patternsof genetic drift and natural selection. With 'gene-dropping' simulations, he and his co-workers recently showed that the frequency and excess of heterozygotes observed inSoay sheep cannot be explained by drift alone and thatselection plays a role in shaping coat pattern (Gratten et al. 2012). That NGS is a rapid and effective way to identifycandidate genes was demonstrated by Aurelie Bonin(LECA, Universite \u00b4Joseph combined scans, transcriptomics) withadmixture mapping and QTL analyses to narrow down thelist of candidate genes for insecticide resistance in the yel- low fever mosquito Aedes aegypti . These genes will now be studied in more detail. Brent Emerson (IPNA-CSIC, Tenerife) gave a nice over- view on the eld of ecological interactions, where NGS isused to determine resource diversity. For example, diet analyses can now be performed by sequencing gut contentsor faecal matter and, in some cases, even complete focal individuals. Several specialized techniques can be applied, such as sequencing distinct diagnostic fragments (with theaid of e.g. chloroplast- or invertebrate-specic primers, if the consumer is a vertebrate, or the usage of species- specic blocking primers). Furthermore, Graham Stone(University of Edinburgh) showed that besides preyspecies, also symbionts can reliably be recovered and identied using NGS techniques. Limitations of NGS Next-generation sequencing success stories, like the ones presented during the Molecular Ecology symposium, have the potential of giving a false impression about the pre- sumed ease of applying the technique and/or analysing NGS data. Fortunately, most speakers also commented onsome of the difculties they encountered when applyingNGS. Limitations of NGS techniques are widely accepted and discussed in the literature (see e.g. Ekblom & Galindo 2011; Harrison 2012). Besides the well-known issues suchas short read lengths, occasional poor read quality, the sheer amount of data to be managed and analysed and/or the lacking user-friendliness of analytic tools, several otherproblems were emphasized by the speakers.One major problem encountered in many NGS studies is the high percentage of nonannotated and/or un-mappedloci, which is especially the case with nonmodel organisms lacking reference genomes and other such resources. Often, a researcher can only speculate about functions of the dis-covered genes of effect or use indirect evidence from otherorganisms. Clearly, large-scale functional validation experi- ments and better comparative tools are needed to recover better annotations for nonmodel organisms. Another widely discussed topic was brought forward by Alex Buerkle. His simulations on sequencing depth vs. allelefrequencies estimates showed that the latter are easilybiased, despite adequate coverage. He argued that for many population genetic studies, a coverage of 1 9is sufcient, as the individual genotype does not play that much of a role in most analyses. The great advantage of a 1 9approach is that many more individuals can be included in a study, reducing overall costs tremendously. It is needless to say that there are many other situations, where one would aimfor high coverage. As Bryan Carstens (Louisiana State Uni- versity) outlined in his talk, higher coverage does give a higher condence when the data is, for instance, used for de novo assembly and SNP calling. Bryan Carstens further pointed out that NGS is a great tool for phylogeographic studies, but that analyses shouldbe performed more rigorously. He proposed a probabilisticmethod for model selection and suggested that an aver- aged approach of parameter estimates in relative propor- tions to the probabilities per model should be used. Although the examples so far focussed on functional validation, study design and analytic methods, severalspeakers called for rened theories. Louis Bernatchez(Universite \u00b4Laval), for example, emphasized the need for an extended theory on the evolutionary causes andconsequences of the molecular complexity that links thegenotype not only to the phenotype, but also to phenotypicplasticity and nongenetic inheritance. In general, a more holistic approach would be necessary, said Louis. Future directions of the eld Next-generation sequencing obviously revolutionized the eld (although, in our view, the number of publicationsseems to somewhat lack behind the large number of people 01020304050 02004006008001000 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012No. of publications Total NGS Fig. 1 The total number of publications (yellow bars; left y-axis) and the number studies next-generation sequencing (NGS; red diamonds; right y-axis) in Molecular Ecology and Molecular Ecology Resources (previously Molecular Ecology Notes ) per year.

This leads to the question: where will we go from here? The revolution in genotyping technologies, from iso- zymes and AFLPs to deep sequencing, is probably the bestexample for the advances that have been made in our eldover the last twenty years, said Loren Rieseberg (Univer-sity of British Columbia). Analytical methods developed and improved alongside the rise of new experimental techniques. And so did the journal Molecular Ecology. Only four issues (258 pages in total) were published in its rst year of existence, 1992, compared to over 5000pages in the twenty-four issues since 2007 (see also Fig. 1).But we are not there yet, concluded Loren, as the gap between molecular biology and ecology is still substantial. We have learned more about evolution (and lately alsoecology) by studying molecules. Now, it is time to increaseour efforts of studying ecology as a way to increase our knowledge on the function of molecules. These goals can only be reached if we improve the integration ofdisciplines and methods, another important conclusion of the symposium put forward by several speakers. The revolution of sequencing technology will continue, and we are on the doorstep of single-molecule sequencingor 'third-generation sequencing'. This method of sequenc- ing single strands of DNA without prior amplication hasgreat potential for the eld in general and for populationgenetics/genomics in particular. Single-strand sequencing directly produces phased haplotypes allowing more accu- rate estimations of population genetic parameters and thedetermination of recombination rates and recombination breakpoints. The technique still needs to improve and to become more efcient, especially with respect to error ratesthat currently counterbalance the ultra-long reads pro- duced, which would, in theory, simplify ( de novo ) assem- bly, shorten sequencing times and further reduce costs (see e.g. Schadt et al. 2010). Technological and analytical advances are beginning to change the way in which ecology is studied. With availablesequencing methods, it is already possible to geneticallycharacterize ecologically divergent populations in detail (see e.g. Roesti et al. 2012). Today's multilocus data sets will soon be replaced by whole genome population samples (see e.g. Jones et al. 2012), making it possible to link, at a large scale, alleles throughout the genome toparticular phenotypes, geographic patterns and ecologicalparameters. Importantly, new sequencing techniques willbecome more and more applicable to nonmodel organisms, which are the main targets of interest in ecology. Thus, in the eld of molecular ecology, we can shortly start focus-sing on the effect of ecology on a single individual ('s gen- ome) instead of studying alleles at a single locus or few loci only; and we can do so in nonmodel organisms and,hence, across a large range of taxa. Furthermore, technical advances will open the opportunity to study topics that have stayed somewhat untouched orisolated until now. In the next twenty years, we should, forexample, focus on epigenomics and plasticity in relation to phenotype and/or genotype. Another challenge is the development of toolkits to study a variety of organisms. Asdiscussed above, elucidating the link between genotype and phenotype is very difcult, if not impossible without proper genome annotation. The integration of ecologicalmetadata with genomic data sets is another challenge, justlike the development of better analytical tools for compara- tive population genomics, which will further support the development of new subelds like landscape genomics. In conclusion, the eld has challenging but very excited times ahead, and together with the ongoing revolution oftechnological, analytical and methodological tools, it willstay an exciting eld for the next twenty years. We fully agree with Loren Rieseberg that the future of the eld is bright indeed !

Remarkable cases of convergence involve the thick-lipped phenotype found across cichlid species flocks in the East African Great Lakes. Unlike most other convergent forms in cichlids, which are restricted to East Africa, the thick-lipped phenotype also occurs elsewhere, for example in the Central AmericanMidas Cichlid assemblage. Here, we use an ecological genomic approach to study thefunction, the evolution and the genetic basis of this phenotype in two independentcichlid adaptive radiations on two continents. We applied phylogenetic, demographic,geometric morphometric and stomach content analyses to an African species. We found that similar morphological adaptations occur in both thick-lipped species and that the 'fleshy' lips are associated with hard-shelled prey in the form of molluscs and invertebrates. We then used comparative Illumina RNA sequencing of thick vs. normallip tissue in East African cichlids and identied a set of 141 candidate genes thatappear to be involved in the morphogenesis of this trait. A more detailed analysis ofsix of these genes led to three strong candidates: Actb ,Cldn7 and Copb . The function of these genes can be linked to the loose connective tissue constituting the fleshy lips.Similar trends in gene expression between African and Central American thick-lippedspecies appear to indicate that an overlapping set of genes was independently recruited to build this particular phenotype in both lineages. Keywords : adaptive radiation, cichlid species flocks, convergent evolution, East Africa, ecologi- cal genomics, RNAseq Received 9 March 2012; revision received 4 July 2012; accepted 15 July 2012 Introduction Adaptive radiation is the rapid evolution of an array of species from a common ancestor as a consequence of the emerging species' adaptations to distinct ecologicalniches (Simpson 1953; Schluter 2000; Losos2009). It is typically triggered by ecological opportunityin form of underutilized resources \u2014just as being pro- vided after the colonization of a new habitat, the extinc-tion of antagonists and/or the evolution of a novel trait, which is then termed an evolutionary 'key innovation' al. 2011). Whatever the circumstances were that initiated an adaptive radiation, there is always a stronglink between adaptively relevant traits and the habitatand/or foraging niche (a 'phenotype -environment correlation'; Schluter 2000). In the most illustrative examples of adaptive radiation, the Darwin's nches on the Galapagos archipelago, the Anolis lizards E-mail: walter.salzburger@unibas.ch Present address: Department of Animal and Plant The University of Shefeld, Shefeld, S10 2TN, UK. 1These authors contributed equally to this work. \u00a92012 Blackwell Publishing LtdMolecular Ecology (2013) 22, 670-684 doi: 10.1111/mec.12029 103Caribbean islands and the cichlid shes of the East African Great Lakes, this correlation exists betweenbeak-shape and food source (nches), limb morphologyand twig diameter (anoles), and the architecture of themouth and jaw apparatus and foraging mode (cichlids) (Schluter 2000; Butler et al. 2007; Grant & Grant 2008; Losos 2009; Salzburger 2009). An interesting aspect of many adaptive radiations is the frequent occurrence of convergent (or parallel) (Schluter 2008; 2011; Wake et al. 2011). For example, similar ecotype morphs of anoles lizardshave evolved independently on different Caribbean islands (Losos et al. 1998; Harmon et lake-stream species of threespine sticklebacks emerged repeatedly in and around postglacial lakes (Rundle et al. 2000; Berner et al. 2010; Roesti et al. 2012), and a whole array of con- vergent forms of cichlid sh emerged between the lakesof East Africa (Kocher et al. 1993; Salzburger 2009). Such instances of convergent evolution are generally inter- preted as the result of the action of similar selection regimes in isolated settings (Schluter & Nagel 1995;Rundle et al. Harmon et al. 2005; Losos 2011). It has further been suggested that if radia-tions are truly replicated (i.e. driven by adaptive pro-cesses), convergence in morphology should tightly beassociated with convergence in ecology and behaviour(Johnson et al. 2009). The species flocks of cichlid shes in the East African Great Lakes Victoria, Malawi cichlid specieshave emerged in each lake within a period of severalmillions of years (as is the case for Lake Tanganyika;Salzburger et al. 2002; Genner et al. 2007) to <150 000 years (as in Lake Victoria; Verheyen et al. 2003). The various endemic cichlid species differgreatly in the morphology of the trophic apparatus(mouth form and shape, jaw structure and dentition) aswell as in coloration and pigmentation, suggesting thatboth natural and sexual selection are jointly responsiblefor adaptive radiation and explosive speciation in cich-lids (Salzburger 2009). Interestingly, convergent forms that emerged in independent cichlid adaptive radia- tions often show very similar coloration patterns inaddition to matching body shapes and mouth morpho-logies (Kocher et al. 1993; Stiassny & Meyer 1999; Salzburger 2009). This has led to speculations whetherselection alone is sufcient to explain convergence, orwhether genetic or developmental constraints havecontributed to the morphogenesis of these matching phenotypes (Brakeeld 2006).The present study focuses on the morphology, ecol- ogy and the genetic basis of a peculiar mouth trait in cichlid shes, which has evolved multiple times: hyper-trophied ('fleshy') lips (see Box 1 in Salzburger 2009).The exact function of the thick lips in cichlids is unknown, although this feature is generally implicated in a specic foraging mode (Fryer 1959; Fryer & Iles1972; Arnegard et al. 2001). Fleshy lips are often inter- preted as an adaptation for feeding on invertebratesand crustaceans hidden in crannies, with the lips beingused to seal cracks and grooves to facilitate the suckingof prey (Barlow & Munsey 1976; Ribbink et al. 1983; Seehausen 1996; Konings 1998). Alternatively, it has been suggested that hypertrophied lips protect from mechanical shocks (Greenwood 1974; Yamaoka 1997),and that they function as taste receptors et al. 2001) or as mechanoreceptors (Fryer 1959; Fryer & Iles1972). [Note, however, that there no increase insensory cells in lip tissue (Greenwood 1974).] It is remarkable that thick-lipped species appear to be a common outcome of cichlid adaptive radiations. For example, the large cichlid assemblages in East Africa all contain at least one such taxon (Lake cichlids featuring hypertrophied from, for example, the Midas Cichlid(Amphilophus spp.) assemblage in the large lakes of Nicaragua, where a thick-lipped species ( A. labiatus )i s common in rocky habitats (Fig. 1). Occasionally, hyper- trophied lips are also observed in other related cichlids inNicaragua, such as in the riverine species Tomacichla tuba 1982) or in Astatheros rostratus (pers. obs.). Additional riverine representatives with hypertrophiedlips in South America are not unique to though.For example, the adaptive radiation of the sailn silver-side sh (Telmatherinidae) in the Malili lakes of Sulaw-esi (Herder et al. 2006) and the barbs of Lake Tana in Ethiopia (Sibbing et al. 1998; de Graaf et al. 2008) also produced thick-lipped species. Members of the family Cichlidae are distributed in the Southern hemisphere, with a few ancestral lineages in India, Sri Lanka and Madagascar and two exception- ally species-rich clades, one in Central and South Amer-ica and one in Africa (Salzburger & Meyer 2004). Thisbiogeographical pattern is consistent with a Gondwananorigin of the Cichlidae, dating the split between Ameri-can and African representatives to ~100 Ma (Salzburger & Meyer 2004; Sereno et al. 2004; Genner et al. 2007). This set-up opens the possibility to study the ecological and genetic basis of a convergent trait across one of the \u00a92012 Blackwell Publishing LtdTHE THICK-LIPPED PHENOTYPE dis- tances in cichlids and, hence, in the complete absence of gene flow and outside the influence of ancestral poly-morphism and/or standing genetic variation. Here, we applied an integrative approach in two cich- lid sh radiations, the one of the Tropheini in East Afri-can Lake Tanganyika and the Midas Cichlid assemblagein Nicaragua, to uncover the ecological and geneticbasis of the thick-lipped phenotype. More specically, we compared the two ' labiatus ' species to one another and to their sister species by means of geometric morphometric and stomach content analyses; we placedthem in their respective radiations by phylogenetic anddemographic analyses; and we provide eld observa-tions on foraging strategies for one of them ( L. labiatus ). To study the genetic basis of hypertrophied lips, werst applied comparative transcriptome analyses (RNA- seq) on the basis of Illumina next-generation sequencing of juvenile and adult individuals of the African speciesL. labiatus (in comparison with a closely related species for which a genome sequence is available). In a secondstep, we tested candidate genes identied by RNAseqin representatives of both radiations in a quantitativereal-time PCR environment. Materials and methods Study species This study focuses on two thick-lipped species, Lobochil- otes labiatus from East Amphilophus Lobochilotes the rock-dwelling Tanganyikan cichlid tribe Tropheini and therefore part of the most species- rich group of cichlids, the haplochromines, whichinclude the Tanganyikan Tropheini, many riverine spe-cies and the species flocks of Lakes Victoria and Malawi(Salzburger et al. 2002, 2005). The Tropheini themselves underwent a subradiation within Lake Tanganyika (seee.g. Sturmbauer et al. is part of the Midas Cichlid assemblage in Nicaragua and occurs in the large Central American lakes Managua and Nicaragua, where it co-occurs with the most com-mon species in the area, A. citrinellus (Barlow 1976; Bar- luenga & Meyer 2010). For this study, we sampled atotal of 84 and 74 specimens of the Central Americanspecies Amphilophus citrinellus and A. labiatus , respec- L. 14 addi- tional Haplochromini/Tropheini specimens from Lake Tanganyika. Exact sampling locations and dates for specimens used for the genetic analysis and GenBankaccession numbers are provided in Appendix S1. Sampling, DNA and RNA extraction Sampling of L. labiatus and other Tropheini species was performed between 2007 and 2011 in the Southern part of Lake Tanganyika, East Africa; A. labiatus and its congen- ers were collected in September 2009 in the two large Nic- araguan lakes Managua and Nicaragua (see Appendix S1for details). Fishes were processed in the eld followingour standard operating procedure: shes were individu-ally labelled, measured (total and standard length) andweighted and a photograph was taken from the left side Lake TanganyikaLake Nicaragua (1) Map of the Southern hemisphere showing the two study systems, the Midas Cichlid (Amphilophus sp.) species complex in Nicaragua, Central America, and the Tropheini in Lake Tanganyika, East Africa. \u00a92012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd672 M. COLOMBO ET AL. 105of each specimen using a Nikon P5000 or a Nikon D5000 digital camera (ns were spread out using clips); then, apiece of muscle tissue and a n-clip were taken as DNAsample and preserved in ethanol; shes were then dis-sected and RNA samples from lip and other tissues were preserved in RNAlater (Ambion); the whole intestinal tract was removed and stored in ethanol. For DNA extraction, we either applied a high-salt extraction method (Bruford et al. 1998) or used a Mag- naPure extraction robot (Roche, Switzerland) followingthe manufacturer's protocol. RNA was extracted accord-ing to the Trizol method with either Trizol (Invitrogen)or TRI reagent (Sigma). Lip tissue was homogenized with a PRO200 Homogenizer (PRO Scientic Inc.) or with a BeadBeater (FastPrep-24; MP Biomedicals).DNase treatment following the DNA Free protocol(Ambion) was performed to remove any genomic DNAfrom the samples. Subsequent reverse transcription wasachieved by using the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit(Applied Biosystems). For the A. burtoni samples, up to two individuals (adults) or up to eight individuals (juveniles) were used per sample, due to a diminutive amount of lip tissue extracted from these shes. Allother samples were taken from a single specimen. Phylogenetic and demographic analyses We rst wanted to phylogenetically place the thick-lipped species into the respective clade of East African and Nicaraguan cichlids. We thus performed a phyloge- netic analysis of the Tanganyikan cichlid tribe Tropheini(see also Sturmbauer et al. 2003) and used haplotype genealogies to reconstruct the evolutionary history in themuch younger Amphilophus species assemblage in Nica- ragua, where phylogenetic analyses are not expedientdue to the lack of phylogenetic signal (see also Barluengaet al. 2006; Barluenga & Meyer 2010). We also performed mismatch analyses within A. citrinellus, A. labiatus and L. labiatus to compare their demographic histories. We amplied three gene segments for each of the three focal species and additional Tropheini/Haplo-chromini species: the rst segment of the noncodingmtDNA control region and two nuclear loci containingcoding and noncoding DNA (a segment each of theendothelin 1, ednrb1 and the phosphatidin phospha- tase 1, phpt1). We used previously published primers L-Pro-F (Meyer et al. 1994) and TDK-D (Lee et al. 1995) for the control region and ednrb1F and ednrb1R (Langet al. 2006) for ednrb1 , and cycle sequencing were DNA sequencing. The resulting sequences were complemented with already available sequences. In the case of the Trophe- ini, we also included available sequences of the numbers).Sequences were aligned with MAFFT (Katoh & Toh 2008) resulting in a total length of 2345 bp phylogenetic analyses of the Tropheini were performed for each gene segment separately (not shown) and for a concatenatedalignment with P AUP*(Swofford 2003) and M RBAYES (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003), respectively. Theappropriate model of sequence evolution was detectedwith JMODELTEST (Posada 2008) applying the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). A maximum-likelihoodbootstrap analysis with 100 pseudoreplicates was per- formed in P AUP*, and M R.BAYES was run for eight mil- lion generations with a sample frequency of 100 and a burn-in of 10%. We then used M ESQUITE (www.mes quiteproject.org) to map feeding specializations on theresulting maximum-likelihood and to recon-struct ancestral character states with parsimony. Dataon feeding mode from the Haplochromini/Tropheinispecies other than L. labiatus are based on Brichard (1989), Nori (1997), Yamaoka (1997) and Konings (1998). Haplotype genealogies for the Amphilophus data set were constructed following the method described in thestudy by Salzburger et al. (2011) on the basis of a maxi- mum-likelihood tree and sequences of the mitochon-drial control region and the nuclear ednrb1 gene ( phpt1 was not used here due to the limited number of haplo-types found). Mismatch analyses were performed on the basis of mtDNA sequences with A RLEQUIN 3.0 (Excofer et al. 2005). Geometric morphometric analyses In order to test for similarities in overall body shape between the thick-lipped forms from Central Americaand East Africa, we performed geometric morphometric analyses on the basis of digital images. Body shape was quantied in a set of 58 A. citrinellus ,2 7A. labiatus and 27 L. labiatus using 17 homologous landmarks (see Appen- dix S2; note that lip shape was not assessed to prevent abias). Data acquisition was carried out using TPSDIG (Ro- hlf 2006), and data were analysed with M ORPHO J (Klingen- berg 2011). For all shape comparisons, we used theresiduals of a within-species regression of shape on cen- troid size to reduce allometric effects within species, Publishing LtdTHE THICK-LIPPED PHENOTYPE IN CICHLIDS 673 106order to retain shape differences between differently sized species. For the same reason, we only included L. labiatus individuals with a body size larger than 12 cm totallength. We then performed a discriminant function analy-sis between all pairs of species and a principal component analysis (PCA). To identify morphological changes associ- ated with the enlarged lip phenotype, we comparedA. labiatus to its closest relative, A. citrinellus . In the case ofL. labiatus , we made use of our new phylogeny of the Tropheini (Fig. 2a) and body shape data of L. labiatus and its nine closest relatives [ Salzburger, unpublished data)] to reconstruct the landmark congu-ration of the direct ancestor to L. labiatus . This was carried out in M ORPHO J using branch length-weighted squared- change parsimony. The changes in landmark congura-tions along a discriminant function (Nicaraguan species)or along the shape-change vector from the estimated ancestral shape to L. labiatus were increased threefold to produce Fig. 3. The shape differences between species shown in Fig. 3 accurately reflect the shape-change vec-tors for landmark positions. Outlines were interpolatedand added to Fig. 3 to help the reader envision theseshape differences in the context of sh body shape. Stomach and gut content analyses To assess trophic specialization of the thick-lipped cich-lid species, we performed comparative stomach and gutcontent analyses. To this end, stomachs and guts wereopened step-by-step. First, the stomach was opened andemptied under a binocular followed by the remainingparts of the intestine. All items were grouped intoseven food categories: hard-shelled (crustaceans, snails, mussels), small arthropods (insects and zooplankton), sh scales, sh remains, plant seeds and plant materialother than seeds. For each specimen, the wet weight ofeach food category was measured on a Kern ALS 120-4scale (Kern, Germany) and was then used to calculateSchoener's index of proportional diet overlap (Schoener1970). We analysed stomach and gut contents in a totalof 159 specimens: A. citrinellus (N=58; of which 25 had contents), A. labiatus (N=62; 34) and L. labiatus (N=39; 29). We note that such an analysis has the drawback that it only covers food uptake in the last fewhours or days before sampling. Field observations in Lobochilotes labiatus The feeding behaviour of L. labiatus was observed at our eld site near Mpulungu, Zambia, in concrete ponds(1.591.591 m). The purpose of these observations under semi-natural conditions and with wild specimenswas to document if and how the lips are used in process-ing the main prey item identied in the stomach contentanalyses. The ponds were equipped with stones of ~20- 30 cm diameters that covered the ground and formedcaves as they occur naturally in the habitat of L. labiatus . Each pond was stocked with ve to six freshly caught andunharmed adult individuals of L. labiatus . After an accli- matization period of at least 4 days, sh were offeredsnails of different sizes and their feeding behaviour wasrecorded with two underwater cameras (Canon Ixus 65with WP-DC3 underwater case; Olympus ltough-6000) for a period of 1 h each. Comparative gene expression assays using RNAseq For the identication of differentially expressed genesin thick-lipped species, we performed RNA sequencing(RNAseq) comparing lip tissue from a thick-lipped spe-cies to lip tissue from a reference species. We decided to perform these experiments in the African species L. labiatus and to use the closely related species Astatoti- lapia burtoni as reference taxon for several reasons such as the availability of laboratory strains and of sufcientRNA samples from adult and juvenile individuals. Mostimportantly, we chose this set-up because of the avail-ability of various genomic resources for A. burtoni , such as a whole-genome sequence and a set of ~50 000 partly annotated expressed sequence tags (ESTs) (Salzburgeret al. 2008; Baldo et al. 2011), which is crucial for the analysis and interpretation for RNAseq data. Suchresources are currently not publicly available forAmphilophus . In a rst step, RNA was extracted from adult and juvenile individuals of L. labiatus and A. burtoni (see above for the RNA extraction protocol). RNA quality and quantity were determined on a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientic) and by gel elec-trophoresis. RNA samples were pooled to create foursamples subjected to RNA sequencing (RNAseq):(i)A. (N=3). Five micrograms of RNA per RNAseq sample was sent for Illumina sequencing at the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering (D-BSSE), Univer- sity of Basel and ETH Zurich. For library constructionand sequencing, standard protocols were applied. Poly-A mRNA was poly-T oligo-attachedmagnetic beads. followed by second-strand cDNA synthesis using DNA polymerase \u00a92012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd674 M. COLOMBO ET AL. 107I and RNaseH. cDNA went through an end-repair process, the addition of a single 'A' base and ligation ofthe adapters. It was then puried and enriched withPCR to create the nal cDNA library. Each library wassequenced in one lane on an Illumina Genome AnalyzerIIx (read length was 76 bp). Illumina reads are available from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) at NCBI under the accession number SRA052992. The Illumina reads were assembled into three different data sets for further analyses: (i) a quality-ltered data set(Data set 1), where the quality of the reads was assessedwith the FASTX toolkit tools implemented 2010; Goecks 2010)]; low-quality reads were discarded applying quality lter cut-off values of 22 -33. (ii) a quality-ltered plus trimmed data set (Data set 2), inwhich all the reads were trimmed to a length of 42 bp toevaluate the effects of read length (iii) as a control for the effect of trimming and ltering, a nonquality-ltered, nontrimmed data set (Data set 3). The reads of the three data sets were then aligned to a reference cichlid assembly (Baldo et al. 2011) with N OVOALIGN 2.07.06 (http://www.novocraft.com/) after indexing the reference sequences 0.6Maximum likelihood Bayesian posterior probabilitites(a) (b) mtDNA control region ednrb1AX W UV T R S Q PN OK L MJIHD GFE CB A labiatus Fig. 2 Evolutionary origin of the thick-lipped species in East African Lake Tanganyika and in the Great Lakes of Nicaragua.

The alignment was performed using default settings with a maximum alignment score (t) of 180 and a maximum number of alignments for a single read (e)of 100; reads with multiple alignment locations werediscarded. Next SAM TOOLS version 0.1.18 (Li et al. 2009) was used to sort and index the les and to generatecount les, which were subsequently transformed intocount tables and analysed in the R package DES EQver- sion 1.0.5 (Anders & Huber 2010). Differentially expressed genes between the four experimental groups were detected using a model based on a negative bino-mial distribution implemented in DES EQ. Differentially expressed genes with P-values (adjusted for multiple testing) >0.05 and/or a quotient of variance >1.00 were discarded to reduce the number of false positives. Theremaining differentially expressed genes of all pairwisecomparisons were tested for multiple hits. Next the hits of the three data sets were compared with each other to create a candidate gene list, consisting of genes thatwere found in multiple analyses in all three data sets.Lastly, these hits were compared to the annotatedA. burtoni ESTs of Baldo et al. (2011). Comparative gene expression assays using quantitative real-time PCR Based on their function according to gene ontology terms (GO terms; http://www.geneontology.org/) andtheir putative involvement in lip formation and/orhypertrophy in other organisms, six candidate genes were selected out of the list of differentially expressed genes for further characterization by means of quantita-tive claudin (Cldn7 ; see Table 1 for primer details). qPCR experiments were performed in total of 36 cichlid specimens: L. labiatus (six adults, six juve- niles), A. burtoni (six adults, six juveniles), A. labiatus (six adults) and A. citrinellus (six adults). By performing two pairwise comparisons between a thick-lipped and a normal-lipped species (a species pair each from Africaand Nicaragua), we effectively control for species-specic expression differences, as genes specic to thick-lip tissue should be upregulated in both comparisons. The experiments were conducted on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) the ribosomal ) as endogenous controls. Average relative quantications(RQ) were calculated for the six experimental groups andsubsequently analysed with a two-tailed unpaired t-testusing G RAPH PADPRISM version 5.0a for Mac OS X (www. graphpad.com). We compared the expression levelsbetween the two thick-lipped species and a closely relatednormally lipped species (i.e. vs.A. burtoni and A. labiatus vs.A. citrinellus ). of the thick-lipped cichlid species in Central America and in Lake Tanganyika.

As primer efciency was lower in the Nicaraguansamples, no direct comparisons between African andNicaraguan tissues were possible. Results Phylogenetic and demographic analyses Our phylogenetic analysis of members of the Tanganyi- kan cichlid tribe Tropheini based on two mitochondrialand two nuclear DNA gene segments reveals only lim-ited phylogenetic resolution between the main lineagesof the tribe (Fig. 2a). This conrms an earlier analysisbased on mitochondrial DNA only, which attributed the star-like phylogeny of the Tropheini to the rapidity of lineage formation in the early stages of the adaptiveradiation of this clade (Sturmbauer et al. 2003). Just as in the previous study, the thick-lipped species L. labiatus represents a separate lineage (without a closely relatedsister-taxon) that branches off relatively early in thephylogeny, but shows afnities to the algae-eatinggenera ednrb1 gene (Fig. 2b) revealed haplotype shar- ing citrinellus and A. labiatus (see also Barlu- enga & Meyer 2010). While all Amphilophus sequences were identical in phpt1, we detected three shared haplo- types in ednrb1 and 24 haplotypes in the mitochondrialcontrol region (two shared, ten unique to A. labiatus and twelve unique to A. citrinellus ). The mismatch analyses based on the mitochondrial control region sequences revealed unimodal distribu-tions for the two sympatrically occurring Amphilophus species and a bimodal distribution for L. labiatus (Fig. 2c). According to this analysis, the demographicexpansion of the two Amphilophus species happened at similar times, with the one of A. citrinellus being slightly older than that of A. labiatus (mean number of differ- ences: 3.9 vs. 3.2; : 3.9 vs. 3.5; see also Barluenga &Meyer 2010, who provide a relative time frame for the evolution of the Midas Cichlid species complex); the mean number of differences in L. labiatus was 6.4 ( : 6.5). Geometric morphometric analyses The PCA of overall body shape revealed substantialoverlap between the two Nicaraguan species A. citrinel- lusand A. labiatus (Appendix S3). The African thick- lipped species L. labiatus is separated from these mainly by principal component 1 (accounting for 20.2% of thevariance), whereas principal component 2 (covering16.0% of the variance) did not discriminate muchbetween species. The discriminant function analysis, inwhich we compared species in a pairwise manner,revealed the main morphological differences betweenspecies. Of the two Nicaraguan species, A. labiatus had a more acute head, less deep body and a larger mouththan A. citrinellus (Fig. 3) (see also Klingenberg et al. 2003). These characters were even more pronounced inL. labiatus , when compared to either of the Amphilophus species. However, the distance in morphospace betweenthe two species with fleshy lips was somewhat smallerthan between A. citrinellus and L. labiatus (procrustes distance 0.08 and 0.1, respectively). We also estimated the body shape of the ancestor of L. labiatus and the 9 most closely related Tropheini species. A comparison of this reconstructed shape and the mean shape of ourL. labiatus samples highlighted similar morphological differences as the comparison of the Nicaraguan species(Fig. 3), especially in the mouth region. Stomach and gut content analyses The fractions of food categories in guts and stomachsdiffered between A. citrinellus ,A. labiatus and L. labiatus (Fig. 3c). While the diet of A. citrinellus did not overlap with that of A. overlap between A. labiatus and L. labiatus (Schoener's index: that any value >0.6 is considered 'biologically signicant'; see Wallace 1981). The stomach and gut contents of bothTable 1 Primers used for the quantita- tive real-time careful inspection of the video material conrmed thendings from the stomach and gut content analyses thatL. labiatus regularly feeds on snails (more than 90% of the stomach and gut content of L. labiatus consisted of snail shells). Small snails were engulfed using suctionfeeding without the lips touching the prey item or thesurface (rocks) on which the items were placed. When feeding on larger snails, however, L. labiatus exhibited a different feeding strategy and snails were no longer taken up using suction feeding. Instead, L. labiatus used their lips to snatch the snails and they turned the snailsa few times before they either swallowed the snails orspat them out (see Appendix S4). Comparative gene expression assays using RNAseq On average, ca. 42 million total reads were retrieved foreach of the four RNAseq samples ( A. burtoni adult, A. burtoni juvenile, L. labiatus adult and L. labiatus juve- nile). Quality ltering and trimming reduced this num-ber so that on average 21.9 (Data set 1), 24.6 (Data set 2)and 23.5 (Data set 3) million reads were aligned to thereference cichlid assembly. Five different pairwise com- parisons were made to obtain genes that are differen- tially expressed between thick lips and normal lips (seeTable 2 for the three comparisons with the highestnumber of genes being different). The largest numberof differentially expressed genes between L. labiatus and A. burtoni was detected in adult lip tissue, with the majority of the genes being upregulated in L. labiatus . The total number of differentially expressed genes ran- ged from 9050 (Data set 3; three pairwise comparisons) to 15230 (Data set 2; ve pairwise comparisons). A sub-stantial fraction of these differentially expressed genesappeared in at least two comparisons in each data set(Data set 1: 2085 [22.1% of all hits]; Data set 2: 8078[53.0%]; Data set 3: 1693 [18.7%]). Of these 'multiplehits', 1463 were detected in all three data sets and 560of those could be unequivocally annotated. A more stringent analysis, in which only loci that appeared in at least three of ve comparisons wereincluded, resulted in 231 differentially expressed genes. A functional annotation of these 231 hits with Blast2GO resulted in a total of 141 annotations (122 upregulatedand 19 downregulated in L. labiatus ; see Appendix S3). Based on their annotations, known functions and/orexceptional fold change ( >1000) between A. burtoni and L. labiatus , thirteen genes were identied as good candi- dates for being involved in the morphogenesis of fleshylips (Table 3). Comparative gene expression assays using quantitative real-time PCR The results of the comparative gene expression assays between the thick-lipped species and the normal-lippedspecies are depicted in Fig. 4 and Appendix S5. Overall,the qPCR experiments largely validate differential gene expression in normal and hypertrophied lip tissue as indi- cated by RNAseq. In the African species pair L. labiatus andA. burtoni , which were the two species used for RNA- seq, differences were highly signicant to point out one inconsistency between RNAseq andqPCR. Actb was actually found to be downregulated in hypertrophied lips by RNAseq, while it shows signi-cantly higher expression levels in lip tissue in the qPCRexperiments (Fig. 4). The comparison between lip tissue in adult and juvenile L. labiatus and A. burtoni further revealed a trend towards higher expression in lip tissue of adult L. labiatus inActb, BNIP3 ,Cldn7 andCopb (Appendix S5), whereas, is observed in A. burtoni , although sta- tistical support was only found in two cases [ Cldn7 (P=0.0063) and ACSL4 (P=0.0328)]. This again suggests that these genes are involved in the formation of fleshylips. In the Nicaraguan species pair, a similar trend wasobserved as in the African species pair, with four of theve genes tested appearing to be upregulated in lip tissue Comparison Data set 1 Data set 2 Data set 3 AB vs. of upregulated and downregulated genes in L. labiatus .Table 2 Pairwise comparisons of differ- entially expressed genes and total numberof unique differentially expressed genes in the three data sets compiled in this study \u00a92012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd678 M. COLOMBO ET AL. 111ofA. labiatus as compared to A. citrinellus (Fig. 4; we could not amplify BNIP3 here). We would like to note, however, that qPCR efciency was less good in the Amphilophus samples, most likely because we used prim- ers designed for the African species pair based on theavailable genomic resources, which also explains thelimited statistical support for these comparisons.Interestingly, it seems that several loci (i.e. Actb,Cldn7 , Copb ,His3) are upregulated in both thick-lipped species when compared to their normally lipped relatives. Discussion The species flocks of cichlid shes in the East AfricanGreat Lakes Victoria, Malawi and Tanganyika, countinghundreds of endemic species each, are prime examplesof adaptive and explosive speciation (see radiations in East Africa have independently produced ecomorphs with highly similarcolour patterns and (mouth) morphologies (Kocher et al. 1993). Here, we explore the ecological and genetic basisof one of the particular trophic structures of cichlids,which has evolved convergently in various cichlidassemblages: fleshy lips. Instead of focusing on specieswith hypertrophied lips between the radiations in the East African lakes, we compare the thick-lipped pheno- type between a cichlid assemblage in East African (LakeTanganyika) and in Central American (the lake Nicara-gua/Managua system), where thick-lipped species haveevolved in parallel (see Fig. 1).Table 3 Thirteen candidate loci for the genetic basis of lip development in the East African cichlid Lobochilotes labiatus , based with Astatotilapia burtoni , in combination with information on gene functions AB LL03 2 Fig. 4 Results from the comparative gene expression experiments via quantitative real-time PCR. The six genes tested in this experi- ment were selected on the basis of comparative RNA sequencing. All genes tested show a higher expression level in lip tissue of the Tanganyikan thick-lipped species L. labiatus as compared to A. burtoni (top panel; note that we used both juvenile and adult samples in these analyses to increase statistical power). A similar trend was found when comparing the Nicaraguan thick-lipped speciesA. labiatus to its sister species A. citrinellus (with the exception of ACSL4; lower panel). Note that BNIP3 could not cichlid adaptive Our phylogenetic and demographic analyses in the Tanganyikan Tropheini and the Nicaragua MidasCichlid species complex reveal that the thick-lippedspecies are nested within their respective clade. Themolecular phylogeny of 14 Tropheini species (Fig. 2a)shows characteristic for adaptive radiations: a 'bottom heavy' topology with only limited phyloge- netic resolution at the deeper nodes due to rapid line-age formation (Gavrilets & Vose 2005). Our newanalysis thus conrms previous results based onmtDNA only (Sturmbauer et al. 2003) or a combination of mtDNA and AFLPs (Koblmuller et al. 2010). In all analyses thus far, the thick-lipped species L. labiatus forms an independent evolutionary lineage that branches off deep in the Tropheini. Its exact position remains unclear, though. In the AFLP phylogeny ofKoblmuller et al. (2010), L. labiatus appears as sister group to all Tropheini except for the genus Tropheus, which is sister to all other representatives of that clade(the topology has very little support, though). In ournew phylogeny and the previous mtDNA trees of Stur-mbauer et al. (2003), L. labiatus shows afnities to Simochromis and Petrochromis (with moderate support). In all phylogenies, however, L. labiatus is nested within a clade formed by various species that feed on algaeand biocover (see our character state reconstruction inFig. 2a). In the Midas Cichlid species complex from Central America, a phylogenetic approach is not applicablewith the available molecular markers. There is simply too little genetic variation, even in the rapidly evolving mitochondrial control region, as a consequence of theyoung age of the assemblage (see Barluenga & Meyer2004, 2010; Barluenga et al. 2006). The structures of our haplotype genealogies, which now also include theanalysis of a nuclear gene (Fig. 2b), conrm thisscenario. In combination with the mismatch analyses(Fig. 2c), these data suggest that A. labiatus underwent its main demographic expansion soon after the expan-sion of the sympatric A. citrinellus populations (see Barluenga & Meyer 2010 for a large-scale analysis ofthe Midas Cichlid species complex). In both species assemblages, the evolution of the thick-lipped phenotype was associated with similarmodications of overall body shape (Fig. 3a,b). Reducedbody depth, a more acute head shape and a larger mouth, along with the prominently enlarged lips, can be hypothesized to be adaptations to the species' micro-habitat and trophic niche. If individuals search for foodin narrow rock crevices, these modications appearadvantageous. Klingenberg et al. (2003) already sug-gested that the elongation of the head, as observed inboth ' labiatus ' species, increases suction power. Other morphological differences between the two thick-lippedspecies, such as eye size or the length of anal n inser-tion, might be either due to adaptations to the specic environments or due to phylogenetic effects. Inclusion of other thick-lipped species in future studies focusingon the ecology and morphological evolution of this traitmight answer this question. The function of hypertrophied lips in cichlids Hypertrophied lips in cichlids have been implicated in several functions. For example, it has been suggested that fleshy lips are used to seal cracks and grooves tofacilitate sucking of invertebrates (Barlow & Munsey1976; Ribbink et al. 1983; Seehausen 1996; Konings 1998), that they act as bumpers to protect from mechan-ical shock (Greenwood 1974; Yamaoka 1997) or thatthey function or mechanoreceptors (Fryer 1959; Fryer & Iles 1972). Previ- ous food analyses on L. labiatus identied this species as mollusc eater (Nori 1997). Our ecomorphological analysis of the thick-lipped species L. labiatus from Lake Tanganyika and A. labiatus from the large lakes in Nicaragua suggests that this phenotype is indeed associated with feeding on hard-shelled prey such as snails, mussels and crustaceans inrocky habitats (Fig. 3c). We cannot, however, conclu- sively answer the question whether the lips are used to seal rock crevices or whether they serve as bumpers orreceptors. In the underwater observations at our eldsite at Lake Tanganyika, small snails were usuallyengulfed by L. labiatus via suction feeding, whereas lar- ger snails were turned around several times beforebeing swallowed or spit out (see Appendix S4). Thiswould classify the lips as instrument to handle hard- shelled invertebrate food (mostly molluscs). Note, how- ever, that our observations were made in semi-naturalconditions only, in the form of concrete ponds equippedwith stones from the lake and lled with lake water. Our experimental set-up could not address the possi- bility that phenotypic plasticity plays a role in the for-mation of fleshy lips, as has previously been shown incertain foraging traits in cichlid Muschick 2011). Interestingly, it has been reported that thick-lipped cichlid species lose theirfleshy lips under unnatural conditions in captivity(when fed with standard food; Barlow & Munsey 1976;Barlow 1976; Loiselle 1998). So far, there is no evidencefor the opposite process, the plastic development offleshy lips due to environmental or feeding properties. In the common garden experiment of Muschick et al. \u00a92012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd680 M. COLOMBO ET AL. 113(2011), one group of normally lipped A. citrinellus indi- viduals was fed with whole snails over a period of sev- eral months, and \u2014although not formally assessed \u2014no increase in lip size was apparent (compared to the othertwo treatment groups peeled snails and crushed snails). Another study on a snail crusher (Huysseune 1995) did not report such changes either, which seems to suggestthat phenotypic plasticity in the lips, if at all present, isspecic to thick-lipped species only. Future commongarden and feeding experiments should thus expand onthis question. Such experiments, combined with molec-ular analyses, should focus on the plastic component ofthis trait and its genomic basis. Insights into the genetic basis of hypertrophied lips in cichlids Our comparative gene expression assays with RNA sequencing between tissue from thick and normal lipsidentied a set of 141 candidate genes that might beresponsible for the morphogenesis or the maintenance of fleshy lips in (East African) cichlid sh (Appendix S3). Six genes were tested further by means of quantita-tive real-time PCR, and these experiments largely con-rm the results obtained from RNAseq (Fig. 4). Whilethere is no obvious functional connection to fleshy lipsfor three of these differentially expressed genes and three ( Actb,Cldn7 and Copb ) makes sense in the light of the structure of hypertrophied lips. Thesethree genes (together with BNIP3 ) also show a higher expression in lip tissue from adult vs. juvenile L. labiatus (Appendix S5). It has previously been shown that the 'fleshy' lips of the Lake Malawi cichlid Otopharynx pachycheilus mainly consist of loose connective tissue covered by dermisand a layer of epithelial cells (Arnegard et al. 2001). Interestingly, the known functions of Actb,Cldn7 and Copb can be directly implicated in cell and/or intercell or membrane structure. The cytoplasmic Actb is found in high abundance in nonmuscle cells, where it pro-motes cell surface and cell thickness (Schevzov et al. 1992), which is also consistent with its upregulation inthe more massive adult compared to juvenile L. labiatus lips (Appendix S5). The integral membrane protein Cldn7 (among other claudin gene family members) con- stitutes the backbone of tide junctions between epithe- lial cells (Tsukita et al. 2001). The coatomer coat proteins (such as Copb ) are involved in protein and membrane trafcking via between (Duden 2003). In addition, theymediate lipid homoeostasis and lipid storage for energy use and membrane assembly (Soni et al. 2009). Copbmight thus be involved in cellular (membrane) development but possibly also in the formation of fatcells that compose adipose tissue, a specic subtype ofconnective tissue. Clearly, much more work will be nec-essary to unravel the development and genetic basis of hypertrophied lips in cichlids, for which we herewith established a valuable starting ground. Our results, especially the comparison of gene expression levels between the thick-lipped species inEast Africa and Central America (Fig. 4), allow us totouch on ongoing discussions related to the geneticbasis of convergent morphologies (reviewed in Brake-eld 2006; Arendt & Reznick 2008; Elmer & Meyer our qPCR results in Midas Cichlid (Amphilophus spp.) species must be taken with caution (efciency was lower as a consequence of usingmolecular tools developed for the African species lead-ing to a lack of statistical power), we nd rather simi-lar trends in gene expression. Our results seem toindicate that a largely overlapping set of genes wasrecruited to develop the hypertrophied lips in Nicara- guan and African species, which are \u2014according to most authors \u2014separated by ~100 million years of evo- lution. This important question about the basis of con- vergent phenotypes should be addressed in futurestudies, and thick-lipped sh species, including thoseoutside the family Cichlidae, appear as an excellentmodel system. Conclusion Our integrative evolutionary, ecological, morphological,observational and genomic analysis of thick-lipped spe-cies in East Africa and in Nicaragua reveals stunningsimilarities between these convergent morphs. Boththick-lipped species appear to have evolved early in therespective clade, they seem to have adapted to the same habitat (rocks) and food source (hard-shelled prey), and their evolution was associated with comparable mor-phological trajectories, especially in the mouth and headregion. Importantly, we also show that the expressionpatterns of at least some genes are similar, too. We thusprovide valuable resource for future studies focusingon the development of this trait and genetic basis ofconvergence. Acknowledgements We would like to thank our helpers in the eld, V.

Furthermore, a top-down approach, by means of RNA sequencing (chapter 6), was used to generate a candidate gene list for the thick-lipped phenotype, which represents the first insight into the genetic basis of this trait that evolved convergently in several cichlid adaptive radiations. In the following I will discuss the genetic basis, the role and mechanisms of gen(om)e duplication and the observed signatures of selection pressure of genes involved in naturally and sexually selected traits in cichlid fishes and put the obtained results in a broader context. The genetic basis of naturally and sexually selected traits As highlighted in the previous chapters, the great ecological diversity of cichlid fishes is brought forward by various naturally and sexually selected traits, which are thought to have played an important role in the evolutionary success of cichlids and which offers great opportunities to study the genetic basis of e.g., adaptation and diversification (e.g., Salzburger 2009). Although in this work no actual functional studies were performed to uncover the exact biochemical, physiological or fitness consequences of the studied loci contributing to the respective traits, my results do give some general insights into the genetics of naturally and sexually selected traits. First of all, several conserved functions within vertebrate lineages and even between vertebrates and insects were previously found for the dlx, Hivep and endothelin gene family members, indicating that these functions are very likely to be conserved in cichlids as well. Functional studies, such as e.g., gene knockout or knockdown studies are often not feasible in non-model organism, including cichlid fishes. Therefore, I used other methods to verify the described and often well-studied functions of the vertebrate or insect orthologs in cichlids. With quantitative real-time PCR I showed that the Edn1/EdnrAa pathway is expressed in the pharyngeal jaw tissue and the Edn3b/EdnrB1a pathway in egg-spot tissue (chapter 2). In chapter 4, I measured gene expression of the Hivep paralogs, in particular after an immune challenge in liver and gills, two tissues where reaction to infection is expected to take place. Here I found a significant positive correlation between expression level and immune response parameters, confirming immune-related functions for the Hivep paralogs in cichlids. Therefore the results of the gene expression assays performed in chapters 2 and 4) together with the known functions in other vertebrates, suggest that (several of) the studied loci are indeed involved in these naturally and sexually selected traits. Specific insight into the genetic basis of the convergent thick-lipped phenotype was obtained by using RNAseq and subsequent comparative quantitative real-time PCR (chapter 6). This approach resulted into a candidate gene list of 141 loci that now can be studied in detail with respect to thick-lipped phenotype in cichlids, including the - so far - not studied species of Lake Malawi and Victoria, as well as other fish species with hypertrophied lips. The comparative gene expression assay of both African and Nicaraguan thick-lipped species revealed similar patterns of gene expression, which indicates an overlap in genes underlying this trait in both species that are believed to 128have been separated by 100 million years of evolution (see chapter 6). It is thus plausible that some of the indentified genes are involved in the thick-lipped phenotype of other (cichlid) fishes as well. Interestingly, Manousaki and colleagues found only a small number of overlapping and differentially expressed genes in four convergent Nicaraguan thick-lipped and thin-lipped species pairs (Manousaki et al. 2013), of which only one loci matched with our list of 141 candidate genes. These results clearly demonstrate that many genes are likely to be involved in this morphological trait and that more work is needed to uncover, especially the overlap of genes in convergent cases . Furthermore, identifying the genetic pathways, to which these genes belong, should become the focus, as well as screening major candidate genes (i.e., genes typically differentially expressed in multiple thick-lipped species), and their regulatory regions, for adaptive changes. These efforts should help to get a better understanding of the complex genetic basis underlying this convergent morphological trait. The role and mechanisms of gen(om)e duplication in the evolution of naturally and sexually selected traits It is clear that gen(om)e duplications play a major role in the evolution of phenotypic diversity across species (Ohno 1970; Sidow 1996). Gen(om)e duplications provide the raw genetic material on which mutation, drift and selection can act (Ohno 1970; Force et al. 1999; Prince & Pickett 2002; Zhang 2003). The three gene families studied in chapters 2, 3 and 4 are hypothesized to have evolved by whole genome duplication events (Stock et al. 1996; Braasch et al. 2009; Renz et al. 2011; Figure 7.1) a nd based on their (presumed) functions, offer valuable insights into the evolution of duplicates in relation to naturally and sexually selected traits in cichlid fishe s. A variety of mechanisms is known by which duplicated genes can contribute to the evolution of phenotypic diversity. Although most of the duplicated genes become pseudogenes through nonfunctionalization (see Lynch 2000; Zhang 2003), several other mechanisms are described that maintain the duplicated, or paralogous, genes. Functional conservation of the duplicates can evolve through gene conversion (concerted evolution) or strong purifying selection, in which the sequences of the duplicates are either highly similar or only differ at synonymous positions (Zhang 2003). This way higher levels of gene products are produced via gene dosage. The ancestral functions can, furthermore, be divided over the two paralogous genes via subfunctionalization (Force et al. 1999), while novel functions can arise via neofunctionalization by the fixation of beneficial mutations (Ohno 1970). Especially the latter is commonly regarded as major cause underlying the evolution of phenotypic diversity. Teleost fishes are characterized by three rounds of whole genome duplication events, which have been hypothesized to underlie the great species diversity: two in the lineage towards vertebrates (Sidow 1996) followed by a fish specific whole genome duplication (Taylor et al. 2001; 2003; Meyer & Postlethwait 2012; Figure 7.1). Cichlid fishes, having an exceptionally high species diversity, are great model systems to study the role of gene duplication during the evolution of naturally and sexually selected traits. In fact, many of the previously identified loci involved in naturally and sexually selected traits of 129 Figure 7.1. G e n ( om)e duplication hypotheses for the candidate gene families. Depicted are the presumed ancestral states of the loci ('Ancestor'), the initial tandem duplication (TD) of the dlx locus and the three rounds of whole genome duplication (First round of Whole Genome Duplication (1 round of Whole Genome the Fish Specific Genome Duplication (FSGD)) . The top part of the figure represents the teleost repertoire, although species - specific losses are known for e.g., the dlx g e n e f a m i l y . G e n e s a r e s h o w n a s b o x e s , w h i l e nonfunctionalization is depicted as an empty line/genomic region. Colored boxes are the loci studied in chapters 2, 3 and 4 . After Braasch et al. 2009; Renz et al. 2011 . cichlids, belong to different gene families (e.g., bmp4 is involved in jaw formation (Albertson et al. 2005), csf1ra is expressed in egg-dummies (Salzburger et al. 2007) and a fhl2 duplicate is involved in the evolution of egg-spots (Santos et al. in prep)). My work on the Hivep, dlx and endothelin gene families provides further indications that loci produced by gen(om)e duplication are of particular relevance for naturally and sexually selected traits in cichlid fishes, since several of the studied loci can be associated with such traits in cichlids ( see chapter 2, 3, 4). While the studied endothelin paralogs (ligands and receptors) are involved in distinct traits (i.e., mouth morphology versus pigmentation; see Braasch et al. 2009; chapter 2), i t seems that several dlx paralogs are involved in the same traits (e.g., pharyngeal arches and egg- spot development; Renz et al. 2011; chapter 3). This is also the case for the Hivep paralogs, for which immune-related functions for three of the paralogs were found (chapter 4). However, inferring the precise mechanisms by which these individual paralogs have been retained is hard without accurate and complete functional analyses. It is clear that nonfunctionalization occurred, as expected, in all three families and that concerted evolution is not observed in these families. Neo- and/or subfunctionalization are thus believed to play an important role in the evolution of these three gene families in of selection pressure in naturally and sexually selected traits In the previous I have proposed putative roles for the candidate gene family members in natural and sexually selected traits Since molecular evolution is - partly - responsible for evolutionary innovations (Yang 2002), genes underlying such traits are hypothesized to be subject to molecular selection favoring new or adaptive alleles (i.e., molecular adaptation; Yang 2006). Therefore, detailed screens of possible effects of selection can give insights into the mode of selection pressure (i.e., purifying, neutral or positive) on these candidate genes. My approach consisted of comparing nuclear sequences from different cichlid species, in which each species was represented by a single individual, to calculate nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratios. By using this method I focus on divergence between species instead of polymorphisms within a species and it is, thus, impossible to differentiate between fixed and non-fixed substitutions per species, which might have affected - to some degree - the results presented here. More comprehensive population genetic approaches are available which take into account both the polymorphisms within species and the divergence between species, such as the McDonald-Kreitman test (McDonald & Kreitman 1991), which needs at least two samples per species. In this work I was primarily interested in the divergence between cichlid lineages to study the molecular adaptation among closely related species. In fact, the dN/dS approach is widely used, and originally developed, for interspecific comparisons to detect positive selection (Goldman & Yang 1994; Yang 2006; Jensen et al. 2007; Kryazhimskiy & Plotkin 2008). I thus, assume that the observed variable sites are fixed substitutions between species, although this assumption is expected to be violated, to some extend. I found different signatures of molecular selection acting upon the candidate loci, both within and between gene f a m i l i e s . These results generally imply that selection pressure is very different among loci involved in naturally and sexually selected traits, although certain families, Hivep in particular, seem to be characterized by positive select ion, with only one locus evolving more conserved (chapter 4). In fact, it is known that complex phenotypes are often controlled by many interacting genes (Nadeau 2001) and that few changes in a small number of genes can change the spatio and/or temporal expression of signaling pathways, which can subsequently become co-opted for a new function that underlies the evolution of novelties (Orr 2005; Abzhanov et al. 2008). Selection on such beneficial changes may then, leave only local signatures of positive selection in these few regions, while the rest of the pathway is not characterized by elevated dN/dS ratios. It could thus be that e.g., beneficial substitutions occurred in other members of the endothelin pathways, slightly changing its functions, which led to the co-option of the whole pathway for functions in the morphogenesis of the pharyngeal jaw apparatus and egg-spots (chapter 2). Also, I did not sequence the full coding regions, potentially missing important amino acid substitutions, although most loci which were characterized by positive selection had several regions with elevated dN/dS ratios (see sliding window plots in chapters 2 and 4). Taken my results together then it is clear that positive selection is commonly observed in the Hivep immune-related genes, part of the dlx repertoire and absent in the endothelin family of ligands and receptors (although variation between individual 131loci within families is observed). Thus, different types of selection pressure are observed in these candidate genes for naturally and sexually selected traits in cichlids. In conclusion, the results of my doctoral thesis provide valuable insights into the molecular evolutionary genetics of three specific gene families and offers exciting new insights into the genetic basis of one specific convergent adaptive trait: the thick-lipped phenotype observed in both Nicaraguan species. 132References Abzhanov A, Extavour CG, Groover A, et al.
