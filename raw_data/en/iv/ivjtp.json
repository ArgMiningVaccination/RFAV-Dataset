By Mark Metherell Kerryn Phelps recalls her near-death experience to explain partly how she came to challenge norms of conventional medicine and arouse scepticism among many of her fellow doctors. In April 2003, when president of the Australian Medical Association, Phelps fell desperately ill with clots on the lung. In convalescence, her treating doctor sat at the end of the hospital bed and issued a caution to the otherwise fit 45-year-old patient: when she reached menopause she should not take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) unless she also took the blood thinning drug warfarin. The brush with drug-linked illness, she says, fuelled her inclination to adopt a holistic approach and question some mainstream therapies. ''Certain medicines I simply cannot touch again.'' As it happens, in the years since emerging evidence of a cancer link prompted a worldwide plunge in the use of HRT, a trend now associated with a striking fall in certain types of breast cancer. To those critics who disparage her espousal of herbal medicine, Phelps, the one-time leader of mainstream medicine, now flings backs the HRT debacle as an example of how orthodox medicines can go awry at huge cost in death and disease. She points to burgeoning evidence challenging other routinely prescribed treatments such as antidepressants for moderate depression and of common drug-based approaches, including use of Ritalin for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder. Expect to hear more from Phelps. She is now back on the public stage as the recently elected president of the Australasian Integrative Medicine Association and this week went to Canberra to push for more support and recognition. Its supporters describe integrative medicine as the blending of conventional and natural or complementary medicines and therapies along with lifestyle interventions and a holistic approach. This takes into account the physical, psychological, social and spiritual wellbeing of the person - with the aim of using the most appropriate, safe and evidence-supported treatments available. For instance, children with hyperactivity disorder can benefit from more exercise and dietary change with nutritional supplements such as magnesium, zinc and omega-3 before being prescribed Ritalin, the integrative doctors say. For mild to moderate depression, the ancient herbal remedy St John's wort is showing better results without the negative side-effects encountered with antidepressants, Phelps says. Hypnotherapy has been shown to help in countering inflammatory bowel disease. Traditional medicines, meditation, massage, osteopathy are all part of the integrative armamentarium. And even ''contrast showers'' - rotating hot and cold showers to pep up the immune system as advised by the in-house naturopath at Phelps's Surry Hills clinic. She also has a practice at Double Bay. Phelps rejects the use of the word ''alternative'' to describe integrative medicine. ''Holistic'' is her preferred name. ''This is definitely not alternative. This is a mainstream movement,'' she says, pointing to the backing of integrative medicine courses by one-third of United States medical schools and the Royal Australian College of GPs. But many of her senior colleagues remain to be convinced. Her ownership of a health food and remedies store below her Surry Hills practice - a business link not permitted of doctors in Victoria - has some of her peers askance at such commerce. Dr Brian Morton, the outgoing NSW president of the AMA, although a friend of Phelps, is an integrative sceptic. Many doctors would cautiously accept integrative medicine, he says. ''But there would be a large proportion of GPs and other doctors who still question the evidence base of it.'' An example was St John's wort. If it were so great why had no pharmaceutical giant exploited it? A popular alternative to arthritis treatment, glucosamine, has drawn doubts in more recent studies as well, Morton says. A leading crusader against medicinal hocus pocus, Dr Ken Harvey, said he had no problem with evidence-supported integrative medicine. His problem was with the prescribing of treatment like homeopathy which was ''scientifically implausible'' and for other treatments which might work but were sold in varying formulations because of lack of regulation. Both Harvey, of La Trobe University's public health school, and Morton, agree with Phelps that many patients are looking for more from their doctors than 12 minutes and a script. Patients have become more questioning. They might be the ''worried well, or educated women'' who tend to be keen users of herbal medicine because, as a survey found, it makes them feel more in control. A central demand of integrative medicine is for longer consultations to enable doctors to work through with patients the solutions to the often-complex nature of chronic conditions. Phelps, who charges patients $280 for an hour's consultation, of which Medicare reimburses $97, says that despite the government's health reforms and hypothetical support for longer consultations, Medicare payments remain biased towards shorter visits. Like the AMA campaigner of old, she says: ''The longer you spend with patients, the lower "}
