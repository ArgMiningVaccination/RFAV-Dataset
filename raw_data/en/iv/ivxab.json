With years of experience in naturopathic philosophy, homeopathy, acupuncture, with a passion for holistic healing, he is here to serve you.", "sitename": "Neighborhood Natural Medicine", "date": "2015-05-05", "cleaned_text": "Meet Dr. Joseph Giacona I was blessed to receive life's golden ticket - a second chance - after surviving an acute bout of Lyme disease that left me paralyzed. Following recovery from paralysis I continued to suffer from low energy, frequent colds, poor sleep, sinus issues, allergies, digestive complications, pain, brain fog, terrible skin problems and hair loss. I consulted various doctors with no success, drugs weren't working and I was terrified that I would never recover. My journey to overcome my struggle completely changed when I discovered natural medicine. It was then I realized my body had the power to heal itself. In fact, I realized that the body has such a unique, innate system of healing so exceptionally good, with such massive transformational value that it is almost magical. This was my paradigm shift and everything - my body, my mind, my confidence - started to genuinely heal. With the help of some extraordinary healers, many of whom would soon become my teachers on my path to becoming a doctor in natural medicine myself, I learned 7 critical rules that have become the crux of my philosophy at Neighborhood Natural Medicine: The body, if given the ideal internal/cellular/energetic environment conducive to healing, can heal any disease that is created within the body. All true healing is ultimately self-healing. Do not focus on treating the disease, but on doing whatever is needed to awaken the natural self-healing mechanism within. When this self-healing/self-repair mechanism is awakened, even after decades of being severely ill, miraculous recoveries are possible. If given the appropriate stimulation and kept free from disease causing factors, the body is designed to always move towards health. This self-healing response can be achieved using strictly natural, drug-free methods. There are an infinite number of health complaints/symptoms that exist, but there are only 6-7 causes of disease. And it is that seventh and final rule that is the foundation for our healing system at Neighborhood Natural Medicine. We focus on analyzing and then correcting the 6-7 causes of disease. The 6 - 7 Causes of Disease Checking and verifying the patient has operative detox pathways - liver, kidney, bowel and assessing the patient for toxemia in general. Assessing the patient for nutritional deficiencies, such as amino acids, minerals etc. Analyzing the patients internal communication pathways and their chemical components, namely hormones and neurotransmitters. Checking pH balance. Verify proper cellular energy production/ATP. Ensuring proper metabolic function, enzyme balance and diet. Analyzing the flow & circulation of energy through the body, making sure it is not blocked. Through the unbelievable care and guidance of these healers, and through understanding the 7 vital rules and then correcting the 6-7 causes, I was able to completely heal myself - so much that I was recruited to play division 1 men's basketball at Boston College. Using this exact same process at Neighborhood Natural Medicine we have successfully reduced and eliminated the effects of ill health, as well as its infinite number of symptomatic manifestations with a vast majority of our patients. Training To Be A Holistic Doctor In Natural Medicine Becoming a holistic doctor was quite honestly not my original plan or passion, architecture was actually my first love. Nevertheless, I am a humble member of a lineage of healers that dates back centuries. I cannot take any credit for the results we achieve at Neighborhood Natural Medicine. I know only two things: I have great faith in the body to heal itself, having experienced it myself, and the knowledge and clinical insights my teachers shared with me. In conclusion, although I have over 10 years of formal schooling, with up 10,500 hours of both clinical training and in-class instruction, as mentioned above my true education came over the many years I spent apprenticing along side numerous of the worlds top healing masters and doctors gaining direct, hands-on experience with thousands of patients, gleaning all the essential aspects of my mentor's techniques. These teachers, about eight to nine in total, instructed me in the healing arts of naturopathy, sujok acupuncture, acupuncture, modern naturopathy, homeopathy, meridian analysis, clinical nutrition, neuro-muscular rehabilitation, herbal medicine, clinical kinesiology, bio-resonance testing, detoxification to name a few.
