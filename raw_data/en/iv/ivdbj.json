This is the only calcium supplement she will recommend. I have been using this supplement for years. Reliable co. and quality ilatiy products. Using this stuff along with a healthy diet has my body feeling as good as it's ever felt would def recommend I'm young and a distance runner and have been getting shin splits and just overall concerned with my health of my legs and hips since I've been having injuries mostly on my right side. I decided to try these toe spreaders when someone explained to me that I'm getting injured because I'm compensating for something, like a tight calf, and modern running shoes are really good about giving you tight calves since your heels are higher than your toes and your toe box is really narrow. These correct toes are not an aggressive spreader like some other brands, they're just as your feet are supposed to be so I recommend them for beginners or as a staple. I also wasn't sure if they would really be useful for me since I already do have a little bit of space between my toes, even though I wear narrow toe box shoes. However, I definitely feel them working when I put them on, especially on my pinky toes where I don't have as much strength to forcibly stretch them out like I had been doing. I recommend everyone try them to explore your natural biomechanics that most of us have lost! I have been using another Cortisol supplement so I thought I would give Cortisol Recovery a try. This works equally as well and is definitely cheaper than the one I have been using. I will continue to use this product! Great customer service. I got the delivery address wrong and they immediately isent me a replacement order I have found this product to be great! I did take as directed at first, but it was too much so have cut back to two in the evening which works great. I have been prescribed carditone by my Doctor for years. When I went to another doctor (after the other died), he didn't prescribed much. When I changed to another doctor, my BP was 200! I remembered my first doctor recommended carditone, so I started taking it on my own (two tabs a day). In about 2-3 months, my BP was 119/84!! I credit carditone (along with cardiopeptase) for my great result! I have used Aller G Plus for a number of years to help keep my sinuses open and it really helps! Natural Athlete's Clinic has always been prompt in filing my orders. Thank you. 15 yo my digestive system fell apart after getting sick from food and/or water then taking an antibiotic and anti-fungal prescribed while vacationing in Mexico. The story is too long for this purpose but know that after trying every diet to manage I.B.S. and a few prescription pills, I was left with an extremely minimal diet & massive loss of energy due to bloating and chronic diarrhea from seemingly almost everything I ate. Years later I was prescribed Digestive Formula & it worked. I eat a Mediterranean styled diet that is diverse and if taken along with a few other supplements, I rarely if ever suffer from the gas bloating or the chronic diarrhea. I was told by the prescribing practitioner that I would need to take this Digestive formula for the rest of my life & after switching PHC I chose not to take it for nine months or so and that was a mistake. I ended up having a sever I.B.S. upset for almost two months and lost 10 pounds without trying in my late 40's........SO happily back on the Digestive Formula and not looking back! Life without fresh fruits and vegetables sucks in my humble opinion. Mangia! Very good quality products and good service I've been using this product for years. It provides the extra fiber I missed. Keeps my colon clean. I started using Correct Toes almost a year ago after suffering with Plantar's Fasciitis for 6 years. It has been an amazing transformation with my foot pain. Within a month of weary, I had very little pain left. Combined with using toe socks and moving to barefoot foot ware, I only have a little stiffness in the morning but can walk, hike, etc for hours without pain. I'm so grateful I found this product after so many years of suffering. I wish more people would understand how much we ruin our feet weary today's styles. It's not worth it! A NP doctor recommended this to me and I could not be happier. My digestive system has definitely improved. I am 60, I workout hard 5-6days a week. I've had a torn meniscus and torn ACL in my left knee for 10 years. I'm trying to avoid surgery for as long as I can. I stay off sugar and take Joint pill and Inflammation Relief every day for the past 4 months. It's making a difference. Pain is lessened by about 30% My bunions and hammer toes have gotten worse and worse over the last 70 years and nothing helped till I heard about correct toes and got a pair and some toe socks. In three weeks I can see and feel a big difference! Wish I'd learned about them years ago. Thank you!!
