Let's shelve the idea of \"New Year, new you\" and open up to a new mindset called \"New Year, ReNew\".", "sitename": "Dr. Meaghan Dishman", "date": "2019-01-29", "cleaned_text": "New Year, ReNew Happy New Year! It's the time of the year where gym memberships, #fitnessgoals, and juice cleanses run rampant everywhere. The idea of \"new year, new you\" seems to be unavoidable. While setting goals are great, we believe a rigid, metrics-based attitude toward health and fitness goals isn't always the best way to go to achieve long term gains. Instead, we encourage you to consider approaching your 2019 goals from a place of wanting to be on your body's side; of understanding, healing, nourishing and loving it. After all, you are not as simple series of numbers; you are a complex, living, breathing, feeling human. Let's shelve the idea of \"New Year, new you\" and open up to a new mindset called \"New Year, ReNew\". With this new year, routine and consistency will be imperative to your success. Here are a few simple tips to get started: Mindset is key: remember that health is holistic. Health is multifaceted; it is not limited to your diet and exercise routine. In order to reach optimal health, each of the 5 Pillars of Inspired Health needs attention. FIVE PILLARS OF INSPIRED HEALTH Nutrition, Sleep, Movement, Stress Management, Community #1 NUTRITION (Food + Water) FOOD \"Eat real food. Not too much. Mostly plants.\" AVOID / MINIMIZE: Gluten, Dairy, Sugar (+any known food sensitivities / allergies) Start eliminating the most common foods that increase inflammation. You don't have to be perfect (not yet!). We are just starting to lay the foundation for doing a customized cleanse in the future. Notice if you have any decrease in symptoms while in this avoidance phase, and notice if when you do eat these foods, what symptoms are exacerbated. A hormone + adrenal support diet should avoid caffeine, chocolate, simple carbohydrates, and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil and be rich in organic protein, fruits, vegetables, whole grains (only if you are not sensitive to grains, and only if you are not Paleo), and good fats. Inspired Tips + Tricks: - Small meals that include protein should be eaten frequently starting at breakfast (within one hour of waking) - Time should be taken to chew thoroughly and digest, rather than eating on the run. - Avoid food/s that you know you have a food sensitivity to. [Schedule an Appointment](https://inspiredhealthmed.com/register/)with one of our Inspired Health Doctors (TeleHealth or In-Person available) if you are interested in testing and finding out what foods YOU are sensitive to! - WATER Hydration is a core cornerstone to wellness! We recommend drinking half your body weight in ounces of water per day. Getting your fill of H2O will assist your body with cellular communication and detoxifying. Plus it will make your skin looking vibrant and your bowels moving! Inspired Tips + Tricks: - Start your water consumption upon waking. This will help you get your water intake in prior to bed. You will want to avoid drinking all of your water after dinner so that you stay asleep! - Keep water bottles full in the car. This helps you get your water in while you are driving- this includes the kiddos as well! DETOX + CLEANSE Our bodies often need a seasonal reboot - clean out the cobwebs and shed some accumulated toxins and inflammation and hit the reset button! This is where our [RENEW Program](http://bit.ly/downloadrenew) comes in!!

Sleeping in, whenever possible may be of benefit as well. Inspired Tips + Tricks: - Try to get to bed around 9:30-10 pm, and aim for 6-8 hours of high quality, restful sleep. - Blackout shades in the bedroom - Cover all lights on appliances (DVD, TV, etc) - Turn phone to Airplane Mode - Snack before bedtime - Orange lensed glasses If difficulty sleeping- Try a Snack Before Bedtime: Having a little snack 30-60 minutes before bedtime can sometimes help to regulate cortisol and glucose levels throughout the night. - A little apple and nut butter is a perfect example of a light snack - Snacks should always try to include good portions of carbs, fats, and protein - If you have SIBO (Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth): do not eat before bedtime. Orange Lensed Glasses: These goggles/glasses have been shown to improve sleep quality as well as mood, simply by blocking blue light and simulating physiologic darkness. Extra Sleep Support !! [MaxRelax:](https://inspiredhealthapothecary.com/products/max-relax)Aims to promote a calm, relaxed, well-balanced emotional and physiological state.

[L-Theanine](https://inspiredhealthapothecary.com/products/l-theanine-100mg): This is an amino acid that helps promote a restful, relaxed state without diminishing daytime alertness. This can also be used for sleep. #3 MOVEMENT Your body is designed to MOVE! Not to mention, one of the top cures for depression and anxiety is - EXERCISE!! EXERCISE Aim for at least 45-60 minutes 3-4 times per week. If it's not on your calendar, it doesn't exist! Inspired Tips + Tricks: - Find a movement routine that you love, and do it! - Exercising in NATURE is truly the best medicine! - Fresh air, sunlight, and sweat will uplift your mood all day long. - Exercise is most healing to the adrenals in a non-competitive environment. - Sign up (and pay) for a scheduled class at your local gym or exercise studio OR Schedule an exercise date with a friend: accountability is a major motivator. FRESH AIR + LIGHT Aim for 20 minutes of fresh air and sunlight per day! The Pineal gland in the brain is considered the \"Master\" endocrine (hormone )gland. Hormones regulate a myriad of things including metabolism, energy, weight, stamina, women's cycles, menopause, etc. The Pineal gland is stimulated by exposure to sunlight! Taking 20 minutes to expose yourself each day will allow you to get outside, go for a walk, take a break, and enjoy the great outdoors! Even if it is a quick office break walk around the block. HYDROTHERAPY Get your BLOOD moving every day! - Cold Water Rinse: Finish every shower with a 30 second COLD rinse The term hydrotherapy is synonymous with \"water cure\" and dates back with the antiquated use during ancient Egyptian, Roman, Greek, Chinese and Japanese Civilizations. When taking a warm / hot shower the blood vessels dilate with the heat. By using ONLY a 30 second cold rinse at the end of your shower, the blood vessels contract and shunt blood back into the core and vital organs, while at the same time increasing lymphatic flow and drainage. All of this benefits the function of your Endocrine, Metabolic and Immune Systems! #4 STRESS MANAGEMENT Make a list of 2 columns and write out your INTERNAL and EXTERNAL stressors on each side. Find the lowest hanging fruit and start eliminating those first! Often when we decrease the clutter of our external stressors and increase our internal mindfulness practices, our bigger external stressors become easier to manage and respond to (versus react). MINDFULNESS + MEDITATION Daily mindfulness AND meditation allows for deep belly breathing, re-teaching the diaphragm to relax, and strengthening the Vagus nerve (the nerve that stimulates all of our vital organs). Deep breathing is essential for the nervous system and adrenal recovery. When we are stressed out, we start to shallow breath. Shallow breathing signals the adrenals to be alert and vigilant. Deep breathing tells the body it can relax- there is no tiger running after you! Inspired Tips + Tricks: - Find a local Meditation Class in your area and sign up! - Mindfulness + Meditation Apps: Calm, Headspace, HeartMath, Insight Timer. - Healing Sounds + Tone Frequency Therapy: Solfeggio Frequencies (Spotify), Now by Solu, listening to your favorite band/s, going to live concerts. - Did you know? 20 minutes of deep belly breathing 1-2x/day will change your hormones in just 1 month! - Practice deep breathing while you are driving. - Practice deep breathing when stress arises. You will get better at this the more you practice. TIME TO DO NOTHING It is important to have unscheduled time. This means that you have the opportunity to unfold. Inspired Tips + Tricks: - Spend time on your couch, in your hammock, on your porch and just stare at the clouds, - Take a walk by the river - Cook in the kitchen because you want to as opposed to because you have to. - Take a bath, hot tub, or sauna #5 COMMUNITY Spend more quality time with your FRIENDS + FAMILY! Humans are meant to CONNECT with others. Studies on the [Blue Zones](https://www.bluezones.com/) (people who live to 100 years old) show that people live longer when they are connected and supported by a community. Find your tribe and invest in them! Inspired Tips + Tricks: - What do you LOVE to do? Can you connect with others who also love what you do? - Even if you are an introvert, step outside of your comfort zone and reach out to another! Your community can be small, it doesn't have to be huge. - Schedule a date, eat, PLAY, relax, exercise with OTHERS. - Get outside in nature WITH others. - ENJOY deep connections with others. - Cook with your loved ones. Gather around the table! - Stay present and engaged when interacting with your community. LAUGHTER They say that laughter is the best medicine, helping release endorphins (feel good neurohormones), and release pent up energy. In addition to laughing, any activity that brings you joy or peace is beneficial. Inspired Tips + Tricks: - Spend time with your funny friends! - Laughter meditation with a family member: try laughing ridiculously for no reason with a friend/family member. Eventually, this turns into genuine laughter because it is so ridiculous! - Try searching around YouTube or Netflix for a favorite Comedy sketch, or comedian for a quick fix. \"In many shamanic societies, if you came to a medicine person complaining of being disheartened, dispirited, or depressed, they would ask one of four questions: \"When did you stop dancing? When did you stop singing? When did you stop being enchanted by stories? When did you stop being comforted by the sweet territory of silence?\" -Gabrielle Roth At Inspired Health, we are committed to inspire you to reach optimal health and vitality by identifying your unique underlying root causes of symptoms.
