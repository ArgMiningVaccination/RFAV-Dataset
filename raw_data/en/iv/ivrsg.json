Health Shots got in touch with [Dr Jyoti Kapoor](https://www.healthshots.com/experts/dr-jyoti-kapoor/), a senior mental health coach and psychiatrist, Manasthali, Delhi-NCR, to learn about some best brain supplements that you can easily add to your daily routine. Here are 9 brain supplements to boost brain function and power: Dr Kapoor says, \" [Omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.healthshots.com/preventive-care/self-care/best-fish-oil-supplements/), commonly found in fish oil and flaxseed, are known for their brain-boosting properties. These essential fats, particularly DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), a type of omega-3, are major components of brain cell membranes and are believed to support memory, repair of brain cells, and overall brain health. Research suggests that adequate omega-3 intake may reduce cognitive decline and promote better brain function.\" Resveratrol is a natural compound found in red wine, grapes, and some berries. It has gained attention for its potential to protect the brain from age-related decline and neurodegenerative diseases. Resveratrol's antioxidant properties are believed to combat oxidative stress and reduce inflammation, contributing to improved cognitive function. B0BR18XCDC Curcumin is the active compound found in turmeric, a spice commonly used in Indian cuisine.

Some research suggests that curcumin may [improve memory](https://www.healthshots.com/fitness/staying-fit/5-brain-exercises-to-keep-it-young-and-sharp/) and mood, making it a potential brain-boosting supplement. \"Bacopa monnieri, also known as Brahmi, is an herb used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine to enhance memory and cognitive function. Active compounds called bacosides are thought to play a role in reducing anxiety and improving neurotransmitter function, thereby positively impacting memory formation and recall speed,\" says Dr Kapoor. Vitamin D, often referred to as the sunshine vitamin, plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health, including brain function. Studies have linked vitamin D deficiency to cognitive impairment and an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Ensuring you have an adequate intake of vitamin D through sunlight exposure, diet, or supplements can support cognitive health. Commonly associated with muscle building, creatine also has cognitive benefits. It helps to supply energy to brain cells and has been shown to enhance short-term memory and reasoning skills. Some studies suggest that creatine supplementation can be especially beneficial for vegetarians and vegans, as they may have lower natural creatine levels due to their dietary choices.

It is known for its ability to promote relaxation and [reduce stress](https://www.healthshots.com/mind/happiness-hacks/tips-to-reduce-stress/) without causing drowsiness.

Caffeine is perhaps the most widely consumed psychoactive substance in the world, primarily known for its stimulating effects.

While excessive caffeine intake can lead to jitteriness and anxiety, moderate consumption, often found in coffee and tea, can provide a temporary cognitive boost.\" Derived from the leaves of the Ginkgo biloba tree, this herbal supplement has a long history of use in traditional medicine.
