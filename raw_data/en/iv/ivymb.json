The First Ever All India Institut e of Ayurv eda (AIIA), set up along the lines of AIIMS, was dedicat ed to the Nation by the Honor able Prime Minist er, Shri Narendr a Modi on 2nd Ayurv eda Day on 17th October , 2017 at New Delhi. Set up as an apex institut e under the Ministry of AYUSH, AIIA is bringing syner gy betw een the traditional wisdom of Ayurv eda and modern diagnostic tools and technology . AIIA has also been awarded with NABH Accreditation, ther efore becoming the \u0000irst Ayurveda Hospital in Public Sector to be conferred with NABH accr editation in July, 2017, indicating the quality patient services it is rendering. AIIA is playing an exemplary role in providing Holistic care through individualized Ayurv eda Medicine, diet , Yoga and Relax ation techniques to COVID 19 patients across India. As envisioned by the Ministry of AYUSH, in pursuance to the 5th Ayurveda Day 2020 theme \"Ayurveda for Covid-19 Pandemic\", a campaign in the form of lectur e series \"AYU SAMVAD\" is organized from 26.01.2021 to 30.04.2021 pan India to mak e people aware about Ayurv eda & COVID 19 pandemic. The objecti ve of this campaign is to educate the community in an authentic way and make them feel responsible for their own health. \"My Health My Responsibility \"Introduc tion: 2On 11 March 2020, WHO declared Novel Corona-virus Disease (COVID19) outbreak as a pandemic and reiterated the call for countries to take immediat e actions and scale up response to treat, detect and reduce transmission to save people 's lives. There's a lot of information & misinformation out there about coronavirus (COVID-19) and role of Ayurv eda in this pandemic. Myths related to various infections have been prevalent from time to time, and it takes a long battle to de-m ystify the existing myths by providing a realistic evidence-based appr oach. These myths can be very danger ous, as these can lead to over- complacency and lead to a reduction in actuall y needed practices, or can lead to other health hazar ds. Most importantl y, it is necessary to get the information from reputable sour ces In view of the above, the AYUSH Ministry has envisioned to conduct a public campaign AYU SAMVAD (Public Awareness Campaign) \"AYURVEDA FOR COVID PANDEMIC\". to enable equip the health workers & gener al public with the right information and to enable them cascade the same to the communities they are serving. The main objecti ve of the campaign is to create awareness through Lectur e series to mak e common people aware of the theme \"Ayurv eda for Covid-19 Pandemic\". This campaign will assist to ensur e the unif ormity of information delivered to appr oximat ely 01 crore target audience across India through 05 Lakh lectur es. This campaign will be immensel y bene\u0000icial in understanding the importance of Ayurv eda & in the \u0000ight against Covid-19 and will speci\u0000icall y focus on the Role of Preventive, Promoti ve, Curative and Restorative Ayurv eda Management of Covid-19. 3Ayurv eda is unique in its appr oach as a healing science, rather than mer ely a medical science. It is rig htly consider ed as science of lif e and it gives due importance to all the aspects of treatment . The word Ayurv ed is comprised of Ayu + Ved. Ayu denot es the health y and happ y life where as Ved is deri ved from vid dhatu which means the knowledge. Hence Ayurv eda should be consider ed in true sense as Kno wledge system about health y and happ y life. Moreover, it emphasizes on knowledge system, which includes physician, infrastructur e, supporting sta and legislation. The COVID 19 pandemic is also a role model to prove the signi\u0000icance of considering all the aspects of the Chikitsa Chatushpada; wherein the whole knowledge system viz. physician, medication, para-medicals and the patient - everyone had their participatory role, hence proving the worth of the whole knowledge system depict ed in Ayurv eda. In covid pandemic situation not only physical health was aected but psychological, social as well spiritual health were also aect ed. The motto is to make a move from Illness to Wellness and Wellness to Happiness. It is not suf\u0000icient to just Ayurveda: Knowledge S ystem of Health y and Happ y Life 4Refer SLID E 3 from the shar ed Po werPoint Pr esentationcure the disease or in other words the Wellness is not just mer ely one does not suer from any ailment and is able to do the regular work. Medicine typicall y treats injuries, disabilities, and sympt oms, to bring the individual to a \"neutr al point\" where ther e is no longer any visible illness. However, the Wellness Paradigm requir es moving the state of wellbeing further along the continuum towards optimal emotional and mental states that is towards happiness. This is the state of achie ving your higher self. The concept assumes that wellbeing is a dynamic rather than a static process. Ayu to Deer agha yu, Deer agha yu to Sukha yu and to par adigm shift fr om 5The concepts and practices of Ayurveda are deeply rooted in our community viz the kitchen remedies, making use of spices, rituals and traditions observ ed in India at various seasons and places. This is the nerv e of our traditions. However, it is not mer ely a Folklor e or Home Remedies Science, as it is scienti\u0000ic and provides an insig ht to our belief s as truth. For instance, observing the rituals of eating Sesame seeds and jiggery on Mak ar Sankr anti falling in the wint er season will enhance the robustness of health and closel y matches with the Rituchary a described for this season in Ayurv eda literatur es. Similar ly, lighting a common \u0000ire as ritual of Holi, falling in Vasant Ritu is a re\u0000lection of Public Swedana to be advised in this season to mitig ate the Kapha prakopa as is depict ed in Ayurv eda. Thus, as explained through cust oms, traditions or rituals or as a part of kitchen herbs, Ayurv eda is tightly woven in Indian community , which mak es it all the mor e acceptable t o meet the health and w ellness for all. Ayurveda is the binding science which advocates scienti\u0000ic paramet ers to give insig ht to those belief system of Indian community . In present covid situation also use of Kitchen remedies like Haldi, Ardrak, Tulasi, Marich, Jeer a in the form of Ayushkw ath or Haldi milk helped to prevent the disease by modulating the immunity . Thus, what is needed is to touch the roots and transf orm the lives of the people.Ayurveda: Rooted in Community & Public HealthRefer SLID E 4 from the shar ed Po werPoint Pr esentation AYURVED A 6Aims of yurveda: has two basic aims: First , to preserv e the health of health y people and to help them attain the four principle aims of life (virtue, purpose or wealth, pleasur e, and release or liber ation from cycle of rebirth); second, to treat illness and disease. The disease COVID has provided an opportunity to prove Ayurv eda - its strength in both of these \u0000ields viz. prophylaxis & prevention through Immuno modulat ors (Rasayana) and in treating the mild to moder ate cases through the stand alone Ayurv eda treatment in signi\u0000icant number of cases through the Advisory protocol noti\u0000ied by oach imbibing the rules of diet , sleep, and health y life style regimen (true meaning of brahmachary a) is incorpor ated for achie ving both the aims along with keeping in mind the indi vidualization of the patient as a unique being and providing a tailor made treatment for every individual based on his/her Prakriti (Constitution). 7Personalized Holistic Appr oachMaintenance of Health Management of Diseases Refer SLID E 5 from the shar ed Po werPoint Pr esentationStrengths of A yurveda: Ayurv eda science has certain salient char acteristic featur es which mak es it unique. First of all, it is Time tested. It has the legacy of thousands of years well document ed in form of texts and practiced till today. As it has its roots in the community and as it is our genetic knowledge, it becomes Cost eecti ve. Man y of the remedies mentioned are readil y available in the Kitchen and known to a common man. Since, these remedies are part and parcel of our routine life in form of spices, herbs, vegetables etc., it Quality , Safety & Ef\u0000icacy assur ed. Further , this system has separ ate governing body, Ministry of AYUSH to ensur e the optimal development and propag ation of AYUSH systems of health care, regulating the rules pertaining to the Quality , Safety & Ef\u0000icacy of the drugs and procedur es. Ayurveda has Rasayana herbs like Amla, Guduchi, Shatavari, Ashwagnadha etc. which are known to the common public and can be easil y grown in the kitchen garden. These drugs bring about the immune modulation, Restoration and Rejuvenation of the body tissues. For the treatment of various ailments, we have vast choices of treatment based on the condition of the patient, condition and stages of diseases, environment , time and place; in terms Pranidhana and so on. the vast \u0000lora and fauna in the biodi versity of India, thousands of drugs are available to choose for treatment . Mor e than 10,000 herbal & Herbo- miner al formulations are document ed in the texts for the purpose. The Panchak arma in an unique modality of treatment wherein the toxin are remo ved from the natur (RaktaMok These modalities of detoxi\u0000ication is applicable in various pathological conditions as well as for the maint enance of health in terms of seasonal Panchak arma. Apart from the treatment modalities, 8Refer SLID E 6 & 7 from the shar ed Po werPoint Pr esentationa Holistic integrated Vihar a & Achar a. Ayurv eda also mak es a syner gy with Yoga system and brings about Mental & Spiritual healing. Ayurv eda science tends to consider the individual as a whole: a soul /mind/senses /bod y thinking and interacting with its environment . It is thus a matter of adjusting a treatment according to the individual characteristics of each patient. The approach of P5 medicine as Predicti ve, Preventive, Promoti ve, Personalized & Participat ory is well incorpor ated in Ayurv eda principles and not mer ely curative alone. Personalised: everyone is unique, we are interested in the personal pro\u0000ile of the individual (genetic, environmental, etc.). Preventive: health education aims to reduce the risk of disease (primary prevention), promote early detection (secondary prevention) and improve the quality of life of the sick (tertiary prevention). \"Wellness\" is at the centre of these dierent processes. Promotive: The immune modulat ors in form of Rasayana drugs like Amalaki, Ashwagandha, Shatavari etc. the health status is enhanced to its optimum in the desired way. Predictive: by establishing a personalised mapping of the risk factors and protective elements of a person's health, the risk of developing a disease can be assessed and the most appropriate drug and other treatments proposed. 9Participat ory: patients are the actors of their own health and care. They are now considered \"expert patients\" , with theoretical knowledge and subjective knowledge derived from experienc e of their disorders. Further, during COVID it is once again proved that 'health is an individual responsibility\" by following the proper prophylaxis, diet and regimen. Further, it also imparts the Universal approach of looking to the individual being as a re\u0000lection of the universe, through \"Lok a Purusha Sam ya Siddhanta \" which says that whatever is present outside is present inside. Ther e exists a harmon y and ve de\u0000inition of health as mentioned in Ayurv eda is a state of balance - physically, mentally & emotionally. Health is unint errupt ed physical, mental, spiritual happiness and ful\u0000illment; a true balance of organs/s ystems, psyche and spirit , and balanced and creative relationships with fellow creatur es and natur e as a whole, family, friends, work, climate, ideals and customs. This holistic perspecti ve is one of Ayurv eda's basic principles. Swastha also means being established in one's self. Gener ally, we talk about mental health and physical health, but one of Ayurv eda's basic principles emphasizes from the beginning that we should be established in our self. Ayurv eda together with its sister science, yoga, which includes the practice of meditation, helps you to stay physicall y \u0000it and spirituall y on point at all times in order to lead a holisticall y health y life. Ayurv eda view s physical health as balance and Wellness as living the dynamic expression of your own natur e and body type to its full potential. Implementation of this holistic appr oach in COVID situation helped the community to restrict the spread and also impr oved the immunity so as to keep the disease in mild to moder ate grade in most of the eda knowledge is systematicall y categorized into eight specialties, which look s after the dier ent needs of dier ent conditions, pathologies, body systems and tr eatment pr ocedur es. Basicall y ther e were tw o main branches viz. Kaya Chikitsa (Internal medicine) and Shalya Tantra (Sur gery). This was later further divided into 08 specialties called as Ashtang Ayurv eda. Today, ther e are 14 specialties existing in Ayurv eda. Hence, specialized treatment is provided based on the need of the disease and the diseased. However, in spite of having these specialties, Ayurv eda does not keep an anal ytical appr oach. The appr of Triskandha viz. Hetu, Ling a and Aushadha. In other words, the basics remains common for all the 08 branches, in the interest of patient . Amongst 8 branches Jara / Vrushan is the unique branch which speak s about rejuvenation and immune-modulation. During COVID 19 through this unique wisdom of immune-modulat ory measur es Ayurv eda could serv e the entir e humanity . 11Refer SLID E 8 from the shar ed Po werPoint Pr esentationEpidemics or outbreak is a sudden spread of the disease within a short time to a large number of people in a given population. In Ayurv eda, a concept similar to the epidemic is narr ated by Achary a Charaka under a broad heading The word 'Janapadodh wamsa 'comprises of two words Janapada(lar ge population) &Udh vamsa (destruction) which means the diseases aecting & causing damage of a large number of people; similar to pandemic. Factors which are common to the community like air (Vayu), water (Jala), habitat (Desha) and seasons (Kala) are responsible for 'Janapadodhwamsa'. These factors prove to be true even today in perspecti ve of dier ent Pandemic situations like COVID. COVID 19, accor ding to Ayurveda is caused by vitiated Vayu (droplets) and vitiat ed Desha. with ghee and Vayu shuddhik ara drugs was advocat ed and was found useful. Similarly, Sushruta has given the concept of Aupasar gika Roga for the communicable diseases and dier ent modes of transmission are also well explained. Avoiding these factors of transmission is nothing but the modi\u0000ied practical version of COVID prevention viz. social distancing, avoid gathering, frequent hygiene, sanitization, wearing mask Po werPoint Pr esentationAnuk ta Vyadhis in A yurveda: The question arises whether such new ly disco vered diseases like COVID 19, Dengue, Zika virus, chikungunya etc. mentioned in Ayurv eda t exts or the y are new t o the A yurv eda fr aternity? A yurv eda has clearly speci\u0000ied that there may be innumerable number of Vyadhis possible out of permutations and combinations of Tridoshas, Sapta Dhatus and Malas. The guidelines for diagnosis of the disease in terms etc are explained in detail and based on these, one can infer the etio-pathogenesis of any disease which are new ly disco vered. COVID 19 may also be explor ed on the same guidelines. COVID 19 is consider ed to be caused due to vitiation of Vata along with kapha in initial phase and with pitta in the later stage, making it a Sannipatik a Vyadhi. Rasa ,Rakta and Mamsa are main Dush ya however in some cases Oja is also deplet ed Thus, the concept of including the new diseases in the compendium and understanding them thr ough basic concepts is not a new er thing shar ed Po werPoint Pr esentationChikitsa is a process of management which involves multi factorial issues and persons. In Ayurveda, however the success of Chikitsa depends mainl y upon four factors which ar e management system in Ayurv eda. Sucessful management depends on availability and best qualities of for segments i.e. Vaidya (physician) Parichayak (par a medical and supporting sta) Ayushdha (Medicines) And Rogi (well aware and convinced patIent ) In Covid 19 Awareness and eduction of preventive like donning ,dof\u0000ing, hand sanitization and manegement of Covid 19 to all the segments of Chatushpada is important . Similar ly, availability and feasibility of requir ed medicines and infrastructur e like green zones, orange zones and red zones etc is important .Fourfold Health Management through Kno wledge s ystem: 14Refer SLID E 11 from the shar ed Po werPoint Pr esentationEstablishing four pillars for management of highly infectious communicable diseases through Ayurv eda was important in successful treatment of COVID 19. This is thus a team work and each pillar of the team has its role to play including the patient . COVID 19 is again a role model to prove this concept of knowledge system; wherein one had to train the paramedicals, medicals and the patient too for certain technicalities of the disease and its prevention and treatment , at the same time being equipped with medicines, instruments and other requir ements. Ayurv eda has mentioned the 4 qualities of each of the four pillars. Amongst the 4 qualities of physician and para medical sta \"Anuk ampaa \" has been mentioned which means having sympath y and human touch. Especiall y in the pandemic conditions like COVID, this model of Care with Compassion has been a successful one. Also, the qualities of patient are mentioned as \"Gyapak\" (kno wledgeable and informed). Thus, in the conditions like COVID 19, it has come out to be the important verse \"My Health is my own responsibility \" 15COVID 19: COVID-19 is a new virus which has spread quickly to many countries around the world. Knowing the facts about COVID-19 symptoms, how the virus spreads and what you can do to stop it will help protect you and your communit y. As ever, when the word \"pandemic\" began appearing in headline s, people became fearful \u2014 and with fear came misinformation and rumours. There is a lot of misinformation about COVID-19 in the public and on social media. Hence, it becomes necessary to provide primary information to the public on the incubation period, signs & symptoms, when to call a doctor, how to dierentiate the symptoms from common \u0000lu etc and ask them not to panic even if found positive for COVID. Moreover, it's important to check that the information has come from a reliable source such as the World Health Organization or your government health authorit y. 16Refer SLID E 12 from the shar ed Po werPoint Pr esentation Corona viruses (C oV) ar e a lar ge family of viruses that cause illnes s ranging fr om the common cold to more severe diseasesCOVID 19 - Management Principles: The \u0000irst and foremost step maybe the prevention. For preventing the virus to enter in to the body, along with the gener al measur es of wearing a mask, hand hygiene, sanitization etc., Ayurv eda prophylactic measur es like Pratimarsha Nasya with Anu Taila; which will act as barrier to stop the entry of the virus, hot water gargling & drinking; warm water soothes the throat and acts as a protective shield. In the second step, if the virus enters the body and starts showing the earlier sympt oms or if one has history of exposur e or contact , than it becomes necessary to stop its replication inside the body. For this, the Katu Tikta dravyas or spices included in the AYUSH kwath, SamshamaniV ati, Tab AYUSH-64 will be useful. These medications are useful for the prophylaxis as well as prevention of the virus to progress further from mild to moder ate to severe stages. In the third step of management , if the virus has settled in the body and start ed sho wing con\u0000irmed s ympt oms, it becomes important t o reduce the damage it causes to the tissues through the restorative treatment of Ayurv eda viz. a Rasayana etc. These Rasayana formulations will help making the tissue robust and impr ove the host immunity .Refer SLID E 13 & 14 fr om the shar ed Po werPoint Pr esentation Preventing the virus entering to our cells Stopping its replication if it gets inside the cells Reducing the damage that occurs to our tissuesThe management principles of COVID-19 can be strategicall y planned based on the Ayurv eda principles. Prophylac tic Measur es: Follow physical distancing, respir atory and hand hygiene, wear mask Gargle with warm water added with a pinch of turmeric and salt. Water boiled with Triphala (dried of medicat ed oil (Anu taila or Shadbindu Taila) or plain oil (Sesame or Coconut) or nasal application of cow's ghee (Goghrita) once or twice in a day, especially before going out and after coming back to home. Ayurveda and Yoga can certainly play a pivotal role to augment preventive measur es provided in the guidelines by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW). The current understanding of COVID-19 indicat es that good immune status is vital to prevention and to safeguar d from disease progression. General and Physical measures as mentioned in National Clinical Management Protocol by Ministry of AYUSHRefer SLID E 14 & 16 fr om the shar oil once a day Use warm water or boiled with herbs like ginger (Zingiber o\u0000icinale) or cumin (Cuminum cyminum) seeds etc., for drinking purpose. Drink Golden Milk (Half tea spoon Haldi (Curcuma longa) powder in 150 ml hot milk) once at night. Avoid in case of indigestion. Drink Ayush Kadha or Kwath (hot infusion or decoction) once a day Fresh, warm, balanced diet Adequat e sleep of 6 to 8 hrs. Moder ate physical exercises Follow Yoga Protocol for Primary Prevention of COVID-19 and Protocol for Post COVID-19 care (including care for COVID-19 patients) 19Yoga pr actices for Mental w ellbeing during CO VID 19: Yoga and Ayurveda have joined hands complementing each other. Ayurv eda is the physical form of Yoga and Yoga is the spiritual form of Ayurv eda. A standar d protocol is designed along with its Standar d Oper ating Procedur es with the respir atory and cardiac ef\u0000iciency , to reduce stress and anxiety and to enhance immunity . This Standar d protocol includes the sukshma vyayama which includes joint movements, Sitting postures, lying down postures in Supine position and prone position followed by relax ation postur es, pranayama and meditiation.Refer SLID E 15 from shar ed Po werPoint Pr esentation 20Gener al Measur es for CO VID 19: Drink W arm w ater: Warm water (Ushnodak a) is speci\u0000ically advised by Ayurveda in the conditions of Jwara and it acts as Amapachaka. It is also a part of Langhana. Ushnodak a is speci\u0000ically mentioned in Janapadodhwamsaniya Adhyaya, which itself proves its indication for the pandemic conditions like COVID 19. Hot water drinking also relieves spasm and checks the entry of virus through its portal. Moreover, warm water is an easily available and simple modality which anyone can adopt. Spices: Kitchen is considered as the primar y pharmac y and most of the times, the \u0000irst aid for mild to moderate ailments are readily available in Indian kitchen. The data on COVID 19 from 163 countries including total cases, total deaths, and total recovered were analyzed. It was observed that there is a clear interrelated prevalence between the total number of COVID-19 cases per million population tested and the gram of spice supply per capita per day. Nations with lower consumptions of spices per capita showed greater number of COVID-19 cases per million population. This is not surprising as herbs and spices are well-known to boost immunit y. Thus, the Ahara yogi varga and the Haritaka Varga mentioned in Chyawanpr ash: Chyawanprash - a polyherbal formulation containing Amla as the main ingredient is considered as an important practical version of Vatatapika Rasayana. The Ayusanjivani Refer SLID E 17 to 25 fr om the shar ed Po werPoint Pr esentation 21App developed by Ministry of AYUSH had come out with a survey data that more than 80% of the population in India have been consuming Amla in one or the other way during the COVID period. Amla has proved to be eective immune booster, immune modulator, rich in vitamin C and eective in strengthening the tissues. Apart from Amla, Chyawanprash also has many other drugs acting on Respiratory system, Cardio vascular system and Digestive system. AYUSH Kw ath: For prevention of the disease progression to symptomatic and severed form and to improve recovery rate, AYUSH Kwath has been included in the National protocol Advisory of COVID 19. Based on the Prakriti of the patient and the environmental conditions, the herbs included in the AYUSH Kwatha can be added or omitted. The proportion of Shunthi and Kali Mirch should be 1/4th of the other ingredients. Moreover, for the persons of Pitta Prakriti and those suering from acidity, acid peptic diseases, piles, mouth ulcers etc. Amla / Yashtimadhu may also be added. It can also be \u0000lavoured with lemon and jaggery. It may also be boiled with milk or prepared as Tea. This has proved to be very eective if the Prayog Vigyan is done properly. Golden Milk: Ayurveda describes \"Kshira Ghrita Abhyasa\" i.e routine intake of ghee and milk (preferably cow's milk & ghee) as best among the Rejuvenators. Turmeric is having the proven eect as anti-micr obial, anti-oxidative immune booster and particular ly useful for the diseases of Respiratory tract. It helps in the co-morbid conditions like Diabetes Mellitus for which also it is a drug of choice. Thus, Golden milk / Turmeric milk is advised for the prophylaxis as well as treatment of COVID 19. Half Tea spoon of Haldi powder in 150 ml of hot milk once or twice can be advised. 22Nasya: Instilling the drops of sesame oil or coconut oil or mustard oil or cow's ghee in the dosage of 2-3 drops in each nostril will stop the virus from entering into the further respiratory system. This will act as a bio mask and strengthen the mucous membrane of the nose as a \u0000irst line of defence. Further, Pratimarsha Nasya is part of Dincharya mentioned in Ayurveda, wherein Anu Taila Nasya is advised and \u0000lexibility is provided for instilling Nasya at any of the eight Kaala mentioned in Char aka Samhita for Pratimarsha Nasy a. It can be advised atleast while going out and after coming back home. Moreover, the other ingredients in the formulation of Anu Taila are bene\u0000icial for making the sensor y organs strong, as loss of sensation of smell and taste are also involved in the manifestations of COVID 19. So, Nasya will be bene\u0000icial for these symptoms as well. Steam Inhalation: Steam inhalation is a simple measure which can be practised anywhere even at the small village level and at every ordinary home in India. Steam inhalation has proven eect as relieving the spasm, broncho dilators, checking the entry of virus and preventing the cytokine storm. Fresh Pudina (Mint) leaves or Ajwain (Caraway seeds) can be used along with water for steam inhalation once in a day. It should be especially done during dry cough / sore throat. Samshamani V ati: Guduchi (Giloy) is a wonder herb. It is especially mentioned under the Rogadhikara of Jwara. Moreover, it also is a drug of choice for Rejuvenation. Thus, its daily usage is bene\u0000icial as immune modulator and prevents the occurrence of communic able diseases. It can be prescribed as two tablets twice daily with lukewarm water. 23Diet: Diet and lifestyle management are the important integration in Ayurveda management. The guidelines of Ahara as mentioned in Ayurveda are detail in terms description of Ahara includes what to eat, when to eat, where to eat, how to eat, how much to eat etc. Amongst those the foremost thing is to advice what to eat. The diet should be balanced not only in terms of its calorie value or in terms of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, vitamins etc., but from Ayurveda point of view, the balance should be in terms of Shad Rasas, Panchabhautik a Ahara, Chaturvidh Ahara (four forms of Ahara) etc. Regarding the time to eat, the food chronobiolog y of nature's clock has to be followed. i.e the Ahara consumption should be in presence of the Sun, as the solar energy representing Pitta component in the body, is responsible for digestion. Regarding the quantity of food, the patients maybe adviced to consume the amount of solids 50% of the capacity, liquids 25% of the capacity and 25% of the space to be kept empty for circulation of Doshas. Further, the heavy to digest Ahara should be consumed less than the satiety and light things also upto the satiety only. In general, the Ahara quantit y should be onl y that muc h which does not cause trouble or hamper the routine physical activities after its consumption. In regards to COVID 19, frequent warm liquids treated with medicinal herbs (preferably Shunthi, Dalchini, Trikatu) should be used as a regular drink to maintain hydration. Freshly prepared Laghusupachya ahara (easily digestible, light diet) should be consumed. The other guidelines of time for consumption and quantity will be same as mentioned above. Refer SLID E 26 from the shar ed Po werPoint Pr esentation 24Longe vity: A w ay of life including Health y Habits: Regarding the modi\u0000ications in life style, the practical equation for longevity maybe adopted. Classifying the day into 3 parts (8 hours each), the work life balance can be achieved. 8 hours can be conveniently utilized for the personal, family and social time; which should include the practices in the daily routine like exercise, massage, yoga meditation and diet nutrition. Seasonal panchakarma should be part of the Seasonal regimen followed by consumption of Rejuvenating herbs. 8 hours to be dedicated for adequate and timely peaceful sleep and rest.

Ther e are some traditional medicine remedies from Ayush systems which provide relief and alleviate some of the sympt oms of COVID-19. Ayush systems follow a holistic appr oach towards disease management and maintaining health of a health y person. It provides detailed advocacy and interventions for disease prevention. There are various interventions in Ayush systems which are presently being used in prophylactic appr oaches as well as in the management of COVID 19, and are providing good results. Further these are seen to be bene\u0000icial in sympt omatic management in COVID 19. The ongoing AYUSH-C SIR COLLABORA TIVE STUDIES (a joint initiati ve among the Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Health and Famil y Welfare and Ministry of Science & T echnology , with t echnical assistance fr om ICMR) includes four clinical studies on use of AYUSH medicines for COVID 19, both in a prophylactic role and as an addon intervention to conventional treatment . The Ministry has also initiat ed 68 studies at 112 locations undertak en through National institut es, Resear ch Councils, Universities, Stat e Governments and other collabor ating hospitals (which includes AYUSH-C SIR studies also). Refer SLID E 30 from the shar ed Po werPoint Pr esentation 26However, it is under lined that the interventions and measur es proposed in the Clinical management protocol are not for cure, but for the management of asympt omatic and mild cases of COVID 19 and for prophylactic care. One should not get a false feeling of safety from adopting these measur es. It is also under lined that for prevention of COVID 19, the mainsta y appr oach remains adher ence to the gener al guidelines as released by Government, including maintaining appropriate physical distance, wearing a mask, maintaining hand- hygiene and avoiding unnecessary crowding at any place, and these should be followed strictl y. Who has prepar ed the National Clinical Management Protocol based on Ayurveda and Yoga for management of Covid-19? The Ministry of AYUSH has set up an Interdisciplinary Committ ee for Integration of Ayurv eda and Yoga Interventions in the 'National Clinical Management Protocol: COVID-19'. The said Committ ee is chair ed by Dr V M Katoch, former Director Gener al ICMR and includes a group of experts. The Committ ee, after a thor ough consultati ve process, formulat ed its Report & Recommendations (which is available at http://a yush.go v.in) based on acceptable experimental and clinical published data indicating potential bene\u0000its and safety at the same time and trends from ongoing studies in COVID-19. The report was present ed before the National Task Force on COVID 19 and the Joint Monit oring Group, both constitut ed by the Ministry of Health and Famil y Welfare. On consider ation of this report , the National Task Force on Covid 19 management suggested preparing a National Clinical Management Protocol based on Ayurv eda and Yoga for management of Covid-19 for inclusion as a dedicat ed chapt er in National Protocol for Management of COVID 19. 27 The Ministry of AYUSH referred these recommendations to the Chairman of its National Task Force (i.e., the UGC Vice Chairman) with a request to vet the recommendations by initiating consensus from experts from the concerned premier institutions. These institutions included the All India Institut e of Ayurv eda (AIIA), Delhi, Institut e of Training and R esear ch in A yurv eda (ITRA), Jamnag ar, e of Ayurv (NIA), , Centr al S), Centr Yoga and Natur opath y (CCRYN) Mor arji Desai National Institut e of Yoga (MDNIY) and other National Research Organizations. Finally, the National Clinical Management Protocol based on Ayurv eda & Yoga for management of Covid-19 was prepar ed with cumulati ve inputs from all the above mentioned exercises and after due consider ation by the best experts of all the concerned disciplines. The report and recommendations have detailed scienti\u0000ic rationale with references of clinical studies, safety studies and in-silico studies based on which repurposing of the interventions for COVID 19 is proposed. This report is available in public domain at https://www .ayush.go v.in/. The said National Ayush protocol has been prepar ed in line with the protocol and rationale used by protocol of the conventional system of medicine. Is there any scienti\u0000c rationale behind selec tion of drugs \u0000guring in the Protocol? These drugs were select ed after due consider ation of relevant factors like published scienti\u0000ic evidence, literary research supported by scienti\u0000ic relevance, the rationale in support of repurposing of these medicines in COVID 19 and the outcomes and trends of complet ed and ongoing studies taken up by the Ministry of AYUSH across India. 28What is immunity in Ayurveda? In Ayurv eda, immunity is referred to as vyadhik shamatv a. Ayurv eda has a comprehensive approach of immunity encompassing two-fold management , respecti vely of health and disease. Vyadhik shamatv a is the resistance of the body to \u0000ight a disease by either of the following two ways: a. Vyadhi-Bala- Virodhitv am - The resisting power of the body to restr ain or withstand the strength or severity or progression of a disease, or b. Vyadhi-Utpada-Pr atibandhak atvam - The resisting power of the body to prevent the manif estation of a disease. Signi\u0000icantl y, various modi\u0000iable factors have been enlist ed in Ayurv eda that in\u0000luence the host defense responses (Bala/Vyadhiksha matva). These factors include a healthy diet (Pathyaahara), condition of biological humors (dosha) and the state of physical and mental health (Sareera). The previous Covid 19 related advisories issued by the Ministry of AYUSH are based on this host defense mechanism or salut ogenesis and also on various empirical evidences available from peer review ed and inde xed publications. Are the recommended medicines safe? The herbs select ed are some of the most commonl y used and prescribed ones in India. Ther e has been a substantial number of clinical studies on each of these without any Serious Adverse Event (SAE) and these are also being prescribed in about 25000 Govt. Ayurv eda PHCs and by a large number of Ayurv eda practitioners in routine clinical practices for a vast range of clinical conditions and as health tonics (Rasayana). The scienti\u0000ic information available in public domain was also screened to substantiat e their safety in preclinical and clinical studies. Furthermor e, the trends coming out of the resear ch studies in COVID 19 as standalone and add-on interventions of these Ayush medicines were found to be 29absolut ely safe and no herb-drug interaction was noted in these studies on a large number of participants. Is taking Ayush Kwath regularly injurious to liver? Ayush kwath is made up of a few common herbs which are used as kitchen spices viz. Dalchini, Lavang, Shunthi and Tulasi. These are regular ly used by the majority of Indian households on a regular basis and are absolut ely safe. Ther e is no known stud y or report on it having any Adverse eect . These herbs are ushna viry a (hot in potency) and may be used with added munnak a or mishri as per need or a person and taste. The ingr edients of Ayush kwath are very good antio xidants. and modulat ory properties of the ingr edient like Tulasi are well document ed in resear ch studies. Are the medicines prescribed in the protocol immune-boosting? Ayurv eda s ystem of healthcar e tak es holistic appr oach t owards disease management and preservation of health in which salutogenesis (maintaining optimum health and immune status) is a major aspect . The medicines select ed in the Protocol have immuno modulat ory eect i.e. they tend to stregthen the immunity of a person in a natur al way. In present times when altered lifesty les, diet and stress are a common, maintaining a natur al immune system is challenging, and this renders a person prone to infections and diseases. The immuno modulatory interventions of Ayurv eda which are included under the broad term 'Rasayana' are very helpful in preserving optimum health of a person. They also help in preventing disease and in controlling disease progression. This should not be confused with hyper immune status or aberr ant activity of the immune system. 30 Eecti ve management to addr ess COVID 19 infection is still evolving and attempts are being made to integrate traditional interventions along with standar d of care. Ayurv eda and Yoga can certainl y play a pivotal role to augment preventive measur es provided in the guidelines by Ministry of Health and Famil y Welfare (MoHFW). The curr ent understanding of COVID-19 indicat es that good immune status is vital to prevention and to safeguard from disease progression. Following three aspects are consider ed while preparing this \"National Clinical Management Protocol based on Ayurv eda and Yoga for management of Covid-19\": Knowledge from Ayurveda classics and experienc e from clinical practices Empirical evidences and Biological plausibilit y Emerging trends of ongoing clinical studies This consensus document is developed by expert committ ees from AII India Institut e of Ayurv eda (AIIA), Delhi, Institut e of Post Graduat e Training and Resear ch in Ayurv ed (IPG TRA), Jamnag ar, and Institut e of Ayurv eda (NIA), Jaipur , Centr al Council for Resear ch in Ayurveda (CCRAS), Central Council for Research in Yoga and Naturopathy (CCRYN), other national research organizations.

Is there any resear ch work done in AYUSH for COVID 19? The Ministry of AYUSH has set up an Interdisciplinary Ayush R & D task force to formulate and plan research studies (clinical, preclinical, observ ational etc) for COVID-19. The inputs from the Taskf orce which had prepared generic protocols (available in public domain at http://a yush.go v.in) led to man y studies being initiat ed by Resear ch Councils & National Institut es under ministry of AYUSH, Universities, Stat e Governments and Covid hospitals. The above-mentioned agencies initiated various studies across the country in collaboration and consultation with reputed scienti\u0000ic organizations like Council of Scienti\u0000ic and Industrial Resear ch (CSIR), Indian Council of Medical Resear ch (ICMR), Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), Department of Science and Technology (DST), Department of Biot echnology (DBT), including clinical, observ ational, in-silico and preclinical studies. The total number of such studies initiat ed by the Ministry presentl y stands at 68, spread over 112 locations, and being undertaken by premier institutions like National institut es, Resear ch Councils, Universities, Stat e Governments and other collabor ating hospitals (this includes the AYUSH-CSIR studies also). Many of these are completed and data anal ysis has been undertak en, whereas the others are in the \u0000inal stage of completion. 35How has the Ministr y ensur ed the quality of the Resear ch work? To ensur e the scienti\u0000ic robustness of the interventions, the Ministry has constituted an Interdisciplinary Ayush Research and ask%20for chaired by Prof. Bhushan Patwardhan (Vice Chairman, University Grants Commission) and comprising of senior scientists and experts from reputed institutions of Ayurveda and conventional system of medicine like ICMR, AIIMS, Amrita school of Ayurv eda, AVP (AIIA) and AYUSH Resear ch Councils. The Committ ee called for resear ch proposals and inputs from all stakeholders across India. This was followed by a series of consultati ve processes and thor ough examination of inputs. The Committee then proposed certain interventions for resear ch studies and also prepar ed compr ehensi ve resear ch protocols for undertaking research studies on COVID 19 through AYUSH interventions. In this sequence, the Ministry of AYUSH in a joint initiati ve with Ministry of Health and Famil y Welfare and Ministry of Science & Technology took up four clinical studies on AYUSH medicines for COVID 19 used as prophylactic and as add-on intervention. These came to be called the AYUSHC SIR collabor ative studies, and were taken up under technical assistance fr om ICMR. These studies ar e curr ently in pr ogress with a robust clinical protocol that was prepar ed by AYUSH Task Force with substantial contributions from eminent rheumat ologist , clinician and resear cher Dr Cent er for Rheumatic Diseases (CRD) Pune. The Ministry also monitored all the studies being undertaken by National institutes and Research Councils and other collaborating hospitals and institut es through a Project Monit oring Unit . 36 A Centr al Ethics Committ ee was also constitut ed with members from reput ed institut es like AIIMS and all studies are put before the committ ee ther eafter to ensur e safety and robustness of the studies at each stud y site. All inputs and suggestions by ethical committ ees are proper ly addr essed before initiation of the stud y. To ensur e Data Safety and safety of participants and proper conduct of studies, Data Safety and Monit oring Boar d (DSMB) was also constitut ed which was chaired by Dr Nandini Kumar, Former Deputy Director Gener al Sr. Grade (ICMR) and Vice President , Forum for Ethics Review Committ ees in India. What is the basis of recommending Guduchi in the protocol? Guduchi is one of the most commonl y used herbs in Ayurv eda. It has been studied and found eecti ve in viral fevers, as anti-in\u0000lammat ory, antip yretic and immuno-modulat ory interventions. Ther e are three in- silico studies, which show its high binding ef\u0000icacy against SARS-CoV -2 targets involved in attachment and replication of the virus, as compar ed to Favipir avir, Lopina vir/Rit onavir and Remdesi vir. About 7 studies are also being done under the Ministry of AYUSH on Guduchi as Prophylactic care on about 1.33 Lakh population and with very good results in preventing COVID 19 and in management of asympt omatic COVID 19 without any side eect . Further detailed rationale of its inclusion has been provided in the Interdisciplinary Committ ee for integration of Ayurv eda and Yoga Interventions in the 'National Clinical Management Protocol: COVID-19' which is made available in public domain on the Ministry of AYUSH websit e. 37What is the basis of the protocol? Ashwagandha (Withania somnif era) (WS) of the most extensi vely experiment ed Ayurv eda medicinal plants and has been used in Ayurv eda practice since centuries. Ashwagandha has been select ed owing to its properties like immune-modulat ory, anti stress and antiviral ef\u0000icacy . In- silico studies have shown its high binding af\u0000inity to ACE2-RBD interface which may stop SARS COV 2 entry into cells. The WS root extract has shown positi ve results against protracted social isolation induced stress and anxiety which mak es it a good medicine for prophylactic use. Further , the medicine also has very good pulmonary protective function and hence is bene\u0000icial in post Covid care. Ther e are substantial number of studies on Ashwagandha published in reput ed peer review ed journals to establish its ef\u0000icacy , safety and protective action. Has any large-scale study been undertak en in AYUSH for prophylactic care? Prophylactic care is a major part of the AYUSH protocol, and in order to substantiat e and understand its role in the management of Covid 19, several studies on a large cohort are being undertak en by the Ministry through Resear ch Councils and National Institut es across India. Notable ones are prophylactic care through AYUSH interventions in about 20000 sample size by each Resear ch Council and National Institut e covering a large area through their peripher al institut es across India wherein AYUSH interventions are studied. Further , All India Institut e of Ayurv eda, Delhi has carried a promising stud y over a big cohort of 80000 Delhi police personnel for two months starting in May and are following up the cohort since then. The studies have shown very promising trends in reducing incidence of COVID 19 and In\u0000luenza like sympt oms among participants to a signi\u0000icant level and also in impr oving Quality of Life. 38Rasa yana: Way to enhance immunity: Easily available Rasyana drugs Haridr a, Amalaki, Shata vari, Draksha.
