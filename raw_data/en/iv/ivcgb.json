Most people think that just because they are, and mean the same thing in real life, that the same thing applies to the anime universes. This is NOT true. First I'll give you my analysis, then I want to see what you guys think. NOTE: I don't want to see someone writing \"Ki translates into chakra and there both life energy, so there both the same thing\" that's not true and it's not gonna work here, anime is in other dimensions. Ki: is the Life energy that exists in all living things even cosmic objects such as suns, planets, and even other worldly beings (Aliens) you don't have to be special to get it, any and everyone can obtain this power, but not everyone can get it to a crazy powerful state. There are three main components of Ki, Courage, energy and mind. It is made to exceed the human body's natural limits, and go beyond that of a human. Chakra: (Manga Spoiler alert!) According to Madara Uchiha Chakra was something that originally belonged to the Shinju clan. When Kaguya ate fruit the Shinju had, she became the first one in history to have Chakra. She used it power to end wars. Her son, Hagoromo Otsutsuki, was the first person to be born with Chakra. He gave it to humans, hopping it would make people understand one other without having to speak. This would ultimately end wars and conflicts. This was known as, Ninshu. however, instead of understanding one another, people amplified their inner Chakra and turned it into a weapon. Spirit Energy: The difference between spiritual pressure and spiritual energy is simple: Reiryoku is the amount of energy a being has stored within their body or soul, whereas Reiatsu is the pressure in ones soul. It's not something that lives inside of everything like Ki. I'ts all about your soul, not life energy. Spiritual pressure is what a soul reaper has when he or she has an immense amount of energy that can crush things or people around them, if someone hasn't had an encounter with someone from the halo realm, or seen a soul reaper, or at least had some sort of contact with the afterlife, they cannot sense, see, or even fell this pressure or the being making it. So as you can see, Spirit energy (Reiatsu), Ki, and Chakra all not only have a different origin, but they all work differently and are acquired differently. Think about it, it's like magneto trying to control wood or something. What do "}
