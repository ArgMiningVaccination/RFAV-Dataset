Herbal remedies were the main source of medicine available in the UK up until as recently as the 1930s, and 25% of modern pharmaceutical medicines available today were originally discovered and derived from plants. Modern scientific research has demonstrated the effectiveness of many plants for a wide range of ailments and there is considerable and growing scientific evidence and research on the benefits and effectiveness of specific herbal remedies. The process of making plant remedies occurs through minimal processing to preserve the active constituents of the plant. This processing usually includes drying fresh herbs, cutting them into a tea or grinding them into powder. Liquid herbal remedies known as herbal tinctures are made by soaking the dried or fresh herbs in alcohol for extraction and preservation. They work in a similar way to conventional medicine by having an effect on cell signalling, such as hormones, neurotransmitters and enzymes and other processes and functions. The difference with herbal remedies is that their action focuses on bringing the body back into balance (an individual's set point) which is also called homeostasis. An example of this is Hawthorn normalising blood pressure and Meadowsweet normalising stomach acid levels. Almost all conditions can be supported with herbal remedies and they can be used preventatively as well as for active conditions. For the best outcome, it is advisable to have a consultation with a Medical Herbalist to obtain the most appropriate and bespoke herbs for you and your condition(s). Herbal remedies have been used for thousands of years across the globe, spanning a multitude of cultures and hemispheres. There is a growing body of evidence and research on the effectiveness of using herbs and plants to help relieve conditions. For example, some herbs, such as andrographis, which has proved to be effective at fighting respiratory infections, is currently being trialed by t [he NHS to explore whether it should be prescribed](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2019/03/19/nhs-trial-ayurvedic-herbal-remedy-cut-antibiotics-coughs-colds/), in some cases, instead of antibiotics. The herbal products prescribed by a qualified Medical Herbalist are always safe. Natural does not always mean safe but a Medical Herbalist will always ensure a safe form is given and is appropriate for the individual person and their particular needs, including giving consideration to any other medicines a patient is already taking, whether prescription medicines or otherwise. It is always advisable to consult your doctor before taking herbs if you are taking prescription medicine or have a serious, long-standing or complicated condition. Medical herbalists will, however, always ensure that the herbs you take are safe and appropriate.
