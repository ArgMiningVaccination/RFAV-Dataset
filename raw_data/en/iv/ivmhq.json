Expenditure in the current year will be $78.7 million compared with $64.1 million for the year ended 30 September 1990 - an increase of23 per cent. It is anticipated that theTrust's income will continue to grow, atleastinlinewithinflation, forthe foreseeable future. Thisstrong financial positionisin nosmall way due to the continued success of Wellcome pic. The Trust's existing commitments to medical research continue to be maintained and in the past year many new initiatives have also been undertaken. Among those implemented in 1990 was the Hitchings-Elion Fellowship scheme which will enable up to fifteen United States' medical scientists to work in Britain each year. This new arrangement has been organized with the co- operationofthe Fogarty Foundation and theBurroughs Wellcome Fund. it illustrates theimportance the Trust attaches to increasing Anglo-hencan exchanges and also recognises the research activities of Dr George Hitchings and Dr Trudy Elion, who both won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1988 for their many years ofcreative work at Burroughs Wellcome. The results oftheir research have made a significant contribution to the prosperity ofboth Wellcome plcand the WellcomeTrust. On the domestic front, theTrust has becomevery concerned about thelevel ofsalaries in medical research. In October 1989 it was decided to expand the prize studentship scheme so that up to sixty PhD students could receive a realistic stipend. Also, the Tnst has enhanced the salaries of postdoctoral fellows and research assistants to a level which we believe will encourage them to stay in medical research. The Trustees are leased that other medical research charities and the Medical Research Council have accepted t!e need for these improved PhD stipends. The most important project that the Trust is undertaking at present is the refurbishment ofthe Wellcome Building. It will house theTnst's offices and the Wellcome Library of the History of Medicine, which will be linked by a tunnel to its very large book store in Bentley House on the north side of the Euston Road. The reconstruction of the Wellcome Building has required much planning and in the case ofthe exhibition 'Science for Life', a great deal ofimaginative work. The Wellcome Building will, we hope, become a centre for medical science and history and form a focus for medical research in Britain when it is occupied in early 1992. TwoTrustees, Dr Helen Muir and Lord Swann, retired during theyear. Helen Muir was a Tmstee for eight years. She is a dedicated research worker and always showed the deepest interest in the Trust's affairs. Her contribution to medical research has been considerable and we will miss her partici ation in our activities at Park Square West. LoriSwann retired on 1 March 1990 after seventeen years as a Trustee. Very sadly, he died suddenly on 22 September. Michael Swann was the most talented and congenial ofmen who gave great help toa wide variety ofinstitutions, both within and outside the academic world. He made a telling contribution to the success and development ofthe WellcomeTmst. He is greatly missed by us all. On 3OJune, Sir Alfred Shepperd retired. Hejoined Wellcome Foundation Limited as Finance Director in 1972andbecameits Chairmanand ChiefExecutivein 1977. Si Alfredled the Wellcome Gmup through its most exciting period ofgrowth and also through its transition to publiccompany status. He canquite rightly look back, with considerable pride, on what the Company has achieved over the past two decades. We at the Trust are most grateful to him. He has been succeeded by Sir Alistair Frame as Chairman of Wellcome plc and by MI John Robb as Chief Executive. We wish them both every success in the years ahead. It was recently announced that Dr Peter Williams, who has been Director ofthe WellcomeTrust forthepasttwenty-skyears, willretireon30September 1991.HewillbesucceededbyDrBridget Ogilvie, who is the Director of Science Programmes at the Trust. Never has the Wellcome Trust had a more active or demanding year. On behalfofthe Trustees, 1 would like to thank everyoneat theTrust andourpanelsofadvisersandrefereesfor theinvaluable contribution they have all made. R G Gibbs 4 INTRODUCTION AND PWCY I This report reviews the financial year 1 October 1989 to 30 September 1990, during which the Trust has had f63.0m available for its activities. This is an increase off13.7m on the pmious year. The policy statement for 1990191 issued in October 1990 envisaged anetpenditure research, and thehistory of medicine. This is the last introduction (thesixteenth) to aTrust report that IwiUwriteMoretheappoinment of a new Director. Even though I will he responsible for the period of the 1990/91 report, its introduction will he focused through the eyes ofmy successor DI Bridget M Og\u00fcvie. I therefore take this opportunity to express my personal views on the role of the Tnst in medical research today. Before doing so may I congratulate Dr Ogilvie on her appointment. Having personally recruited her as the first Director of Science Programmes at the Tnst it gives me great pleasure to pass on the mantle to her. The Wellcome Trust is an independent organisation which creates its own policy. It must, of course, do this on the basis ofknowledge ofthe state of the universities, the government and the National Health Service, and the changes taking place therein. Sometimes the Trust may have to react to these changes. Most ofthe time, however, its task must be to decide what is the best way to pursue Sir Henry Wellcome's stated purpose - to advance knowledgein the biomedical Saences and the history of medicine 'which may conduce to the improvement of the physical condition of mankind: Thus, scientific quality and relevance to the physical condition of mankind is the first criterion for selection. Inevitably in a field like medicine anumber ofperipherai possibilities arise which must be resisted if the central objective is to be limited enough to he effeaive. The usual diversions are requests for funds to support the university system, the health care system and special groups of deprived people. There are obviously sound reasons why help should be given to these three categories. However, once supported, they have an enormous appetite which would soon devour the resources ofeven such a relatively rich trust as the Wellcome. We have therefore taken the line that the university and health care systems must logically benefit as a spin-off from our central purpose rather than as central themes. Nevertheless the Wellcome Trust is now a very significant source of t\u00fcnding for universities. It also provides grants and has started to train researchetS for health services researdi. Wejudgeproposalsfrom thesesectors, likeallothers,onthemeritsofthescientificcasapresen~. This attitude means that we tend to leave to others the lobbying and negotiation that has been so active during the past year in relation to changes in the universities and health service, resulting from the early activities of the University Funding Council and in conneaion with the Health Services Act. There are enough voices from the universities and the medical world representing their case. TheTiustees and their staffare therefore pleased to support the AssociationofMedical Research Charities and the academic committee convened by the Royal College of Physicians - and serve on these - without feeling obliged to take part in further political lobbying. Wenotethat thenewpressuresontlteuniversities tobefinanciallylessdependenton~~ent are pushing them to sources of hinding that are less conducive to academic freedom than grants from an independent research council or a charitable foundation. it is difficult to believe that in today's political climate, commerce and government are not seeking advantage from the support of research when they make major contributions to universities. These motives are, of course, perfectly acceptable from the viewpoint of the prosperity of the country or the more equitable distribution of scientific activity over the realm. But when geographical distribution vies with academic suitability in determining where to place a research unit, we begin to use the wrong reasoning in deciding what to support. This is a danger that also besets disease-orientatedcharities trying to satisfy their donors' expectations that they will soon come up with a 'cure'. 5 One illustration must be the relocation of the activities ofthe Clinical Research Centre from Northwick Park, not to Hammersmith aloneas was proposed originally, but tovarious sites around tbecouotry. It isreasonable towant evenhandedness selectivity which often means the development ofa 'critical mass: The Wellcome Trust would therefore appear to be pulling against the general tenor of government policy as it continties to put excellence above short-term usefulness as the basis ofits selectivity. This policy is sustained at the Trust by maintaining a considerable scientific participation in theevolutionofmedical research.Thisis achieved fintly by theconstitutionoftheBoardofTnistees, ofwhom five out ofseven are practising scientists; and secondly by the Director and most ofthe senior staff who are scientifically trained and maintain an interest and participation in the flow ofscience in the various fields. All ofthis in-house expertiseis advised and supported by the active participation of more than 60 panel members and numerous expert referees. It is against this background that the Tmst has had to take a number ofmajor decisions during thepast year.Thefirst wasthereplacementoftworetiNigTnstees withsuitably qualifiedsuccessors. Here the problem was to ensure that the Tmst could attract the best people available and yet not so drown them in Tmst work as to make it impossible for them to continue the very activities which would make them valuable as Trustees. One way to reduce their load has been to relieve them ofthechairmanship oftheTrust's scientific advisory panels - although they will still attend as members. Another solution, in the case of Sir David Weatherall, was provided by Downing Street in appointing him to the Regius Professorship of Medicine at Oxford from 1992, which will relievehimofcertainonerous responsibilities. Sir HansKornbergwho has succeeded DrHelen Mnir, had, ofcourse, already passed over the Chairmanship of the Department ofBiochemistry in Cambridge to Professor Perham. The other step has been to expand the establishment ofscientific staff at the Trust by the appointment of scientific and senior scientific officers, who will become secretaries to the panels, and thereby enable the scientific programme directors to be relieved of some of their day-to-day routine. Having established what needs to be done, theTrustees have evolved a comprehensive programme of support for the biomedical sciences and the history of medicine. The principal aim has been to train and develop the potential of talented research workers, and to provide whatever form of support will most successfully advance knowledge in medical science and thehistory ofmedicine. An important step towards this end has been the implementation ofthe Trustees' decision to enhance the salaries ofpostdoctoral non-clinical scientists funded by theTrust. Thisdecision was announced in the last report, and its implementation, as hoped, hasled to other organisations acknowledging the need for greater financial recognition of the importance of medical research. The Trust continues to receive a large number of applications - a total of 1916 during the year of which 1155 were funded. However, one sometimes wonders whether the relentless pursuit for grants is beneficial for the system as a whole. An analysisofthe time allocated to their research projects by principal investigators applying for grants averaged 16 hours per week by new lecturers and 9.8 hours for established academic staff. This was for requests of f92 000, on average, most ofwhich goes towards salaries for staff. At a time when it is generally agreed that good quality staffaredifficult to find, thequestionmust beraisedas to whetherthe provisionoflimitedsupervision to numerous assistants is the most productive way of doing research rather that making a major creative commitment oneself? This is a real question, not a rhetorical one, and the Trust's newly created unit for Policy Studiesin Science and Medicine (PRISM) will be investigating this problem in due course. 6 News of recent awards During the year, apart from the regular grants programme, special studies have been made of a numberofnRNideas,andindividualawardsoutsidethecoreprogrammehavebeenmadeinresponse tospecialneedsThus theTrusthasgivenE30DOOOto theRoyalkietyofMedicinetocomputerise its library, which it is hoped will link even more closely to the Wellcome institute for the History of Medicine library. The Trust has helped this important library for medical research on previous occasions with substantial grants. The Royal College of Physicians of ireland also made a speciai plea for help withitslibraryandwasawardedE20000.ThenewInstiniteforMoleeularMedicine in Oxford which the TNst, together with the Medical Research Council and Imperial Cancer Research Fund, had helped to create, was given core funding ofE200 O00 per annum for five years so that it could get undenvay as quickly as possible. Also the Trust has agreed to fund the setting up of the European office of the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO). This will be located in Trust accommodation. Workshops on osteoporosis, gene therapy and mathematical biology led to policy discussions about support for these fields. in the last case, special fellowships and scholarships were created and the first awards were made in July 1990. A special review of the Tmst's support for veterinary research was undertaken by Dr Bridget Ogilviewhovisitedall theUKveterinaryschools. Asaresult, theTmsteesdecided tofundspeaal training awards for this field (see page 95). Note should also be taken of the progress of the developmental biology pmject in Cambridge The building is now nearing completion, and during the year the various teams have received major awards from the Trust so that they wiU be able to staff the Institute when it is opened in June 1991 by the Duke of Edinburgh. The second largest grant in the history ofthe Trust, E4m to Professor Roy M Anderson, FRS, at imperial Coliege, London was made during theyear to fund the WellcomeTrust Parasitic Diseases and Biology of Helminths Research Unit. Applications to the Trust for large sums of money for major developments are becoming more numerous. In the coming year the Tmstees are faced with a number of requests to mpp\" developments of this type, far outstripping the funds available Feedback on grant applications A high proportion of grant applicants, particularly those who have been unsuccen~, now request feedbackaftera decisionhas beenmadeon theirproposals.Theprovis+onofthisinfomtionseems to be appreciated by the recipients but it must be emphasised that the sending of feedback with subsequent agreement to submit a new or revised proposal cannot beinterpreted as an indication that supportw~beprovided.Theprovisionoffeedb~kpplacesaconsiderableandadditionalburden on the office staff and it is important therefore that the Bust receives in retuTn information from applicants who have benefited from this process. 7 -AND- History of Medicine In the history of medicine the Wellcome stitute has been much preoccupied with moving into temporary accommodation inBentley House and in Tavistock Square. The major task ofrelocating and storing the library was undertaken during the early part of 1990 and much credit must go to Messrs Eric Freeman, Robin Price and Steven Emberton and all their assistants for its smooth achievement. A special meeting of the Trust's History of Medicine Advisory Panel was held in May from which evolved a forward-looking plan aimed at extending the public interface with the subject, especially among students and doctors. The decision to place the visual images of the iconographic collections held by the Tmst on to a videodisc will create a valuable resource for the future. Alsoofnote was theloan to the National Gallery ofthepainting by AdamElsheimer of Saint Elizabeth tending the sick, which was used by the Trust for its 1990 Christmas card. The work of the Academic Unit of the institute came up for special review and was highly commended. 8 Iin#oucm*uppoynr Centre for Medical Science and History Finally, wemustdraw attentiontothevery hardworkundenakenontherefurbishmentofBen~~ House and the WeUcomeBuilding. These major developments, which wi\u00fcconsolidatethe'liust's in-house activities on opposite sides of the Euston Road, joined by a tunnel, have necessitated extremely hard work by Mr Denis Richardson, the project manager, and his team, who are to be congratulated onbringingthedevelopmentofBentleyHowtocompletionontimeandwithin budget. It was an onerous task to create the capacity to store the Wellcome Library (on mobile shelving) aswellastoprovideracksforthepictures, manusuiptsandarchivesownedbytheTrust.

The whole enterprise has been managed through a Centre Working Party chaired by the Director who up to now has assumed overall charge for the Centre. Dr Laurence Smje has been hmsf\u00e9rred with e&# from early October 1990 from the Directorship ofthe Physiology and Pharmacology Programme to take charge ofthe Centre, and Mr Steven Emberton who had earlier become the Public Activities Development Manager, will now work with Dr Smaje. The Centre will include an exhibitiofi. 'Science for Life' being developed by Dr Paulette McManus in conjunction with the designers MET Studio. Regular committee meetings have been held to define the content of e& don of the exhibition. Formulating these plans has been a stimulating exercise and we hope that the eventual product will be very attractive and informative. 9 \\\\L VnmLmeB I GROUND FLOOR PLAN m - - \".I / The resources centre is aimed at providing information on the availability ofgrants and positions in medical research, and will be linked through JANET to all universities in the country. As the resonrce develops we believe that it will become an important support for medical research. In addition, the tropical videodisc and the iconographic disc will be accessible through the Centre. \u00efhese are described in more detail on pages 129 and 132. The third activity is ameetings programme using the excellent facilities being developed in the building. Some meetings will be generated internally to promote the interests of the Trust and the research community. Others will arise through the activities ofthe various organisations which may wish to use the facilities. The WeiicomeTrust isa busy placeasit strives toheinnovativein thesupport ofmedical research and medical history. This report gives details ofthe awards made during the year, each ofwhich has received detailed scrutiny. After twenty-six years at the helm I leave the Trust with a feeling of great satisfaction that it is now fulfilling Sir Henry Wellcome's great expectations and wiIi continue to do soin the future. P O Williams 10 FINANCE The finances of the Trust are closely linked to the performance ofits total invemnent por&oLo. \u00efheinvffitmentportfolomanagedbytheTrust'sInvestmentManagerswhilstproducbiguiincome of f14.0m in 1989190 was subject to the very considerable fluctuations in theinternatiodstodr markets, particularly towards the end of the year when tension in the Middle East led to the very severe marking down ofvalues on all the major international stock markets. As adt its market value at the end of the year was f237m (f223m 1986). The value of Wellcome pic shares during the year moved at times quite spectacularly. Having started the year at 664p. the price then rose to 780p in January, falling to 423p on the 24 August and closing the year at 476p. During the year the value of the distributions made by Wellcome plc showed a 34.6 per cent in- on the previous year's figures and, at \u20ac44.21~1, represented some 70 per cent ofthe Tnist's total income which amounts to f63m (f493m in 1989). The expenditure during the year in support of medical research amounted to \u20ac54.6m, with a furtherS.8mcommitted to thesu~uortofthehistorv ofmedicincnieamountadableforsuppon .= __ in 1990/91 totals E72.7m. 11 The Government has yet to indicate when the proposed new legislation on charities may be put before Parliament. The 1989 White Paper entitled Chriries: A Frntneuiorkfor /he Fulure still allows for representations to be made on behalf of the charity world and these continuing efforts will probably lessen the effect that any legislation might have on highly responsible charities such as the Wellcome Trust. The singleEuropean market planned for 1992 still causes concern, as harmonisation ofthe fiscal treatment of foundations may well damage charities in the UK. Wellcome pic The company has seen a year of considerable change. Sir Alfred Shepperd retired as Chairman and ChiefExecutive on 30 June and was replaced by Sir Alistair Frame as Chairman and by Mr John Robb as ChiefExecutive. Mr Martin Brookman retired and was replaced by MrJohn Precious as Group Finance Director. Mr Claude Matonsalso retired. MrJames Cochranejoined the Company as European Operations Director and Mr Keith Merrifield joined the WeUcome Board as International Operations Director after spending a number of years as Managing Director of Wellcome International Trading Ltd. It is pleasing to note that Wellcome pic were again awarded the Queens Award for Export Achievement. TheTrustees continue their regular visits to WeUcome plcestablishmentspartiicularly to the research facilities at Beckenham in England and in North Carolina, USA. Lord Swann This noteabout LordSwannwasbeiigwritten to commemorate his Trusteeship when we heard of his sudden death on 22 September 1990 only seven months after he ceased to be nTrustee. Weextendourdeepest sympathy to Lady Swann and their family. Lord Swann became a Trustee in 1973. He succeeded Lord Murray of Newhaven and took on the roleofrepresenting the university interface of the Trust. He also brought with him an important background of biological research from his work as Professor of Zoology in Edinburgh. He was the Principal ofEdinburgh University at the time of his appointment but not long after becoming aTrustee he became Chairman oftheBBC.This. ofcourse, lessenedhisdirect university involvement but brought to the mist other useful connections. Lord Swann also brought to the Trust an interest in theveterinary field, stemming from his chairmanship of the loint Committee on 'l\u00fbt Ri Han rhr Lad Suuim, FRS theuseofantibi~titiainar;imalhusbandryandveterinarymedicine,andsohewasanantcllsuccessor to Professor Robert Thompson as Chairman ofthe Trust's Veterinary Panel. Along with the late Keith Sinclair, he stimulated the Trust's veterinary programme to grow and develop. When he received a peerage in 1981 he added another dimension to the Trust by providing an ongoing contact with Parliament, thus broadening the political interface of the Tiust. ALI of us at theTrust gained great pleasure from our association with him and miss his participation hour meetings. 12 13 Helen Muir Helm Muir brought to the Trustees her background in biochemistry and cell biology and assumed responsibility for these fields alongside MichaelMorgan from 1982 to 1990. She took her role seriously and worked very hard on her panel papers to ensure that the best applications were selected for support. She undertook this considerableeffort, against the background of her busy life as Head of the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology. She gained many international and national honours for lier work during the time of her Trusteeship, including being elected a Foreign Member in the class for Medical Sciences, by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and an honorary DSc by Brunei University. During her time at the Trust many changes occurred in the size and style of its activities and in biochemistry, specially the development of the molecular and cellular approach to biomedical science. Helen Muir was the first woman to be appointed to the Board of Trustees and she brought grace and elegance to our activities from which we all benefited. I Hlln: dfidr, CBE, dlA, DPhil, DSr, FRS DICE Gordon Smith was awarded the George McDonald Medal in April 1990. This is awarded jointly by the Royal Society oflropical Medicine and Hygiene and the London School ofHygiene and Tropical Medicinein recognition ofoutstanding research leading to the improvement ofbealth in tropical countries. Professor Sir David Weatherall was appointed as a Foreign Member ofthe National Academy of Science of the USA, a rare distinction for a practising clinician.

In addition, the computer staff also support 26 personal computers, an increase of 17 on 1988/89. which are used for localised processing. Plans are undenvay for the transfer of the main computer to the WellcomeBuilding. Work continues towards a fully integrated grants administration and accounting system. The Property Department has during the year supervised the successful renovation programme within Bentley House andis now very heavily committed to managing the major redevelopment of the Wellcome Building. The number ofpersonnel employed within the Trust during the year has increased to 141 from 129 and it is anticipated that, as we move towards the opening of the new Wellcome Building, the Centre for Medical Science and History, and the Information Resources Centre, staffnumbers will continue togrow.Theplanningfor theuseofthenew buiidmgandforthestaffingandfacilities required to support these new activities is now at an advanced stage. James Hd James Howard had been known to the Tmstees for a very long time, initiaUy because he had worked with Lord Swann in the department of Zoology in Edinburgh from 1966 to 1969. He then moved to the Wellcome Laboratories in Beckenham, where over many years he contributed to the leadership of biological activities and the management of research. When the direction ofthe laboratories took a new turn and anew research director was appointed, he felt the time had come to retire. He was invited to the Tmst as a Programme Director to look after its Tropical and Infectious Diseases Programmes in succession to Bridget Ogilvie, who had become Director of Science Programmes. His personal stature, high level ofscientitc achievement and the respect in which he was held by fellow scientists made it possible for him to develop this programme even further. His knowledge of the Tropics was less great but he soon established close contacts with the Trust's Units overseas, which led to him encouraging their development. in particular, his wisdom was very important during the difficult phasesoftransfer ofresponsibiity for the Indian andJamaican Units and the planning andimplementation ofdevelopmenis inKenya. His thoughts on the future ofBelem and for a closer association with the Francophile tropics will be of special importance in the next phase. His company and good sense wereenjoyed and valued and will be missedby many at the Tmst. He has been succeededby RE Howells Professor ofparasitology at theLiverpool School oflropical Medicine. Dr Howells was a member of the Tmst's Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases Panel prior to his appointment. Derek MetcaIfe Derek Metcalfe could be said to be the last of the original staff (excepting the Director) recruited before the Tmst moved to Park Square West. He had thus seen the whole place grow from its small beginnings and his career had developed along with the Tmst resulting in his appointment as ChiefAdministrativeOfficerin 1985. Hisspwalachievementwastomakethegnnapro~ an efficient and coherent entity. He developed and instilled discipline into the whole programme so that the many grants officers who came under his tutelage developed a great respeft for his sense and integrity. Having been so long with the Tmst he knew all about it and, until a year before he retired, was responsible for a very wide range of administration. After his retirement at the end ofJune 1990, aid with the growth of the Tmst, it has been necessary for two staEto be appointed to take on his former role. One of these appointees is Mrs Linda Arter, who has become Head of Grants Administration. Linda has been trained by Derek and has proved a great su~s. Unfortunately, Derek had suffered from ill health for a number of years and it was therefore agreed that he should retire a few years early. He is sadly missed. AcknowIedgements The Tmstees and their staff would like to express their thanks to the numemus expert advisers who assist the work of the Tmst by refereeing applications, serving on committees and panels andadvising onpolicy.TheadministrarionoftheTNst wouldbe,@qmssiblewithoutthekunstdhg support. 18 19 SUPPORT FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH During the year theTrust's commitment to medical research totalled S54.6m (E40.0m for 1988/89). The foliowing sections examine each scheme and panel in detail. The subsequent pages give an overview of the work of the Tist. A total of 1916 applications were received (compared with 1591 for 1988/89). Of these 1155 were funded in part or in full, representing 60 per cent ofrequests. The total value ofapplications was S1439m (see Figures 2 and 3). 20 21 TheTmstees policy is toset asideone-third oftheir income for longer-termsupport. An analysis, by panel, excluding the history ofmedicine, for 1990 onwards is given at Figure 5. (For details on expenditure for the support of the history of medicine see page 120).

This scheme is designed to provide medical graduates with research training on the application of epidemiological principles and techniques to problems in clinical research. Fellows nody receive support for a Master's Degree in epidemiology, as part ofthe Ttaining Wodip. In the year under review (1988189inparenthesis for comparison) 13 (12)nominationswerereceivedand 4(5) new awards were made. Applications under this scheme are now considered in parallel with Research Training Fellowships in Health Services Research. The dividing line between thesubject matter of research in these two schemes is necessarily indistinct, and it has helped in the selection procedure for the interviewers to see applicants in the two schemes in parallel. The Tmst's Clinical Epidemiology Fellows have an excellent record in movingonm estabkhed positions where they can continue their research. For example, Dr S Wesseley received a Clinical Epidemiology Fellowship for studies in forensic psychiatry. He developed an interest in the epidemiology of post-viral fatigue syndromes, and his findings attracted considerable interest. He has now moved to a Senior Lectureship in psychiatry at King's College School ofMedicine Dr Frances F M Cowan Department ofGeniIo-Urinmy Medicine, Udvemly demographic charactcrirtics, scxud behaviour and symptoms. under PNfirmr .Ai W Adler @iikiliZ%WA>.

The Trustees regard the research training ofyoung medical and dental graduates as being ofparamount importance, and have provided substantial additional funds for this scheme in 1989190. This general scheme covers all clinical subjects including the Trust's former Research Training Fellowship schemes in surgery and pathology. A few selected subjects such as psychiatry and ophthalmology are covered by separate arrangements. The Tmst continues to note with disappointment the relatively few applications from surgeons, obstetricians and pathologists. Part ofthe reason for this deficiency may be the ciinicai training requirements in these specialities, and we are therefore investigating ways to promote research in these important areas of clinical science. Thereis evidence that prospective fellows and their sponsors welcome the flexibility oftheTmst's training fellowship schemes. Medical Graduate Fellowships are awarded in competition four times each year, and the length and type ofsupport are flexible. Fellows sometimes reccive research training at selected centres abroad, where this experience cannot be gained within the British Isles.

The table below (Figure 8) lists the number of nomiiiatioiis and awards since its inception in the academic year 1987188. These fellowships are open to graduates it: a wide range ofdisciplines, iiicluding medicine, and the Tnistees have been ericoiiraged by the high quality of many of the applicants. Health Services Research is a subject of increasing importance, and the Trustees' decision to introdiicc this scheme was in recognition of the need for well-trained research workers in this field. 111 thelight ofthesuccessofthe fellowships, they have agreed a limited programmeofsupport for research projects in Health Services Research, and grants ofthis type will be available in the academic year 199019 I. The Trustees noted with interest the Government's proposals for research within the Health Service, in the White Paper PriorifiCs iii A4cdicd Rrscoirii (CM 902). They have expressed the hope that research develops its rightfni place as an itnportaiit arm of the National Health Service.

TheTrustees have received a number of representations about the shortage ofresearchers working at the interface between mathematics and biology. Mathematical biology is ofincreasing importance in many areas of the life sciences, and difficulties in attracting qualified staff in this subject had beennoted in various areasoftheTrust'sinterest: forexample, research workmusingnon-invasive methods for studies ofthe brain (see page 43) have had some difficulty in attracting statisticians interested in developing methods for handling the large and complex data sets generated by these techniques. A meeting was therefore held at the offices of the Trust where Trustees discussed the problem with a number of outside experts. in the light of those discussions, the Tmst advertised a new scheme of support providing Postdoctoral Fellowships and Research Training Scholarships in Mathematical Biology. Fellowship support is flexible in type, designed to attract mathematicians to pursue independent studies applying their mathematical skills to a biological problem, and to attract postdoctoral biological scientists to develop their mathematical skills in rehion to their biological interests. Fellowships are advertised with a tenure ofup to Eve years. Research Training Studentships are also advertised for graduates with mathematical or biological degrees, wishing to study for a PhD degree at the interface. The possibility of support for four years is available, to allow graduates to fully develop their skills in areas not covered by their first degree. Twelve applications for fellowships were received, and seven candidates were interviewed. One fellowship application was approved for support. Twenty applications for Research Training Scholarships were received, and four awards agreed. One award was subsequently withdrawn as the candidate decided to take up another offer. This scheme will be advertised again in the year 199011991. The Tnistees are most grateful to the experts who advised them on the development of this programme, both at the meeting held at theTrust andelsewhereininformaldiscussion. They arealso particularly gratefulto theoutside experts who helped with the assessment of candidates in the first round of this new scheme.

An interim review conducted during the year led to the decision by the Trustees that awards would continue to be made to individuals and will not normally be transferable. Movement between institutions will be encouraged by ensuring that about 50 per cent of places arc made available to nominees from a different institution. It had been hoped to attract graduates from the physical sciences by making some awards for four years. The Trustces are disappointed to note that this approach does not seem to have been successfitl in attracting a significant number. There were fewer withdrawals following award this year (9 as opposed to 18 during 1988/89) but whether this was because of the increased stipend is not known. The significant amount ofmearch being undertaken in polytechnics was recognised by allotting 3 number of nominations to the Committee of Polytechnic Heads ofBiological Sciences. This body undertook prelinunary screening of applications from polytechnics on our behalf and fonvarded a restricted number to the Trust, severai of which were awarded. In the coming year, theschemeis toexpand to 80 studcntships. Nominations will also beinvited from Wellcome3ust Units, Principal Fellows and postgraduateinstitute\u00e7; up to now applications have been largely confined to universities undertaking undergraduate as well as postgraduate teaching. The Prize Studentship scheme, like all Trust schemes, is open to modification and theTrust will therefore he pleased to receive suggestions for improvement. Itshonld beemphasised that thcPrizcStudentshipsarenotopen toindividualapplicationsfiom candidates or supervisors. Instead, institntions are invited to nominatea specificnumber ofcandidates from which the Trustees will select a proportion for award.

For the purpose of consideration of grants, the Neuroscience Panel divides into two groups: the Mental Health and Neuroscience Grants Committee, and the Vision Research Working Party (see page 100): The Trustees hope that the research community will recognise, from the names assigned to these two groups their continuing special interest in developing research in psychiatry, ophthalmology and the other dinical neuroscience subjects, on a solid foundation of high quality basic neuroscience research. The two Grants Committees considered an unusually large number of applications, and the competition forsupport was severe. Grants totalling E6.2mwereawarded,arcludinglonger-term support.

The programme subsumes the major part oftheTrust's activities previously considered by theveterinary, Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases sections; the majority of which were in these subject fields. Applications for awardsin infection and immunity are reviewed by a panel often external scientists representing the many and diverse subjects covered by this programme, including two veterinarians. Inaddition to their essential rolein the assessment ofgrant requests, panelmembers provide valuable advice on policy issues and research fields requiring special attention. During theyear the Panel's expenditureamounted to S6.6 million, includinglonger-term support, equivalent to 12.3 per cent of the Trust's overall research support expenditure. 187 project grant applications were considered by the Panel and 57 per cent were funded. The 53.0 million allocated to project grants represented 39 per cent of the total amount requested. Eleven proposals for Weilcome programme grants were considered by the Panel during the report period, from which the Tnistees made four awards. One award was for S4 million, to Professor R M Anderson at Imperial College London for the support of a new research Unit in parasitic diseases and the biology ofhelminths. The Unit will focus on diseases caused by parasitic worms. These parasites, which are amongst the most common of human infections, add significantly to the publichealth problems in theThird World where the humanimmunesystem can provide ody a weak bel of protection against them. The total cost of the five longer-tern awards was S5.9 million. In February 1990 a workshop on the 'Molecular and Physiological Basis of Vector Parasite Interactions and its Epidemiological Implications' was held at the Dorny House Hotel, Broadway. 49 scientists from the UK and overseas attended this successful meeting, which was organised by Dr R P Lane, Professor D H Molyneux and Jiliy Steward. The workshop was jointly funded by the Wellcome Trust and the UNDPlWorld BanWgVHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases. Dr A H Fairlamb was awarded a personal chair in Molecular Parasitology, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine from 1 August 1990. Dr Fairlamb is cunently in receipt of funding for a study oftrypanothione surrogates: a series ofchemical compounds which my provide a lead to treatments for for work of an outstanding nature to a biochemist under 35 yean of age. Dr Ferguson is a lecturer in the Department ofBiochemistry at the University OfDundee. He ho]& a Wekome Trust longer-term award for research into the role ofglycoconjugates in parasite survival and host-parasite interactions.

(Grants Officer) S A Heat, BSc, ACIS, (Grants Officer) 65 AND CEU MOLECULAR AND CELL In the summer of 1989 a major re-organisation of the Tmst panel structure took place resulting in the demise ofthe Biochemistry and Cell Panel and the establishment ofthe Molecular and Cell Panel which, in addition to the former responsibilities OftheBiochemistr)' and Cell Biology Panel became responsible for the clinical, veterinary and tropical interests which use the tools ofmolecular and cell sciencein their investigations. A major consequence of this re-organisation. coupled with a realisation in the scientific comniunity that the Wellcome Tmst is a major funder of research in this area, was a greatly increased number ofgrant applications such that the work load almost doubled. This was also reflected in an increased number ofmeetings from four to six per annum. Panel membership was adjusted to take account of this change in responsibility and now includes both basic and clinically qualified scientific advisers. TheTnist has also established aseries ofspecial interest groups to look after the concerns ofgroups such as clinical researchers which were formerly the business of the Clinical Panel. \u00efhe total number of applications for grants, excluding longer-term support, during 1989190 was 301, of which 151 were awarded in part or in full. \u00efhepanelwasabletomeet31 percentofthef26.4mtotalrequest fortheyear.Thetotalamount awarded was therefore S8.2m. The following three awards for longer-term support are ofparticular interest. In two instances scientists have been assisted in their objective of relocating from foreign bases back to the UK. Thus Professor Adrian Bird leaves the Institute of Molecular Pathology in Vienna to take up the Buchanan Chair of Genetics at the University of Edinburgh. The Tmst has provided funds to help refurbish his laboratory space and to help establish his research group. Professor Bird is well known for his studies on methylation ofDNA and its role in the regulation ofgene expression. Professor Jonathan Lamb presently at the University of Stanford is taking up the Chair of Immunology at St Mary's Hospital Medical School and has been provided with assistance to establish his laboratory and to set up a research group. Professor Lamb has made a fundamental contribution in establishing atopy on a scientific basis. In recognitionofhisseminal discoveriesoncalcium transientsin singlecells and the application ofnovel approaches, Professor Cobbold at the Department otBiochenustry, University ofLiverpool has also been provided with long-term support for his research group. Such major project grants are intended to provide the principal investigators with sufficient funds so that they do not need to spend so much time applying for smaller short-term grants. It is likely that by the time this report is published the Wellcome and Cancer Research Campaign Institute of Cancer and Developmental Biology in Cambridge will have opened its doors to the principalinvestigators who will wehope haveestahlished their research groups. The official opening will takeplacein thesummerof 1991. Aspartofthesetting-upphaseoftheInstitute, theTmstees considered applications from Dr Michael E Akam (Department of Getietics, University of Cambridge) and Professor Brigid L M Hogan (Department ofCellBiology, Vanderbilt University, USA) to provide Principal Research Fellowships for their own support and long-term support for their staff who are to establish research programmes within the Institute. Dr Akam will be investigating the devebpniental genetics in the fruit fly Dmsoplli/d iaeldirognrQr and the locust. Professor Hogan will be establishing a major programme (in collaboration with D~ M~~~~~E~~~~J on the ndecufar genetics ofdevelopment in the mouse. (Professor Hogan has unfofiunat+ now decided to stay in the United States.) It is a special pleasure to be able to report such a major \"reverse brain drain\" which returns to the UK scientific community such outstanding scientists. 66 Summer Schools Two Summer Schools were held in conjunction with the biochemistry department at the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas's Hospitals. The first, on Molecular Parasitology was directed by DrsJulian Crumpton, Debbie Smith,andMurray %kid<; thesecond on DNA related methods human genetics: YAC cloning in genome analysis was direaed by Dr William Brown, Dr David Bentley and Dr Tony Monaco. The participants came from all over the world and both courses were heavily over-subscribed. Meetings Two one-day meetings were organised on topics of some immediate interest to the clinical and molecular genetics community. The first on malignant hyperthermia was organised to assist in the co-ordination ofthe search for the gene responsible for this life threatening condition which is revealed during anaesthesia. The second meeting on gene therapy was ofparticular Helen's warm, but fum chairmanship was appreciated by all who served on this Panel and its predecessor, the Biochemistry and Cell Panel, and I am sure they would wish m join with us in wishing her a happy and long retirement.

The expansion ofthe range ofresponsibility to cover both basic science and human and veterinary clinical science. wh\u00fcst helpful inemphasising the unity ofbiomedical science, has meant that panel members have had to deal with a wide range ofsubjects: from broken teeth in sheep and bone disease in horses via epidemiology ofdiabetes in India through immunology and molecular biology of endocrine and vascular disease to the biochemical control of the opening of ce11 membrane channels. This diffidt task has been performed conscientiously and with good humour by our expert panel members to whom the Trust and the scientific community owe a great debt of gratitude. Another factor increasing the work load has been the number ofapplications received, 271 in 1989/90 as opposed to 186 in the previous year. The success rate in competing for funds was 33 per cent of amount requested as opposed to 37 per cent last year (these figures exclude longer- term support). In order to find time to properly discuss the number of applications now being received, meetings are starting earlier and finishing later and the July meeting was held over two days. Next year the number ofmeetings has been increased to five, and two ofthese are scheduled overtwoday periodaniepressureon theref~ees,panelmembersand theadministrativestructure of the Trust is considerable. One issue that gave rise to concern during the year was the condition ofosteoporosis. This is becoming a major problem in our ageing population and may give rise to fractures. 50 per cent of cases result in a need for long-term institutional care at great cost to the individual and the community. The panel was receiving a number of applications for studies in osteoporosis, some ofwhich seemed to imply very long-term studies. A special working group was consequently set up with the brief to explore what ought to be the Trust's policy, in view of the fact that the Medical Research Council was also considering the matter. A paper suggesting that an effective treatment is possible appeared at the time the working group met, thereby simplifying its task. It was agreed that no specia ti~ was needed and that appfications should continue to beaccepted andjudged on their own merits. A careful watch on the situation will be maintained. Toxicology is a subject which was identified by the Trustees for special development as long ago as 197\u00fb A scheme ofAdvanced Training Fellowships in Toxicology was introduced in 1986187. This scheme together with a protected budget for toxicology was handled by the Physiology and Pharmacology Panel. An increasing number of grant applications were in the biochemical area however and it was decided that in future applications should go to the most appropriate panel, whether this were Physiology and Pharmacology or Molecular and CeU, while fellowships wiU continue to be administered by the Physiology and Pharmacology Panel. Only 11.5 per cent of project grant applications in toxicology were successful compared with nearly three times as many in physiology and pharmacology. It is not clear whether this is due to an inadequate budget or to poor applications. The new arrangements should clarify this. Furthemore, applications for Advanced Training Fellowships in Toxicology suffered a sharp decline this year. Only four applications were received, none of which was considered suitable. A working group consisting offrust advisors, external advisors includingindustry, andTrust staffmet to discuss this situation and concluded that training ought to start earlier than the postdoctoral level. The Trustees have agreed to this and a special scheme of Prize Studentships in ToXcology has been agreed. 78 List ofgrants awarded over f2WO LONGER .TERM YipPoRT Profeiror R ycq for a study of oxytocin and fntility in domestic Department oiAriatomyandPhysiology,Univenityof Dundee: human using rtahlc- for of sodium. and potassium by d m\u00fccaing duct in primary culture CIPNMIBUA).

This Interest Group will concern itselfwith such matters as recruitment and careers; the interviewing of candidates for tropically-related fellowships; consideration of the progress and annual budgets of the overseas Units and the case for further development. in the year under review expenditure on tropical fellowships and overseas units was S1.5 million. A meeting ofthe Directors of the Tropical Units was held at the Trust in May 1990 at which the following papers were given; Wellcome Research Unit, Vellore, India Professor V I Mathan 'Physiology and epidemiology in designing ORS and 'From a research grant to a national centre: A joint endeavour of the Wellcome Trust and the Christian Medical College' Dr B S Ramakrishna 'The colon in diarrhoea1 D W Macdonald 'Canid reservoirs: Foxes and dogs as maintenance and reservoir hosts' Dr J J Shaw 'Monoclonal antibodies and parasite identification', 'Monkeys as laboratory models in studies on the immnnohistopathology of Dermal Leishmaniasis - Dr T F Silveira' Tropical Metabolism Research Unit, University of the West Indies, Jamaica Dr M H N Golden 'The pathogenesis of severe malnutrition' Dr 'Pregnancy T E Forrester induced hypertension in Jamaica' Wellcome Research Unit, Bangkok, Thailand Dr N J White 'Studies on malaria, melioidosis and sexually transmitted diseases' 91 Wellcome Trust Research Laboratories, Nairobi, Kenya Dr W M Watkins 'Pharmacokinetics and parasitological studies of antifolate antimalarial drugs'.

UNITS WeUcome Bust Research Laboratories, Nairobi, Kenya For the Trust's unit in Kenya, the past year has been one ofexceptional vigour and productivity in research, Two research programmes on AIDS are underway in Nairobi. The first is an in-depth clinical delineation ofthe disease (Dr C F Gilks and Professor D A Warrell). The second concerns the impact of HIV infection on tuberculosis (Dr P P Nnnn, Dr R J Brindle and Professor K P W J McAdam). Dr W M Watkins, the Unit Director, has successfully integrated the research programmes based in Nairobi and at Kilifi on thecoast, with thoseofthe Kenya MedicalResearch Institute (KEMXI). Dr Watkins' own research programme concerns drug pharmacokinetics and parasite resistance in the chemotherapy and prophylaxis of Pi~sitiuniiitiijnk$nnriti malaria. This has involved close collaboration with Professors AM Breckenridge (Department ofPharmacology andTherapeutics, University of Liverpool), RE Howells (then at Liverpool School ofTropica1 Medicine) and Dr P Winstanley, an MRC supported clinical research fellow based at Kilifi. By the beginning ofthe report period, the coastal research unit at Kilifi had broughtinto service a new laboratory/office unit and paediatric ward provided by the Trust. The Unit has continued its programme of research into severe Z?>fnlripnrst malaria in children which was initiated early in 1989. Dr Geoffiey Pasvol who was responsible for developing the coastal unit during this period returnedtotheUKinMay 1990,and tooknptheChairoflnfectiousDiseasesandTropical Medicine at St Mary's Hospital Medical School on 1 October 1990. Dr Kevin Marsh replaced Dr Pasvol as leader of the clinical research team, composed of Drs Charles Newton, Peter Winstanley and Mr Peter Warn (medical technologist). During the year Dr Marsh was awarded a Wellcome Senior Clinical Research Fellowship. The Trustees were pleased to learn that Dr Watkins was appointed a Chief Research Officer within the Kenyan Medical Research Institute. This is their most senior grade ofresearch officer and is on the same grade as their Director, Dr Davy Koech. Dr J G Howard and Professor RE Howells visited Nairobi and Kilifi in March 1990. 92 Unidade de Estudos Especiais da WeUcome, BeI\u00e9m, Brad establishedin to study theecology andepidemiology ofhumanleishtnaniasis in the Amazonian regionofBrazil. During the past quarter century the Unit's Director, Professor RLainson FRS and his long-term collaborator DrJ J Shaw have become the foremost authorities on the biology of New World leishmaniasis. They have published many major contributions to the indentification and taxonomy of leishmanial parasites, sandny vectors and animal reservoirs as well as the delineation of four distinct clinical types of the disease in man. During the period of this report certain of the Unit's research activities entered a period of consolidation to ensure their completion by the time of Professor Lainson's retirement in 1992. The researdi work of the Unit will be concentrated on visceral leishmaniasis but a major effort will he directed to organising the remarkable collection ofcryo-preserved parasite materia! in the Unit, and the associated records, to ensure their survival after 1992. The Trust is examining ways in which opportunities afforded by the special location of this Unit can be developed in the future. WeiicomelMahidol UniwrsityDxfod 'Itopical Research Programme, BangLol4lbpilpM1 DrNJWhite hasbeenDirectorsince on the pathophysiology and clinical pharmacology of swerePlm~diti~njdcipnmnfairipaMm malaria.

Fieldstationsat is on anddoubIeinfCdonwith Pvivax. A clinical study is underway at another fieldstation at Ubon Ratchabni with laboratory studies on the antibiotic sensitivity of Ps-pseudomaliei. Research on sexually transmitted diseases now concentrates on the bacteriology of inguinal buboes. During the period of this report the Director, Dr N J White visited Cho Qum Hospital. Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam to explore the opportunity for establishing clinical research pmjectsinto malaria and other infectious diseases there Funds have now been provided for pilot studies. Wellcome 'Rust Research Unit, VeUore The work in Vellore which was first supported in 1957 came under the Directorship of Professor VI Mathan in 1976. Its original remit was to investigate tropical sprue, but this was subsequently broadened to include diarrhoea1 diseases of local importance. The work undertaken involves pathological, microbiological, biochemical and physiological approaches. Field studies in nearby villages have established the striking prevalence of intestinal pathogens (bacteria, viruses and parasites) in an apparently healthy rural population. The basis ofthi\u00e7 apparent resistance to overt infection, knowntobeassociated withmucosalchangesintheintesnnal traa.is amajorobjectiw of the Unit's research. Long-term epidemiological studies on the prevalence and duration of the phenomenon are in progress. On 1 April 1990 the Unit was recognised by the Indian Council ofMedical Research (ICMR) as an ICMR Advanced Centre. The Trust's financial responsibility for the Unit ceased on that date but some support wili continue to be provided to help with the transitional phase. The Trustees were pleased to learn that Professor Mathan has been elected a Fellow ofthe Indian National Science Academy. 93 %ce Element Research Group WRG), lfopical Metabolism Research Unit FMRU), University of the West Indies, Kingston, Jamaica This Unit is associated with the University of the West Indies on the Mona Campus, Jamaica. Dr M H N Golden is Director of both the Trust-funded TERG and of the TMRU. This latter appointment is supportedjointly by the Tmst and the University as are two other scientists there, Dr Sally Grantham-McGregor and Dr T E Forrester. The TERG investigates the role of defective antioxidant defence in the genesis of the stunted height and retarded mental development of malnutrition states, the role of intestinal helminths in retarded growth, and metabolic abnormalities leading to hypertension in pregnancy. The Unit operates an integrated programme of clinical, laboratory and field studies. It has been notably successful in developing strategies for identifying and treating malnourished children at the community level. Following a visit by an advisory group from the Trust in ApriUMay 1990 it was decided that theTrust should terminateitsdirect financial responsibility forTERG and theTMRU. Acontribution of S54O O00 has been made to the University to help to maintain the momentum of the research of the TMRU. This decision ends a very long period of association between the Tmst and the TMRU in Jamaica. A wide variety of support has been provided and Dr Golden has played a significant role over the past 17 years in developing its research programme and administration. who worked in the Unit with Trust support, every success in this new phase of their research. 94 vETEWNAW-t3ROW VETERINARY INTEREST GROUP # * ** Professor P M Biggs, CBE, FRCVS, FRS, Formerly Director, AFRC institute for Animal The Rt Hon the Lord Swann, FRS, (Chairman, Wellcome Trustee) C E Gordon Smith, CB, MD.

Some ofthese changes were foreshadowed in the Trust's eighteenth report but came into effect during 1989/90. Lord Swam retired as a Trustee on 28 February 1990. He had been a Trustee since October 1973 and had chaired the Veterinary Medicine Panel until it was disbanded in September 1989. He chaired the first meeting of the Veterinary Interest Group in November 1989. Lord Swann's special interest in and enthusiasm for veterinary research was appreciated by all those who worked withhimattheTmt. Weweresadtohearoniis~ddendeathon22September 1990.Heissucceeded by DrCEGordonSmith, DeputyChairmanoftheTrustees,aschairmanoftheVeterinary Interest Group. Following the death of Dr K B Sinclair in April 1989, who was responsible for the Bust's Veterinary Programme for the decade 1979-1989, Dr Bridget M Ogifvie took charge of the veterinary research programme. Her appointment coincided with the Trustees' decision to alter the arrangements for decision-makmg on grants. Au grants, whether they concernbasic science, clinical or veterinary medicine are now considered by one of the four subject-related panels. Membenhipofthese pane~refl~alloftheseinterests, and the\u00efhsteesareadvised on the partintlar problems of special subject areas by Interest Groups. In 1989190, under this new arrangement, grant requestsin the veterinary area were as successful in obtaining funds as any other. The success of veterinary applications illustrates that the new arrangements for decision-making donot discriminate against research with aveterinary purpose. Two-thirdsofthesuccessful grantswerein theareaofinfectionandimmunity with theremainder distributed between the other three panels. In the previous three years, awards were divided about 5050 between infection and immunity and the other three subject areas. Over the past decade, the percentage offunds in theveterinary area awarded to theveterinary schools has droppedfiom about 80 per cent to between 50 and 60 per cent and in the 1989190 fundmg year, 56 per cent of awards went to the schools. The Veterinary interest Group adjudicated on applications for scholarship and fellowship awards. The previous report described changes in the Trust's Research Training Scholarships deigned to attract veterinary graduates into research. These changes were implemented inJanuary 1990 and the responsehasbeenmostheartening. Therewere27applicants,manymore thaninany previous year. 16applicantssoughtathree-yearPhD award; IOappEedforoneofthenewfour-yearawards, which enable the recipients to retain and develop their dinical interests by spending 30 per cent of their time undertaking higher clinical training and 70 per cent on research leading to a PhD; and one applied for the new five-year award, which funds an individual to obtain a PhD in three years ina non-veterinary school laboratory followed by atwo-year fellowship ina veterinary school laboratory. The calibre ofthe six successfid candidates was exceptional, and two awards were for three years, three for four years and the single application for a five-year ad was also successful. Two awards for postdoctoral fellowships were also made, one for five years and one for three yean. The Veterinary interest Group had advised that the Project Development Grant adable in 198911990invet~m~cineshouldbeusedtofiindpmjectstodevelopimmunologifalreagents for use in dogs and cats and the awards are derailed below. On the advice of the Veterinary Interest Group the Trustees had agreed to increase the funds available for the support ofveterinary undergraduates wishing to intercalate a year of research training. Although funds were available for 20 awards, in the event oniy 11 awards were necessary, as most students obtained support from their local authority. 96 To emphasise further the Bust's commitment to the support ofveterinary research, there were two new initiatives this year. Firstly, a leaflet which describes training, fellowship and traveiawards in veterinary medicine madeby the Agrintitural and Food Research Cound, the HorseraceBetting Levy Board and the Wellcome Trust, has been produced by the Tnst and sent by the Royal CoUege ofveterinary Surgeons to all of its LJK members. It is available for distribution in each veterinary school. Secondly. the Trustees have provided funds for the biennial award of a WeUcome Trust MedaI for Veterinary Research by the AssociationofVeterinaryTeachersand Resedrch WorkmThet\u00eent medal will be awarded in 1991 and will be accompanicd by a prize of S500 in memory of Dr K i3 Sinclair, from funds provided by the Tnst and his friends and colleagues list of grants awarded over QO\u00fc\u00fc Professor A 'Bit U2 of pamitcs of veterinary and medical importance @l624PiZ9i~Al.

Vision Research Fellowships These training fellowships continue to be available under the new panel structure. nie annual competition invites applications from young workers in ophthalmology, optometry, neum- ophthalmology, and the related sciences who wish to begin or advance their research training. The Trustees have been particularly encouraged by increasing numbers ofyoung ophthalmologists of high quality wishing to obtain a serious training in research. Support has also been agreed for a scheme to allow secondment for research ofclinical trainees in ophthalmology ofthe Institute of Ophthalmology. The Trustees were particularly pleased to learn of the appointment of Dr Susan Lightman. a former Vision Fellow, to the new Duke-Elder Chair of Ophthalmology at the Institute of Ophthalmology. SUPPORT FOR OTHER RESEARCH OVERSEAS EUROPEAN PROGRAMME OTHER OVERSEAS AWARDS TRAVEL GRANTS 104 112 116 103 EUROPEAN PRMiRAMhlE This year has been dominated by the dramatic and revolutionary changes occumng in Eastern Europe. The Trust has responded in a number of ways with the objective of creating a climate conducive to the free exchange of postdoctoral scientists between the UK and Eastern Europe. The model that is being used is the one that has served well for the rest of Europe. Recognising the special needs of this region, the Trustees bave agreed to make additional funds available for 1990191. A tot31 of E13111 was awarded in grants during the year. The arrangements that existed previously with the International Cultural Institute in Hungary and the Postgraduate Medical Federation in Prague bave been terminated. In future scientists will beexpectedtoapproach theTntstdirectly.Theusualpatternwillbeforthemtohavemadecontact with a suitable laboratory in the UK so that the head of the laboratory and the intending fellow will make 3 joint application to the Tmst for a visiting fellowship. A imv arrangement has been agreed with the Norwegian research councils which will enable scientists from ail iinivenities and biomedical institutes (including the veterinaryschool) in Norway tocompete for travelling fellowships to the UK. Our previous arrangement with the Anders Jahre Fond (Olso, Norway) remains, but only covers visits to and from the University of Oslo.

In general, theTnistees only consider applications from scientists in developed countries (other than Australia, New Zealand and japan for which special schemes exist) if they are already in the UK, funded by another agency, and wish to extend their stay to complete a research project. Exceptionally, theTnistees may be willing to accept an application from a fellow elsewhere, but only if hdshe is nominated by and is well known to a sponsor in the UK. Hitchings-Elion Feilowships This new scheme, which will enable postdoctoral scientists from the United States of America to spend up to two years in the UK and then one year back home, was announced in the last report. Discussions on the detailed plans have now reached fruition and applications have been solicited forthetirst roundoffellowships, thedeadlineforapplicationsbeing 20january 1991. Itisexpected that these fellowships will be taken up in the antunin of 1991. The Tistees are grateful for the enthusiastic support ofthe Fogarty International Center ofthe National Institutes ofHeaith which will be advising them on the suitability of candidates, and the Burroughs Wellcome Fund which will be responsible for administration while fellows are in the USA.

A total of 14 awards have been made under this scheme since it was set up in 1984. The Trustees were particularly pleased to learn that Dr D L Healy, one of the first Wellcome Australian Senior Research Fellows, was appointed to a Chair in obstetrics and gynaecology at Monash University, Melbourne from 1 January 1990. New Zealand During 1990 the Wellcome Tnist and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians agreed to set up a scheme to award a Senior Research Fellowship in Medical Science to New Zealand Nationals. The tenure ofeach fellowship will be for five years and will be held in a New Zealand univenity department. These awards are open to candidates who are either medically or scientifically qualified, aged over 32 years, and who wish to make their career in New Zealand. It is anticipated that suitable candidates will not be available every year. 112 The total sums committed for the support ofoverseas awards (excluding the European andTropicai programmes) amounted to S936 O00 (E622 O00 for 1988/89). r.mm 10 Summary of Other Overseas FeUowships Awarded (including awards less than \u20ac2000) From Australia China India Israel New Zealand Nigeria USA Japan October 1988 to September 1989 2 3 1 4 2 1 13 - October 1989 to September 1990 2 8 3 3 4 I 21 - I AWTRAUA DrJ G Colebstcb Department of Neurology, Prince fora midyofthcfudond ,Ma&, OTHER OVERSEAS AWARDS CHINA FELWWSHIPS Dr C Q Cao Academy oflhditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing: for Di Yi Sun Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Medical Scicnccs.

The scheme also provides for contributions towards the travelling expenses of younger workers who have been offered research fellowships tenable for at least a year in institutions overseas. During the year there has been a substantial increase in the number of applications, and the Tmstees made 483 awards (438 in 1988189) at a total cost of \u20ac246 000. Special %vel Grants (CANZUSA) The Tmst operates five special schemes relating to research workers in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the USA. The schemes are jointly sponsored by the Trust and collaborating agencies overseas, to provide for short-term (up to three months) working visits by experienced research workers.

At thesame time there was a marked increase in the number of grant applications received, especially for the SUP~OR of larger-scale and longer-term work. Among these was a successkl application (from Essex University) for a university award, the first-ever in this field. A precondition of this type ofsupport is an undertaking by the university to provide the grant holder with a permanent post at the end of five years. At a time when new academic posts are so few and far between this has an obvious appeal both to universities and to the Trust, for the continued advancement of the history ofmedicineas an academicsubjectdepends aboveall onits becoming anestablishedstudy in a greater number of places. Moreover, many able scholars have now received training in the subject and too many of these are experiencing difticulty in progressing beyond temporary appointments. Improving the prospects for an academic career in the history of medicine is consequently one of the Trustees' foremost current priorities. At the same time, the Tiustees are keen that interest in the subject should not be confined to academics. The new Centre for Medical Science and History, due to open in 1992, promises to play an important role in reaching that wideraudience, through audiovisual and other techniques. In 1992 there is also the prospect ofmuch closer co-operation between Britain and the other countries in the European Community. TheTrust's support for the history ofmedicine has until now been concentrated within the British Isles but it now seems propitious for support to be extended geographically.Thought is thereforenow being given to bringu>gTheNerherlandswithin the framework ofthe programme. Such a move would build on established links between British historians ofmedicine and those in a range ofconntries on the Continent which have grown up over the years, particularly through the many Wellcome grants awarded to scholars from overseas forperiodsofstudy Cambridge University, for example, has entered into a long-term scheme for reciprocal conferences and exchanges with the CSIC history ofmedicineinstituteinBarcelona. Similarly, theunit at Glasgow University has plans to takeadvantageofitsnew Director'sinvolvementin thehistory ofmedicine in Germany. Links with East CentralEurope, by contrast, have upuntil now inevitably been scanty. To rectify this, the Trustees have decided to make available a few short-term visiting fellowships to enable younger historians of medicine in the newly-emergent democracies to form contacts among their counterparts in Britain and to catch up with Western literature. In last year's report mention was made of plans to bring together a group with the history of hventieth-century medical scienceasits focus, to be based at theRoyal CollegeofPhysicians under the direction ofSir Christopher Booth, theCollege'scurrent Harveian Librarian. This group, made up ofscientists and historians, has made an encouraging start with a programme ofseminars and its own newsletter. Twentieth-century medical science is meanwhile featuring more often among the research projects put fonvard to the Trust for support. During the year the amount allocated by the Trustees for research in the history of medicine was S3 393 O00 (compared with S2 581 O00 in 1988189). Sl 816 000,54 per cent, was expended intemaily. in maintaining the work of the Trust's principal investment in this field, the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine. S464 O00 was devoted to supporting the five History of Medicine Units - a considerable increase on the previous year, now that two of the Units once again have directors and their programmes are recovering momennim accordingly. And S1 013 O00 (f613 O00 in 198W89) was awarded in grant support. 120 Support for eachofthe Units is nowona'rolling'basiEandrenewalisdependentontheoutcome of a rigorous, periodic scrutiny by a panel specially appointed for the purpose. in 1989190 the Unit at Manchester University, after three years inexistence, wasrevi~edunderthenewsysrem. The report was full of praise for the productivity of this team and the wide rmge of activities in which it is engaged. The review group particularly noted the introduction of what the Trust intends should be the second of two national courses (the other being at the Wellcome Institute) for medical or other students opting to study the history of medicine for a BSc degree during an intercaiated year. WELLCOME UNITS FOR THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE University College London Director Dr W F Bynum This Unit isvirtuallycotertninouswith theAcademicUNtoftheWellwmefnstituteanditsacti~ties are covered in the report on the latter (see page 128). University of Cambridge Director Dr R K French This Unit continues to grow in both staff numbers and research activities. The problem of accommodation for research fellows, adminisnation and visitors has beensolved by theunimmity's provision of four extra rooms in the building the Unit currently occupies. At thesuggestionofthe\u00eftust theUnit'sadministrativeback-uphasbeenallotted toapart-time graduate administrator (Dr J P Williams) and a part-time secretary. This rearrangement has the effect of giving the Unit, a sub-department ofHismry and Philosophy ofscience, a greater degree of autonomy. The Unit is now also responsible for the presentation of Historical lectures and exhibitions (the first is on the history of Cambridge medicine) at the Clinical School at Addenbrooke's Hospital. The Unit has three core staff members: the Director, Dr French, Dr A RCunningham and Dr Harake Kamminga. The number of research fellows is variable, and reached a peak of swen in 1989. With resident research associates the number ofactive members ofthe Unit, excludingvisito& was then twelve. Four ofthe retiring research fellows have now gone into nnivmity teachingwhile Dr Johanna Geyer-Kordesch has been appointed Director of the Glasgow Unit. During the year under review a major conference was heid in Cambridge on the History of MedicalEthics (April 19901, and the first inaninteernationaljointseriesofconferences withCSiC Barcelona, on Medieval Medicine in the Latin West. The informal series ofbooks with Cambridge University Press continues, with the appearance ofvolumes on medicine in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The Unit also continues with its extensive undergraduate teaching and the following degree courses of MPhil in the History of Medicine, MLitt and PhD are being undertaken. SUPPORT FOR THE HlsTwIv OF MEDICINE University of Glasgow Director Dr Johanna Geyer-Kordesch Until the new Director, DrJohanna Geyer-Kordesch, came into post on 1 March 1990, this Unit was administered by Dr Marguerite Dupree. Dr Dupree continued her teaching (using material relevant to the history of medicine) for the course'Computing for Historians' and hcr menibership ofthe teaching committee ofDlSH (Design and Implementation of Software in History) Project and its History Computing Laboratory, as well as her supervision ofresearch students. She has been invited to oKer an honours course, 'Disease, Medicine and Society in Britain 1750-1948' for undergraduates in the Department of Modern History in 1991/92, and has joined the editorial board of Social Hisiory ofkfediciite. Dr Geyer-Kordesch hascontinued her work for the Cambridge Medical Ethics Forum, together with Dr Harake Kamminga (Cambridge). She organised aninternational symposium on the 'Future of Medical Ethics' in the grounds of Ampleforth Abbey in Yorkshire with intemational participation and financial support from the King Ed\\mrd's Hospital Fund. Dr Dupree and Dr M A Crowtber of the Department of Economic History are Co-holders ofa Wellcome Research Grant for research into 'The Role ofMedical Societies in the Development ofthe Scottish Medical Profession circa 1700-1939' for two years beginning 1 January 1990. Dr Jacqueline Jenkiason is research assistant for the project. She has already presented a paper on the subject at the annual conference of the Society for the Social History Medicine. The Units research focuses on European medicine in the eighteenth century (in particular the Scottish Enlightenment), natural law and medicine, the history of medical ethics, women and medicine, voluntary hospitals in Scotland in thenineteenth and twentieth centuries, the development of the medical prot\u00ebssion in Scotland in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, medical societies in Scotland since 1700, and the history of case histories. The staff of the Unit has published and given public lectures and conference papers on these subjects in the course of the last year. Plans to develop research in eighteenth-century Scottish medicine, psychiatric history in Scotland and the history of biomedical science in twentieth-century Scotland have been made. The Unit has been successful in initiating a series ofsix lectnres in the Medical Faculty's new curriculum for medical studerits in their third (clinical) year. It has also been invited to teach a modular course on the history of public health for the Department of Public Health. Close links with the Institute of Law and Ethics in Medicine are about to be formalised. Univenity of Manchester Director Dr J V Pickstone In January 1990 the Unit's work was reviewed by a panel of the Tnist's History of Medicine Committee. The report was very favourable and the Unit has now been awarded support for a further period. It continues to be part of the University's Centre for the History of Science, Technology and Medicine, and benefits from this close association with historians ofphysical sciences and technologies. This relationship strengthens the Unit's general programme, which is focused on the history of medical science and on the social history of medicine in industrial societies. In October 1989, Dr Stephen Jacynajoined the Unit from Glasgow: he is completing a major study of medical education in nineteenth century Edinburgh and maintains his interest in nenrosciences. At the end of the year Dr David Cantor and Dr Paolo Palladino, both already associated with the Unit. were awarded Wellcome Research Fellowships. Their respective projects on rheumatology and on British and American genetics, further increase the Unit's strength in recent history of medical sciences. The size and expertise of the Unit has allowed for the creation of a new degree programme for medical students who wish to study the history ofmedicine intensively for one year, usuaUy before beginning their clinical Studies. For the initial year, the WeUcome Tnst is funding fiw did students and one dental student. It has been agreed that in future years students from other medical schools will beable to transfer to Manchesterfor theuinte~a~yearandg~aManc~terd~ The Unit is also supporting a second new teaching programme, linked to Manchester's recently re-organised School of Biological Sciences. Among the wide range of degrees now offered by the School is a BSc in Life Sciences with History of Science and Medicine, to which Unit smff contribute about one-third ofthe courses. For biology students who are also interested in history Manchester University is now a prime choice. Three postgraduates supervised within the Unit gained PhDs. Its resources for postgraduate training, however, are not fully exploited and it is keen to attract some new postgraduates, as well as postdoctoral fellows and visiting scholars. From its inception in 1986, indeed fromits pre-history as a research group at UMIST, theunit has played a regional role- in archive remeval, as a provider of lectures, and as a sourceofinformal advice. This regional aspect takes on a new dimension with the appointment ofDr h4ichael Worboys ofSheffield City Polytechnic, to undertake research for two days per week, basedat the Manchester Unit. This cost-effective development, funded by the Tnist, is of a sort to allow concentration of research and postgraduate training, while also facilitating the diffusion ofteaching in history ofmedicine. A second route to this end has been happily demonstrated by the recent appointment of Dr Keith Vernon, after completing three years as a Wellcome Research Fellow in the Unit, to ateaching post in thehistory ofmedicineat LancashirePolytechnic,Preston.DrVemonwilleontiinie as an associate of the Unit, carrying out research on the history of microbiology. The Unit is keen to expand its intemational links and has recently 'twinned' with the distinguished Department of History and Sociology of Science at the University of Pennsylvania. University of oxford Director Dr R M Smith During theyear under review thisunit hascontutuedasaproductivecentreofresearchandteadiing in the history of medicine. On 1 January Dr R M Smith assumed the Readership in the History ofMedicineandtheDirectorshipoftheUnit, DrP Weindlinghavingably aaedasinte~mDirenor from 1 October 1988. Si historical dissertations were completed by pre-clinical medical studentsand three postgraduate doctoral dissertations. Currently members of staff in the Unit supervise 15 doctoral candidates in the history of medicine and related fields. A major publication this year was Dr P Weindling's Health, Rare amd Cenw\u00fctt Poliiics Behwpri is scheduled for publication in late 1990.

This complicated operation was completed successhilly between January and March 1990. Temporary accommodation for the Library was establishedat 2OOEustonRoad (Bentley House); the Academic Unit and Administration moved to the fourth and fifth floors ofTavisrock House South; and accommodationforWellcomefeUowsandvisitingscholarswasfoundinthe~~~ Building, courtesy of University College London. The Library re-opened for public use on 23 April 1990. Staff are to be congratulated on the generauy good-humonred and professionaiway in which they faced the inevitable strains and stresses of a difficult and disruptive period. Duringthe year Mr StephenEmbertonhad to withdraw fromtheadmini\u00e7ta\u00e0onofthelnstitute as his duties as Pub\u00fcc Activities Deveiopment Manager for the planned Wellcome Centreinaeased. HisreplacementinanewadministrativesmimirefortheWeUcomeinstitutehasyettoheappollited. The Library A period more disruptive to ordimary library life and routines could scarcely be imagined. Three months' closure and the exigencies of temporary accommodation produced effm on the public service which will take time to repair. The need to move hardware and to employ key staff on other duties contributed to some delays in the implementation ofthe Automated Library System, whiie gaps and delays occurred in the ongoing routines of acquisitions and cataloguing. On the positive side, and following a major policy reappraisal by the Trustees' advisory panels and committees, a number ofmajor projects were begun. Substantial funding over two years was earmarked for sorting and processing the very large reserve stock ofprints and drawings in the Enfield Library Store. A major project to produce a videodisc catalogue ofup to 55 O00 images from the iconographic CoUections was begun in partnership with Media Projects intemational Ltd.

FOR THE HISTOXY OF MEDKINE The Library's acquisitions for this year include a drawing ofa professor (at present unidentified) giving clinical instruction to students, probably in a Paris hospital around 1820. The Academic Unit The AcademicUnit has managed to continue its formal teaching commitments through University College London and to run its widcr acadentic programme from a variety of locations. A record number (28) of Intercalated BSc stodents read for the History ofMedicine degree. The closure ofthe Library put special burdens on both thestudents and their teachers, especially in connection with their projects; in the end, the quality of both projects and examination papers was better than average, and five students achieved First Class Honours. Bursaries from the Wellcome Trust were available for more than half the students. in addition, menibers of the Unit teach courses for other scienceand artsundergradiiatesaswell aspostgraduatesemiiiars for theMScprogramme. The latter is offered through the London Centre for the History of Science, Tfchnology and Medicine. 130 Three theses were examined: Lesley Hall's PhD thesis, T H Turner's MD thesis, and Bernard Brais's MPhil thesis. Eachis being revised for publication as a monograph. Five new research students and three new research fellows joined an existing group of 17 students and fellows aiready in residence. Three scholars fromabroad spent periods of sabbatical working through the Unit. The esprii in thenew Postgraduate Centre in University College has beenexcellent, although.asusual. there are more bodies than desks. In addition to the Wellcome Trust, funding was provided by the King's Fund, the Special Trustees of the Westminster Hospital Group and the Fulbright Commission. Staf\u00eeresearch productivity remains at a very high Ievel. Among severai volumes and more than 50 papers may be noted the collection of essays edited by Vivian Nutton, Medicine ni the Cotiri; OfEiwepe, 1500-1837 (Routledge, 1990), based on a symposium organised in 1986 by the Institute and the Herzog August Bibliothek, Wolfenbuttel, Germany. The Institute's programme ofseminars and symposia has been maintained, with only a modest diminution in scale. The Research Seminar for 1989-90 had as its themeiWdicnlLiues orrdPrnciice, and now meets in the Library's Reading Room in Bentley House. Six all-day sympotiawere held, including one on Meteorology and Medicine in conjunction with the History SectionoftheRoyal Meteorological Society. During the development of the Wellcome Building alternative venues have had to be found, including the King's Fund CentreinCamdenTownand theNationalHospita, Queen Square. Hisforp Other notable events included two public lectures; that by Prof\u00ebssor Richard Loveil of the University ofMelbourne offered a fascinating preview ofhis forthcoming biography ofLord Moran, whose papers are in the institute's Contemporary Medical Archives Centre. Dr RobenKark, Rush Presbyterian, St Luke's Medical Center, Chicago, gave the first Amalieand Edward Kass Lecture, a new biennial series endowed by the Kass children. It was a moving occasion, as many ofEdward Kass's British friends gathered to pay their respects to him. His death three months later deprived the Institute of a loyal friend. nieinformal faculty Asim\u00fcar scheme has been started with the Department of the History of the Health SRences, University of California at San Francisco, with Dr Roy Porter representing the Institute. Staff at the Unit gave a number of external lectures abroad including Canada, Holland, Australia, France, Spain, Portugal and the United States. WELLCOME TROPICAL INSTITUTE ProfworEldryd PanycomptetedhisfiveycarcontactasDircctoroftheWellcomeTropical Institute at the end of September 1990. The Tropical Institute had been originally created to modernise and develop the Wellcome Museum of Medical Science when it was taken over from the Wellcome Foundation Ltd. During the five years of his directorship a series of moves for the museum and latterly for its oftices caused disruption ofits work until, ultimately with the development ofthe WellcomeBuilding complex, the Trustees decided to disband it as a separate entity. The Wellcome Tropical Institute Museum will be the resource from which the Wellcome Tropical Videodisc Project is developed. Professor Parry's special interest in Distance Learning is now being continued from a base at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, with continuing support from the Trust for the next two years. The Tropical Historical Library and Archive, started before his appointment, is now absorbed into the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine. This will be the resource for the history of tropical medicine activities now being encouraged by the Trust alongside the videodisc development. Professor Parry'E great experience of Africa has meant that the Distance Learning Programme, developed by him and his colleague Charles Engel in the Tropical Institute, has been adopted in a number ofcountries in Africa, notably Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, Ghana and Tanzania. There are now texts on the following subjects available: Videodisc Project During the year it was agreed to fund the development of an interactive videodisc to replace the Museumofthe WeUcomeTmpicalInstitute.ThecontentsoftheMuseum togetherwithnewmatetial from a variety of other sources will be placed on a combination of videodisc and computer. This will make the collection portable and produce a moreversatile resource for teaching and learning. S760 O00 was allocated during 1989190 to the project by the Tmstees. The Trustees see this as a cooperative project facilitated by the Trust rather than an initiative that isexclusive to theTrust. Thisphilosophy isinline with the fact that muchofthevisualmaterial in the to theTrust, free ofcharge, by many scientistsover theyears. Theprojectisled by DrJALongstaffewhoisDirectoroftheComputersinTeachinglnitiative Centre for Medicine in the University ofBristol. A team ofcompnter programmers and systems designers led by Dr M Whittlestone and Professor D ingram, Professor of Medical informatics at St Bartholomcw's Hospital Medical School, will provide the bulk of software infrastructure and specify the necessary hardware. DI P Harkin, University of Leeds, will develop a tutorial authoring system which will enable university staff to produce their own interactive learning modules using the visual and computer databases. A group ofdoctors and programmers led by Dr J Poyser at the University of Sheffield will develop a computer programme which will use 'computer games' philosophy to gencrate problems of diagnosis and case management to challenge and train users by constructing an unlimited series of simulated path& from the database. Dr S Lucas, Department ofPathology, University College and Middlesex School ofMedicine, will providea definitive archiveofillustrationsofpathological and histological materialappmpriate to tropical medicine. Two-thirds of tropical medicine concerns problems ofmaternal and child health. The Institute of Child Health, University of London (DI R Richardson and Dr Jann Marshall) has tberefore agreed to contribute to the project by allowing access to the valuable slide archive at the Hospital for Sick Children and its Teaching Aids at Low Cost cen\u00eere and will produce tutorials in this important area of tropical medicine. The first yearofthe project willla~elyconsistofbuilduig theatchiveanddwelopingthecomputer software to the point where :he project can receive material from others and the dwdopment oftutorials can start. As the project develops, it is planned to involvemany other individuals fmm the university system to extend the scope of this large and ambitious venture. WuiromETRWrFaMUNir WEUCOME TRUST FILM UNIT During the year Anthony Palmer undertook to make a film entitled The Wellrottie Legoy. This film, now complete, gives a synopsis ofthe objectivesof Sir Henry Wellcome's will and the f\u00f9lflment ofits purpose by his Tnistees. It uses the following three major projects to illustrate the scientific work of the Trust: - the developmental biology unit in Cambridge - the care and study of the premature infant at University Collegc London - the joint KEMRI and Wellcome Trust Unit at Kilifi in Kenya which is working on malaria. OtherpartsofthefilmshowthegrowthoftheTnistand thecareanduseofSir Henry Wellcome's collections. It runs for 25 minutes and is an excellent production. Two oftheTrust's earlier films on the history ofsleeping sickness have received awards. Embbe Eiicoirirferwas awarded Best Camera at the 1990 international Visual Communication Association Festival, and TheSleepofDeofli was awarded a certificate for creative excellence at the US industrial Film and Video Festival. Theuseofthese films andsomeofthoseonmorebiological topiahasbeenexamined by several university departmentsand many copies havenow beensold at costpriceorgivenawaytosuitable institutions. The importance offilm material as an archive for the history ofmedicine has also been examined through a fellowship to Dr M Clark to catalogue fdms on the cardiovascular system, and more recently to extend this catalogue to cover a wider subject base. Dr Clark has also produced a book entitled Medicol, gives details of the films made by the Tmst film unit and its predecessor, the film unit ofthe Wellcome Foundation Limited. Many of these films are available on video.
