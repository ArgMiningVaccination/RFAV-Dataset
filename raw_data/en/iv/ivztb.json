It's not just you who relates to this, but this seems to be the ethos of our generation. We wallow in our ironies - set fire to forests to call it a wildfire, mow down trees to call it deforestation, and mine out hills to call it excavation, while fully understanding that we are more or less at a place that is irreconcilable. Then there are those of us who reconcile with the earth, our beginnings, and the vital energy that has always led us. Those of us who reconnect to earth and believe that the cure is in nature, and natural cure is the best form of healing.

Today, naturopathy roots in a traditional understanding of nature, its healing properties, and science. This is how it works!

Based on this preliminary assessment of your health, he/she will assign you a steady diet, engaging exercises, and stress management tips for a healthy lifestyle. Your condition will be treated with the use of touch, pressure, and massage to balance and channel the energy in your body, which is called naturopathic manipulative therapy.
