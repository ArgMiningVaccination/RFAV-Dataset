It does not give complete immunity, nor will it prevent you from spreading the virus to others. While a single dose of the vaccine is believed to give moderate protection after 2 weeks, it is very important to complete both doses in order to get the highest level of protection. Your second dose should be given 28 days after your first dose. However, a dose may be administered up to 4 days before the minimum interval of 28 days if necessary, as per CDC guidelines. People who had a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of the JYNNEOS vaccine or an ingredient in the vaccine (such as gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, or egg protein) should not receive the JYNNEOS vaccine. Yes, you can receive the JYNNEOS mpox vaccine at the same time as the flu vaccine. Yes, you can receive the JYNNEOS mpox vaccine and the COVID-19 vaccine during the same doctor's visit, as long as the COVID-19 vaccine is administered first. As per CDC guidelines, COVID-19 vaccines may be delayed by 4 weeks if the JYNNEOS vaccine is given first. If you have any questions about the timing of your vaccinations, please contact your primary care physician. There will be no charge for the doses of the vaccine, but depending on insurance coverage, an administrative fee may be billed to your insurance.
