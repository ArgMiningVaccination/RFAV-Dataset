Amnesia due to an injury or a brain disease like Alzheimer's can cause loss of memory. TCM and acupuncture offer an alternative treatment for problems with memory loss due to different [types of amnesia](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21455-amnesia) or dementia related to brain diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. [Amnesia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amnesia/symptoms-causes/syc-20353360) is often depicted in stories as the sudden loss of one's memory, or even their whole identity, due to a traumatic accident of some sort. That kind of dramatic memory loss is rare in real life. Difficulty remembering events from one's past is called retrograde amnesia. The most common type of amnesia, however, is anterograde amnesia, which causes short-term memory problems. People with anterograde amnesia may be able to remember facts they learned in school, and how to do things like play a sport or an instrument, but they have trouble remembering what they did earlier this morning, or what day of the week it is. Anterograde amnesia can have a serious impact on a person's life, as it can make it difficult to retain new information, learn new skills, or form relationships with new people. Conditions like Alzheimer's and [Parkinson's](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-parkinsons-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) can affect memory and cause other types of cognitive impairment. Memory problems can be a part of dementia; the term \"dementia\" encompasses other kinds of cognitive decline in addition to memory loss. Being more forgetful is considered a common aspect of [mild cognitive impairment](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia/related_conditions/mild-cognitive-impairment) (MCI). MCI is the term for changes in thinking patterns that occur in older adults, sometimes as a precursor to more serious dementia. \"Amnestic MCI\" pertains to short-term memory problems like forgetting recent events, appointments, and facts or names one might have been able to call up easily in the past. People suffering from [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and/or [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), and those with [PTSD](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ptsd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) often [experience short-term memory loss](https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/depression-and-memory-loss), forgetfulness, or a sense of confusion. At this point, there is no real medical solution for amnesia or other kinds of memory loss. There are no treatments that cure or reverse dementia or Alzheimer's. Medications like cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine may help to slow the breakdown of certain neurotransmitters-brain chemicals that relate to memory and learning capacity. Cognitive therapy can help people work on their memory skills and teach them coping mechanisms, like using various forms of reminders and creating stable routines that help them continue to perform their daily tasks. Research has shown that [TCM](https://www.acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=28184) and [acupuncture treatment](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312144#Acupuncture-effective-in-combination-with-nimodipine-for-AMCI) have a positive impact on [cognitive impairment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4145916/), as measured both by memory assessments, as well as the impact on neurotransmitter activity in the brain. Top 5 Types of Amnesia Amnesia is classified into two main categories: neurological amnesia and functional amnesia. Neurological amnesia is caused by some type of physical problem with the brain, either due to an injury, a stroke, a tumor, or diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Amnesia could also result from an infection that affects the brain, such as HIV, [Lyme disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-lyme-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or [encephalitis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-encephalitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Functional amnesia is caused by some psychologically damaging event that causes a person to \"block out\" memories. This type of amnesia is considered a psychiatric disorder. - Retrograde amnesia - this type of amnesia occurs after a traumatic event or injury to the brain. It affects memories that were stored before the inciting event, but not necessarily the entire history of memories. Usually the events leading up the trauma are the ones that are compromised. - Anterograde amnesia - this type of amnesia causes short-term memory loss. While a person can still pay attention, they have trouble retaining new information or forming new memories related to current events. - Transient global amnesia - this type of amnesia incorporates both retrograde and anterograde types of memory loss, but only for a short period of time (anywhere from a few to 24 hours). This temporary loss of memory usually occurs in older people, perhaps because of some loss of blood flow to the brain (ischemia) or loss of oxygen to the brain (hypoxia), or even because of a seizure. - Dissociative amnesia - a mental health disorder in which a person blocks out memories or certain facts about their life after an emotionally traumatic event. This is sometimes known as \"selective amnesia.\" - Infantile amnesia - (or childhood amnesia) this term refers to the fact that most people do not have memories from the early years of their life. Other factors that can affect memory to the extent that they cause amnesia are severe alcoholism (when a person gets \"blackout drunk\" and cannot remember what has happened), severe nutritional deficiencies, thyroid issues, or exposure to radiation. Some drugs, like benzodiazepines, or anti-epileptic medications, can cause memory loss while the drug is in effect. Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is sometimes used in psychiatric treatment to induce selective amnesia. Sometimes amnesia is temporary, such as after an injury. Once the brain heals, memory will often be restored. Amnesia due to brain damage, such as after a [stroke](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-help-stroke-recovery-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), may be permanent, while amnesia caused by a degenerative disease like Alzheimer's, may be progressive in nature. Acupuncture treatment can be beneficial for people with various types of memory loss, both by helping people heal after brain trauma, and helping to protect the brain and other organs from degeneration due to aging or other kinds of disease. Can Acupuncture Help Amnesia? TCM theory takes a different view of the organ systems of the body than conventional modern medicine does. Whereas [memory loss](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312144#Researchers-used-data-from-five-trials), cognitive impairment, amnesia, and dementia are seen as primarily having to do with the brain, in TCM we see problems with memory and cognition as also being related to the function of the kidneys, liver, spleen, and heart. The [kidneys](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12035-018-0908-0), in particular, are believed to support the brain, so if the kidneys are weak, or congested with phlegm, this can lead to amnesia. The buildup of phlegm in the body can block the smooth flow of qi and blood, leading to a lack of nourishment to the brain. It can also block the channels of communication between the heart and the brain. This concept of phlegm is roughly analogous to the conventional medical view of how heart disease arises from the buildup of cholesterol clogging the arteries. TCM treatment for amnesia and dementia will often focus, then, on the clearing of phlegm from the channels, and working to resolve other conditions, like [high blood pressure](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-acupuncture-tcm/) or [diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), that are contributing to the problems of memory loss and cognitive deficits. Herbs have been used for many centuries [in TCM to help improve memory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3927560/) function and stave off cognitive decline. In recent years, scientific research has begun to confirm that these herbs can work to reduce neurodegeneration. TCM herbal formulations have the benefit of being highly customizable, while being relatively free of potential negative side effects. [Acupuncture](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2017/8460145/) has been demonstrated to help patients recover neurological function after traumatic brain injuries. Top 5 Tips for Improving Your Memory With TCM Stimulating more blood flow to the brain can help boost your memory. Try these simple home remedies to help promote better cognitive function. - Acupressure Points for Memory - Find the tender spot right in the center of the top of the head. Stimulate this point, and the four points that can be found one inch away from the center in each direction: right, left, front, and back (see photo above). Apply gentle but deep, downward pressure with your finger to each of these five points 50-60 times each day. - Stimulate the Fingertips and Tips of the Toes - Hold the hands so that the tips of the fingers and thumbs touch. Gently press or stroke the corresponding fingers together, each stimulating the other, up to a hundred times. Practice daily. Similarly, gently press/stroke the tip of each toe, up to a hundred times per day. - Keep the Neck Supported - when the neck is stiff or out of alignment, blood flow to the head and brain may be compromised. If you have [neck pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-get-rid-of-neck-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)or tightness, be sure to address it adequately with acupuncture, a supportive pillow and appropriate sleeping position, and gentle exercise. - Dry Brush the Scalp - use a brush or comb to stimulate the whole scalp every day. This will help bring good blood flow to the head. - Massage the Ears - gently knead the whole outer ear, especially the ear lobe, until it is warm and red. This will stimulate many beneficial acupressure points located on the ear. Acupuncture Near Me for Memory Loss Perhaps someone close to you has begun to show worrying signs of cognitive decline or loss of memory. People who are suffering from amnesia and dementia associated with degenerative brain diseases like Alzheimer's can benefit from an integrative approach that includes acupuncture and herbs. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

Traditional Chinese Medicine is based on Qi, which is an invisible force that usually cannot be observed by modern science.

[ How to Treat Bloated Stomach With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bloated-stomach-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac,. Ph.D. Ph.D. Do you feel constantly gassy or have a bloated stomach after eating? Digestive problems like gastritis or [colitis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-colitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) can cause abdominal bloat. Stress and hormonal imbalances can also contribute to inflammation and bloated stomach pain. [Acupuncture](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-28576/i-tried-traditional-chinese-medicine-for-chronic-bloat-heres-what-happened.html) and [TCM herbs can help](https://www.wellandgood.com/traditional-chinese-medicine-herbs-bloating/) improve digestion and relieve abdominal bloating. [Abdominal bloating](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3264926/) occurs when gas builds up in the gastrointestinal tract, filling the stomach and/or intestines with air. This can cause the belly area to get swollen and distended. Bloating can cause an inflated belly, sharp pain in the abdomen, belching and flatulence, nausea, or a sudden strong urge to go to the bathroom. Bloating can be related to fluid retention; this is sometimes called \"water bloat.\" Problems with digestion that lead to a feeling of heaviness, \"like a rock\" in your belly after eating, are common. People who have been diagnosed with some type of functional gastro-intestinal disorder (FGID)-like [irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-manage-ibs-diet-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) or dyspepsia (indigestion)-are extremely likely to experience abdominal pain and bloating after eating, while [up to 30% of all people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2581929/) report having bloating at least some of the time. Inflammation in the walls of the stomach (gastritis) or intestine (ulcerative colitis) can also cause bloating. Women often feel bloated [before or during their menstrual period](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and female reproductive disorders like [endometriosis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-painful-periods-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), [fibroids (leiomyoma of the uterus)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-leiomyoma-of-the-uterus-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) can cause abdominal pain and bloating. FGIDs can be very hard to manage; it may be difficult to get a clear diagnosis or effective medical treatment. Problems like constipation, [diarrhea](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diarrhea-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), nausea, abdominal pain and bloating are highly subjective, and people are often made to feel like it's normal to have these issues, or that all they need to do is avoid certain foods. Feelings of anxiety and depression are [common among people](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/070674379303800703?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed) who suffer from moderate to severe bloating on a regular basis. This can become a vicious cycle, as the pain and swelling of the abdomen causes anxiety, and the physiological effects of the emotional stress trigger the bloating to happen again and again. Sometimes people dread eating meals because they are so afraid of the painful and embarrassing bloated stomach. Digestive upsets are complex to treat because there can be many factors contributing to the discomfort. So many different conditions can cause [bloating](https://www.healthline.com/health/abdominal-bloating#treatment), it can be hard to get a clear handle on the true cause. This is a case when TCM methods of diagnosis offer many advantages, because a TCM practitioner will be able to study the whole picture presented by a patient and pinpoint what underlying conditions are causing gas and distension. Acupuncture and herbs can help resolve abdominal bloating and other symptoms at their root source. Top 10 Abdominal Bloating Causes Why might someone feel bloated and gassy all the time? Many different types of gastrointestinal disorders can contribute to a bloated belly and excess gas, as can hormonal and emotional changes. [What causes abdominal bloating](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/whats-causing-that-belly-bloat) can be one issue or a combination of factors: - Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) - Inflammatory bowel disease, U [lcerative colitis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-colitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)or [Crohn's Disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-crohns-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Gastritis, stomach ulcers, inflammation of - Food intolerance, [gluten intolerance, celiac disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-celiac-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [PMS](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), menstruation - Stress, anxiety, depression - Pregnancy - Constipation - Liver disease - Abdominal adhesions, or scar tissue from surgeries Eating behaviors like eating too quickly, swallowing air while eating, or eating fiber-rich foods that cause gas like beans, can lead to bloating. Drinking a lot of carbonated beverages can lead to excess gas in the GI tract. [Smoking](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-quit-smoking-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) can also be a factor. Some medications can cause bloating as a side effect, including antibiotics, oral birth control pills, opioid pain medications, medicines to relieve constipation, and even some supplements, like iron pills. Cancers of the abdominal organs, such as ovarian cancer, stomach cancer, colon cancer, or pancreatic cancer, can also cause bloating in the belly. Gallstones or gallbladder disease, kidney problems, and liver problems can all cause stomach pain and bloating. Medical Treatment for Abdominal Bloating Many people do not seek medical help for bloating, trying to manage it on their own with over the counter medications that promise relief from gas pain and [acid reflux](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-acid-reflux-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Antacids only help with the kind of bloating that is caused by food, though; they don't help with bloating related to FGIDs, hormones, or emotional stress. When a person does ask their primary care doctor or even a gastroenterologist for help with bloating, they may find that the treatment options are very limited. Doctors will usually reassure patients that gas and bloating, while uncomfortable, are not actually dangerous. Then, they will often advise that patients go on a strict elimination diet, cutting out wheat, dairy, and most vegetables and legumes. Sometimes doctors will prescribe antibiotics to alter the balance of gut bacteria. Antidepressants are sometimes prescribed to help with bloating. Conventional medical science still has a ways to go to fully understand the underlying causes of digestive problems like bloating. Because bloating is not viewed as a disorder in and of itself, not much serious research has been done to show what types of treatments work best to get rid of bloating. TCM treatment has been shown in a [randomized controlled trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19489491/), a [peer-reviewed study,](https://www.intechopen.com/books/gastritis-new-approaches-and-treatments/gastritis-treated-by-chinese-medicine) and a [hospital-based investigation](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1613-acupuncture-beats-drug-for-gastritis-relief) to help in relieving stomach pain due to chronic gastritis. How Can Acupuncture Help With Bloating? TCM offers a multidisciplinary approach to the digestive problems, hormone imbalances, and emotional upsets that can cause bloating. An experienced acupuncturist is able to use methods of diagnosis such as studying the appearance of the tongue, feeling the pulse, and asking lots of questions about how and when the symptoms occur to find the specific pattern of imbalance that is causing gastric distress. Different presentations of digestive conditions that may cause abdominal bloating and pain include: - Spleen/Stomach Deficiency - characterized by symptoms: chronic bloating, poor appetite, feel worse after eating, pallor, and fatigue. This type of bloating can be caused by antibiotics, too much raw or fermented food, eating disorders, a long period of illness, or chronic inflammatory disorders. - Damp-Phlegm - symptoms include: distended stomach, nausea, acid reflux, diarrhea. This type of bloating can be caused by dietary habits that include excess sugar, alcohol, fatty or fried foods, and dairy products. Can also be related to damp environmental conditions. - Liver Qi stagnation - common symptoms are: stomachaches, stomach gurgling, belching, and constipation. This type of bloating can be caused by stress, feelings of anxiety or anger, and irregular, emotional eating behaviors. TCM treatment for abdominal bloating will use acupuncture and herbs to bring the stomach and liver back into harmonious function, clearing phlegm and improving digestion. Treatment will be individualized based on the underlying causes of the imbalance; if reproductive hormones are involved, then that factor will be taken into consideration when preparing the herbal formula. If mental health issues are a factor, specific points will be added to help relieve anxiety. Naturally, your acupuncturist will have some clear instructions on how to optimize your nutrition to reduce bloating. Top 5 Tips for How to Stop Bloating While bloating may be caused by all sorts of different factors, there is no doubt that making some changes to your eating habits will probably have an impact on how bloated you feel. What helps bloating may be different for each person's constitution or lifestyle, so it will be very helpful to have an in-depth conversation with your acupuncture provider about what bloating diet is best for you. - Chew your food thoroughly. Many people eat fast, and don't pay much attention to chewing their food well before they swallow. Food is really meant to be broken down and mixed with saliva in the mouth before it moves down the esophagus and into the stomach. Skipping this important step by swallowing half-chewed food means that your stomach has to produce more acid and work much harder to digest the food before it moves deeper into your gastrointestinal tract. Eating too quickly can also easily lead to eating more than you need. It takes about 20 minutes for your brain to receive the message that the stomach is full. Chew slowly, and enjoy every bite; this will improve your digestion. - Avoid icy cold drinks and foods. Cold liquids are shocking and unfriendly to your internal organs, both those of the digestive tract and the female reproductive organs. Constantly drinking ice-cold beverages irritates the smooth muscle tissues of the stomach, intestines, and uterus. Drink more warm liquids, which are soothing to these organs. - Ginger tea - many of our herbal formulations include slices of fresh ginger to help soothe the stomach and GI tract. Ginger helps the body to produce more of the digestive enzymes that work to break down food, and relieves cramping in the belly. All you need to do is keep a knob of fresh ginger on hand, cut two or three slices and steep in hot water as you would a teabag. Sip anytime, but especially before meals, to help relieve gastritis pain and bloating. - Choose foods in harmony with the season. Raw foods are appropriate in the summer, but in the winter, it's better to eat cooked foods. Eating more bitter-tasting foods, like dark leafy greens, helps the liver and kidneys. - Use acupressure to help relieve bloating and gassiness. Acupoints are located along the meridians and correspond to various organ systems. Applying gentle, steady, downward pressure to acupoint ST36 (Zu San Li), which is associated with the stomach, can help to relieve bloating, stomach pain, nausea, and feelings of stress. ST36 is located on the outer edge of the shin bone, about 4 finger widths beneath the kneecap. Acupuncture Near Me for Abdominal Bloating TCM offers a holistic approach to digestive problems of all kinds. Symptoms like abdominal bloating, stomach pain, and gassiness are usually signs that there is a deeper problem. If you haven't been able to solve the problem of bloating with conventional medicine or dietary changes, you may be able to get help for digestive difficulties with acupuncture and herbs. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How To Treat ED With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ed-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Qineng Tan, Ph.D. Let's face it: most men have probably had trouble getting hard on occasion, but if it's happening 50% of the time, or more often, then it may be a sign of men ED, or [erectile dysfunction](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/erectile-dysfunction/symptoms-causes/syc-20355776). ED refers to the inability to get or maintain an erection, making it difficult to have sexual intercourse. Acupuncture and TCM offer a natural solution for low sex drive and reproductive health problems, without over the counter ED pills. In the past few decades, this condition, which used to be referred to as \"impotence,\" has come to be perceived as a men's health issue or a [men's fitness issue](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/women/sex-tips/why-you-cant-get-hard/) that can be treated medically, rather than a personal problem. While it's great that men can get help from doctors for this condition without embarrassment or shame, ED medications may not solve the problem for everyone. [Stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), hormones, nutrition, exercise, emotions, and relationship dynamics all play a role in ED. ED can have a serious impact on a man's quality of life, as it affects self-esteem, romantic relationships, and [sperm count](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-oligospermia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and [fertility](https://myartofwellness.com/infertility-faqs/). It is [estimated](https://www.trendstatistics.com/health/erectile-dysfunction-statistics/) that about 30 million men in the U.S. experience erectile dysfunction (ED). By age 60, over 40% of men will probably experience ED. While ED drugs and over the counter ED pills help some men with ED symptoms, many men cannot use these medications because they interfere with others that are commonly used to treat heart disease. [Acupuncture](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/acupuncture-for-ed) and TCM provide an alternative treatment for ED that can help men with this issue. Top 10 Causes of ED ED is a complex problem, which can involve both physical and mental components. A physical problem that causes a man to experience ED a few times may lead to emotional stress around sex and low sex drive, making the problem worse. Because the brain and hormones contribute so vitally to arousal and erection, sometimes [ depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), or interpersonal feelings are the main cause of the issue. Some of the most common physical causes of ED include: - Heart problems, high blood pressure, clogged arteries, high cholesterol - Diabetes - Obesity - Use of certain prescription medications (antihypertensives, antidepressants) - Neurological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease or [Multiple Sclerosis](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-ms-how-to-treat-multiple-sclerosis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Alcoholism](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-addiction-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)or excessive consumption of alcohol [Smoking cigarettes/tobacco](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-quit-smoking-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Prostate problems like [BPH (enlarged prostate)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bph-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or prostate [cancer](https://myartofwellness.com/acupuncture-and-tcm-for-cancer-integrative-oncology/) - Lack of sleep, [sleep disorders](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Low testosterone Sometimes erectile dysfunction is the reason men discover that they have a heart condition or [diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) that they didn't realize they had. When high cholesterol causes plaque to build up in the blood vessels, it's not only the heart that is affected. Atherosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries) can also affect a man's ability to get an erection by [restricting blood flow](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/circulationaha.110.017681) to the penis. Inability to maintain an erection can be a sign that a man has [hypertension](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-acupuncture-tcm/). What Is the Treatment for ED? The most common medical treatment for men with ED are PDE-5 medications (like Viagra, Cialis, or Levitra), which work to dilate the blood vessels that supply blood to the penis. These [ED drugs](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/erectile-dysfunction/in-depth/erectile-dysfunction/art-20047821) lower the blood pressure, which is why they cannot be used in conjunction with some other medications, including nitroglycerin or Imdur. If a man were to take both his ED pills and these medications, it could cause dangerously low blood pressure. Some men experience [side effects](https://www.healthline.com/health/erectile-dysfunction-medications-common-side-effects#dizziness) of taking these ED meds, including: headaches, blurred vision, dizziness, hot flushes, muscle pain, and diarrhea. In rare cases, men may have a painful erection that lasts longer than four hours (priapism), which can require medical treatment and/or cause permanent damage. If necessary, a doctor may numb the penis and use a needle to drain the blood that is trapped there, or use decongestant medications to help relieve the swelling. Other forms of therapy for ED include penile implants and penile injections. TCM acupuncture treatment for ED does not involve any needles inserted into the penis itself. How Can Acupuncture Help ED? According to TCM theory, ED is classified as a Jin Wei disorder and can follow one of a few patterns: - Liver qi stagnation - Blood stasis - Kidney deficiency TCM also acknowledges that stress, emotional and mental health disturbances are often a primary cause of ED, and seeks to incorporate counseling and awareness-building, both with the patient, and with the patient's partner, if applicable. Sessions with a TCM provider usually involve plenty of discussion and feedback; patients feel heard and understood, which can go a long way towards relieving anxiety surrounding the ED or other sexual disorders. TCM treatment for ED will include both acupuncture and herbs, which, combined, help to address the weakness or blockages that have developed around the liver and kidneys, strengthening the liver qi, relieving stagnation, and clearing dampness. [One study](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1847-acupuncture-heals-erectile-dysfunction-finding) showed that, after a course of treatment including 3-5 acupuncture treatment sessions and daily herbal supplementation, almost half of the men reported satisfaction with the results. [Another study](https://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/news/20000505/impotence-gets-needled-in-acupuncture-study#2) found that about two-thirds of the men who received TCM treatment reported feeling that they were \"cure,\" while the other third reported improved erections, but still felt that they needed more help. The group who received placebo treatment did not report improvement. Top 5 Tips for ED Men's Fitness The desire to overcome ED and get your sex life back on track can be a great motivation to clean up your diet and get rid of habits you know have been holding you back from peak men's health. Your acupuncturist can help you plan the best diet for men to help regulate hormones, reduce cholesterol, improve circulation, boost heart health and energy. - Eliminate alcohol, tobacco, and other recreational drugs. You may feel like these substances help you to relax and get in the mood, but on a deeper physiological level, they are compounding the problem. - Get more exercise. Ideally, balance cardio with some weight training. Losing fat and building muscle will help to balance the hormones and increase testosterone levels. - Take care of your mental health and emotional well-being. Foster open and honest communication about ED with your partner. Acquaint yourself with men's and women's health issues, so that you can care for each other with empathy. - Reduce stress. Prioritize a balanced, healthy lifestyle. Making time for yourself through regular exercise, meditation, and healing modalities like acupuncture can help improve your performance in all other areas of your life - Get adequate sleep. When the body doesn't get the deep rest it needs, it can lose all kinds of functionality. Acupuncture Near Me for ED ED is a sensitive men's health issue. Knowing that it's a common problem that affects lots of other men may help a little, but if ED is becoming a sexual problem that is negatively affecting your life and relationships, it's worth it to seek out help for erectile dysfunction. If conventional medical treatment for ED isn't working or isn't an option, or if you want to take a more holistic approach that will help also boost your fertility and longevity, consider acupuncture treatment for ED. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Depression With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Qineng Tan, L.Ac, Ph.D. & Xiaomei Cai. L.Ac., Ph.D. More than ever, people are struggling with feelings of sadness, [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), and isolation. Feeling empty or worried all the time, having difficulty concentrating, or even having thoughts of suicide are all possible symptoms of depression. [Acupuncture has been shown](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1876382011001417) to be effective for helping manage and overcome both low-grade depression and [major depression](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/major-depression.shtml). Everyone feels worried, sad, or frustrated due to life situations and problems that come up periodically. But feeling persistently fatigued with heavy emotions for days, weeks, or months on end is a signal that a person might be clinically [depressed](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/depression), or in the throes of a depressive episode. The current global pandemic is causing most of us to feel exhausted with worry over all kinds of issues: personal health, grief for loved ones who are alone, ill, or have passed, desperation over financial concerns, and feelings of being trapped or deeply pessimistic. [People who already had mental health](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/) problems, especially [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/anxiety/) or depressive disorder, may feel like they have less support than ever, as they cannot see friends or family, and may not have access to meeting with a therapist online. People who have other chronic health conditions, like [cancer](https://myartofwellness.com/acupuncture-and-tcm-for-cancer-integrative-oncology/) or chronic pain, may be struggling even more than they normally would, feeling distanced from the care they need. Everyone is dealing with tremendous stress right now, and we know that [stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) causes all kinds of health problems. Many people are already used to annual bouts of depression due to Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). Young people, most of whom have had to adapt to a wildly different form of learning this year, as well as being cut off from their friends, are even more prone to teen depression. Parents and caregivers are putting in extra hours, and may begin to feel helpless and hopeless in the face of this daily struggle. Truly, everyone is at risk for feeling situational depression in times like these. Remember that treatment for depression is [available,](https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/national-helpline) and if you are feeling despondent, it is in your best interest to reach out for help. Integrative care that includes different kinds of therapy may work for people who have not been able to find help for their depressive disorder. We are here at Art of Wellness to provide effective help for depression and chronic anxiety through acupuncture and TCM. Signs of Depression Many times people hide or deny their feelings of depression, even from themselves. It is important to recognize the signs and [symptoms of depression](https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/depression/symptoms) so that if you or someone close to you if affected, you will be able to get help. Signs that someone is suffering from depression include: - Changes in weight or appetite - Changes in sleep habits [Drug or alcohol abuse](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-addiction-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Difficulty concentrating](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Lack of interest in activities - Fatigue, feeling tired all the time - Angry, irritable all the time - Loss of libido - Backache, headache, or digestive problems Signs of [depression in teens](https://www.scripps.org/news_items/5319-hidden-signs-of-teen-depression) and [depression in women](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/depression-in-women/index.shtml) may cause other symptoms, similar to those of anxiety, like racing and intrusive thoughts, extreme sensitivity to criticism, or withdrawal from family and friends. Having trouble sleeping, or sleeping more than usual are potentially signs of depression, as are significant changes in a person's eating habits, sudden weight loss or weight gain. Depression can also affect [cognitive function and memory](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Top 10 Types of Depression Depression is a mental health condition that is caused by combinations of different factors, and takes [many forms](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/six-common-depression-types) in terms of symptoms and behaviors. Mental health professionals differentiate this condition into different [types of depression](https://www.psycom.net/10-types-of-depression/), according to duration, severity, and specific kinds of behavior, emotional, and thought patterns: - Major Depression or Clinical Depression - is defined as an episode of sadness or loss of interest or pleasure in external stimuli one usually enjoys that lasts for more than two weeks. - Persistent Depressive Disorder or Dysthymia - this is a chronic mental illness characterized by a pessimistic outlook and sad mood that persists for years. In this case, people may have what is sometimes called \"high functioning\" depression. Even happy occasions do not bring them joy. - Manic Depression or Bipolar Disorder - this condition is marked by extreme changes in mood and energy. A person might, at times, feel so low that they have suicidal thoughts or lose touch with reality, then their mood may suddenly shift into high gear, and they seem to have boundless energy and confidence. These shifts may occur over short or long periods of time. - Postpartum Depression - colloquially known as the \"baby blues,\" many women experience a form of depression in the months after having given birth. This type of depression occurs because of sudden changes in hormones, and is often marked not only by fatigue and inexplicable feelings of sadness, but also feelings of anxiety, panic attacks, and disturbing thoughts. - [Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-seasonal-affective-disorder-sad-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)- this type of depression is relative to the time of year, that is, a person regularly goes through a recurrent period of fatigue and low mood, a sense of heaviness, and irritability, or difficulty getting along with other people. Most people with SAD experience it during the winter months, but it can actually happen at any time of year. - Psychotic Depression - this is a form of depression that is accompanied by a break with reality, including delusional or paranoid thoughts, and hallucinations. - Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) - is an extreme form of [premenstrual syndrome (PMS)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)that interferes with daily life during the 7-10 days preceding the period. It is characterized by severe depressed thoughts that can become suicidal in nature. Then, after the period, the symptoms disappear for a few weeks, until the premenstrual phase occurs again. - Atypical depression - in contrast to its moniker, this type of depression may be the most common. Atypical depression refers to a predictable pattern of depressive feelings and behaviors, including oversleeping, changes in eating habits, problems with relationships, that overtakes one for a while, then clears up when some kind of positive event occurs. This can turn into a pattern of depression that comes and goes over the years. - Situational depression - this type of depression occurs in reaction to some kind of inciting event, maybe one that causes trauma or loss, or simply a major life change like a move or job change. This is a way that some people will adjust to circumstances and stressors in life, and it usually clears up within six months or so after the triggering event. - Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) - this is a disorder that occurs in childhood marked by chronic, extreme irritability and a struggle to handle negative emotions. Children with this order may regularly act out or have tantrums when facing frustration. While some types of depression are considered more severe than others, it is important to keep in mind that all kinds of depression are real health conditions than can and should be addressed before they become even more serious. Treatment for Depression In Western medicine, depression is seen mostly as a chemical imbalance affecting hormones and/or neurotransmitters, primarily in the brain. Depression can be triggered by a highly emotional event or difficult circumstances, and then, the chemical imbalance continues to cause negative emotions and disordered thoughts. The conventional medical solution for most forms of depression is a combination of psychotherapy, also known as talk therapy, and prescription medication, in the form of antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications. Modern psychotherapy aims to help people with depression through the practice of coping skills, problem-solving around relationship issues, and resolving negative emotions. Different types of antidepressant medication include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs such as Zoloft, Lexapro, Prozac, Celexa), which affect the way the hormone serotonin is produced and absorbed by the brain cells, and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs like Effexor, Cymbalta, and Pristiq), which influence norepinephrine production, as well. All of these medicines basically work by allowing the brain to have more \"good mood\" chemicals available. Other, less commonly used medications include second-generation antipsychotics, such as Abilify, which are usually used to treat mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but which are sometimes tried when other medications have not helped. Many people feel that they benefit from the mood stabilisation these medications can provide. Generally, doctors recommend taking the medications for one to two years, to prevent relapses of the depressive symptoms. However, some people find that they have a hard time coming off of certain antidepressant medications, and unfortunately, there are many unpleasant side effects associated with these drugs. More than half of the people who take [antidepressants](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK361016/) report side effects such as: - Headaches - Dizziness, brain fog - Weight gain - Dry mouth - Restlessness, trouble sleeping, [insomnia](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/insomnia) - Sexual dysfunction, loss of libido - Nausea, diarrhea, constipation, or trouble urinating - Skin rashes or vision problems In some cases, these [side effects](https://www.nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Mental-Health-Conditions/Depression/Treatment) may seem manageable in relation to the severe depression they were feeling before, but for others, these problems compound their dissatisfaction with life. More serious side effects, like heart or liver problems can also occur, especially in older people, or because of interactions with other medications used to manage chronic conditions. Some research studies have shown that acupuncture treatment can be used as an [effective alternative to antidepressant medications](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-acupuncture-treat-depression/), or as an adjunct that helps to offset some of the unwanted side effects. This study showed, also, that patients felt an improvement in their mood and quality of life after only a few weeks of acupuncture treatment, whereas the patients taking antidepressants took longer to register the positive effects. How Acupuncture Treats Depression TCM takes a holistic view of health that makes it very effective for [treating depression](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2018/7234101/). Going back thousands of years, TCM philosophy has always acknowledged the fundamental connection between mental health and physical health. Emotions and thoughts are as integral to wellness as the proper functioning of the organ systems. Imbalances in organs can cause emotional problems, and vice versa. So, when an acupuncture practitioner addresses mental illness such as depression and anxiety, she is looking at the whole picture. While a medical doctor may see varied symptoms such as digestive trouble, headache, irritability, and trouble sleeping as disparate problems to be solved by different specialists, or treated with different medications, a TCM provider views all of these issues as being part of a particular pattern and treats that pattern as a whole. According to TCM, depression is caused by stagnation, or blockages in the Qi (life force energy). It is usually related to stagnant energy in the liver, spleen, heart or kidneys. Liver Qi stagnation can cause strong feelings of frustration, stomach pain and digestive trouble, heartburn or tightness in the chest, and headaches. Heart or Spleen Deficiency patterns cause worrying, trouble sleeping, and poor appetite. Chronic cases of depression with anxiety are often related to Yin deficiency, which causes irritability, restlessness, poor sleep, and back pain. An acupuncturist looks at all of these symptoms and treats the appropriate pattern with acupuncture and herbs. Acupuncture will also help people by relieving stress, and helping to [restore better sleep](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). [One study](https://europepmc.org/article/med/10758845/reload=0) looked at patients diagnosed with minor depressive episodes and generalized anxiety. Patients who received ten acupuncture treatments showed significant improvement over those who did not. [A study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022395616303867) designed to help show the effect of acupuncture on neural circuity and chemistry as it relates to depression combined acupuncture with antidepressants when treating women with major depressive disorder. The patients receiving both showed improved functional connectivity in the corticostriatal reward circuitry of the brain. [Another study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-1819.1998.tb03262.x) showed that electro-acupuncture treatment has as positive an effect on norepinephrine levels as amitriptyline - a medication commonly prescribed to treat major depression disorder and anxiety disorders. Can Acupuncture Help Depression During Pregnancy and Postpartum Depression? Some forms of depression are specific to the area of women's health. [ PMDD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24410911/), [pregnancy depression](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032704001879) and anxiety, and [postpartum depression](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1136/acupmed-2017-011530) can all be helped with acupuncture treatment, without the risk of side effects. It is important, both for their own health and that of the expected baby, that women suffering from depression during pregnancy or in the postpartum period seek help. However, there are risks involved in taking medications during pregnancy. Antidepressant use has been linked to birth outcomes such as low birth weight and premature delivery. Acupuncture, which can provide innumerable benefits during pregnancy, is an option worth exploring to relieve symptoms of depression and anxiety during pregnancy. Acupuncture Near Me for Depression Depression can make it difficult to take action. Feelings of hopelessness and isolation can cause people to feel that they are beyond help. Stigma around mental health can cause people to hide their anxiety and extreme moods from others. But depression is a real and treatable illness. Whether you have been struggling with depression for a long time, or have just begun to feel worried about your mental health over the past several months, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at Art of Wellness. We are here to help you get past this depressed period and begin to feel hope and purpose again. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Anxiety With TCM and Acupuncture ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) By Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. and Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. Everyone experiences feelings of anxiety or apprehension at times. Sometimes people suffer from excessive feelings of dread or panic, even when they are not in immediate danger. In some cases, the complex cascade of emotional and physical sensations encompassed by [the term Anxiety](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9948) is so pervasive that it becomes a chronic mental health condition. [TCM and Acupuncture offer a natural, highly effective treatment option to reduce anxiety symptoms](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1755-5949.2011.00254.x). We are currently living in a particularly harsh reality in which human life is filled with setbacks and potential danger. There is always a chance that something bad might happen to you or someone close to you. In recent weeks, [the coronavirus pandemic](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) has understandably created a pervasive sense of worry amongst the population, and the numbers of people filling prescriptions for anxiety-related medications, antidepressants and sleep aids has [increased dramatically](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/anti-anxiety-medication-prescriptions-have-spiked-34-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-04-16). Anxiety is clinically defined as a persistent feeling of worry, accompanied by physical sensations such as heart palpitations, dizziness, and sweating. Sometimes people describe it as being similar to the sensations you feel when you've tripped and you're falling, except that the scary feeling persists for a long time; it doesn't go away even when nothing is happening. Anxiety disorder is a very common mental health condition experienced by people of all ages; every year about [20% of Americans](https://adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statistics) seek medical help for symptoms related to anxiety. If you are feeling heightened levels of distress that are affecting your ability to sleep, focus, or care for yourself or others, please be assured that help is available. Acupuncture and other [TCM treatment modalities offer a safe alternative](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-acupuncture/what-we-treat/) to pharmacological drugs that can cause side effects and potentially lead to dependency and withdrawal symptoms. A [qualified acupuncturist](https://myartofwellness.com/our-doctors/) will conduct an in-depth consultation and create a program designed to specifically address each patient's individual combination of symptoms and life situation. What Are the Symptoms of Anxiety? Doctors classify types of anxiety disorders into several sub-categories, including Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Social Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Phobia-related Disorders, and Separation Anxiety (anxiety in children). The most common symptoms of various types of Anxiety include: - Rapid or labored breathing - Rapid heartbeat or tachycardia - Feeling \"on edge\" or irritable - Sweating [Difficulty concentrating](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Memory loss](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Difficulty sleeping - Fatigue - Stomach upset - Anxiety headache Each person will present with a unique combination of symptoms and sensations, along with her own \"triggers\" or things that seem to cause the symptoms to manifest. Most people who seek medical care for their anxiety symptoms are either prescribed psychiatric tranquilizing medications such as Xanax or Atavan, referred for psychotherapy, or both. Some doctors use antidepressants such as Zoloft, Lexapro or Prozac to treat anxiety. These Selective Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) may help reduce symptoms in some cases, but all of these types of medications can cause side effects and lead to dependency. TCM and Acupuncture treatments not only address specific symptoms of anxiety, but address the root causes of the disorder. TCM Deals With All Types of Anxiety Disorders Anxiety, like [ depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and other mental health disorders, carries the disadvantage of being \"invisible.\" Other people, and even many medical professionals, simply can't see physical evidence of the problem, and can't empathize with the suffering involved. Well-meaning family members and friends might offer suggestions to \"calm down\" or reminders to stay positive, all with the implication that nothing is really wrong or that \"it's all in your head.\" Being plagued with constant self-doubt further amplifies the problem. Anxiety is a real health issue, and TCM offers effective modalities to address it. Modern medicine has only recently begun to make the [connection between emotional and physical](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18589562) maladies. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), on the other hand, has acknowledged for centuries that the mental, emotional and physical experiences of human beings are all inextricably linked. Sometimes a physical injury or traumatic experience can set the stage for a mental health problem. For example, a car accident that creates even minor injuries to the body might trigger future panic attacks, phobias, or P [ost Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ptsd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Other times, a mental health condition like chronic [Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)](https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/generalized-anxiety-disorder-gad) can affect sleep, eating, and other behaviors to such an extent that a person becomes more susceptible to illness and disease. It would not be surprising to see an increase in cases of Agoraphobia (fear of leaving one's home) and [Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD,](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-the-different-types-of-ocd-2510663) which sometimes causes compulsive hand-washing and cleaning as well as hoarding behaviors) as a result of the current coronavirus pandemic. People who experience multiple [panic attacks](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-panic-attacks-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) may be diagnosed with panic disorder. Anxiety disorders already tend to lead to feelings of isolation. Now that most people are spending far more time alone or sequestered with family members and roommates, already existing feelings of fear may be exacerbated. People who have never had to cope with anything beyond normal, mild anxiety may suddenly find themselves feeling real panic for the first time. Additionally, some might feel guilty or ashamed about reaching out for help for these problems when there are so many other people hurting for more apparent reasons. But there is real help for anxiety, and getting that help during this time of crisis makes sense. There is no need to suffer. [Find acupuncture near me](https://myartofwellness.com/) to address anxiety symptoms and the root causes before the problem becomes more severe and chronic. Acupuncture for Controlling Anxiety Conventional medicine generally attributes anxiety disorders to abnormal functioning of the brain and nervous system. The feelings associated with anxiety - the emotional sense of worry, the breathlessness and restlessness of the body, the behavioral instincts to freeze or to run - are all exaggerated responses to stress. [Stress is the body's natural reaction](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/stress/) to perceived dangers in the environment. When something threatens us, the sympathetic nervous system kicks into gear, and the adrenal glands pump out the hormones that flood the body with energy-what is often referred to as the \"fight or flight\" response. Normally, once the threat has passed, adrenaline will take some time to move through the body and then dissipate, and a feeling of relaxation is eventually restored. When a person has an anxiety disorder, this hormone release can be triggered by thoughts, and the fear of the physical response itself becomes a part of the vicious cycle. [Acupuncture treatment has been shown](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/integrative-mental-health-care/201810/acupuncture-anxiety) to act upon the nervous system, facilitating the release of serotonin, endorphins and noradrenaline, all of which contribute to relaxation and a sense of well-being. Stimulation of specific points have been clinically proven to reduce perceived feelings of anxiety as well as reducing the heart rate and blood pressure of patients. Auricular acupuncture, which specifically uses points on the ear, has been shown to be effective for anxiety. This method is particularly useful, as patients can be fitted with a tiny needle that can be stimulated with gentle pressure as needed to help alleviate symptoms as they appear. [Auricular acupuncture](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2206232/) has been used for thousands of years, not only in China, but all over the world. [Modern critical analysis has demonstrated that auricular acupuncture](https://journals.lww.com/anesthesia-analgesia/Fulltext/2001/02000/Auricular_Acupuncture__A_Potential_Treatment_for.49.aspx) affects the parasympathetic nervous system in ways that help alleviate pain and reduce anxiety symptoms. Electro-stim acupuncture, or [electro-acupuncture,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29705474) is another effective modality used by TCM doctors. How Does Acupuncture Benefit Anxiety Relief of Panic Attacks? One of the great advantages of acupuncture treatment over conventional methods of talk therapy and pharmacological intervention is that it has an immediately discernible effect. Patients often leave an acupuncture session with a deep sense of calm and relaxation. Reports of improved sleep usually follow quickly. In addition, the long-term effects of regular acupuncture sessions are cumulative, and people [report a sustained decrease](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Blog/723-panicattacksshenmen) in episodes of anxiety and panic attacks. One controlled study compared groups of patients treated with a regimen of acupuncture with moxibustion to a group prescribed a type of benzodiazepine medication. The [results showed higher efficacy](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1952-acupuncture-outperforms-drug-for-anxiety) in reducing anxiety symptoms among the patients receiving acupuncture. TCM Doctors' Top 10 Suggestions on Self Care for Anxiety Here are some natural remedies for anxiety you can utilize at home. With consistent practice, these habits will help alleviate stress and reduce anxiety symptoms. - Meditation for anxiety- Those struggling with anxiety may well be tired of hearing well-meaning friends suggesting they \"Relax!\" or \"just breathe.\" But studies have shown that regular meditation practice can significantly reduce anxiety. There are many methods; it is important to find a method that works for you. [This study](https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/9/6/751/1664700)suggested mindfulness meditation may be especially effective. - Waterfall Meditation - In this exercise, imagine yourself at the base of a waterfall. As you breathe in and out, picture the water gently raining down on you, trickling down each route until the tension inside you releases, relaxing parts of your body one section at a time. Allow your entire body to enter a peaceful and relaxed state. Let the image of the water wash away any stress or anxiety that burdens you. - Physical Exercise - By now it has been well documented that regular exercise is good for health in every way, lowering the risks of all types of chronic disease. Movement helps [reduce anxiety symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3632802/)by reducing adrenal reactivity, increasing the output of endorphins and endogenous (naturally produced in the body) opioids, and even stimulating the growth of new brain cells. It is also suggested that exercise functions as a type of exposure therapy. When people become more used to the sensations of an increased heart rate, heavier breathing, and sweating due to cardiovascular activity, it increases their tolerance for these same symptoms when they appear as part of an episode of anxiety. If you are able to go for a walk or run while following social distancing guidelines, it is especially helpful to get some sun exposure, as well. Put on some music or a favorite workout video; rhythmic movement that engages the large muscle groups provides great benefits. - Tai Chi and Chi Gong -These ancient traditional forms are \"moving meditations\" that work upon the endocrine circulatory, and nervous systems to balance energies and strengthen Qi. - Good Eating Habits - Caffeine, sugar, processed and spicy foods can trigger anxiety. Complex carbohydrates like brown rice, barley, quinoa and oats are relaxing, as are nuts and chickpeas, which contain tryptophan. Now is a good time to become more intimately involved with preparing dishes at home, and this process can also be soothing: a mindfulness exercise that results in a healthy meal! Your TCM provider will provide more detailed instructions for a nutrition program for your specific situation. - Stress Reduction - [Reducing stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/)goes hand in hand with reducing anxiety. Especially now, carefully manage your daily activities so as not to become overwhelmed. Allot a short period of time for checking the latest news and catching up with friends; then consciously disengage from screens and virtual realities. Social media has already been called into question for its apparent increase of anxiety among teenagers, but it has a real impact on people of all ages. Comparing your situation and surroundings to the carefully curated content you see on sharing platforms can make you feel pressure, shame, a sense of inadequacy.
