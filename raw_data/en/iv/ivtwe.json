Smith, State Geologist of Alabama, as follows: In connection with the work of the < ieologieal Survey of Alabama, and as a part thereof, Dr. Charles Mohr, of Mobile, lias prepared an elaborate account of the plant life in the State. Deeming thin work a most important and timely contribution to our knowledge of the Southern flora, as it di ecu wee* the character, distribution, and general asj>ects of plant life in Alabama in a broad and philosophical manner, I believe that it would prove of interest to a larger .section of our country than the region to which it is confined by its title. In order to secure, therefore, a more wide- spread distribution, allow me to suggest the propriety of publishing it as one of the contributions from the United States .National Herbarium. I may add that I am induced to offer this valuable manuscript for publication to the National Herbarium because under present financial conditions of the State Survey its publication would orobablv be delaved for an indefinite time, and thus its immediate usefulness would i V 4-' ' be impairs!. Dr. Mohr is now and has been for several years a special agent of the Division of Forestry of this Department, and there being, there- fore, no obstacle in the way of accepting this manuscript, I earnestly recommend compliance with the courteous suggestion of the State geologistof Alabama, Dr. Smith, and 1 desire to take this opportunity of acknowledging the obligations of this Division, both to Dr. Smith and to Dr. Mohr. The report is in part a complete enumeration of the plants of Ala- bama and in part a discussion of the various natural belts and areas of vegetation into which the State is divided, with a full description of the vegetative characteristics of each. I have, therefore, the honor to transmit the manuscript for your final approval, and recommend its publication as Volume VI of our series of Contributions. Respectfully, Frederick V. Coville, Botan int. Hon. .James Wilson, Sec Mart/ <> f Aw > h ^ f H PREFACE. The following description of the plant life of Alabama is the result of nearly forty years of sojourn and wanderings through the State, during which all parts were visited and the collections were made that serve as a basis of this work. The writer has attempted more than has been usual in the descrip- tive works and the various floras of regions or States of this continent. He thought it not sufficient to give inerelv an enumeration of the plants known to be indigenous, together with those which are known as immigrants growing without cultivation in the State, and to supple- ment such enumeration with notes on geographical distribution and habitat, but he has attempted a deeper study, that of the relations of plant life in the field; that is, of its ecological conditions. In this attempt the work of Merriam on the life zones and areas of the North American continent north of Mexico1 and Willkoinm's \"Grundzuege der Pflanzenverbreitung auf der iberischen Halbinsel (Leipzig, have served as a general basis in respect to the dis- tribution of plant life over wide geographical areas and limited regions embraced within them. The writer has been especially fortunate in having been able to con- sult, before the completion of his task, the classic work of Warming,2 which may be considered as laying down for the first time, in a sys- tematic manner, the principles of plant ecology. While these prin- ciples had been more or less foreshadowed by other writers, they were enunciated by Warming with such logical precision as to inaugu- rate a new departure in the study of plant life. Since these methods of viewing plant life have not yet become familiar to most students of botanv, it has seemed necessarv to discuss them somewhat in detail in the introductory part of this volume. It is hoped that by describing the plant associations to be found in the different localities, not only the primary object of a floral work as a part of a geological survey will be subserved, but a new interest will be added to the study of botany, both for the botanist and the thought- ful layman, which may enable them to use the volume for practical purposes. 1 See p. 20. a I)r.

In 1879 the botanical collections made by the State geologist of Ala- bama, Dr. Eugene A. Smith, in the northern section of the State, were submitted to the writer for classification, with the request that he bike charge of the investigation of the flora of Alabama in connection with the Geological Survey. Having accepted this duty, the formation of a Normal Herbarium of the State was undertaken. To this end the collections of the writer, made in the Coastal plain, and particularly in the Lower Pine region and Littoral belt, were incorporated with the above collections, and thus the foundation was laid for the Normal Herbarium of the Geological Survey of the State, deposited in the Museum of the University of Alabama, which has served as a basis for this report. Subsequently, and during a long series of years, the writer has worked singly in the Held at such intervals as his official tJ 4j duties would permit. Engaged in the investigation of the forests for the United States Census in 1880 and 1881, and later in making collec- tions for the exhibits of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, at the Exposition in Louisville, and the Cotton Exposition at New Orleans in 1884 and 1885, extensive collections of plants were made and advan- tage was taken of the opportunities for the study of plant life in the field in all the different regions of the State. Further facilities in the same direction were enjoyed from 1890 to 18% while engaged in the study of the forests and in the collection of the material for timber tests under the direction of Dr. Fernow, then chief of the Division of Forestry, Department of Agriculture. During the summer and fall of 189^ several special trips to investi- gate more closely the flora of the State were undertaken for the Geo- \u00a35 * logical Survey of the State. These trips included visits to the so-called Canebrake (Central Prairie) region, the basin of the Coosa River, the eastern part of the mountain region, and the Tennessee Valley. In 18% a visit was paid to the Chehawhaw Mountain and the higher val- leys and denuded plains in Clay County, the most elevated district in the State. Very desirable contributions have been received during 11 12 PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA. recent years from Prof. M. C, Wilson, of the Normal School at Flor- ence. The large collections made in 18VH>, and in the early part of the following season, by the biologists of the Agricultural Experiment Station, under the auspices of the Biological Survey of Alabama, con- nected with the Agricultural and Mechanical College at Auburn, and kindly submitted to the writer for examination, afforded many plants from localities not represented before in the Normal Herbarium, and from a section of the State of peculiar interest to the student of plant distribution, but heretofore almost unknown to botanists. They included a number of forms not previously observed in the State, some of them new to science. PLAN\" OF THE PRESENT WORE. In the gene nil part of the work a short sketch of the physiographical features of the State precedes a chapter on the general aspect of the flora of Alabama, and its relation to that of adjoining States, and to the continental and extra-continental floras. In the paragraphs on geological and climatic conditions, the publications of the Geological Survev of the State and of Prof. P. H. Mell, in charge of the meteor- * I1 ological service of the State, have been depended upon. In the general discussion of the geographical distribution of plants, the principles leading Dr. Merriam to the establishment of his life zones on the North American Continent north of Mexico have been adopted, these having already been successfully applied in the investi- gation of the distribution of animal as well as plant life in the part of our country west of the basin of the Mississippi River by Messrs. Merriam and Covillc. The delimitation of the floral divisions of the State introduced by the writer can only be regarded as tentative. The area, as yet. has been but superficially explored, and in many parts the borders of the divisions are but obscurely outlined, and need to be cleared up and rectified, while several gaps remain to be tilled. No effort has been spared to ascertain the distribution of each species and variety known from the State, first, over the globe, then, within the life zones of this continent, and last, within the floral divisions of the State, For this purpose the leading works on systematic botany, particularly North American botany, and all the available State and local floras and catalogues have been consulted. SYSTEMATIC AKRANGKMENT. In the catalogue of the plants growing without cultivation in Ala- bama the natural svstem of Engler and Prantl1 has been followed. * ~ This embodies the results of the latest investigations of the natural relations of plants and their affinities in the light of the development 13 of life from the lowest to the highest forms, the truly natural order, and at the present time generally accepted as such by biologists. The study of plants is now coming to be generally conducted in accordance with these views, and the natural system of the vegetable kingdom, as 7 i- % .. O enunciated in the classical work cited, has already been adopted in the most important works on descriptive botany in this country which have lately made their appearance, and will without doubt be followed in similar publications during another generation. NOMENCLATURE. In nomenclature the principle of priority, regarded as the funda- mental one, is strictly adhered to in the present work. This was first advocated bv De (Jan do lie at the International Botanical Congress at Paris in L8f>7, and its application was developed by American botanists at the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science at Rochester, in 18U2, and through the rules reported by the committee on nomenclature which were adopted at the next meeting of the botanical club of the association held at Madison, Wis., in August, L8!*3, The applications of plants to the use of man are briefly alluded to under the abbreviated head of Economic, and a list of the cultivated plants of the State is given at the close of the volume. The fuller treatment of the relations of the plant life of Alabama to the necessi- ties or comfort of mankind was at first contemplated as a part of this volume, but. on account of the expansion of the other matter, has had to be deferred, HISTORY OF THE EARLIER BOTANICAL EXPLORATIONS OF ALABAMA. In regard to its vegetable productions Alabama, like the rest of the territory fronting the Gulf of Mexico east of the Mississippi, remained until the last quarter of the eighteenth century a terra incognita. WILLIAM liARTUAM. The first description of these productions is given by William Bar tram,' in his account of his memorable travels through the South- ern States, in the years 1773 to 1778, This intrepid explorer of the botanv of Southeastern North America entered the State to all t' appearance somewhere near the middle of its eastern border, at the old Muscogee town Uche (the site of which can at present not be exactly located), after a journey of three days reaching the Indian settlements at Tallassee on the Tallapoosa River. In his account of his travels from the Tallapoosa Valley to the coast Bart rani depicts most graphically the 1 Travels through North ami South Carolina. <leorgia, east and west Forida, etc. Philadelphia, 1791. 14 PLANT LIFE OK ALABAMA. features of the vegetation prevailing in the floral regions traversed. He passed through the subtropical zone, recognized by the long wreaths of the Spanish moss investing the huge limbs of venerable evergreen oaks (the laurel oak, mentioned by him as Querew hemisphaerica), and huge magnolias, with the Cretaceous plain before him, which the trav- eler describes as a country with a rich black soil resting upon a chalky testaceous limestone clad with tall grasses and a variety of other herit- age, most conspicuous among it tall rosinweeds [Silphhim)^ with their large spikes of golden yellow flowers and a resinous substance exuding from the bruises and splits of the stem; beyond the plains a broken ground of hills and vales covered with forests of stately trees\u2014locust (designated as Robinia, but most likely the honey locust), linden, mul- berry,elm, hickory, and black walnut, with the Southern crab apple, dog- wood. and redbud for the smaller tree growth; further south a generally level plain, with a lighter soil, pebbles and sand mixing with the surface soil, covered with an open forest of oak, hickories, ash, red buckeye, and the smaller trees mentioned above, associated with an abundance of chestnut1 and with pines (Piam i. e.. short-leaf pine, Ptnm echinaia) interrupted by expansive cane meadows and detached groves, in strong contrast with the gravelly and rocky hills and vales support- ing the forests mentioned above. The traveler speaks enthusiastically of the dense cool groves of dogwood and of the flagrant groves of sweet illiciuni and odorous calycanthus or spice wood covering the higher banks of the streams, together with the beautiful ihtlexUt Um (silver bells, Mohrothmlt'on). stuartia, storax bushes, azaleas, mir/rtdatti (undoubtedly all overtowered by large-flowered Across the Shambee (Kscambia) River the coun- try is described as low and open, descending for the next So miles to the southeast, exhibiting a landscape, different, from others, not unlike the low countrv of the Carolinas, consisting of grrassv savan- * ~ ~ I nas, intersected by narrow forests along the water courses, hummocks. and swamps, with long leaved pines \"scattering!*' planted among the grass, associated on the higher knolls and swells with barren oaks,\" the rivulets running swiftly over their gravelly beds, their banks adorned with evergreen andromedas, American olive, illiciuni, hollies, sweet bay, and azaleas.

On one of these excursions he discovered the scentless wax mvrtle, a small tree * 7 called by the French the wax tree, which possessed none of the fra- grance of the common wax or candleberry tree {Myrica c<>r{f<>ru), and for this reason was described by this author as Jfi/t't'ea inodora.

On his return from the I'erdido liiver and from IVnsacola, Rartram describes the grassy savannas with their sarraccniiis extending from the Apalachi- cola to the Mobile River.

After three flays' travel he arrived again at the settlements of the Creek Nation, between the falls of the Moclassee (Tallapoosa River) and the Indian town Alabama, near the confluence of the Coosa and the latter river. After a short rest he a^ain left the soil of Alabama bv crossing the Chattahoochee River between the towns of Chehaw and Usetta (a short distance above the eitv of ^ 4- Columbus, Ga.). At this point in his narrative this genuine lover of nature repeats his praises of the fragrant groves of illicium left behind him, stating that he never met with it north of latitude 33\u00b0 nor south of Mobile except at one place, namely, at Lake George, eastern Florida, in latitude 2$-. 1 The citronella of the settlors. a dcrnetitm nf it frequently used in fevers as a dia- phoretic and invigorating drink. 16 PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA. SAM LEI, BOTSFOItl) lilVKLKY. After the lapse of about throe-quarters of a century, Samuel Bots- ford Buckley followed the footsteps of Bartram in the exploration of the flora of Alabama. Mr. Bucklev was a native of New York but received his education at Weslevan Universitv. Middletown. Conn., where he graduated in IS3ti. After leaving college the enthusiastic young botanist was among the earliest to explore the southern Appa- lachian mountains, discovering many new plants and making the study of the trees his chief object. Buckley reached Alabama by the prin- cipal road of travel leading from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf. Pass- ing over the detached spurs of the Cumberland Mountains in Madison County, on his journey to Alabama and pursuing his favorite occupa- tion he discovered the interesting American smoke tree (Coftntw twitlvx (Nutt.) Britton), before known only from a single locality in the Indian Territory near the borders of Arkansas. Arriving in central Alabama, he settled in Wilcox County as teacher in an advanced school (about I83it). There, among the hills and vales of the Upper Division of the Maritime pine belt, and near the woods and grassy glades of the Central Prairie region, an inviting Held was open to the botanist. In the prairie region he discovered that tine tree of the white-oak group named by him Qtunttx dtirainiil (Q. hr*Juloha (Torr.) Sar- gent), and in the hills, Tfudictmm , besides a host of other inter- esting plants heretofore unknown from the Southern States. lie described his discoveries in the Proceedings of the Philadelphia Academy of Science. Working without the advantage of a large botanical library he met with severe criticism; but many of his new species which at the time were not regarded as valid have now received their deserved recognition. In ISM Buckley was appointed State geologist of Texas, and, continuing his botanical studies, he enjoyed ample opportunities for discovering many undescribed plants. He never lost his interest inbotanv, and his last vears were devoted to fruit raising and horticulture at Austin, Tex., where he died in 1884. Buckley a, a remarkable shrub of the North Carolina mountains, com- memorates Bucklev's zealous efforts in the cause of Southern botanv. I 11K/KKJAII <JATKS. Or. Hezekiah Gates, a native of New Kngland and for man\\ vears O \u00ab * a successful apothecary at Mobile, was the til'st collector of Alabama plants from the coast region, whence he contributed valuable material to Torrev and Grav for their Flora of North America, from the vear *r * t lSo\u00bb; to the early forties. He died at Mobile in .iJSOO(i). Prof. Asa Gray dedicated to his memory the genus Gates! u, a monotypieal peren- nial of the Southwest, native from Alabama to eastern Texas; but unfortunately the name Gatesia has had to be given up. having been previously applied to another plant. EXPLORATIONS OF PETERS, BEAUMONT, AND NEVIUS. 17 THOMAS MINOTT PETERS. Thomas Minott Peters, of Now England parentage, l>tit n graduate of the University of Alabama, was engaged in the practice of law until his death, June 14, 1888. lie served his State us a representa- tive in the legislative assembly and afterwards as a State senator. In 18(i!J he was appointed a judge of the supreme court for a term of six years. In his love for botany he found recreation from his profes- sional duties, and his greatest enjoyment was to wander through the adjaeent mountains in search of plants. The study of lichens and fungi attracted him particularly, and he was one of the few my eulo- gists working in the Southern field along with Curtis and Kavenel. Of his zeal and activity in this line the long list of Southern fungi of his contribution, published by M. A, Curtis and Berkeley, bears ample testimony. He was also a close observer and accurate student of the *- plants of higher orders. He first brought to light the delicate and extremely rare fern, Triehohuutc* pcterxii, described by Gray, with others like it hidden in the dark recesses of rockv defiles and the so- called \" rock houses.\"1 He gave close attention to the species of Carex, furnishing the investigators of this diilicult genus with material from a region unknown to botanists. In acknowledgment of the services rendered him, Boott, of London, one of the first authors on these plants, presented him with a copy of his magnificent work, Illustrations of the Genus Carex. These classical and valuable volumes Judge Peters bequeathed to the University of Alabama, his alma mater, together with his mycological herbarium and collection of Carices, all mounted and labeled. In 1NN0 the writer had the privilege of enjoying the company of this venerable botanist during his investigations of the forests in Lawrence and Winston counties, and also received from him much valuable information on the mountain flora of the State, made use of in the present work. BEAUMONT, NEVIUS, AND RECENT COLLECTORS. John F. Beaumont, of German extraction, was born in Pennsylva- nia in 1S25. Judge Peters speaks of Beaumont as a man of a fair clas- sical education, an enthusiastic student of botanv, and a contributor to * * our knowledge of Alabama plants who, following his own example, became the active correspondent of Tuckerman and the other botanists already named. After some years spent as a missionary in Africa, he returned to Alabama, where he taught school. He died at Troy about the close of the civil war. He discovered that interesting grass, Lvzioht ahib(niien!<iH, first described in Chapman's Flora (18<!0). The Rev. K. I), Nevius collected plants in 1853-54 in the vicinity of Tusealoosa. He is the discoverer of the singular shrub Neviusia, named 15894 % 18 PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA in his honor bv Gray, which is confined to si single locality on the banks of the Alabama liiver. More recently our knowledge of the Horn of Alabama has been greatly enriched by the extensive collections made by Profs, F. S. Earle and L. M. Underwood in 189(>, and also bv those made the fol- lowing spring and summer by Professors Earle and Carl F. Baker. GENERAL PHYSIOGRAPHICAL FEATURES OF THE STATE. TOPOGRAPHY AND GEOLOGY.1 Alabama, extending from the shores of the Gulf of Mexico in lati- tude 30\u00b0 31' to the rim of the highlands of Tennessee under the thirty-fifth parallel of latitude, presents two well-marked divisions which nearly coincide with the northern and southern halves of the State, and which are readily distinguished by climatic differences, topographical features, and geological structure, and by the aspect of the vegetation corresponding with these conditions. The upper or northern division embraces the mountainous region of the State, which offers great complexity in its geological formation, almost every stratum of the various geological epochs being here represented. This gives rise to greater diversity of topography and soil than exists in any other of the Gulf States, thus producing that variety of resources which gives Alabama such a prominent position among her sister States. The lower division, which occupies the southern half of the State, can be considered as a vast plain of great uniformity in its general features; gently undulating where the loose sedimentary strata of the Post-Tertiary formations prevail, and broken where the cherty ridges of the Tertiary and Cretaceous rocks offered greater resistance to * o erosion by water. THE COASTAL PLAIN. The sedimentary strata forming the Coastal plain cover three-fifths of the area of the State. In the lower part, in Mobile and Baldwin counties, this plain rises in gentle swells to 300 feet above the tide- water region, reaching at its northern limit an average elevation of about 500 feet above the sea. For a distance of from 80 to 100 miles from the seashore this plain is almost entirely covered with the man- tle of sands and gravels of the Lafayette formation, the oldest of the Post-Tertiary strata, which give rise to soils varying from almost pure sand to loamy sand and generous sandy loams, and support a rather uniform but magnificent vegetation of coniferous trees. To the north of these terrains appear the limestones and marls of the 'Drawn chiefly from thi' Reports of the Geological Purvey of Alabama, 1S7~) to 189U, by E. A. Smith, State Geologist. COASTAL PLAIN AND REGION OF CRYSTALLINE ROCKS. 19 Tertiary formation, slightly dipping south and southeast. The warm, fertile, calcareous soils resulting from admixtures of these strata with the Lafayette loams support an arboreal vegetation of varied char- acter. The lower members of this formation, Buhrstone strata, con- sisting of hard, flinty limestones, render the surface of the plain broken by chertv hills which rise above the underlying lignite marls. Further north these hills merge into the cretaceous plain, or u Black Belt,\" so tallied on account of the black lime soil, the great agricul- tural region of the State. This Black Belt is followed by a belt of gravels and sand, partly of the lowermost Cretaceous (Tuscaloosa) for- mation, partly of the Lafayette formation, in which sandy loams pre- vail, and which is from 5 to 30 miles in width, widening at its western border, where it .suddenly takes a northern direction and forms the geological feature of that section of the State to the Tennessee River. This central belt of sands and pebbles forms the northern border of the great Coastal plain, separating the Paleozoic from the Mesozoic formations. Through its souther n portion runs the borderline between the two principal biological divisions of the State, the Austroripariau or Louisianian life area and the Carolinian life area (Merriam). North of this Coastal plain rise the highlands of Alabama with their mineral wealth, which cover about two-fifths of the area of the State. The first terrace of this mountainous region forms the so-called Fall line.\" Here the head of river navigation is reached, the tributaries of the Tombigbee and Alabama in this region making their way over rocky obstructions, over shoals and through rapids, to the main chan- nels of the extensive drainage area south of the Tennessee River. REGION OF CRYSTALLINE KOCKS. Ascending this terrace at the falls of the Tallapoosa River, the most easterly of the tributaries of the Alabama, the region of crystalline or metamorphic rocks is reached. This extreme southern extension of the eastern Appalachian ranges consists of a congeries of crystal- line rocks, to a small extent granitic, mostly of stratified gneiss, micaceous schists, argillaceous shales, and quartzites, wrinkled by many folds and deeply furrowed by the effects of erosion. The different degrees of resistance to this agency offered by these various rocks give rise to an ever-changing configuration of the surface, and to wide variations in the mechanical and chemical conditions of the soil. The folds of the highly siliceous slates and quartzites form sharp crested ridges of an elevation not reached in any other part of the State, while the stratified gncissic rocks and clayey slates most prone to decay under atmospheric influences form the undulating uplands. The sandy soils derived from the first men- tioned siliceous rocks, often intermixed with the angular fragments of quartz and hard slates, render the surface obdurately sterile: while 20 PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA. the latter rocks, decomposed and converted in xitn into stratified clays, form the. deep, warm soil of a region noted for its fertility. The metamorphic region extends without any interruption from the central belt of sands and gravels along the eastern border of the State nearlv to its northern botindarv. t- ft. liKClON OF THK COAL MKASITKKN. 4 The largest portion of the northern part of the State is occupied by the Coal Measures. There are three coal fields recognized, more or less separatee! bv other formations which will be presently referred to. The most southern of these fields is the Cahaba coal field, beginning above the shoals of the Cahaba River. This field is separated from the Warrior field bv the Birmingham or Jones Vallev toward the * O h. northwest, and from the Coosa coal field bv the Cahaba Vallev toward * * -ft the southeast. The southern outlines of this region are extreme!v broken: the strata of the steep rugged hills disturbed by many folds and faults are deeply furrowed by erosion. The principal part of this region is formed by the Warrior coal field, a triangular area, with the .southern corner at the shoals of the Warrior near Tuscaloosa. The topographical features of the western field are of much greater uni- formity than those of the. Cahaba field. In the lower part of the basin proper, where soft shales overlie the lower conglomerate of the Coal Measures, the surface is undulating, the highest swells rising most frequently to low hills. Toward the north the hills pass gradu- ally into the table-lands formed bv the heavv bedded sandstones of the upper conglomerate, which exhibit an almost horizontal stratifica- tion. These table-lands are the flattened summits of the several con- verging spurs of the Appalachian chain, know n north of the Tennessee River as the Cumberland Mountains and south of the river as the Sand Mountains: the latter with escarpments fronting the Tennessee Vallev toward the north, and toward the southeast, Blounts Vallev, which is formed by the southern extension of the Sequatehee fold. The table-land lying between Mounts Valley and Big Wills Valley in the southeast is known as the Raccoon Mountain. The table-land of the range forming the eastern border of Big Wills Valley is known as Lookout Mountain, the steep escarpment of which fronts the Coosa Vallev. n~- This highland area of the Coal Measures presents in its general aspect a somewhat rolling plateau. It rises to an elevation of from 1,000 to a little over 2,000 feet above the adjacent valleys. It slopes gently away from the greatest elevations in the north to the north- western limits of the region, where the Coal Measures disappear under the deposits of more recent formations; and to the south, where it passes gradually into the lower hills in the Warrior coal basin proper. COOS A AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS 21 HEGION OF THE COOSA VALLEY. Between the region of crystalline rocks and the region of the Coal Measures a narrow area inserts itself, extending in a southwesterly direction along the course of the Coosa River for a distance of about 50 miles, located upon the line of the greatest disturbance caused by the Appalachian upheaval. Consisting of an anticlinal valley, the river valley proper, and a succession of vertically uplifted strata of Cam- brian and Silurian rocks with successive faults, the surface of this region is extremely broken and presents a mountainous aspect. To the southeast of the anticlinal, through which the river winds its way, the hard Lower Cambrian sandstone, offering the greatest resistance to the action of water, forms the most prominent ridges in the Alpine, Coldwater, and Ladiga mountains, reaching a height of from 1,800 to '2,000 feet above the sea. The upper aluminous strata of the Cam- brian shales cover the floors of the vallevs, where from want of drain- V f age they give rise to the stiff impervious clay soils of the 4v flat woods.\" Areas of these Hat woods are found in the anticlinal valley itself, which is for considerable distances covered bv drifted sands and gravels. Where the cherty beds of the Silurian dolomite prevail, the surface in the vallevs is more or less broken and the soil thin. The surface * soil of the Coosa Valley along the banks of the river (i. e., in St. Clair County) is underlaid by the Subcarboniferous shales. Running mainly parallel with the Coosa Valley and similarly inter- secting the Coal Measures there are several smaller valleys similar to the Coosa Valley proper in their geological and topographical conditions. REGION OF TIIE TENNESSEE VALLEY, The remainder of the northern part of the State north and west of the Coal Measures is covered by the strata of the Subcarboniferous formation, which form the region drained by the Tennessee liiver. The river basin is about 45 miles wide, and toward its northern and southern limit is hilly, and often even mountainous. The plain through which the Tennessee River winds its tortuous way is from 12 to 15 miles wide. On the western frontier of the State the river level is about 480 feet above tide water, while near Iluntsville it reaches an elevation of (>12 feet. West of the table-land of the Cumberland Mountains, already spoken of in connection with the Coal Measures, this plain or valley proper is bounded by the Highlands of Tennessee, described as a plateau of from 700 to 800 feet above the sea, through which numer- ous streams have cut their deep and narrow channels, rendering the surface very broken and hilly. South of the river the escarpment of the Sand Mountain forms the southern boundary of the valley. From the eastern part of Morgan County in a northwesterly direction the 22 PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA. valley is traversed by the Little Mountain range, which owes its exist- ence to the Subcarbonif evous sandstones which have resisted erosion. The depression between the main range (Sand Mountain) and Little Mountain widens by their divergence into a broad valley of the same character as the main valley. Where the uppermost cherty strata of the Subcarboniferous lime- stone form the surface rock the surface soil is lijjht and more or less siliceous. This kind of soil prevails chiefly toward the northern limit of the valley. The soil of the river plain proper, resting upon the lower and more purely calcareous strata, is of great fertility. RIVER SYSTEM. Its extensive river system forms a most prominent feature in the physical geography of the State. Many of the larger tributaries of the main channels of drainage are navigable, and their innumerable feeders, the creeks and streams, traverse highlands and plains in all directions, affording an abundant water supply in every part of the State. TENNESSEE RIVER. Among the principal rivers is the Tennessee, most remarkable for its anomalous course. It rises in the mountains a short distance beyond the border of southwestern Virginia, and following mainly a southwestern course it becomes navigable at Knoxville. A short distance south of Chattanooga it cuts its channel through a southwest- ern range of the Cumberland Mountains, and enters Alabama at the northeastern corner at Bridgeport. From this point it flows in a nearly uniform southwestern course about 75 miles, when it reaches Guntersville. Here it turns abruptly to the northwest, reaching the Mussel Shoals, 10 miles below Decatur. These shoals are formed of hard, flinty rocks, over which the water rushes in a series of shallow cascades for a distance of about 38 miles, forming an insurmountable obstacle to navigation as far as Florence. From Florence the river is again navigable. It takes a northerly turn at Waterloo, and leaving the State near its northwest corner, continues in this direction, and after a course of 296 miles empties into the Ohio River at Padueah, Ky., making the distance from its source 1,037 miles. The vast area south of the Tennessee River is in the main drained by the Tombigbee River and its tributaries, the larger being the Sip- sey and Black Warrior; and the Alabama River with its tributaries, of which the chief are the Coosa and the Tallapoosa. These main channels of drainage Hnd their outlet into the bay of Mobile through the Mobile River, which is formed by their confluence about 50 miles above the river delta. ALABAMA AND TOMBIGBKK RIVERS. 23 ALABAMA RIVER. This is the largest and most important of the waterways of Alabama. It is formed by the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers, a little southeast of the center of the State. It cuts its way through the rotten limestone and underlying sands of the Cretaceous formation, and farther south through the limestones and marls of the Tertiary forma- tion, flowing not infrequently between the vertical walls of high bluffs formed by the horizontal strata, at other times winding through wide low bottom lands of great fertility. In its lower course toward its confluence with the Tombigbee River it passes through beds of sand and pebbles of more recent formation, and pine-clad hills front its banks, with wide cypress swamps where the banks are almost perpet- ually submerged, or extensive hardwood forests where less subject to overflow. From the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa to the confluence of the Tombigbee with the Alabama, the length of the latter is variously estimated at from 31^ to 400 miles. The average depth from Mobile to Clai borne is from to 7 feet, and from Clai borne to Montgomery it varies from 3 to 5 feet. The Alabama River passes through the richest agricultural region of the State, and through the Maritime Pine belt, its great timber region. TOMMUHEE RIVER. This river is formed by the confluence of the Little Tombigbee or Upper Tombigbee and the Warrior River in Marcngo County, a short distance above Demopolis, and unites with the Alabama River 243 miles south of that place. The course of the river is almost due south, trav- ersing a country rich in agricultural products, its banks often spread- ing out in heavily timbered bottoms. The character of the country traversed is the same as of that crossed by the Alabama River. The Tombigbee River is throughout its course in the State navigable by steamers for nearly the whole year. The numerous feeders of the Little Tombigbee River take their rise on the southwestern rim of the Warrior highlands and among the gravelly hills in the southwestern extension of the watershed of the Tennessee basin. The most impor- tant tributary of the Tombigbee is the Black Warrior River with its two forks, the Locust and the Mulberry, both of which take their rise in the wild ravines of the Warrior table-lands. These forks unite on the dividing line between Walker and Jefferson counties, the river continuing its southwestern course for about 50 miles farther. On reaching Tuscaloosa the Warrior takes a more southerly direction and unites with the Little Tombigbee about 170 miles below Tusca- loosa. According to the late Professor Tuomey the fall of the War- rior River between its source and Tuscaloosa is nearly 1,000 feet, V r or f> feet to the mile, and between the latter place and Mobile the 24 PLANT LIFE OV ALABAMA. waters which unite with the Warrior River have a fall of only 1<>1 feet, or 5 inches in a mile. It is for this reason that the Warrior River rises during freshets to the height of 50 feet at Tuscaloosa, the water being suddenly cheeked by the diminished fall and therefore accumu- lating at that point. Above Tuscaloosa the Warrior or Black Warrior River is not navigable. COOS A RIVER. This is the largest of the tributaries of the Alabama and is formed by the junction of the Oostenaula and Ktowah rivers at Rome, in northern Georgia. After a southerly course of 100 miles, the river enters Alabama in Cherokee County, where, continuing its southerly trend, it joins the Tallapoosa River at a distance of 334 miles from Rome. The river is navigable from Rome to Greensport, a distance of 180 miles. From the latter point to Wetumpka, a distance of 137 miles, navigation is interrupted by a series of shoals and reefs of ragged rocks, but from the latter point it is navigable again to its confluence with the Tallapoosa River. The chief tributaries of the Coosa River take their rise in the Blue Ridge and the Alleghenies of Georgia. The banks of this river are mostly high. It passes through a country rich in its mineral, agricultural, and forest wealth. CAUAKA RIVER AM) SMALLER STREAMS. The Cahaba is one of the smaller tributaries of the Alabama, into which it empties 28tJ miles above Mobile. It takes its rise in the lower hill country in or near St. Glair County, draining a mineral region containing the coal tie Id of the same name, and passing through the rich agricultural counties of Perry and Dallas. In former years steamers ascended from its mouth to Centerville, in Bibb Countv, a distance of 80 miles. Smaller streams affecting the drainage of the Coastal plain east of the basin of the Alabama River are the Kscambia River and the Choc- tawhatehee River, the former emptying into IVnsacoIa Bay, The Chattahoochee River, with an almost directlv southern Mow, forms the a ? boundarv between Alabama and southwestern Georgia, forming bvits * * ' ft i confluence with the Flint River of the latter State the Apalachicola River, a deep stream, to its mouth inclosed mostly between extensive forest-clad swamps and cypress brakes, and emptying into Apalachi- cola Bav. The Chattahoochee River is navigable throughout the vear between Bainbridge and Columbus, Ga. Its banks are lined with steep bluH's of the later Tertiary strata. CLIMATE. Owing to its geographical position, extending from its northern confines to the Gulf shore, over five degrees of latitude, and further to TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS. 25 the difference in elevation between its- northern and southern sections, the State of Alabama is favored by a varied, but in its extremes not excessive climate. The climatic conditions give rise in the upper part of the State to a vegetation closely related in character to that prevailing in the cooler temperate zone, and in the lower division stamp upon it the features of subtropical regions. Such conditions admit the successful cultivation within its borders of almost all the chief crops and many other useful and ornamental plants raised in higher latitudes, and also the cultivation of the great industrial staple crops and others serving for the sustenance of man and domestic ani- mals, originally derived from warmer zones. TEMPEKATURK. Kqually open to the influences of the warm and vapor-laden breezes from the Mexican Gulf and the intertropical Atlantic Ocean and the cool and drier aerial currents from the north unimpeded by mountain ranges or table-lands of very great elevation, the climate is mild and equable. The following table, transcribed from the diagram com- piled by Prof. i\\ II. Mell1 from the records of the Alabama State weather service, .showing for the entire State the monthly mean maximum and mean minimum temperatures and their average, exhibits the run of temperature during the course of the year. The regularity with which it proceeds within comparatively narrow limits from mouth to month, in the line of the mean maximum as well as the mean mini- mum temperature, both series keeping close to the line of the aver- age temperature, makes the mildness and uniformity of the climate at once apparent. ]htta tt'mjHTtfhtrt' h*/ is 12 The following jrives similar information for the seasons and the average temperature Mean maximum (i\\ yrursj Mean minimum itt years) Widest range (tf years) I <;:! ! :>0 U) Whole I > I .

The widest range in the extremes of tempera- ture observed once in that period covers 104c between the absolute minimum of 2iJ in January' and the absolute maximum of 106 in July. 4 In the southern division of the State, which is mainly embraced within the isothermal lines of and F., the lines of mean annual temperature follow with but slight deviation the parallels of latitude. Between the isothermal line of #4 and that of 60\u00b0 extends a central belt closely following the terrace that divides the northern and south- ern divisions of the State. The lines of mean annual temperature of (50\u00b0 and (!2\u00b0 include its northern division. RAINFALL. The meteorological region including Alabama receives the supply of moisture for its precipitation principally from the Gulf of Mexico. In the distribution over time and space the rainfall is of great uni- formity. According to the records of the State weather service/ consisting of observations made at the 4K different stations through periods of from two to over thirty years, the annual rainfall for the entire State is about 52 inches. Of this amount 14.52 inches falls during the winter months, December, January, and February; 14.IS3 inches in the spring; 13.21 inches in the summer, and not quite 10 inches (9.55) in the autumn. The greatest annual rainfall does not exceed 65 inches at any place and the least falls not below 41.75 inches. The number of rainy days in a year observed during a period of six successive years fluctuates between 74 and 117, according to the records kept at Montgomery; no periods of wet weather extend over five days/ Snow falls occasionally in the northern part of the State; usually one considerable snow fall occurs during midwinter. In the lower part it snows very rarely. Such a plentiful and evenly distributed, but not excessive, supply of atmospheric moisture, in connection with a mild and equable tem- perature, is productive of a highly luxuriant vegetation, which is most strikingly exhibited in its arboreal growth. WINDS. In its correlation with temperature, precipitation, and cloudiness, wind exercises a potent influence upon the climate. The prevailing 'On February 1 >, 1S99 (not included in the above period), the temperature fell at Tusealoosa to ti\u00b0 or 7\u00b0 lielow zero F. and at Mobile to below. a P. H. Mel I, (Himatulopy of Alabama. Mp.rit., pp. 29, 59. 8E. A. Smith, Agricultural Features of Alabama. Report of Geological Survey of Alabama for 1HS0 and 1881. PRINCIPLES OF PLANT DISTRIBUTION 27 winds in Alabama come from the south, southeast, and southwest. According to the meteorological summary of the observations collated by the State service, covering a period of six successive years, the winds from these directions prevailed in forty-one out of the seventy- two months, and thev are most likelv to be followed bv rain, most ^ f frequently by a heavy precipitation, when coming from the east, south, or southeast. The cool and dry winds from the north and northwest are least likelv to be followed bv rain. The western and northwest- * & crn currents prevailed during the period stated in twenty-three months, the north and northeasterly only in eight months. From the wind chart showing the average direction of the wind in Alabama from 1884 to 188!>, it appears that southeastern winds prevailed almost exclusively during the winter and earlier part of the spring, but with some northwestern winds; that winds from the northwest and north- east predominated in spring and in summer, and that in autumn the winds were from the south, southeast, or southwest, and more rarely from a northern direction. The differences in mean annual directions of the wind are but slight. In their rush toward centers of depres- sion, the warm winds from the south, charged with moisture, imping- ing upon the cold currents from the north, produce a whirlpool, resulting in electrical storms, generally with a heavy rainfall, often assuming the force of a tornado. These tornadoes, moving generally in a northeasterly direction, are most frequent in the north-central part of the State, and happen most often in the latter part of the winter or in the spring. CLOUDIN KSS. South and southwestern winds are generally followed by a sunny sky, those coming from the east and northeast by a veil of clouds which strong blasts from the north are apt to rend and disperse. According to the meteorological summary quoted,1 in a succession of six years the number of clear days per year averaged 120, of fair days 119, and of cloudy <lavs 116. No data are at hand for the deduction of the average duration of sunshine during this period. GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF PLANTS, Wherever life finds support plant life thrives and is reproduced, but no one plant, except perhaps a few of the lowest forms, is found dis- persed over every part of the globe. Every one of the multitude of forms which constitute the plant covering of the earth is by its organi- zation restricted within certain limits. It grows and reproduces its kind in those places where conditions of climate and soil are most favorable for its particular needs. If all plants could adapt themselves 11\\ 11. Mcll, Clinialolo^y of Alabama, op- pp. 59 to tvi. 28 PLANT LIFE <)K ALABAMA to their surroundings with equal facility, there would be no limit to their dispersion over every part of the globe where life exists, only with the reservation that in the struggle for the possession of the ground those of highest vitality, endowed with greatest power of re- production and possessed of special facilities for dissemination, would overcome the less favored and eventually establish themselves, to the #- exclusion of others, upon the available space. It is by the diversity of their climatic requirements, their varying degrees of dependence upon the universal environmental factors\u2014air, light, heat, and moisture (the last two being the principal ones)\u2014that plants are restricted within specific limits. The dependence of plant distribution upon heat is demonstrated by the different character of the vegetation under different parallels from the poles to the equator, and vertically in the ascent from the shore of the sea to the heights of the mountains. As Alexander von Humboldt graphically and eloquently expresses it: \" Unlike in design and weave is the \"nrpet which the plant world in the abundance of ita flowers has spread over the naked crust of the earth, more densely woven where the sun ascends higher on the cloudless sky, looser toward the slug- gish poles, where the early returning frost nips the undeveloped bud and snatches the barely matured fruit. Every zone is endowed with *\" 1- peculiar charms\u2014the tropical in the variety and grand development of its production, the northern in its fresh meadows and in the periodical revival of nature and the influences of the first breezes of the spring. Besides having its own special advantages, every zone is marked by a peculiar character.\" It is a fact well established by observation that the same or more or less closely related forms will often appear under similar climatic conditions in parts of the globe widely separated by oceans or deserts. This applies, if not to predominating specific and generic types, at least to representative orders. On the summits of mountains, covered for the greater part of the year with snow and ice, plants are found which are at home in the Boreal Zone; again, the flora of the equatorial zone bears the same general features around the globe. Plants with the same climatic requirements, calling therefore for the same physiological functions, necessarily show similarities in their morphological development, and thus we find that in different parts of the globe the plants exhibit a stronger or feebler resemblance morphologically. PLANT ZONES OF HTJHBOLDT BASED ON ISOTHERMAL LINES. Alexander von Humboldt was the first to divide upon these princi- ples the surface of the globe into botanical zones and to lay the foun- dation of the science of plant geography. Each of these distinct zones of plant, life exhibits features which are absent or at most more or less feebly represented in the other zones. LIFE ZONKS OK HUMBOLDT AND <>K MERKIAM 29 Recognizing heat as the prime factor in the distribution of plants, this great investigator of nature established the boundaries of plant zones by connecting the points having the same mean annual tempera- ture. The resulting isothermal lines denote broadly the limits within which certain plants find their demands upon this factor satisfied. He established for plant as well as for animal life, the. following lift* zones: The Boreal, or Northern; the Austral, or Southern, and the Tropical Zone. The borders of these zones rarely conform with the parallels of latitude, but frequently diverge widely from them, according to the elevation of the land, moving northward when they pass over lowlands, moving southward when running overt-he mountains, and also affected by the prevailing aerial currents and proximity to the sea. Since, how- ever, two points of the same mean annual temperature may present wide differences in the extremes of annual, monthly, or daily tempera- ture, and since the physiological functions and the development process must be correlated with these conditions, the zonal divisions established upon these isothermal lines are in a high degree faulty. LIFE ZONES ESTABLISHED BY HERRI AM. The amount of heat required to accomplish the cycle from germina- tion or the first movement in the unfolding bud to the maturity of the seed has been called the physiological constant of the species, which for a given species has been ascertained to remain the same wherever it may grow. To determine this constant the temperature of 4X K. (6\u00b0 C.) has been assumed by physiologists in general as the lowest point at which germination and bud movement takes place. As to the method of establishing this physiological constant opinions differ widely, some investigators believing that the desired coefficient is obtained by multiplying the mean temperature of a certain period by the number of days, while others find it in the sum of the maxima shown by the thermometer exposed to the sun (maxima of insolation). Merriarn recognizes it as a law that the physiological constant rests upon the sum of the mean daily temperatures during the cycle of vegetation.1 By adding the mean daily temperatures above the assumed zero point of vegetation at numerous stations of observa- tion from spring until such time in the fall as the temperature again falls to the zero point, and connecting stations of the same sum of these effective temperatures, lines are established which are regarded by Merriant as determining the northern limit of the species. In its southward distribution he finds a barrier in the l0.

These boundaries were found to conform with the limits of dis- tribution of species as arrived at by Held observations. Differences in moisture, the factor next in importance to heat in the distribution of life\u2014on this continent most potent in its influence from east to west\u2014determine the distribution of animals and plants within dis- tinct areas of these life zones. Based on these principles I>r. Merriam recognizes in the North American continent three primary divisions or regions Boreal, Aus- tral, and Tropical\u2014and seven transcontinental zones.

This division, the first of the three, extends from the limit of tree growth to the polar lands. The greatest portion is covered with eternal snow and ice, and farther south it includes the summits of the moun- tains reaching above the line of arboreal growth, subject to the same conditions. This zone is recognized by some writers as the hyper- boreal region, and as the realm of mosses and saxifrages. nrusoxiAN ZONK. The second, namely, the Hudsonian or subarctic zone, embraces the most northern part of the American forest. Its spruces, firs, and most of its birches and aspens extend from the shores of Labrador to Alaska. This zone is spoken -of as the Northern Forest or Lacustrian Forest of the North. CANADIAN' ZONK. This is the third subdivision, or the second of the northern belts of cone-bearing trees. In this zone pines, spruces, firs, and hemlocks outnumber the deciduous forest growth. In the southern and warmer parts of this belt the cultivation of the hardier cereals oats, rye, barley\u2014is possible, and potatoes and other root crops succeed. AUSTRAL REGION AND ITS ZONES. 31 AUSTRAL REGION. The great transcontinental Austral Region covers nearly the whole of the United States except northern New England, northern Michi- gan and Minnesota, and the higher mountains generally. It embraces three distinct life zones\u2014Transition, Upper Austral, and Lower Austral. TRANSITION ZONK. This includes the vast forests of deciduous trees of the cooler tem- perate region of the continent. Here the outposts of the northern types meet those of a decidedly southern distribution. In its exten- sion from east to west this zone presents three well-marked areas,\" or floras. Alleghenian Arm.\u2014The humid eastern division, the Alleghenian Area, extends from the coast of New England to the eastern border of the grassy plains west of the Mississippi River and pushes southward in a long arm along the heights of the Allegheny Moun- tains to Georgia and nearly to the border of Alabama. In its forests oaks, hickories, chestnuts, and locusts, with rhododendrons, azaleas, andromedas, and other shrubs of the heather family, mingle with the birches, aspens, mountain ash, ashes, the northern spruces, firs, hem- lock, and pines, and other cone-bearing trees at home farther south. In addition to small grains, the indian corn (maize) is grown here; the potato, with a number of other root crops, is raised, and apples, pears, cherries, and plums, and a variety of berries and fruits of the orchard are common. CentralC<mtm<fntal Area.\u2014This is the arid middle division of the Transition Zone, and comprises the dry plains and elevated table-lands extending from the eastern border of the former to the Cascade and Sierra Nevada mountains, and corresponds in part to the Central prov- ince of Gray and the northern prairies of other botanists. Area.\u2014This consists of the Pacific slope, west of these mountains, recognized by botanical writers as the Pacific floral region. UPPER AUSTRAL WINK. This /.one is natural!v divided into a humid eastern and an arid western area or flora. (Mrolmlan ,4m*,\u20141The eastern division, or Carolinian area, com- prises the lower part of the northern deciduous forest which covers the coast region south of New England; an interior portion of the Southern Atlantic States, including northern Georgia and the larger part of the upper half of Alabama; the basin of the Ohio River to the southern shores of Lake Michigan, and the great central valley of the Mississippi to near latitude 4H\u00b0, finding its western limit between the ninetieth and ninety-fifth degrees of longitude. Here the tulip tree 32 PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA (Li r<o<hn<] r<m tulipif4'ri()% cucumber and Spanish </\u00bb'ux difjiinkt) make appearance, Chestnut W(mm deuktht) ami black gum (Xy.sm ayl-mticn) are common, and of cone-bearing trees the yellow pine (Pinttx t'chhuita) and scrub pine (/'.

The cultivation of the grape and peach adds to the variety of the fruits, as also in the corresponding division of the preceding zone. The Upp't' SuHoran Area.\u2014This, the arid western division of the Upper Austral life zone, extends from the vaguely delined limits of the last division over the great western plains; beyond the Rocky Mountains it covers much of the great basin and parts of California, I.OIVKH AI'STKAl> ZONK. The Lower Austral zone, like the Upper Austral, is divided into a humid eastern and an arid western area.

Begin- ning with a narrow strip of the Atlantic coast near the southern shores of Chesapeake Hay, this area covers the coastal plain of the Southern Atlantic States nearly to the southern extremity of Florida and the Gulf States to the center of Texas and the southern section of Indian Territory, finding its western limit between longitude and 95\". It follows the lowlands of the Mississippi Iiiver toward its junction with the Ohio. This Louisianian flora has been designated as the realm of the magnolia, southern pine, and dwarf palmetto. The greatest part of the arable land is devoted to the cultivation of cotton. Rice and sugar cane, particularly in the lower part of this division, contribute to home demands and furnish staple products for export. The subtropical cow pea takes the place of clover for forage and as an ameliorating crop. The sweet potato is the chief root crop, and corn is the only grain crop cultivated for breadstuff. Peaches and grapes are successfully grown, and in the lower belt the lotpiat or Japanese medlar, while in proximity to the Gulf the orange ripens its fruit. Lower Sonoran Arm.\u2014This flora, consisting of the western and arid extension of the Lower Austral zone, extends from the plains of western Texas to the Pacific Ocean. It is generally recognized as the cactus region, or the Moxieo-Californian region. OTHKR Jj'ACTOBS INFLUENCING DH3TBIBUTION. 33 TROPICAL REGION. This zone embraces in eastern North America a narrow belt along the coasts of the. southern extremity of peninsular Florida and the surrounding keys, and contains part of the West Indian or Antillean flora. SECONDARY FACTORS INFLUENCING PLANT DISTRIBUTION. Besides the primary factors, heat, light, and atmospheric moisture, which regulate the distribution of life within the wide areas recog- nized as life zones, there are others which exercise a potent influence upon the distribution of plants in con lining them to narrower bounda- ries. The former are due to geographical position, latitude and longi- tude, extent of land area, presence and position of mountain chains, and prevailing winds and oceanic currents, while the latter are dependent on minor local conditions, such as altitude, topography, proximity to large bodies of water, all of which influence the lesser fluctuations of temperature, precipitation, occurrence of frosts or other extremes, secondary currents of the air, and exposure to sunlight. In addition to these and of equal importance are the stratigraphical relations deter- mining the chemical and physical character of the soil and subsoil, as well as the drainage of the surface and the soil beneath, which in itself must be considered as one of the most important of the secondary factors influencing distribution. To this class of factors belong also the facilities possessed bv different species for dissemination. These consist chiefly of biological agencies, special adaptations with which the fruits and seeds of many species are provided, to secure their dispersion. This is effected in various ways, particularly through the agency of animals. One means consists of fleshy, sweetish fruits tempting animals to feed upon them. In most instances the seeds are discharged with their vital power unim- paired and thus are transferred to distant localities, particularly when the fruit has served as food for birds. A second means consists of the prickles, hooks, or stiff, hooked hairs covering the surface of the hard fruits, by which they attach themselves to wandering animals. Distribution of seeds is also effected by atmospheric agency, the fruits or seeds being very minute or provided with broad, wing-like, or plumose attachments, which enable them to be wafted through the air. In some cases the sudden tearing asunder of the parts of the fully-matured hard fruit when touched causes the scattering of the seeds. Finally, some seeds are disseminated through their ability to float about in fresh or saline water without losing the power tlrr J'fUuizi'iifieographir, Jifi (1890). 15SU4 3 PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA. The opportunities for the dispersion of species by the.se means are more or less diminished by intervening- extensive water and desert areas or high mountain ranges. These primary and secondary factors, in their ever-varying combi- nations, arc the conditions by which the various associations of species and their restriction within specific areas of greater or less extent are determined. Such areas constitute the floral regions; and the system- atic relationship of the different species, their numerical proportions, and their various assemblages impart to each region its floral character. Suitable environment, that is, a proper combination of conditions of moisture, sufficient room and light, proper exposure, etc., determines the place in which a plant tinds all the requirements for its existence met, that is, its habitat. The conditions which outline its habitat, in combination with the greater factors of latitude, altitude, rainfall, etc-., determine the distri- bution of plants over wider areas, in which the particular plant (species) may find few or many suitable localities, which areas constitute its range. Within this range the plant may be found in few or many places, isolated or gregarious, but outside of this range it does not occur. DISTRIBUTION OF SPECIES AS DEPENDING UPON GEOLOGICAL HISTORY. The distribution of plants can not always be explained on the ground of their dependence upon the atmospheric and terrestrial factors. The differences in climatic conditions become too insignificant to explain the confinement of many species within extremely narrow limits, and at the same time topographic and other conditions of environment offer no satisfactory account. Premising the theory that the existing plants arc the descendants of similar types which flourished in past periods of the history of our globe, inmost instances an explanation is easily found on geological grounds. Viewed in this light, the occurrence of the hemlock (Txmja cauadenain), for example, with its northern companion, the sweet birch, on the extreme southern extension of the Allegheny Mountains, in Winston County, Ala., in a completely isolated spot hundreds of miles distant from the range of its distribution, can be accounted for when they are regarded as > 4 IJ the sole remnants of the northern arboreal flora which during the glacial period was pushed to lower latitudes and which oil its recession to cooler zones left these trees behind in the narrow valley of the 4. Sipsey River, where at. present the former shades the cliff-bound banks. The Torreya (Tumto/i tmfjfoiium) and the Florida yew {Ta.n/x floridana) of the valley of the Apalachicola River in western Florida, the American smoketree or chittaniwood {('otimtx in its isolated localities in north Alabama and southwestern Missouri, and ECOLOGICAL GROUPING OF PLANTS. 35 the Leitneria (L. jforidtina) in the latter locality and the swamps of the estuary of the Apalachicola River present similar striking instances of a strange, localization, in some eases within an extremely limited range. The relation of these woody plants to the flora of a preceding geological period, of which the present is the progeny, is clearly proved by the remains of almost identical types found buried in the strata of the Middle Tertiary formation of southern Europe and the Rocky Mountains. If we regard theso plants as the slightly modi tied descendants of types belonging to an ancient flora, which have sur- vived the changes our globe has undergone and have found a refuge in their present localities, the mystery of their strange isolation finds a satisfactory solution. The confinement to a single spot 011 the Warrior of Neimma alahmiumxlx^ with its nearest relation in Japan, and of Crotou alahatnmm# to a secluded valley of Little Cahaba River, can be accounted for on the same ground. PLANT FORMATIONS AND PLANT ASSOCIATIONS. The same causes to which the restriction of a plant within a floral region is due, give rise to the grouping of species widely differing in their natural affinities but equally adapted to accommodate themselves to the same conditions. Such assemblages, forming groups of a definite character, are by the later writers on plant geography recognized as plant formations ((irisebach, Drtide); or, with respect to their condi- tions of life, their ecological relations as plant associations by Warm- ing.1 The former authors define a plant formation as a group of plants of a definite physiognomic character, such as a forest, a grassy swamp, the vegetation of a dune of the seashore. The group may be composed cither of only one species, as the forests of long-leaf pine or the South- ern canebrakes, or characterized by the predominance of species of the same family or allied families, as most coniferous forests and our forests of oaks and hickories, or composed of an aggregate of species of various affinities with some of their features in common, as is the case with most forests and prairies. These plant formations impress upon a flora its physiognomy, as was long ago noticed by Humboldt. The following plant formations, recognized by Engler and Drude,3 will be referred to in considering the distribution of plant life in Alabama: 1. Open plant formations, more or less interrupted, inhabiting\u2014 a. The strand or beach. h. The sands of seashore, hill, and plain. Rocks and pebbles. Willkonim, p. VII. 189t>. 36 PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA. 2. Compact or continuous plant formations of a uniform typo, consist- ing\u2014 d. Of mosses or lichens. r. Of cespitose grasses (meadows, grassy swales). f. Of various herbs (prairies, pastures). <j. Of gregarious suffruteseent plants or low undershrubs. It, Of gregarious larger, woody plants branched from the base (thickets). /. Of arboreal vegetation (open and dense high forest). k. Of paludial plants (riparian swamps, marshes, and bogs). /. Of immersed aquatics, floating free or rooted in the soil. Considering these natural groups or plant formations in their bio- logical aspect and investigating the mutual relationship between the plant and the place where it lives (habitat), Warming finds that the properties by which a plant is able to adapt itself to the influence of the various factors to which it is exposed and to hold its own in com- petition with its associates are deeply founded in peculiarities of anatomical structure as well as in the morphological development of its organs and the resulting physiological functions. The presence or absence of a type in any given plant formation finds its explanation in these peculiar modifications of its organism by which its mode of life is regulated, as well as in the ecological relations existing between its own life and the life of its associates. On these principles Warming has proposed a new classification of the plant covering of the globe, recognizing four principal groups of associations based on ecological relations, namely: (1) Hydrophytic vegetation, forming the associations of plants sur- rounded entirely or partially by water or growing in a constantly water-soaked soil. (2) Xerophvtic vegetation, forming the associations of plants con- fined to an arid soil and a dry atmosphere. (3) Ilalophytic vegetation, making up plant associations restricted to a saline soil, wet or drv. (+) Mesophytic vegetation, including the general vegetation prefer- ring a soil and an air of medium humidity. Of the various plant associations met with in Alabama, those com- posed chiefly of vascular plants will be more thoroughly discussed under this classification of Warming. It is self-evident that there exist manv intermediate forms between these groups, and these often render it extremely difficult to assign a certain plant association to a place in one or other of the above groups or classes. Within each of these four principal groups the vegetation is com- posed of typical forms of plant life, distinguished as trees, shrubs, PLANT ASSOCIATIONS OF ALABAMA. 37 u rider shrubs (including* the low perennials with a woody stem and branchlets partially dying at the close of the season of growth) and perennial, biennial, and annual herbs. HYDKOPHYTIC PLANT ASSOCIATIONS. Of the associations of this group the following are recognized in the Alabama flora, consisting of plants: (//) Floating free in water either on the surface or submerged; for example, the water fern (Azolla), worts (Utricularia), horn weed. (Ceratophyllum), etc.; (&) connected with the soil, rooting either on rocks, as Podostemon, many fresh-water alga\\ and some mosses (Lith- ophile associations), or in the loose soil, as the pond weeds (Potaino- geton), ditch weed (Kuppia), eelgrass (Vallisneria), and of the higher cryptogams N i te1la. (tf) Immersed only at their base and rooting in the slightly sub- merged or swampy soil, forming associations of paludial plants, as the vegetation of the grassy marshes and of bogs, and the shrubs and trees covering the alluvial swamps; for example, cypress swamps. XKltOPHYTIO PLANT ASSOCIATIONS. These consist of the vegetation of the dry, exposed, drifting sands of the seashore and of dunes, and the woody vegetation of loose sands (Psammophile associations); also of the vegetation of dry prairies (\"\"bald prairies\"), and of the forests of the dry uplands, either of evergreen cone-bearing trees (pine barrens) or deciduous trees. IIALOPHYTIC PLANT ASSOCIATIONS. These are composed mostly of aquatic plants, inhabiting the beach and saline marshes of the seashore. MESOPHYTIl PLAM' ASSOCIATIONS. These embrace the plant associations confined to a soil and atmos- phere of moderate humidity, as grassy swales, canebrakes, the arbo- real vegetation of the subtropical forests of broad-leaved evergreen trees and shrubs, and the deciduous forest of the lowland with a fresh soil rich in humus, never or infrequently overflowed. GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE ALABAMA FLORA. The flora of Alabama stands in the number of species and varietal forms, as well as in the diversity of their characteristic associations, unsurpassed among those of adjoining regions. This wealth and vari- ety of Alabama's plant life is easily explained when, on the one hand, its area is considered, extending over nearly o degrees of latitude, andon the other, the diversity of its topographical features, varying from the 88 PLANT LIKE OF ALABAMA. abrupt mountain ranges, with their broad table-lands, wide valleys, and rugged hills in the northern half of the State to the fertile Cretaceous plain in its center; and farther south, to the pine-clad hills and rolling uplands merging into the coast plain with its open and forest-covered swamps, and the sands and saline marshes of the seashore. The num- ber of distinct species and varieties known can undoubtedly be increased, since thorough botanical investigation has lieen attempted by but a few. The closer exploration of any of its regions is sure to reward the botanist in bringing forms to light which have never been observed in the State, i f indeed not new to science. SYSTEMATIC RELATIONS. The list of vascular plants growing without cultivation in Alabama, as given in this volume, numbers between 2,500 and 2,550 recognized distinct forms (species and varieties), including all the introduced, advent ive, and fugitive forms. Of this number, 5U are spore-bearing plants \u2014Pteridophvta. Of the seed-bearing plants\u2014Spermatophyta \u2014 12 species belong to the Gymnosperms, their ovules destitute of an inclosing ovary; the remainder to the Angiosperms, their seeds within an ovary. Of the latter, 707 distinct forms belong to the Monocoty- ledons, the division consisting of plants with the embyro of the seed bearing but a single cotyledon or seed leaf, and a little over 1,700 species and varieties belong to the Dicotyledons, comprising the angio- sperms, with an embryo bearing two opposite cotyledonary leaves. Among the families of the above divisions most prominent by num- ber of species the Compositae1 (goUlenrods, asters, sunflowers, hawk- weeds, etc.) take the first place with 303 species, followed by the Poaceae with 2S!t, Cyperaeeae with 140, Leguminosae * taceae with 60, Scrophulariaceae with 5i>, Rosaceae, including the plum and the apple tribe, with 54. Of the families less prominent in num- ber of species the excelling in number of species, Panicum stands first, with 71, Carex has fully 60, Aster 38, Cyperus 35, Quercus 23, Paspalum 20, and Hypericum 20 species and varieties. ENDEMIC PLANTS. The number of plants endemic to Alabama is small, but suggestive. Only the following types are exclusively found within the limits of 1 (Jar^lua^cau ami Curlioriareai*. ~ (dabamenxix, and Trichomanes peter*!V. Tliis poverty in endemic forms is easily explained, by the absence of any serious obstacles to plant migration from and to all parts of the eastern section of this continent. The gradual descent of the Allegheny Mountains to the Coastal plain rendered the influx of plants from the north and east easy. The oldest types flourishing on the most ancient strata succumbed gradually to the vicissitudes of eons of time and gave way to later invaders. Completely open on the east and the west, the denizens of the plant world from these directions found no hindrance in peopling the new soils of the secondary (Mesozoic and Cenozoie) formations, after their rise above the water. RELATIONSHIP OF THE ALABAMA FLORA TO THAT OF ADJOINING REGIONS. It results from these conditions that the plant-covering of the State coincides closely with the flora of the adjoining regions. In its south- ern portion it is very intimately related to the flora of western Florida, Mississippi, and eastern Louisiana, equally so to that of the maritime plain of North and South Carolina and Georgia, and in a less degree to that of western Louisiana and eastern Texas. In its central parts the same close connection exists with the flora of the middle region (Piedmont region) of these States and with that of southern Arkansas. The flora of the northern part, of the State, with its mountains and the Tennessee Valley, presents a similar relationship with the flora of the Allegheny ranges south of the Potomac River, below an elevation of 2,000 or 2,500 feet above sea level, and with that of the southern extension of the Cumberland Mountains and the rim of the Highlands of Tennessee. RELATIONSHIP OF THE ALABAMA FLORA TO FORE ION FLORAS.1 KASTERN ASIA. Asa Gray first directed attention to the intimate relationship exist- ing between the flora of eastern North America and that of eastern Asia, particularly that of Japan.\" The eastern Asiatic element is in this part of our continent most pronounced southward. It is here most strikingly manifest in the arboreal and shrubby vegetation of the numerous genera of the catkin-bearing families, such as walnut, chest- nut, oak, beech, haxlenut, iron wood, hornbeam (Ostrya), willow, wax myrtle; and of the coniferous family, such as pine, hemlock, cypress (Chamaecyparis), savin (Juniperus); to which are added elm, mul- berry, linden, pear, plum, service trees (Amelanchier), maple, witch 1 In this discussion the introduced and immigrated plant* occurring in Alabama and the genera ivjindented only by cosmopolitan species inhabiting the temperate and warmer regions all over the globe are disregarded. 2 Asa Gray, Memoirs X.

The number of arboreal and frutescent genera is still further increased by those chiefly confined to the southeastern section of our continent, such as Magnolia and Illicium of the magnolia family: Persea and Henzoin of the laurel family; roses, honey locust, & * t 7 storax bushes, catalpa trees, and devil wood or American olive, of different families. On closer comparison of the flora of Alabama with that of eastern Asia and principally of Japan, it is found that about .1(10 genem or nearly per cent of the genera indigenous in Alabama, belonging to 60 families, have their representatives in eastern Asia. Besides the above common genera there occur others in those parts which in their essential characters differ but slightly from the nearest allies found in Alabama, forming with them such pairs as Glaucidium and Ilvdrastis, a and (Jroomia, and some others. The number of types indigenous to Alabama which are identical with species found in eastern Asia is small, amounting scarcely to forty. Though this number by itself considered is insignificant, it must he viewed together with the fact that every one of the genera common to Alabama and eastern Asia is represented in the latter region by one or several species closely allied to the forms found in Alabama, so closely in not a few cases as to be difficult to separate. The relation of these two floras is expressed in the following Total I 8 1U (3 4 a 2 1 t 1 1 1 m !

Not loss than 200 genera containing nearly 40 per cent of the plants indigenous to the Alabama flora are represented in the West Indian Islands, Mexico, Central America, and more rarely in South America as far south as Argentina. On the western coast of the continent but a few genera occur which have also their home with us. The num- ber stated above is comprised within 2*2 families. About 140 species are common to Central America, Mexico, and the West Indian Islands. This relationship is most evident between the flora of that part of the State embraced within the Austroriparian area and the flora of the more elevated regions of tropical America with climatic conditions some- what similar to those prevailing in southeastern North America. The flora of the subtropical regions of Alabama exhibits faintly the fea- tures of the vegetation of the neighboring tropics by the presence of a few genera of the epiphytal plant formation (Tillandsia, Epidendron, PoWpodium), which in the abundance and variety of its forms consti- tutes one of the most striking characteristics of the tropical vegetable world. A scarcely stronger suggestion of tropical character in our flora is afforded in its arboreal vegetation by the presence of our dwarf palmettos (Sabal, Serenoa) with their short or prostrate trunks. Our deciduous-leaved trees are represented by 10 genera common to both regions, *2 species of oak (Querm# vhyiniana, Q. brev/'foba) and 2 of hickory (TTicoria pecan, II. myristicaeform.w) being common to Alabama and the plains of northern Mexico near the Texan frontier. Our wax myrtle, hop hornbeam, mulberry, elm, box elder, haw, and sweet gum occur in the elevated regions of the eastern declivity of the Mexican Andes. Our evergreen magnolia is in the same region 42 VLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA. represented by the closely related genus Talauma. Of coniferous trees pines are abundant in the higher mountains of Mexico and Central America. Our slash pine, or Cuban pine, extends from the West Indian Islands to Honduras; Taxodium inhabits Mexico, and savin {Juniperux barhidetixbi) the West indies, with other species of Juniper us in Mexico.

The relationship between the flora of Alabama and that of Europe and the parts of Asia and Africa bordering upon the Mediterranean Sea is indicated by their having in common about 100 families with about 230 genera, this being nearly 35 per cent of the genera indig- enous to Alabama, with 55 species which occur in Alabama and also in western Europe and in the Mediterranean region, chiefly the former. Of the arboreal plant formation nearly all of our deciduous catkin- bearing trees and most of the shrubs are represented by closely allied species in those regions. Some of these genera are represented far to the north in the European-Asiatic forest belt, such as willow, cotton- wood (Populus), birch and alder, and pine, while walnut, beech, oak, hornbeam, hazelnut, ash, maple, plum and cherry, pear and apple, and the savin are widely diffused over the more temperate regions of Europe. In the Mediterranean region our white cedar (Chamaecy- paris) finds itself represented in the cypress (Cupressus), from which it differs by a mere technical character, and Celtis (hackberry), Cereis, and Storax are represented in the same region. It is a remarkable fact that in no one of these genera is the European species identical with that found in Alabama. The ferns and allied families are represented by 4 families with lk2 genera; of these 7 belong to the ferns proper with 5 identical species, *2 to the Ophioglossaceae, 1 to the Lycopodiaccae, 1 to the Selaginellaceae, and 1 to the Equisetaceae.

Viewing the plants of Alabama in their biological aspect, their habits of life, and the peculiar adaptations by which they establish and maintain themselves successfully among their various associations, no striking features are met with which are not presented in one or the other of the adjoining States. With our present knowledge it is, however, impossible to enter upon very close comparisons. The per- ennial plants are largely in excess of the annuals and biennials, com- prising five-sixths of the total vascular flora of the State. Among the woody perennials, 343 distinct species and varieties have been counted, 32 with climbing or creeping stems. This number includes 45 under- shrubs and sutfrutescent perennials, most numerously belonging to the Hypericaceae (St, Johns wort family), with 12 species, which, owing to the large number of individuals gaily adorned with bright yellow flowers, form a striking feature in the plant covering of the flat pine barrens in the coast plain. FOltKST FLORA. SIIKTHHV l'LANT ASSOCIATIONS. The 171 species and varieties of shrubs known in Alabama, intimately connected with the arboreal vegetation, form the higher undergrowth and the brushy cover of the soil of the mixed forests in the southern SHRUB AND TREE ASSOCIATIONS. 45 part and prevail in the openings avid along the borders of the deciduous forests in the northern half of the State. Twenty-four species of the woody plants are of the liana form, stout climbers, which ascend the highest trees, nearly half of their number belonging to the grape family. Outside of the forest the shrubs rarely aggregate into an independent \"bush\" formation of such extent as to make an impres- sion upon the physiognomy of the vegetation and to form a proper plant association. In the coast region, however, the following species form to a limited extent thickets more or 1 es:; free from with marsh elder {Iva frutcseenx), dot here and there the salt marshes of the seashore. The arborescent grasses of the bamboo tribe, the so-called cane, repre- sented in eastern North America by A mini Inarm and A. tecta, form by their spread over wide areas a most peculiar and prominent feature in the vegetation of the State, known as canebrakes. The big cane, attaining not rarely a height of from 20 to 30 feet, occu- pies the more or less overflowed alluvial river banks. The so-called reed or switch cane, of smaller size, forms the impenetrable under- growth of the forests of the humid and flesh soil depressions, and is most prevalent in the Cretaceous plain, designated as the, cane brake region, AltlioltKAI. PLANT ASSOCIATIONS. As in most parts of eastern North America, forests constitute in Alabama the most extensive and predominating of plant formations. Under the influence of the mild climate of relatively low latitudes with an abundant rainfall evenly distributed throughout the year, condi- tions most favorable to tree growth, Alabama presents the aspect of a richly wooded country. From the mountain heights and valleys of the north to the shores of the Gulf the State is clad in a robe of forests scarcely surpassed in the diversity of their tree growth and timber wealth by those of any other part of eastern North America. Origi- nally the tree covering was almost uninterrupted. It can safely be assumed that at present over 50 per cent of the area of the State remains under cover of the original forest growth, although more or less invaded by the ax in the more accessible localities. Of the 172 arboreal species recorded as growing without cultivation in the State, 15 are introductions from the warmer temperate and tropical regions, mostly of the Old World, and 8 from the States of the Southwest. 46 PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA. Deciduous forest*,\u2014Deciduous-leaved forests prevail principally in the northern part of the State, They are marked by the same variety A. t- of forms and the same great abundance of catkin-bearing' or nut-bear- ing trees (amentaceous orders) which are characteristic of the forests of the lower Allegheny ranges as far north as southern New England and the lower Ohio Valley, with their walnuts, hickories, oaks, hornbeams, beech, cottonwoods, elms, tulip and cucumber trees of the magnolia family, cherries, plums, haws, and service berries. Of the 43 species of amentaceous and other apetalous trees known to occur in the State 3W are common also to the regions just mentioned. Of the 28 oaks occurring in Alabama, 1<> art; found in (he more northern forests; of the 8 Magnoliaeeae, 5; of the 8 plums and cherries, 4; of the siO or more species belonging to the apple tribe, mostly haws, 7; of the 5 maples, 4; of the 4 elms, 3, and all of the 6 species of ash. In the mesophile forests, covering the valleys and terraces of a rich, moderately humid soil, oaks predominate, but many other genera are present. The following list exhibits the characteristic trees, all of which, except Magnolia acuminata wrdata^ extend north of the Ohio River: Qiicrcm allut liber asli), The gum here attains its largest dimensions.

Kivrjr<jni forexU. \u2014The evergreen arboreal vegetation forms a most prominent feature of the flora of the State. The 3L species found in Alabama are nearly all distributed throughout the warmer temperate and subtropical regions of eastern North America. In the xerophile forests of the dry uplands the cone bearing evergreens, embracing six species of pines, one, type of (he cypress tribe, and the red cedar, hold an important place in the tree-covering of the State, particularly the pines. These cover extensive areas, the long-leaf pine extending almost exclusivelv and with scarcely any interruption over many ti L- 1. 4/ hundreds of square miles, while short-leaf and loblolly pine form a large element in the forest growth of the northern half of the State. Broad-leaved evergreen trees and shrubs in great variety of species prevail in the mesophile semiswampy forests of the subtropical zone. In these forests the magnolia, single or in groups, finds its home with the white bay of the .same genus, red bay, dahoon holly, yaupon, wax myrtles, li-ti, American olive or devil wood, leather wood, and large oaks with persistent leaves (live oak. etc.) or retaining their foliage during the greater part of the winter (laurel oak and water oak). A host of evergreen shrubs\u2014the sweet illicium of the mag- nolia family, azaleas and andromedas of the heather family, holly, and ' *- T *- * others\u2014form the dense undergrowth. Of conifers, the loblolly pine, with the Southern spruce pine and Cuban pine and, mostly in swampy localities, the white cedar, tower above the broad-leaved forms. The strange-looking Spanish dagger (aloifolia), an arborescent lily, with its trunk covered with rigid sharp-pointed leaves and, in the beginning of the summer season, crowned with ample panicles of snowy while Mowers, forms a characteristic feature of the arboreal vegetation of the sands in the coastplain. 48 PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA. OPEN-IjAND OK CAMPKSTRIAN FLORA (xeuophile plant associations.) Under a climate so highly favorable, to tree growth and with .soil conditions which in general present no obstacles to the development of an arboreal vegetation, there is in Alabama, as in the adjoining States and the corresponding regions of the Southern Atlantic States, but little room left for the characteristic vegetation of open-plain or treeless mountain and hill country, especially if we exclude the vege- tation of herbs and undershrubs of the open rolling pine barrens, of the pine flats of the coast with their scattered tree growth, and of the scanti 1 v shaded rockv crests of the mountains. It is only on the com- paratively small tracts of the Cretaceous plain where the underlying limestone strata come near the surface and the covering of the rich black calcareous soil becomes too shallow to permit the roots of the trees to gain a firm hold, that arboreal vegetation is completely excluded. In these localities\u2014the so-called bald prairies, low knolls, or broad swells of limited extent, with the soil not deep enough to be plowed\u2014many of the typical plants of the eastern North American prairie have found a refuge, from which they have spread over the borders of fields, open waysides, pasture and waste grounds, and worn- out and abandoned lands. In such localities the original types have to contend for the possession of the ground with many introduced and adventive weeds, the hardy offspring of species originating in the exposed plain. Most of the native typical plants of these remnants of the prairies, and of the open in general, are also common to the prairies of the Mississippi Valley from the Wabash to the valley of the Colorado River in Texas. Most of the rosinweeds (Sifphmm character- istic of the prairie flora; most of the species of the pea family and most of the umbel lifers and grasses inhabiting the prairies, open borders of fields, and pasture grounds in the central and northern part of the State, have also their home on the prairies of Illinois, Missouri, southern Arkansas, and eastern Texas, WAT Kit AND SWAMP FLO It A (ll YMiOI'll YTIC PLANT ASS< XUATIONS). Plants of these associations arc most prominently represented in the lower pine region of the ('oast plain. Among the ^7 species of vas- cular hydrophytes so far observed in Alabama 11 are pteridophytes, 139 species are monocotyledons, and 77 dicotyledons. H V1 >ROCH \\ III I1KA N CLASS. Of hydrophytes floating free in water, species arc known in the State. They are kept afloat by their thallns or thallus-likc stems, as in Azolla and duckweeds (Lemixi mhnn\\ L. trimdaita^ Spirodelti), or * WATER AND SWAMP FLORA. 49 by the rosettes of their floating leaves, as in sundew {Drosera inter- media), water feather {Ilotion la Infiata). bladder wort (TTtrieidaria inflata), or l.lTHOf'HYTIC ANI> LIMN.'KAX CLASSES. Of submerged hydrophobes rooting on the solid rocky bed of swiftly running brooks two species of Podostemon occur in the mountainous regions. They are moss-like plants, their roots provided with peculiar organs by the aid of which they fasten themselves closely to the rocks. More numerous species of different families constitute that association of submersed hydrophytes which take root in the soft soil (Limmean associations). These are in some cases provided, in addition to the immersed foliage, with peculiarly constructed shield-like leaves floating on the surface, only their flowers being lifted above the water, of which the following are examples: CmUtl'ta (water |. Others have the foliage entirelv submersed and of one form, as O f leaves finely divided; Vallisneria, with spp., Philotria, narrowly lanceolate to linear. These Limmean aquatics, with their stems mostly emerging from the water at flowering, but their seeds ripening beneath it, form the fre- quently very dense vegetation of ponds, lakes, and semistagnant waters of the estuaries. Of this association, the species are especially numerous in the Coast plain. J'ALTsTiMAN t'LASSKs, This association embraces the halophytes and fresh-water plants which root in a water-soaked soil, with their leaves and flowering stems above, and frequently their bases alone surrounded by water. Thev are nearly all perennials, with stout roots or strong running root- stocks (rhizonms), and cover the extensive open marshes of the tide- water regions and river alluvium. Large monocotyledonous plants of various kinds form the characteristic feature of this vegetation, of which the following are representatives: PhragmHea 15894 4 50 PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA.

The plants of these associations of halophytes are nearly all perennials with stout, fre- quently deeply rooted, running rhizomes. This vegetation of the swamps and salt marshes encroaches upon the water with the shoaling of the rivers and the formation of muddv banks in the inlets of the sea 4- and on the open shore, and serves to break the force of the waves, and finally, by the close interlacing of the rootstocks, binds the loose soil into a solid matting as a bulwark against the ceaseless destructive action of the water and winds. The paiudial arboreal vegetation of the more or less submerged soil of the alluvial districts has already been spoken of, and the flora of the tree-clad swamps fringing the pine-barren streams and of the open pine-barren swamp will be fully discussed in treating of the several regions in which they occur.

The epiphytes are simple lodgers living upon trees in an atmosphere saturated with moisture, without depending for their nourishment on the tissues of the supporting plant. Only a few of the many species of these plants which lodge in the trees of the Tropics are represented in the flora of Alabama. They inhabit the trees of the damp or semi- swampy forests of the Louisianian area.

They are, however, found to grow also upon shaded rooks and prostrate trunks. NAI'ROI'JIYTIC AND SYMBIOTIC ['LANT ASSOCIATIONS. Saprophytes are colorless plants which, as fur as those belonging to the phanerogams are concerned, live upon the debris of the vegetable world, deriving their nourishment from the organic matter resulting from its decay. The largest number of saprophytes belong to the fleshy fungi and some of these live upon decaying animal matter. Being destitute of chlorophyll, their vascular system less developed, without breathing pores, their leaves reduced to mere scales, these plants are unable to elaborate the constituents needed for nutri- tion or to change carbonic acid from the air into assimilated food mate- rial. The number of seed-bearing saprophytes occurring in Alabama is small, and widely dispersed through the deep, shady forest, as Apteria Corallorhiza, and Ilexalectris of the orchid family, and in grassy, damp swales Burmannias. Hemisaprophytes are green per- ennial herbs of the ordinarv structure and habits, which for their nutrition are only partially and to varying degrees dependent upon organic matter. Some live in humid, peaty soils, mostly in the open, for example, some of our club mosses (Lycopodhtm carolwum-tnit ^ Z. (Limodorum, Pogonia, llttlxnarki spp.), while others can exist only in a humid soil, rich in vegetable matter, under cover of the forest. Symbiots are pale, almost colorless, plants, of waxy appearance, in their organization similar to the saprophytes, and have been until recently regarded as truly parasitic in their mode of living. It has, however, been found that they do not .subsist on decomposed vegetable matter, nor are tinny root parasites. They are true symbiots, being in their existence closely bound up with that of another plant which contributes to their necessities, but is equally1 benefited by this con- nection; Monotropa and Ilypopitys, of the Indian pipe family, belong to this group. Immediately after their germination the rootlets of these plants are infested by the vegetative threads or spawn (mycelium) of a fungus which, as the plant develops, fastens itself upon every root, finally enveloping the rootstock with a thick iilm, the higher plant drawing its nourishment solely from the elaborated food of the fungus. 52 PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA. r.VKAsmr plant associations True, parasites are also destitute of chlorophyll, and leafless, but thev take their nourishment from the living tissues of their host, sub- sisting entirely on its elaborated food materials. Three species of this class of parasites which foist themselves upon the roots of their hosts (root parasites) occur in the Carolinian zone of Alabama, and are also frequently found in other parts of temperate North America, all belonging to the family of parasites which fasten themselves upon the stems of their host, (1 are found in Alabama, all belonging to the dodders or love vines (Cuscuta). These plants at the start, root in the ground, but upon springing up, when they meet a plant suitable for a host they wind themselves around its stem and at places of close contact send haus- toria through its bark to the wood, and, the cells of the two uniting, the parasite draws its food from the plant attacked. Thus firmly established, the part of the stem of the parasite connecting it with the ground dies, and it depends henceforth entirely for its nourishment on its host. The chlorophyll-bearing shrubby parasites of trees are represented by a single species, the American mistletoe {Phoradcndrou fljt/v-.vr w/.y). The so-called hemiparasites\u2014green herbs which fasten by-their lateral rootlets upon the roots of their host\u2014are only partly dependent upon assimilated food material. These half-parasites belong mostly to the figwort family, examples being Canadian louse wort (l\\>di<'ularls painted cup {(Jmtilh'ja efumdensLy), and sev- eral Gerardias. The number of plants subsisting in this way has not been ascertained, but outside of the Serophulariaceae, Comandra and Darby a are also supposed IXS K< T1 VOROt'S 1'L A N'TS. A these plants inhabit the bogs of peat mosses and the damp flat open pine barrens of the Coast plain, consisting of sarracenias inhabit stagnant or still-flowing waters of shallow pools, ponds, lakes, and streams, floating upon the surface of the water or immersed. It is evident that bv the facultv of appropriating animal substances for their nourishment, nature has provided these plants with an additional supply of nitrogenous food which the sterile soil, extremely deficient in the elements required for plant nutrition, does not contain. In order that they may get hold of the animals serving them for food they are endowed with peculiar appliances of a highly specialized character, as, for example, the CLASSES OF INTRODUCED PLANTS. 53 trumpet-shaped or urn-shaped loaves of the Sarracenias.

INTRODUCED PLANTS AND THEIR INF1AIl\\N( K V l*ON NATIVE PLANT ASSOCIATIONS. Fully one-sixth of the, plants enumerated in the catalogue of the Alabama flora as growing without cultivation are immigrants from other regions, and but few of these are native in the more distant parts of this continent north of Mexico, They are mostly from the warmer temperate, subtropical, and tropical regions of the Old World. Those of widest distribution and which have gained the firmest foothold are wanderers following civilized man in his conquest of the wilderness. Originally children of the open plain, exposed to the extremes of heat, cold, drought, and excessive rain, these plants necessarily acquire the widest elasticity in adapting themselves to new surroundings and possess the greatest power of resisting adverse conditions. Considering the way these foreign plants have established and are maintaining themselves in their new home, they may be regarded as mtti.wdizrt! when they have taken a permanent place among indigenous plants; <Wvv^///v when restricted to cultivated lands or to the vicinity of human dwellings; andi/^c//V//v when they have gained only a tem- porary or precarious hold on the soil. N VlTltAUZED I11. A NTS. Naturalized plants, in a strict sense (De Candolle, A. Gray), are those which have established themselves tirmlv among the native * o plants and participate in their various associations over considerable areas. Their introduction is in inanv instances due to the direct -L agency of man. About 150 species of this class have been noted in Alabama, the greatest number (about one-fifth) belonging to the grasses. Fully one-half had their home original!y in central and western Europe; one-seventh in the Mediterranean region; one-sixth in the subtropical and tropical regions of the Old World; about the same proportion come from subtropical and tropical America (West Indies and Mexico to southern Brazil and Argentina); and, lastly, three species are from the territory west of the Mississippi and immediately north of Mexico. 54 PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA, It is often impossible to decide whether a plant should he considered naturalized or native, particularly when, though it grows in distant parts of the globe, every trace is obliterated of the time and manner in which it may have been introduced. Such instances are found in the Cherokee rose (R<mt htwiguta)* the strnmon 'mm). The first, also at home in eastern Asia, is said to have been found by the whites on their first, arrival at the. villages of the Cherokee* and ('reeks; the sec- ond, dispersed over the wanner regions of the Old World, was fre- quently found about the habitations of the aborigines in the warmer temperate and subtropical zone of this continent, and the last was met with about the Indian villages on the banks of the James Kiver in Virginia. AIIVEXTIV i: I'LA NTS. These are foreign plants which have gained a firm foothold only on cultivated lands, or land abandoned bv the cultivator, and are rarely found to stray beyond the waste places near his dwelling, lacking power to hold their own in the struggle with the indigenous plants for the possession of the soil. Strong feeders, of quick growth, these adventive plants arc dependent upon soils rich in available nitrog- enous plant food, such a& is provided by the tiller of the soil for his crops or is accumulated in the rubbish about his habitations. Here belong the host of weeds which infest fields, gardens, and meadows, and consequently are in close connection with the cultural plant formations. If it is difficult to draw the line between naturalized and indigenous plants, it is not less so to decide whether a plant is thoroughly natu- ralized or merely adventive. Some of the species, at first merely ad- ventive, acquire speedily the ability to accommodate, themselves to their changed environment and thus become able to gain a linn hold upon the soil among the indigenous plants, not infrequently spreading widely if the proper opportunities for their dissemination exist. Some of the plants of quite recent advent from distant shores offer striking examples of this kind. The Japanese clover (Zrw^W^-f/ .v/zvWiv), advent- ive from eastern Asia, and first observed at the port of Charleston, S. C., during the second quarter of this century, has now spread over thousands of square miles, west to Louisiana and southern Arkansas, and as far north as Maryland. This enormous spread was speedily effected by the droves of cattle and horses following the armies during the late war. Greedily eaten by the animals, the seeds beinyf voided * t- n without being injured and readily germinating in the decaying drop- pings, this annual was soon permanently established in the open woods and pasture lands, over hill and lowland, throughout a vast extent of country. The bitter weed (JL-lrnitim tenuiful'niht), originally from the sunny plains west of the Mississippi River south of the r ADVENTIVE AND FUGITIVE PLANTS. 55 Arkansas valley, was first, observed in Mobile in 1866. It has spread along the embankments of the railroads to the mouth <\u00bbf the Ohio River, literally covering in many places the waste and uncultivated grounds, and reaching out along byroads and borders of fields and woodlands. In its northward spread this plant has largely taken the place of the mayweed {Anthemix eottiJa)^ a European weed of early introduction. Ac<tlitJu/xperiiiuiit auMralf, of the Antillean flora, has, during the past thirty years, made its way along roadsides from the coast of Georgia to western Florida and Alabama, and toward the banks of the Mississippi River. As an example of a plant of more recent advent, which has gained a firm hold among the weeds and native plants of the waste heap, Mdoehw hir^da deserves to be mentioned. First observed on recently turned soil at Mobile in 1876, and subse- * (juently lost sight of for a number of years, it is now found to infest cultivated and waste places widely in the Coast plain: and as it ripens its seeds in abundance throughout the summer this weed proves most troublesome and difficult to eradicate. Somewhat over forty species of adventive plants have, been recog- nized in Alabama, fully one-half from Europe, and a small number from the warmer regions of the Old World; one-third from the West Indies and South America, and about one-sixth from the trans- Mississippi region. The following weeds, classed among the adventive plants, are most conspicuous by their abundance all over the State, or, at least, in some one of the recognized botanical Under this designation are understood those immigrant plants which have not firmly established themselves upon our soil and are liable to succumb to the vicissitudes of climate and accidental changes in the locality of their growth. In some, instances their disappearance is to be ascribed to the absence of the specialized insects necessary to their fertilization and also to the occurrence of earlv and late frosts. Thev are mostly introductions coming with the ballast of ships and, show- ing but a slight tendency to spread from the place where they were landed, arc mostly confined to ballast heaps. One hundred and fifty- seven species of these fugitives have been observed in Alabama, mostly on ballast about the port of Mobile and on the shores of Mobile 56 PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA Bav. About one-half are native in the West Indies, Mexico, southern Brazil, mid Argentina; one-fourth are arrivals from the Mediterranean region and tropical regions of the Old World, and the rest are from central and western Europe. Of the trees and shrubs introduced into cultivation in Alabama a comparatively small number have escaped. Such are rarely found to strav far from the localities where thov have been cultivated, and % V ? they establish themselves mostly among the native plants along fences, about dwellings, on the borders of adjacent woodlands, and in hedge- rows. Still smaller is the number which have escaped of the orna- mental herbaceous exotic plants cultivated in our gardens.

In several instances, the boundaries of the life zones and areas, based upon the distribution of heat and moisture on this continent, as established by Merriam, can not at present be distinctly drawn in Alabama. The investigation of the plant covering of the State, the location of species, and the study of their relation to the factors controlling their distribution within its limits is as yet not sufficiently r CAROLINIAN AREA IN ALABAMA. 57 advanced to furnish the data required for this purpose. The frequent yet only indistinctly perceived overtopping of these zones adds to the difficulty of placing satisfactorily the linos by which they are separated. The efforts here, made to lav down the lines of life zones and their subdivisions can only be regarded as tentative. The following .subdivisions of the life zones of Alabama have been recognized as floral regions; that is, as endowed with a flora of characteristic and distinct features, due to the presence of types which, if not confined exclusively to their limits, predominate within them and impart a peculiar character to their several associations. The prevalence of one or another of these associations or plant forma- tions in the different sections of the same region determines the character of its subordinate floral divisions. CAROLINIAN AREA OK FLORA. A line drawn from the northwestern corner of the State to the lower part of Lee County, crossing the Coosa Valley near Childersburg, makes the limit of the highlands having an average elevation of SOU feet above sea level (K, A. Smith). This line coincides approximately with the isothermal line of (to F., and mavbe regarded as the boundary in Ala- *- O * bama of the Upper and Lower Austral zones, therefore of the Carolin- ian and Au.st.rori parian or Louisianian areas. It winds its way from northwest to southeast and southward to the \"fall line.\" Accepting this zonal line, a botanical limit is gained, northward of which is found a flora different in character from that to the southward, generally O % described as the flora of the great Central Mississippi Valley, and dis- tinguished by the feeble representation, if not total absence, of the subtropical element and the exclusive prevalence of deciduous forests. Various shrubs and trees coincide in their limits of northern and south- ern distribution closely with this boundary line, and serve as unerring guides in pointing out its course. Such all find in Alabama their southern limit, on this line. Although n the vegetation of the Carolinian area presents in its broad features great uniformity, particularly in its tree growth, there exist in its range of nine degrees of latitude differences in the latitudinal distribution of heat, which necessarily affect, the distribution of plants within its lim- its and present insurmountable obstacles to the extension of a number of species northward. Due to this temperature element, there is a most pronounced limit beyond which the successful cultivation of the cotton 58 PLANT LIFK OF ALABAMA. crop <*nn not. be pushed, and which also presents a harrier to several trees and a number of other plants of Southern distribution that are only rarely met farther north, as, for example, the willow oak {Qin-rcm phdlox), loblolly (Arumlinarut- mHcroxpa'tno). This line, roughly extending from the Atlantic coast at the mouth of the Chesapeake Ray west ward to southwestern Missouri and northern Arkansas, was located by Grav fe. 4 along- latitude 30% and by him regarded as the line of separation between the two principal floral divisions of eastern North America, namelv, the flora of the northern Cnitcd States and Canada and the flora of the Southern States. In AlaUuua it is onlv this lower belt of 4 the Carolinian area, embracing the mountain region and the lower hills with which we are, concerned. MOUNTAIN KK(;iON. The extreme southern spurs of the Appalachian chains belong, with their western and eastern frontiers, to two distinct members of this mountain system. Their differences in topographical and stratigraph- ical conditions affect visibly the distribution and localization of species in the sections traversed by them.

The valleys reach an extreme elevation of about 1,(.100 feet above sea level, and the highest summits of the ridges reach an alti- tude of from %!,000 to 12.400 feet above the Gulf of Mexico, These ridges rise abruptly from the valleys and above the lower lulls; their steep flanks are covered with the sharp-edged fragments of the sili- ceous rocks which crown their crests with bold cliffs.

These pine forests are open, almost entirely bare of undergrowth; only in the depressions on the flanks of the mountains a stunted growth of black-jack makes its appearance. At its vertical limit of distribution the pine is suddenly replaced by mountain oak, chestnut, and pignut hickory. Whenever on the summits of the pine-clad ridges at lower levels soil conditions more favorable to deciduous tree growth prevail the pine is obliged to give way to the hardwood trees. The pine timber on these, mountains is somewhat stunted; the bodv of the trees is short and more or less knotty, and the old trees are frequently affected by dry rot, caused by the mycelium of polyporous fungi. It is little esteemed for lum- ber, but largely consumed for charcoal. There are, however, found exceptional tracts, with a timber growth unrivaled in density and per- fection. Such heavily timbered forests of long-leaf pine have been observed, for instance, at Hollins, in Clay County. They extend for miles over a narrow valley and along the rounded foothills of the higher ridges which rise abruptly above them on either side. These particular tracts of forest are not surpassed in yield and quality of timber by the best pine timber lands elsewhere east or west of the Mississippi River, the trees showing most vigorous growth and remarkable uniformity in size and averaging from 20 to 24 inches in diameter breast hi\"h, Bv actual measurement thev were found to be n 1 t of a total height of from 110 to 120 feet, the greatest height growth of the species on record. Of the large number of felled trees exam- ined in the logging camp not one was found defective.

A loblolly pine felled on the border of the brooklet watering the valley measured 25 inches in diameter across the stump and was found to be searcelv 50 vears old. The herbaceous vegetation on these pine-clad hills is of essentially the same character as that found on the uplands of the Central pine belt, denoting a dry soil. The hidden cause of such perfection in the development of the longleaf pine on a soil apparently as unpromis- ing as any of the rolling pine barrens was clearly revealed by the 60 PLANT LI KK OF ALABAMA. examination of the subsoil. The argillaceous schist underlying the sandy surface was. found completely decomposed, transformed into a friable loam rich in plant food and sufficiently porous to permit the slow percolation of the surface water and its unhindered access to the long taproot of the pine. Open forests of longleaf pine responding to conditions similar to those prevailing on the Hanks of the Talladega Mountains or Blue Kidge of Alabama, already mentioned, cover the lower cherty ridges in Calhoun County and the isolated peaks south of Talladega known as the Alpine Mountains, which rise to a height of 1,500 to 2,000 feet above the sea. These pine forests of the metamorphie highlands and of the Cambrian hills on their outskirts have in many localities become important since the development of the iron industry in these districts. During the past twenty-five years extensive areas have been denuded of their forests to yield the large supplies of charcoal demanded by this industry. Characteristic herbaceous species pine cover the lower hills toward the Coosa River and the adjacent deposits of sands and gravels of the valley from Renfroe to Kymulga and to the banks of the Coosa Kiver. A similar timber belt follows the drifted deposits from (Jadsden, Etc)wall County, through Cherokee County and for a short distance beyond the Alabama and Georgia State line. The timber resources of these forests in the Imsin of Coosa River have furnished the sup- plies for an active lumber industry during the last twenty live years. They are, however, rapidly becoming exhausted. Wherever a richer and deeper soil covers the heights, the slopes of the mountains, and the lower hills, deciduous trees predominate, though rarely the shortleaf pine makes its appearance. The deciduous forests of these metamorphie mountains and Coosa hills differ only slightly from the xerophile forests of the same character in other divisions of the mountain region. Notable is the greater scarcity of tulip and cucumber trees, shagbark and pale-leaf hickory, elins, and lindens, which abound in other parts. On the rocky heights above !>00 to 1,000 feet the following prevail: Qurmitt prhtu# DRY FORESTS. 61 The chestnut, originally one of the most frequent trees of these for- ests, is ut present rarely found in perfection. The older trees mostly show signs of decay, and the seedlings, as well as the coppice growth proceeding from the stump, are more or less stunted. It is asserted by the old settlers that this tree is dying out all over the mountain-region, where at the beginning of the second half of the century it was still found abundant and in j>erfection. Wild cherry {l*nuutx xerotlna) is only found here and there in the richest spots, and red plum cuitrr/mna) rarely along the banks of streams.

With the disappearance of the long-leaf pine the deciduous-leaved trees make their appearance, the same which also form largely the tree covering of the lower mountain ridges, with their dry hut more gener- ous soil. The flora becomes more varied and types characteristic of these rooky heights more numerous. On their cliff-bound brow Primus serotlnu- nm-irumtmw makes its appearance. This variety of the wild cherry is at once distinguished from the type l>v its low stature, scarcely exceeding 25 or 30 feet; by the stem, which is somewhat crooked with the bark rough; the wide-spreading slender branches, which are slightly drooping; its broader, thick leaves, with a fine close pubescence beneath, and its rigid horizontally spreading racemes, the berries ripening in August. This tree was first observed in Alabama, in 189*2, on the summit of the Alpine Mountains, near the signal station (1,900 feet), on the same range near Renfroe, nearly 1,000 feet lower, and on the summit of Chehawhaw Mountain, 2,400 feet. On the exposed cliffs forming the escarpment of the last Lmicera flmut, was found, trailing abundantly over the rocks, associated with R ub us mllosus (12. <-ana- donMx authors) and Stiulax -rotund?folia. It is also found on the lower ridges of the Alpine Mountains, near Renfroe, at an elevation of about 1,000 feet, and confined to a few localities on the eastern Alleghenian ranges in South Carolina and Georgia at similar altitudes. Primus injiH-Hiidn, a low, straggling shrub lately described from northwestern Georgia, and VHis hicoh>i\\ or Le Contc\\ grape, are not infrequently met with on Chehawhaw Mountain, as well as on other summits of the liietamorphic region (Alpine Mountains, l,U0O feet) and on the highest of the Coosa hills (Anniston, 1,000 feet). Le Conte's grape is recognized at first sight by the long stems of a bright reddish-brown (rufous) color stretching from rock to rock and over- hanging the cliffs, the leaves sharply lobed, with deep narrow sinuses, i HERBACEOUS FLORA OF FORESTS AND FIELDS. 63 pubescent beneath, the berries in compact rather oval clusters, pur- plish black without bloom, juicy, and sweet, ripening in the latter part of September.

The berries of the last are of the size of a small garden gooseberry, of a shining plum purple, almost black color, juicy and palatable, and eagerly consumed by man and animals. This shrub, from 24 to nearlv 4 feet high, when in bloom is at once recognized by the abundance of its strict!v racemose flowers, and when bending under the burden of its fruit pre- sents a pretty sight. The berries ripen in the latter part of July. It is sparsely distributed over other parts of the mountain region, and occurs also in the Ozark Hills of the same geological formation in southwestern Missouri. Where the floor of the Coosa rests upon the Silurian dolomites and subcarhoniferous limestones, and the same strata form the first terraces of the hills, the soil is highly fertile. The flora is rich in the number of herbaceous species, belonging to many families and partly of cam- pest rian and partly of sylvestrian character, and it stands in strong contrast with the flora of the arid rocky hills.

These flats extend for many miles in the main valley where the impervious Cambrian slates form its lloor. They are for the greater part covered with a low forest of dwarfed trees, black jack, Texan oak, post oak scarcely over ^0 feet high, with equally stunted loblolly\u2014more rarely short-leaf and scrub pines- scattered among them.

O (hdtvnd plant \u2014About. ^5 per cent of the area of this subdivision is farm land more or less subjected to the plow; the rest is under tree covering1. High forests in their original condition prevail on the steep mountains, which are not profitable for tillage, and in valleys remote from the highways of trailic. In the metamorphic area the lower hills and valleys with a warm loamy soil, resulting from the decomposition of the more basic schists and softer shales and augitie or feldspathie gneiss, worn down far beyond their original level, are, of high and lasting fertility and almost entirely under cultivation, which is also to be said of the fertile lands of the Coosa Valley. Over one-half of the tilled lands are devoted to cotton, broad fields of which alternate with smaller ones of Indian corn (Zen ///\u00ab//*), of small grains (mostly oats, wheat, and rye), and forage crops (clover and meadow grasses), with patches of the Chinese sugar cane or sorghum (Soryhnm FKATUBES OF WABKIOE AND COOSA h<tt<tt<r><)\u00ab ground nuts {Anwith hypogaeif)^ and more rarely the Irish potato, presenting a system of diversified farming; like that practiced throughout the mountain region, with the difference that in the richer soils of this subdivision the production of cotton, the staple crop of the South, has assumed far greater proportions. Among the cultivated fruit trees the peach takes the first rank, no other part of the State producing this fruit in greater perfection than the lower metamorphic hills and plains, where also the grape is suc- cessfully cultivated, and is, owing to the drier atmosphere, less liable than elsewhere to the injuries caused by fungoid diseases. Pears and apples are of a thrifty growth all over the mountain region and pro- duce abundant crops of high quality, particularly the latter, in situa- tions on the higher levels. AM) t'LIMATK. This area comprises about 4,500 square miles, including all of Cull- man, Winston, Walker, and Klotiut counties, nearly all of Marshall and Dekalb, and small portions of Ktowah and Cherokee counties, with the detached spurs of the Cumberland Mountains in the north- eastern part of the Tennessee Valley in Jackson County. About three- quarters of this area contains the coal measures, with their drainage level above the Subcarboniferous limestone lands. The extreme southern spurs of the westerly Alleghanian ranges, including the Cumberland Mountains and all of the strata of the lower coal measures and underlying Subcarboniferous rocks, constitute this floral subdivision. It comprises the extensive table-lands drained by the Warrior River and of the coal lield drained by the Coosa River, covering fully three-quarters of the area of the mountain region, and also the valleys with their water level not below TOO or 800 feet above the sea. The lower Carboniferous sandstones and conglomerates form the surface rock of these table-lands. Their surface is furrowed bv the q - narrow beds and deep gorges through which the, numerous tributaries of the main channels of drainage have worn their wav. The soil resulting from the disintegration of the strata is a light, more or less sandy, loam, and where shallow, full of thin rocky fragments. The mean annual temperature on these highlands at their average elevation of from 800 to 1,500 feet is about 55(J F., with a mean of 45\u00b0 for the winter and 75\u00b0for the summer months; average minimum liJ0 in January, and maximum S7 in August, The mean annual precipi- tation amounts to 55 inches; mean for the winter months 18 inches, for the summer months 14 inches. The larger streams forming the 70 PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA, main channels of drainage have cut their bed through to the Subcar- boniferous limestone. The calcareous strata constitute the floor of the wide valleys of erosion by which the diverging ranges are separated and also of their foothills. VKKBTATIOX OK forest of a varied growth of deciduous-leaved trees and evergreen cone bearers originally covered n n this subdivision. On the broad expanse of the table-lands above 1)00 or .1 ,000 feet the tan-bark or mountain oak largely prevails, associated with post oak and Spanish oak, or more rarely with black-jack and black oak, occasionally with scarlet oak, a rare tree in this State; also with mocker nut, pignut hickory, and tine chestnut trees (the latter rap- idly disappearing, having been eagerly sought for on account, of their durable timber for fencings or wantonly destroyed for the nuts), and with white oak (Quercua aJhu) and highland gum {Xt/ssa sylnaft<(/). Among the tree growth of smaller size the sour wood {Oxifth'tult'tnti a/'burntin) is most frequent, here attaining its largest development, not infrequently becoming 40 feet in height and over a foot in diameter; together with dogwood, persimmon, sassafras, and the Southern pale- bark maple {Acer h'UCMh'Mir)* and in localities with a deeper soil, the Northern sugar maple (Anr mwvhtrxw- harhaftmi). tulip tree, box elder {Ac<r j), and angelica tree {Antha .sphmnn). On Sand Mountain, in Culhnan County, where these forests have been more closely inves- tigated, the woodlands support from 25 to 35 timber trees of various species per acre, afl'ording from 5,000 to 0,000 feet 11 M. of merchant- able lumber of all grades, the largest amounts being derived from the Spanish oak and the less valuable black oak {Qu<rcttx crhtfitta). The lumber finds a ready market in the mining districts. Wherever the mountain oak prevails pines are rarely seen. On the ridges of a lower altitude, with a thinner soil, the short-leaf pine {Phwa <rhhu(f(() forms from 20 to 30 per cent of the timber growth, and, together with the loblolly pine {I^hutx taetht), supplies pine lumber, which always finds a ready market. Dense groves of the latter cover the shallow depressions deficient in drainage, which are particularly frequent on the Warrior table-land. On these swales, from a fraction of an acre to several acres in extent, the loblolly pine arrives at its perfection, scarcely surpassed anywhere in its dimensions and in the quality of its timber. The trees average about 2-t inches in diameter, with a height of from 110 to 120 feet, the trunks free of knots for a length of from 45 to To feet and with but a small proportion of sapwood. The scrub pine (J*in as vmjimxmft) is found on the most broken and poorest places at an elevation mostly above 1,200 feet, and is not frequent. XEROPHILE AND MESOPHILE FOREST FLORA. 71 Under the cover of the mostly rather open forest a variety of shrubs contribute to form a dense undergrowth. Blueberries (Vaccimum vtwillan*i J'. xfamhtcHtii} are met with everywhere in the mountain region, and a bushy low form of the common azalea or honeysuckle {Azalea Hud/jftmt), conspicuous by the abundance of its mostly snow- white flowers, borne in close clusters, almost hides the ground. The fringed stuartia {StjMrtiapciitayyna)* mountain holly { Ih.r mimticoht), and its variety (/. montieoia tuollh)^ with soft hairy leaves, extend northerly on the lower of the western Alleghenian ranges to south- eastern Kentucky, western Virginia, and Pennsylvania, and reach their southern limit on Sand Mountain.

In these secluded valleys of the table-land, particularly where they begin to slope almost impercep- tibly toward their southern and southwestern borders, the arboreal growth is of great luxuriance and variety. Besides many of the trees of the uplands, the following are found: Qnerrnn michauxi'i (cow oak). Magnolia umkrrHa (umbrella tree). Fttywt americana (beech). Magnolia acuminala (common cucumber magnolias in these sheltered valleys arrive at their best development, the last having been observed with a trunk fully 20 inches in diameter. In such a valley on the northern border of Winston County, near a branch of the east fork of the Sipsey River, the yellow-flowered magnolia {May nolia acumhmta cor data), first described as a distinct species1 by Michaux the elder, was discovered by the writer in 1882. Since the original discovery of this rare and beautiful tree by this great investigator of the trees of eastern North America, on the banks of the upper waters of the Savannah River, the range of its distribution had remained obscure. It can now be said, however, to extend from upper South Carolina and the upper moun- tain region of Georgia to northwestern Alabama. Here this tree has been observed as large as a full-grown common cucumber tree, of which species Professor Sargent regards it as a variety. When unfolding under full exposure to the sun, the flowers are from a dingy canary to a golden yellow color, but are of a greenish tint when opening under the shade of the dense foliage. In the shape and size of the mature leaves the vellow-iiowered variety can scarcely be * i distinguished from the typical form; it is only in the foliage of the young vigorous shoots that the heart-shaped form of the leaves is observed. Entering near the same valley the cliff-bound channel of the Sipsey fork, one finds to his surprise the rocky defile shaded by groves of stately hemlock (7xuga canadeim#). This inhabitant of the coniferous forests of northern regions extends southward along the highest sum- mits of the Appalachian ranges to Georgia and northwestern Ala- bama, where it follows this mountain torrent for a distance of about 10 miles, nearly to the falls of Clear Creek, in Winston County, there reaching its southern limit. In this valley the hemlock is accompanied by the sweet or cherry birch, BeUda lenta, at home in the same northern life zone.

Trieho- marie* peter* i the tiniest of this order in the United States, and con- fined to northern Alabama, is at home in these rock houses, and thence it was first brought to light by Judge T. M. Peters, who discovered it on the banks of the head waters of Sipsey River. The filiform hori- zontal rhizomes are interwoven into dense patches, their fronds of dark green scarcely an inch high, somewhat resembling the thallus of a large liverwort. This fern was subsequently found in a similar locality on the western edge of the table-land by Prof. E. A. Smith, D 1^7 and later by the writer on its eastern border at the falls of Black Creek, in Etowah County. Iricfamuine* ntdietmx is also a frequent inhabitant of these rock houses, being found on wet, deeply shaded, rocky walls northward to the Cumberland Mountains of Kentucky. The long creeping rootstock of this beautiful fern, adhering firmly to the rock, decorates the roof and walls of these recesses. Aaplrnhun triehoManes, with its fronds of brightest green, ami the thallus of a large liverwort (Dumortiera sp.) are the frequent companions of the above. Of plants of higher orders only a few have been observed in these cavities.

The summit of Lookout Mountain spreads out to a wide table-land of the same character as the plateau of the Warrior coal field, and ter- minates suddenly in the precipitous escarpment abutting upon the Tennessee River known as the most prominent landmark in the Ten- nessee basin. Near Men tone, Little River, a pretty stream which follows the southern extension of this table-land, leaps over a ledge into its narrow channel, some 125 feet below. By reason of a rainfall more copious than in other sections of the mountain region (64.4 inches), and toward its northern extremity of a generally deeper and fresher soil, this mountain was recently covered with a fine hard-wood forest, chieflv of oaks, and was noted for the abundance of white oak timber 4- (tywrrtf* alba) and tan-bark oak; but this timber wealth is now almost exhausted. On its flanks the black locust (Iiohinia pmud<(cacia) is found, one of the few localities in Alabama where it can be considered to be indigenous. The short-leaf pine is rarely met with on these heights. The scrub pine is more frequent, reaching its best develop- ment on rocky benches and declivities with a scanty covering of soil. On the brow of this mountain, and particularly along the low, damp banks of Little River, there occurs a strong mingling of types that arc1 at home in the Alleghenian area of the adjoining States and of North Carolina with plants of the lower ranges within the Carolinian area, ifivinsr rise to a varied flora, the like of which has not been ~ i~i f observed in any other part of the mountain region of Alabama. When the low elevation of this extremely limited spot is considered (not quite 2,000 feet above the sea), the suffusion of types from different life zones admits of no explanation on the ground of climate or local influences controlling plant distribution, but points clearly to a disjunc- tion of floral conditions due to geological changes. Among the woody plants peculiar to the Alleghenian area, Rhododendron catawbieme 78 PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA is the most prominent. In the beginning of summer, when covered with the profu.se clusters of its purple or lilac flowers, this shrub, from ft to 10 feet in height, massed in dense thickets along the banks of Little River, forms one of the most attractive sights. The home of this shrub is ascribed to the highest crests of the southern chains of the mountains from western Virginia to Roan Mountain, on the border of North Carolina and Tennessee, at an altitude of f!,ooo feet. I t has, however, been found, by Mr. Small, at a much lower elevation on Table Mountain. At its extreme southern limit in Alabama it is asso- ciated with the Azulrd arhntweeibs and Kaiuihi Of other shrubs Viburnum (Xtxxinoidi'x^ extending to the Canadian zone, is abund- ant on the banks of this stream.

With these AHeghenian shrubs occur a host of other species, which are at home on the southern extremity of the lower ranges within the Carolinian area, and are more or less frequent throughout our mountain region.

The tiny At'faaria bra-ifo! ia, known from a few localities in upper Georgia and the Cumberland Mountains of Tennessee, roots in crevices of rocks among the dark-green cushions fleshy perennial with rose-purple flowers adorning exposed rocks in the mountains north- ward to Pennsylvania. On the exposed rocks close to the edge and above the falls of Little River dense tufts of filiform leaves produced by a many-branched rootstock deeply sunk in the crevices attract the attention. Specimens of this plant in flower obtained in September proved to be Cltotafrophora riiyntn (Bigelovia Nutt). The identity of our plant with NuttnlTs .specimens is, however, not free from doubt. In the type collected by Nuttall in lower New Jersey and preserved in the Herbarium of the Academy of Sciences at Philadelphia the radical leaves, which furnish the decisive character, are wanting; furthermore, the similarity to I'luthamin' (/ramint'folia ascribed by Nuttall to his type is not recognized in our plant. The, locality quoted by Nuttall is also doubtful, his plant having never been found afterwards, although the ground has been closely investigated by later botanists. Under the umbrageous cover of the high forest on the upper flanks of the mountain, in the deep soil, rich in humus, tall umbelliferous herbs are conspicuous, among which are Lifjusticma mwultniw, frequent throughout the, mountains northward to Pennsylvania, Thaxpium pia- aafifiduitt, and Tha^piam hurhiaotl\u00bb\\ which extends north to the Ohio Valley.

Cultural jtla/tf association.*. Scarcely :\u00a30 per cent of the area of the table-lands is reduced to a state of cultivation; the rest consists of more or less devastated woodlands and of high forests, which, how- ever, near the settlements and highways of commerce are largely stripped of merchantable timber and are suffering from the inroads of fire and cattle. Scarcely more than a quarter of a century ago, before these table- 80 PLANT LIFE OK ALABAMA. lands were made, easily accessible to the immigrant by the great trunk lines leading* from the centers of population in the North to the Gulf coast, they were but sparsely inhabited. The earlier settlers who had squatted upon them depended for their support more on the chase than upon the cultivation of a soil which was looked upon as too poor to afford an adequate return. This, however, has all been changed by the influx of a population which was attracted by the mild and salubrious climate, and which, coming with the determination to establish its home here, has succeeded in conquering the unpromising soil and developed its possibilities. With the rapid increase in population these lands have come much into demand, and under rational management almost every crop raised in the Northern States can be successfully grown on these table-lands bv the side of cotton. The meadow grasses of the North, with red clover arid similar for- age plants, do well here. Much attention is given t'o the production of breadstuff's, chiefly corn, to which the greater part of the arable land is devoted. Small grains, as wheat and rye, supply a part of the home demand. Irish and sweet potatoes are profitable summer crops, and nearly all of the root crops and vegetables grown in the, temperate zone are produced here in abundance and perfection. Of small fruits, the strawberry has been found highly profitable, usually being har- vested before thn end of April, This fruit finds a ready sale in the distant northern markets. Orchards of fruit trees on a lame scale do not yet exist, although apples, pears, and peaches are successfully grown. The cultivation of the grape was given great attention by the earlier of the German immigrants until the appearance of a fun- gous disease proved a great drawback. But with the successful employment of remedies to subdue this disease viticulture, particu- larly of grapes for table use, has received a new impetus. liKUIOK OF TIIK TJiKNESSE K HIV Kit VALLEY.

The most distinctive feature of the vegetation of the Tennessee Valley consists in decid- uous forests, generally of a me\u00abophile composition, with decidedly northern types prevailing, and containing species in common with the Carolinian area in the Ohio Vallev which are not found in anv other * \u00bb piirt ol Alabama.

The climate of the valley is somewhat extreme. According to the observations of the United States Weather Service at Huntsville (altitude 050 feet), made during a period of fourteen years, the mean annual temperature is 59.9\u00b0 F.; for the winter, 41\u00b0; spring, 59.9\u00b0; summer, 75\u00b0, and for the fall, 59.7 .

On these rugged grounds the red cedar (Juniperu* wrginiana) predomi- nates, but a few other trees gain a foothold. Among thom is the blue ash {Fraxhim qmdramjuiata), a tine timber tree of the Alleghenian area, which reaches its southern limit here, where it is of stunted growth, being rarely more than a tree of medium size. A peculiar varietal form of the white ash mner-lcatia mtrtissii) is not infrequently found with the last. It is readily distinguished by its low habit of growth, almost always beginning to branch below a height of 8 to 12 feet, the spreading branches somewhat drooping, the foliage pale, and the fruit smaller. In this locality the seeds have the embryo well developed. This tree has also been found by Curtiss in the cal- careous hills of Eufaula, on the eastern border of the State, and is apparently not rare in the cedar brakes of central and southeastern Tennessee. 1 P.

Mell, Climatology of Alabama, bulletin 18, Alabama 'Experiment Station, new series, 1890, p. 23. 15894 6 82 PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA On the rugged foothills and mountain slopes, and particularly on the broad, barren, limestone flats of the uplands i n the eastern part of the valley north and east of the Tennessee River the red cedar forms extensive woods, of pure growth, interrupted only by bare openings where the rocky ground scarcely affords a foothold to shrub or herb. The trees in the cedar glades or cedar brakes arc closely set and attain a height of from 50 to 75 feet, the trunk from 15 to rarely 24 inches in diameter, breast-high, frequently deeply ridged toward the base, knotty, and with the crown from 30 to 50 feet or more above the ground. Under these severe soil conditions the growth of the trees is exceed- ingly slow, particularly during the later stages of life. By counting the annual rings trees of the dimensions mentioned were found to be from 140 to 175 years old. Large supplies of the valuable timber of the cedar, used for piling and for telegraph and telephone poles, are drawn every year from the cedar glades. On the gentler slopes with a deeper soil covering, and in the narrow valleys with a damp and rich soil, red cedar occurs scattered among the hard woods and here reaches its greatest perfection. The trunk is smooth from the base and free from knots and limbs for the greater part of its height; the wood is straight-grained, soft, and easily worked, and possesses all the quali- ties for which it is so eagerly sought in the manufacture of pencil casings and the best qualities of hollow ware. Not long since this tree was abundant in the narrow valleys and rich coves south of the Ten- fes nessee River, but these resources are now becoming rapidly exhausted. On the sunny exposures, in the openings and borders of the forest which covers the calcareous hills, where the soil is deeper, a variety of xerophile trees of small size and of shrubs of the lower belt of the Carolinian area are found mingled with the associations are naturally, in the main, of xerophile character. On the exposed rocky flats tiny cruciferous winter annuals till every crevice. Leaoen- worthm a urea, L. and L. tonthwt, the first harbingers of spring, arc followed by Draba ramllnkina and IK hmchycarpa. With the advent of warmer all herbaceous vegetation withers on these arid cedar glades, which then continue to present the aspect of absolute barrens. On the rocky banks and shelves of the sunny hillsides a varied array of characteristic herbs makes its flowery display.

West of the spurs of the Cumberland highlands isolated knolls rise above the wide river plain with its seemingly interminable fields of cotton, corn, and small grain. These hillocks, of a siliceous limestone which has resisted erosion, support with their scanty covering of soil a stunted growth of chinquapin oak [Quercm acumimita)* shrubs common on dry calcareous soil, and are frequently destitute of large trees. The plants which find a refuge in these localities form an interesting combination of xerophile, campes- trian, and sylvan associations.

Tlioir summits, spreading into tables-lands of comparatively limited extent, support a more varied and heavier tree growth than the table-lands of the Warrior Inisin, differing chiefly by the total absence of pines and the appearance of species common also to the forests of the Ohio Vallev, and as vet not observed in other * * parts of the State. Oaks form the predominating forest growth of these highlands- -white oak, mountain oak, and tine black oak. As observed on Monte Sano and the adjoining ridges, the typical sugar maple (Acer wrcc/tarum) of the North is not rarely met with on the summit and the highest thinks in the richest spots. Its variety {Acer mcvhfrum barbatutu) with smaller and sharper-lobed leaves, is more frequent and is widely diffused over the rocky hills which extend south- ward to the tertiary ridges of the Upper Division of the coast pine belt, associated with the cucumber tree, silver-leaf linden {Tilio lutero- ph[flla), and sweet buckeye {Awevhi* <><iandro^). A group of fine trees of this last species, which is rare in Alabama, was observed on a ter- race of rich soil a short distance below the brow of Monte Sano. The trees measured from 25 to 30 inches in diameter and from 75 to 85 feet in height. This truly Alleghenian type, extending from the head- waters of the Ohio River in Pennsylvania along the mountains to the northwestern corner of Georgia, finds its southern limit at this point. The valleys skirting the detached spurs of the Cumberland Moun- tains are for the greater part still covered with the original forest, which is practically untouched bv the ax. Jt can be said that a consid- erable portion of the most valuable hardwood timber found in the State is hidden in these secluded valleys\u2014as, for example, in the valley of the Paint rock River. It is stated that in this valley, of about 35 miles in length, the tulip tree or yellow poplar (Lirt'odendnm tulipifera) abounds in its largest dimensions, with white oak, linden, white ash, large sassafras, and black walnut, and with red cedar of superior qual- ity occupying the damp rocky recesses. The ridges of Subcarboniferous limestone rarely exceed an elevation of 1,200 feet. Their tree growth is the same as that of the forests which cover the gentler slopes of the limestone ledges cropping out beneath the sandstones which cap the summit of the higher ranges. On the flanks, with a deeper soil covering, the tulip tree becomes more frequent among the oaks, associated with the maples mentioned, and, more rarely, with white ash and shell-bark hickory (11 worm ovaf.a). Black walnut {Juglans nigra) and wild cherry {Prmi >/.s wrotina) are but rarely found even on the richest spots. Fetid buckeye {Aexeuhw gla- bra) is of rather rare occurrence on the more exposed slopes of the cal- careous hills, and red cedar is mingled with the hard-wood trees. Of the trees of smaller size, the American smoke tree (Cothvm cotinoides) makes its appearance on the calcareous summits and upon the shelves MESOPHILE ARBOREAL AND HERBACEOUS FLORA. 85 where the sandstones overlie the calcareous rocks on the flanks of the higher mountains. This highly ornamental tree, one of the rarest of the Atlantic forests, is confined in the State to the mountains of Madison County, where it attains a height of from 30 to 50 feet, with a diameter of from 8 to lsJ inches. The American smoke tree was first discovered by Nuttall on the limestone cliffs bordering Grand River, near the northeastern limit of Indian Territory. It was subse- quently found in Alabama by Buckley, and has also been detected as far west as the Medina Valley, in western Texas. Having disap- peared from the locality where it was first discovered, and subsequent to its discovery in Alabama not having been seen by any botanist, the tree remained in obscurity for the next forty years, until it was again brought to light by the writer in 1881. Later it was found by Mr. Bush1 in southwestern Missouri, and since then Professor Tre- lease has found it in several localities in the Ozark Hills of the same region. Being in the Tennessee Valley exposed to a temperature falling not rarely nearly to zero, this tree will prove hardy in almost every locality where the cultivation of its European relative is possi- ble. In its native location it is readily reproduced by sprouts from the stump, almost all of the vigorous coppice growths which it forms\u2014for instance, the one observed on the Gurley place (near Gurlev)\u2014being of this origin. Red plum caiiadsmxix), with seedlings of the red cedar, form the bulk of the undergrowth of the high forests, and coral-berry and shrubby St. John\\s wort (Ilyperi- cant jyrolifieum) the covering of the ground. MempMU herlxweoux plant uwHuatlonx.\u2014The herbaceous flora on these forest-clad heights is represented chiefly by mesophile plant associations, which seek the shelter of the forest, or its borders and more or less shady openings.

The dense, tree cover consists chieflv of cow oak, Texas oak, willow oak, Spanish oak, and more sparingly of mocker- nut hickory, beech, and white ash, C. xpathulata), common in damp fresh soils, as undergrowth. The cow oak abounds in the bottoms along the .streams in the per- fection of its growth, trees from 80 to 40 inches in diameter not being rare. Three trees felled, representative of the average, size, of this valuable hardwood timber, showed the following dimensions: fKmeusiowi am! utjr. lljlJ'^hS) 2 It 3S W 2t> Length of % *2S0 -\"20 177 The Texas oak or Southern red oak, the frequent companion of the above, is often found from to 3 feet in diameter and from 80 to 100 feet in height, dimensions attained at an age of from 150 to 175 years. The timber of the Southern red oak is considered little inferior to that of the white oak. White ash (I'hrximis anterlcand) is found scattered throughout the forest, particularly along the base of the declivities bordering the low- lands. Trees from to 3 feet in diameter have been observed in the valleys, as well as occasionally in other localities, extending to the border of the Louisianian area. Not being of gregarious habit, this tree is not abundant in any locality. The benches of the Mountain Limestone which form the terraces of the wide fertile coves surrounding the head waters of the streams named are covered by a deep fresh soil rich in humus, productive of an excellent timber growth. On these terraces oaks predominate, and, above all, the white oak (in this region called ridge white oak to distinguish it from the swamp white oak or cow oak), together with FORESTS AND HERBACEOUS FLOEA OF LOWLANDS 87 post oak, Southern shagbark hickory (ITicorm carolinae-septentrio- nalis), black oak, Spanish oak, and more rarely black walnut, the last becoming scarce wherever it is accessible. On these bench lands the white oak takes the place of the cow oak. There can be little doubt that the largest supplies of white oak timber in the State are preserved in these coves of the Tennessee Valley. The full-grown trees average from 2 to 3 feet in diameter.

The Southern shellbark or shagbark hickory is also abundant in these coves, and large quantities of this timber are annually shipped to the manufacturing centers North and South. The saplings of this tree form the greater part of the undergrowth in the more open forest. The Spanish oak (Querctis digltata {Q. falcata Michx.)) is at its best where the terraces merge into the lowland. Its sturdy trunk aver- ages from 2 to 3 feet in diameter, with a total height of from 9(> to 100 feet, affording clear sticks of timber 36 to 48 feet long. The age of such trees of full growth varies between 135 and 175 years. The willow oak (Quereunpkdlos) is most abundant in wet, undrained flats of an impervious soil. In Alabama it is rarely found outside of this valley, but extends sparingly southward to the Central Prairie region. This oak seldom exceeds 80 feet in height, with an average diameter breast high of 25 inches, and spreads its massive limbs at a height of from 30 to sometimes 40 feet from the ground. The large amount of hardwood lumber sawn at the mills on the banks of the Tennessee River (chiefly at Decatur) and at the numerous smaller factories along the Memphis and Charleston Railroad exhibits the rapid development of the industries depending upon the timber wealth of the Tennessee Valley.

VEGETATION OF THE JJAKRENH AND RIVER HTLU3. In the northern part of the Tennessee Valley and west of the out- lying spurs of the Cumberland Mountains rises an undulating plain from 200 to 300 feet above the river level, broken by the deep narrow channels of the numerous tributaries of the river which take their rise in the 44Highland Rim\" of Tennessee. The soil is a sandy com- pact loam of whitish color, destitute of lime and vegetable matter and deficient in underdrainage, being underlaid by an impervious clay or hardpan. This plain is covered with an open forest of the upland oaks, which are common in the mountain region, black jack prevailing, accompanied by mockernut hickory. The trees are all of stunted growth, scarcely above medium size, with an undergrowth of dogwood, black haw, sour wood, and sumach. A low willow (Salix tristis) covers acres of the level expanse, imparting by the ashy hue of its foliage a peculiar aspect to the low, bushy, deciduous forest. The herbaceous flora of these barrens exhibits the same want of variety as their woody growth. As noticed on a single visit to the barrens between the forks of Cypress and Shoal creeks, in Lauderdale County, in the early part of June, the paucity of the glumaceous plant formations was perennials, indicating a cold, ill-drained, rather poor soil. The following were among the herbaceous plants observed, the first being exposed declivities, which admit of ready surface drainage, the same associations of xerophile herbs prevail which inhabit similar localities all over the State, mostly Leguminosae, con- striata), which overruns the ground around dwellings, afford the only pasturage to live stock. On their descent to the river plain the channels of the water courses intersecting the barrens widen and the highland becomes divided by broader valleys into ridges, which encroach more or lews upon the banks of the Tennessee River. These hills are mostly steep and densely wooded. With the dip of these strata toward the south the soil becomes looser and calcareous and the vegetation more luxuriant. The timber growth is of great diversity and of fair quality. White FLORAL REGION OF LOWER HILL COUNTRY. 89 oak, post oak, and Spanish oak are most frequent, with chestnut, bass- wood, and tulip trees. As has been observed, the trees on these hills are of rather rank growth. Of smaller trees and shrubs, forming the dense copses and bordering the high forest, small-leaf sugar maple, redbud, dogwood, and hazelnut prevail. Box elder, winged elm, wil- low, with azaleas, whortleberries, farkleberrv, and the poison laurel (Kaluiia latifolia) shade the rocky banks of the swift mountain streams. The Carolina silverbell tree {Mohrodmdrmi {Halesia) caro- li/m/ii) also makes its appearance here, a strictly southern Appalachian type, frequently met with from the lower ranges of southwestern Virginia, along the mountains, to the lower hills in Alabama. CULTURAL PLANT FORMATION'S. Of the 4,500 square miles embraced within the region of the Tennes- see Valley about 2,430 belong to the Valley proper, their red soil resting upon the more or less siliceous limestones of the subcarbonifer- ous strata. Being highly productive, these lands arc mostly cleared and under cultivation. Mainly in the hands of small owners, they are under a high state of cultivation, the eifort being directed to the devel- opment of all the possibilities of the farm. Hence, proper attention is given to the raising of every kind of live stock and the cultivation of all the crops needed on the farm for the sustenance of man and beast. Fields of corn and small grain alternate with fields of cotton, in which crop from 12 to 15 per cent of the whole area of the valley is planted. The fresh green of the meadow and the clover field greet the eye, and, as in the gardens and orchards of the Warrior table-land, all the vegeta- bles, root crops, forage plants, and a large part of the fruits of the temperate zones of the globe can be successfully grown in this valley. Peaches, pears, and apples are raised in perfection on the hills, and for the cultivation of the grape no other section of the State appears to be so well adapted. Red wines of high quality can be produced on the sunny slopes of the calcareous hills. What has been said of the agricultural plant formations of this valley applies generally to the Coosa Valley proper and to the smaller outlviner vallevs from the foot of Lookout Mountain westward to f ft Blount's Valley. REGION OF THE LOWER HILL. COUNTRY. The line of demarcation between the mountain region and this part of the Carolinian area can not be distinctly drawn. South and south- west, where the strata of the same geological formation slope gradually away from the high table-land to the hills which rise from a lower water level, these regions overlap each other and the changes in the character of their flora are difficult to discern. Not less difficult is it to recognize their border line toward the south and southeast along 90 PLANT LIKE OF ALABAMA. the limit of the metamorphic hills. The change in the character of the flora in this ill-defined region is indicated by the absence of or decrease in the, number of species possessed in common with the north- ern Alleghanies and the Ohio Valley and the appearance of Southern forms which never or but rarel v occur in the mountain region. These *. D hills have a number of species in common with the northern extension of the Carolinian area which find their southern limit in this region and impart to its flora a northern aspect. For this reason it might botaiiically be regarded as a subdivision of the mountain region of which these lower hills in their descent to the Coastal plain form the last terrace and of which stratigraphically they are an integral part. (iKAVBLLY HILLS OF HIIOUT-LEAK PIKE AN1) HARDWOOD TREES. On the western descent of the Warrior table-land the coal measures disappear under heavy deposits of sand and gravels of a more recent formation, through which the water courses have cut their beds, result- ing in the formation of rounded hills from 250 to a little over 300 feet high down to low undulating ridges, of considerable length and width between the hills. This belt of drifted deposits extending along the western border of the State across the Tennessee River forms the divide between the waters of the Tombigbee River and the Warrior basin, and is the northern extension of the central belt of drifted deposits which separates the older from the recent geological forma- tions. It embraces nearly all of Colbert, parts of Franklin and Marion, all of Lamar, the western section of Fayette and Piekens, and the northwestern part of Tuscaloosa counties. Notwithstanding the dif- ferences in its geological condition, this subdivision can not well be separated botanically from the floral region under consideration. This upland area is at once distinguished by the frequency of the short leaf pine among the hardwood trees, mostly upland oaks and hickories, the pine having originally constituted about one-half of the tree growth. This proportion has, however, during later years, been greatly reduced, and the, supply of pine timber is at present nearly exhausted. The forest presents almost the same aspect as that found on the table lands at or below the elevation of about 800 feet above the sea, which have a similar light and dry soil. These gravelly hills, being closely connected with the Tennessee Val- ley and with the mountain region through the numerous prongs of the, western edge of the Warrior table land intersecting this subdivision, its herbaceous flora, mostly of the xerophile class, presents no peculiar characteristics. COAL MEASURES OP TUB CAHABA VALLEY AND WARRIOR HABIN. Crossing the southern rim of the Warrior coal basin and the Cahaba coal field an extremely hilly area is entered, most rugged along its southern borders. It comprises the eastern part of Marion and Fay- FORESTS OF CAHABA VALLKY AfTD WARRIOR BASIN 91 ette counties, the lower half of Winston, the southern edge of Call- man mid much of Blount, all of Walker and Jefferson, a great part of Tusealoosa. the northern border of Bibb, and portions of Shelby and St. Clair counties. The hills within this region rarely exceed <>00 feet above sea level. The soil resulting1 from the disintegration of coal-bearing shales, frequently rocky and shallow, is poor and dry. X< i'ophilr_ ftn'rxU.\u2014The xerophile forests consist largely of decidu- ous trees of inferior size. These are upland oaks of the black and red oak group, with stunted post oak, more rarely chinquapin oak (Qtwem acuwhuiUi) of a pale-leaf medium size, lately distin- guished, occurring from Missouri.

On the outcrops of the subcarboniferous limestone the chestnut oak {Qvet'cux <teninin<tt<i)y here in its best development, is not infrequent, and Texas white oak hrrrifnixf). known commonly as pin oak, finds its northern limit on the calcareous hills near the Mulberry Fork of the Warrior River, in Blount Count v. 7 * On the cliffs of sandstone which form the eastern brink of the Black Warrior River, a short distance above the city of Tusealoosa, a mono- typical shrub, Nevlmut ulabmm'/us/.s, finds its only home. The numer- ous slender wand-like stems bear abundant white apetalous flowers in the earliest days of spring, when the leaves begin to appear. This unique shrub belongs to the Asiatic element of Alabama's flora, and is strictlv confined to the above localitv. It was discovered bv the Rev, R. A. Nevius and Professor Wvinan in 1K5X. In Tusealoosa Countv, between North liiver and the Black Warrior t. ~ River, a tract of longleaf pine extends to the hanks of Yellow Creek near Oregonia, and in the northern part of Walker County a dense forest of this pine covers an isolated urea of sand and pebbles extend- ing over several townships, and is in its timber growth not surpassed by the best pine lands, further south. South Lowell, Walker County, 450 feet above the sea, is near the center of this pine forest. The upland willow oak or blue jack, common in the lower Coast Pine belt, in this isolated pine forest reaches its most northern station. The herbaceous flora presents the same associations of xerophile grasses, Leguimnosae, and Compositae. common in the maritime belts of long- leaf pine. Noteworthy is I lei at nth it* a rare plant widely diffused from the prairies in southern Missouri and Arkansas to Ten- nessee and upper Georgia, and known in Alabama also from another locality, viz, the pine forests near Gadsden, Etowali County. 92 PLANT LIFE OP ALABAMA Mi'wphilc fiyresU.\u2014The forests of the fertile valleys and the inclosing hillsides of a somewhat fertile soil are heavily timbered. The South- ern haekberry (Celtis mtsishftlppiemi^)^ honey locust, and large, sweet or red gum {lAquahimbar dyraciflua), become more frequent among the abundant cow oak, Southern red oak, Spanish oak, and the more scattered tulip trees, white ash, and hickories of the lowlands, and the scarce black walnut- The timber growth on the larger tributaries of the Warrior, particularly the Mulberry fork and its numerous branches (Cane, Lost, Wolf, and others) crossed by the writer, has been but slightly encroached upon. The loblolly pine is confined to the narrow bottoms along the banks of the streams. In the semiswampy bottom of the Luxapallila, of a cold, somewhat sandy, and compact soil, this pine is found of large dimensions, scattered among beech, sweet gum, willow oak, cow oak, water oak, and laurel oak, the last two now becoming more frequent than observed farther north. The hillsides with a fresh soil and the openings in these forests are in the spring and early sum- mer adorned by the flowers of the umbrella tree {Magnolm t/ripetala), Eraser magnolia and large-leaf magnolia{M. macrophyHa), by the bloom of the Carolina silverbell, and bv the profusion of the delicate white-flowered spikes of the small-flowered buckeye {Awrultw parmfiora) and the dense clusters of Hydrangea quercifoUa, known as scvenbark, both of these shrubs, strictly southern Appalachian, extending along the mountains to South Carolina and southwestern Virginia, respectively, and southward to the Tertiary hills. The importance, of the forests of the \"Hill Country of Alabama,\" the great mineral region of the State, in connection with the wealth hidden in the ground beneath them, can not be too highly appreciated. The mining of every ton of coal requires half a cubic foot of timber, To this demand of the miner must be added the large drafts upon these forests for charcoal and for lumber, which are augmenting with the rapid increase of the population at the centers of mining and other industries. IfcrlHicef/m plant flwoclatiimx.- The herbaceous flora of the Lower Hills, with its associations of species common on the table-lands and in the higher valleys of the mountain region, mingling with forms more or less frequent in the Louisianian area, differs but slightly in its general character from the similarly mixed flora of the southern edge of the metamorphic region. Characteristic, however, is the occurrence of a few endemic types confined to a single locality in this region and of others of a peculiarly local distribution rarely found elsewhere in the Carolinian and Louisianian areas. Nemuain a(ahm\u00bb- etHfi* has already been mentioned as a monotype endemic to this region. To this is to be added Crotf.m alabamena^ presently to be further discussed.

A continuation the AHeghanian spurs pene- trate the Central Pine belt in Bibb County, there reduced to low, short ridges. Their outcrops, consisting of the oldest Silurian sandstones and cherts and Subcarboniferous limestones, give rise on this narrow area to a diversity of soil conditions, and hence their plant associa- tions, generally of xerophile character, present a remarkable variety. Among the arboreal vegetation Aver jtoridannnt is found. This maple, below medium size, occurs also in middle Florida and on the Tertiary hills in the upper division of the coast pine belt. It is here for the first time encountered by one coming from the northern part of the State. After a long series of years of doubt concerning the existence of Qwreux hreviloba in Alabama, it was found in this region by the writer on the limestone hills lining the Little Cahaba River in 188*2, more than fortv vears after it was first credited to the State bv *j Buckley, who also discovered this tree subsequently in southern Texas.

Descending from the hills of the older (Paleozoic) formations, con- sisting of the extreme southern members of the Appalachian mountain system, the Austroriparian or Louisianiun area of the Lower Austral life zone is reached. This urea within the State is thus coterminous with the vast Coastal plain. The elevation of this plain scarcely exceeds at any point 350 feet above sea level, and in its gradual decline to the Gulf shore presents great uniformity in its topography. Undis- turbed by local influences due to great differences in elevation, the distribution of heat here follows the lines of latitude. In consequence the climate does not run to extremes.

It has been shown that many of the plants frequent throughout the Carolinian area and types characteristic of the southern exposures of the Alleghany Mountains find their southern limit of vegetation on the hills bordering upon the coastal plain. A similar limitation has also been pointed out for a number of shrubs and trees, clearly marking the border line between the lTpper and Lower Austral life zones. This zonal border, marked bv trees strictlv confined to the Louisianian I -1 area of the Lower Austral zone throughout its extent from east to west, not only in Alabama, but from the Atlantic coast to the eastern border of the Southwestern arid plains, deviates but slightly from the line of latitude 3^\u00b0 80', and is clearly indicated by the northwestern limit of the following species: Magnolia Joeftda (Southern spruce pint1). The evergreens, consisting of pines on the light siliceous soils and of broad-leaved species in the mesophile forest, predominate largely over the deciduous forest growth, and the frequency of types identical with tropical forms, or closely allied to them, impress upon the vege- tation of this life area the character of the subtropical regions.

PhyxuigfttpkU'itl ft>atuFt>x.- A belt of sands and pebbles crosses the State almost contrailv in a southeastern and northwestern direction and separates the Paleozoic formation from the more recent sedimentary (Mesozoie) strata. This belt, varying from about 10 to a little over 35 miles in width, extends from Russell County to a xhort distance west of Tusealoosa County, where, with a sudden bend toward the north, it merges into the Lower Hills, which are elad with a mixed forest of short-leaf pine and upland hard-wood trees. Between the water courses the undulating surface frequently spreads out into more or less level table-lands. Xcrophite and >>tmitphU<>,_for<>Mx.\u2014Wherever the sandy loam forming the surface soil becomes deeper, the long-leaf pine is associated with post oak, Spanish oak, black oak, black-jack, pignut, and inockcrnut hickory, and where the more siliceous soil prevails the long-leaf pine alone forms continuous forests of a heavy timber growth, which furnish the supplies demanded by the active lumber industry established along the railroad lines traversing this belt. Entering this region at the northern border, the turkey or barren oak and the blue jack make their appearance and are frequent com- panions of the long-leaf pine of the dry-pine barrens farther south; and of evergreen shrubs and trees, which line the streams throughout the maritime pine belt, the sweet illicium {lllicium -fUrridmium), ti-ti (('Itftoivia humophyliu), and red bay {Perxea Carolina) are here met with.

Belonging FEATURES. This floral region comprises the plain of Cretaceous rocks which crosses the State in a belt from 35 to 45 miles wide, its mean ele- vation above the Gulf of Mexico scarcely exceeding 200 feet. It is inclosed at its northern and at its southern limit between the pine- clad hills, which rise from 150 to 250 feet above the depression of the plain. Rarely perfectly level, the plain rises in broad swells above the sluggish water courses. Westward the water courses of this plain are the tributaries of the Tombigbee and Alabama rivers, and toward the east they empty into the numerous bays which indent the coast of western Florida or into the Chattahoochee River. It covers an area roughly estimated to exceed somewhat 5,000 square miles, embracing all, or nearly all, of Greene, Hale, Dallas, Lowndes, Mont- gomery, Macon, and Bullock counties, and parts of Sumter, Marengo, Perry, Autauga, Pike, and Russell.

Post-oak jrrmries.\u2014 All over the region, particularly on the highest swells, the drifted clayey loams, sands, and pebbles mingle with the soil resulting from the decomposition of the underlying limestone strata, and give rise to light, more or less sandy, loams or heavy cal- careous clay soils, covered with open xerophile forests of Spanish oak, black oak, black jack, post oak, the last predominating, associated with mockernut and pignut hickory. Where the heavy clay soils prevail, destitute of humus, water-soaked during seasons of rain and baking to a hard crust during droughts, these so-called post oak prai- ries have been hut little encroached upon. Under the cover of the brush the gramineous plant formations predominate, while sedge grasses (Cvperaceae) abound in the more shaded and wet situations.

HILL PRAIRIES AND PRAIRIE REGION 99 The ubiquitous bush clovers, Japanese clover, and tick-trefoils in a large measure take possession of the drier and lighter soil in the post oak woods. Where the limestone strata come near to the surface and the soil is not of sufficient depth to support a heavier tree growth, the oaks and hickories give way to copses of small trees and shrubs, among which hawthorns of different species are most abundant. Characteristic (red Pi dm trifoliate (trefoil hop tree).1 These coppices form isolated boskets in the open or skirt the post- oak prairies, and when covered in the spring with the snowy white flowers of hawthorns, plums, and crab apples or adorned in autumn with their lurid red and flaming scarlet fruits, impart to the landscape a peculiar charm, relieving the monotony of the interminable fields of cotton. Ilill prairie*.\u2014On the hills bordering the plain northward and southward and on the highest ridges within the plain, capped like the hills with drifted siliceous deposits, the short-leaf pine mingles with the hard-wood trees, while the longleaf pine makes its appearance on the most abrupt of their summits. Where on these hills the drifted soils have been removed by denudation, the rich black soil of the prairies or calcareous marls prevails, covered either with the white oaks and hickories, or with cedar hammocks. These so-called hill prairies are mostly under cultivation, and the abandoned exhausted fields have been taken possession of by shortleaf and loblolly pine. East of the Alabama River, particularly on the divide between the waters of the Tallapoosa and those of the tributaries of the Chattahoo- chee, Chootawhatchee, and Conecuh rivers, the plain becomes broken into low hills, and the drifted deposits mingle largely with the soils of the rotten limestone. On these hills the timber growth, through the frequent intcrspersion of the shortleaf pine, assumes the same mixed character which prevails in the adjoining upper division of the Maritime pine belt. In the ravines and the narrow valleys the Southern spruce pine {Pinu.s glabra) with magnolias and cucumber trees is of frequent occurrence. ME80PHILK FORESTS. Prairie region..\u2014The term u prairie region,\" applied to this plain, refers less to the timberless tracts which originally formed a small fraction of its area than to the black, calcareous, highly fertile soil of 1 Rarelv found north of the Central Pine belt. 100 PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA these uplands, which, being rich in humus, as a result of the reaction of its calcareous constituents upon vegetable matter, closely resembles the equally productive soil of the western treeless prairies. Before its settlement by whites this region was largely covered by forests of a decidedly mesophile character, mostly of hardwood trees, in some localities mixed with red cedar. On the fertile uplands the forest has been almost entirely removed; the bottoms of the Alabama and Tom- bigbee rivers and their largest tributaries, where subject to overflow, are still heavily timbered with a mesophile growth of cow oak, over- cup oak {Quereux lyrata), laurel oak {Quereux laurifolia), water oak, red or sweet gum\u2014in such perfection as this tree attains only in the Atlantic forests of the lower latitudes\u2014beech, mockernut (Ilimrki alba), and bitter nut hickory (Ilieoria iH inima), all draped with Spanish moss. A tine elm is also frequently met with here of a sturdy growth, often fully 2 feet in diameter, the branchlets covered with corky flat expansions of the bark. Although not seen in Mower or fruit this tree certainly is distinct from the white elm ((rImun amerteana), and is doubtless identical with the Southern white elm lately discovered by Messrs. Sargent and Can by near Iluntsville, and described in the suc- ceeding catalogue. With the rise of the land above overflow tulip trees, linden, mulberry, stately magnolias, hackberry, and red bay {Perse/1 htrhmica) mingle with the trees of the bottom. The diversity of the arboreal vegetation increases further on the broad swells of the uplands with a rich dark soil, as is apparent from the rather scanty remains of their tree covering observed between Un ion town and De- mopolis. On these rich uplands the Texas white oak (Quercm bremloba)^ commonly known in this section as pin oak, is found most frequent and in the same perfection as in the rich bottom lands of southern Texas, rivaling in size the common white oak. This beautiful oak is at once recognized by the diverse shapes of the leaves, which frequently vary on the same tree from oblong-lanceolate and entire to broadly ovate or obovate and obtusely three-Iobed at the apex; and also bv the small fruit. The post oak, in its best-developed state, is frequently associated with the above. Black walnut, frequently mentioned in the records of earlier times, is at present extremely scarce; in fact, as a timber tree it has disappeared from these forests. The pecan {Ilicoriap<'cat>) and nutmeg hickory (Jlicor/a myrixticaeformix) among the oaks throughout the woodlands of this region in the basin of the Alabama and Tom bigbee rivers. There can be no doubt about the pecan being indigenous to this region, although heretofore not regarded as a native of the eastern Gulf region outside of the Mississippi and Yazoo deltas. Groves of full-grown trees, which must have been in existence before the arrival of the first white settlers, arc remembered by very old inhabitants. A few of these landmarks of the original forest growth still survive, surrounded by their offspring TREES AND SHRUBS OF PRAIRIE REGION. 101 of succeeding generations, notably on a plantation near Faunsdale, Dallas County. Generally this tree has disappeared with the oak forest on the fertile lands, and is at present found only in the small groves of oaks saved from destruction to shade the grounds around the dwell- ings of the planters. The nutmeg hickory, when full grown, resembles the shagbark hickory in its pale, shreddy bark, but it is readily dis- tinguished from the latter by the silvery hue of the lower surface of the leaves and the smaller fruit, with a thin epicarp inclosing the per- fectly smooth nut, which simulates the nutmeg in size and shape. By the discovery of the nutmeg hickory in this region, and of its exten- sion into Mississippi, the northern limit of the distribution of this tree from the Atlantic slope in South Carolina to Texas and northern Mexico, following with hardly any deviation, the same parallel of lati- tude, is now clearly established. Of trees of smaller size the pawpaw (Anmina trttoba;), red bud (Oer- cis canademis), Carolina of shrubs the spice bush (Benzoin {Laurm) benzoin), form the undergrowth and frequent the jack (BercJmrnui 'ixthilrilis), ascend the highest trees without visible support below the lofty summits, where these members of the liana formation spread out their branches, and under a fuller exposure to the sun unfold their flowers and ripen their fruit. With these are associated a number of others of the same plant formation, Ampelopsix cor data. Tecoma radkans (trumpet vine). These vigorous woody climbers cover with their festoons the borders of these forests as it were with an impenetrable curtain of green.

The last is a type of the Louisianian area, sparsely distributed from South Carolina to northwestern Louisiana. Nowhere is the poison ivy {Rhus radicam) found of more luxuriant growth and in greater abundance than in the openings of the damp forests. Taking a firm hold in the bark of trees with its innumerable rootlets, the stem creeps up to the top of the highest trunks, which are completely hidden by the long horizontal branches of this creeper when covered with their soft, rich foliage. 102 PLANT LtFE OF ALABAMA. Cedar hammocks.\u2014On the highest swells of the plain where the strata of the rotten limestone are overlaid by lighter loams poorer in humus, deep, and of perfect drainage, forests prevail of a mixed-tree growth, consisting of the following: Frariuus amerivann (white ash). .hudperHx (rod ccilar i. Originally the red cedar formed about 30 per cent of the timber growth. The ground beneath is densely shaded by the (Huuthern privet). The red cedar of these forests is of most vigorous growth, the smooth trunk free of limb for a height of from 30 to 50 feet and from 16 to 20 inches and over in diameter, and less affected bv decay than . fc m in the northern part of the State. These cedar hammocks once formed detached tracts extending over many square miles. At present only a few remnants of them are left, and these are doomed to speedy destruction by the drafts made upon their valuable timber and through the injuries constantly inflicted upon the young growth by live stock. MESOPHILE ITERRAOEOrx I1 LA NT ASSOCIATIONS. Jn the shade of these forests, as observed on the banks of Big Prairie Creek, the herbaceous plant associations are poorly represented by mesophile species more or less common throughout the Carolinian area. Some of the species are: Adicea The Trepacarpm is frequent in eastern Texas, but has heretofore been known in the eastern Gulf States only as a fugitive on ballast in several localities. The Dtwlea has been known from a few localities in Georgia, and especially along the Luxapallila Iliver. near Columbus, Miss., and is abundant in the bottoms of the Mississippi and Yazoo deltas. Cantb't'uh'x.\u2014-The most prominent feature in the vegetation of this region consists of the extensive tracts of cane, arborescent grasses of the bamboo tribe, which prevail throughout the depression of the plain. The large cane (yl randlnaria t/ufcroxprr/tHi) inhabits the alluvial bot- toms more or less submerged for the greater part of the year, and the small or switch cane {^4. tccta) prevails in the open as well as in the HABITS OF THE LARGE AND THE SMALL CANE. 103 forest on the low plains which rise above the water courses and are subject to overflow only at the time of high freshets. So conspicuous was this formation in the western part of the plain that it is called emphatically the \"canebrake region.\" At present a comparatively small representation of the smaller cane remains. It occupied the most fertile lands, and these were claimed for the plow by the earliest settlers. Although the growth was so dense as to be almost impene- trable, it was easily eradicated, being susceptible to the effects of fire. The strips of the large cane which lined the banks of the larger streams subject to frequent overflow have for the most part remained intact. These two species, which resemble each other so closely in habit, differ greatly in their modes of reproduction, a subject of much interest of which but little is as vet known and one which invites the attention of the investigator of the ecological relations of plants, and no less that of the agriculturist, on account of the value of the canes as pasture plants. Arimtlmarhi ircta- rarely exceeds the height of 12 to 15 feet, and the slender culm branched from the base is seldom half an inch in thickness. Early in spring, apparently every three or four years, the paniculate flowers arc, produced on naked radical shoots scarcely exceeding 1H inches in height, while the tall flowerless canes are sent up every season from the long creeping rhizomes. Arundi- nana uiacvostpeMua, from 15 to 30 feet high and frequently an inch and over in diameter, produces the panicles of its flowers in the axils of the branches at long and indefinite intervals of time. It is evident, therefore, that generations may pass by before the spectacle of such a canebrake in bloom is ever witnessed. For example, in the beginning of the summer of 185MJ the inhabitants of Russell County were aston- ished suddenly to find the large canebrakes bending under the burden of their heavy, nutritious grains, which attracted large numbers of birds and beasts. The farmers regarded this as an entirely new plant, and, finding their stock grew fat upon the seed, stored away quanti- ties of it, not only for future feeding, but under the delusion that if sown it would constitute a crop of small grain equal in value to any previously grown. But in the light of experience, it is to be presumed that a period of not less than forty to fifty years has to pass before the propagation of this plant by sexual reproduction takes place. With the maturity of the seed the vitality of the plant is exhausted and the cane decays. In the succeeding season, from the spontaneous stocking of the ground with an abundance of seed, a new crop springs up. The seedlings produce no branches during the first year. These simple sprouts, which are known aw \" mutton cane,\" are tender and sweet and afford the best of pasturage. They arc particularly sought after by bears, which find in the impenetrable density of the canebrake their securest retreats. 104 PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA CAMPEKTRIAN PLANT ASSOCIATIONS, Bald jmuriw.-\u2014The eminences of the lower swells of the plain with the strata of the limestone near the surface and destitute of arboreal growth are called bald prairies. Wherever the soil is not too shallow to be cultivated, these open prairie lands are devoted to the produc- tion of corn, oats, or forage crops, and only the poorest spots remain in the original state. These bald prairies can be regarded as the true home of the original canipestrian flora, which is peculiar to a calcare- ous soil rich in humus and with a sunny exposure. Many of its types are held in common with the plant associations prevalent on the grassy timberless plains of eastern North America. These types have spread all over the cretaceous depression wherever the forest has been removed, and find refuge also on the borders of fields and woods, and in waste places and abandoned grounds. Of grasses the following are most common in the open, except the last two, which prefer and adventive weeds invade cultivated grounds, the last two named ineradicable and seriously injurious grasses are the following species widely distrib- uted in the <\\:ntral Pine belt.

At the base of the hills occur: rare in the State. Aliionia hirmta is at home in the prairies of the West from Minnesota to Texas. SUene ovata is found in the exposed ravines of these hills. It is also found in the Cumberland highlands of Tennessee, and is dis- tributed somewhat widely in the mountains of the Carolina* and Georgia. CULTt'RAI. 1'l.ANT FOKMATIOXS. This region constitutes the great agricultural region of the State, celebrated for its large production of cotton. With the decline in the price of this staple crop during late years greater attention has been given to the growing of breadstuff's and forage crops. Broad fields of Indian corn and oats are seen on every hand; and since an increased interest is taken in the raising of stock, the old fields exhausted by the continuous practice of the one-crop system are- either being con- verted into wide pastures of Bermuda grass (Capriola dactylmi) or, to hasten their recuperation, are planted in white melilot {MelilMw alba), known in these parts as Bokhara clover, which, like red clover, as an ameliorating forage crop for hay and for pasture, has proved of the greatest benefit on the exhausted calcareous prairie lands. In the beginning of the new era in the agriculture of the South, Sorghum kalepmse was extensively raised as a perennial bay crop. After it was 106 PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA. found, however, that in this plant an almost ineradicable pestiferous weed had been introduced, its cultivation was restricted to low, undrained tracts, unfit for other crops. Although peaches, plums, pears, the fig, and grapes succeed on the ridges, the cultivation of these fruits is much neglected, and does not supply even a small part of the home demand. MARITIME TINE REGION, The great belt of long-leaf pine forest, which extends almost without interruption from southeastern Virginia over the coast region of the Atlantic States to the lowlands of the Mississippi River, adjoins on its southern border the Central Prairie belt. ri'PEK DIVISION' OK THE COAST PINK HKI/r OR KBGION OK MIXED TREK GROWTH. Phyaiographical featurew.\u2014In the upper part of this pine belt, from South Carolina to eastern Mississippi, a mixed growth of pine and broad-leaved evergreen trees alternates with helts or rather strips of pure long-leaf pine forest. In Alabama this region of cone-bearing and broad-leaved evergreen and deciduous trees is confined within the limits of the older Tertiary strata, which in this State cover about one- half of the area of the Coast Pine belt, although the beds of drifted sands and gravels of a more recent formation overlie the older rocks in large areas. In its climatic conditions this region differs but slightly from the foregoing. Its floral character is difficult to define. Broadly stated, it consists in the increased frequency of types which are at home in the Louisianian area, and in distinction from regions farther north, of a tree growth in which, though otherwise similar, the long-leaf pine in its highest development predominates. Equally difficult is the estab- lishment of the limits of this floral region. It has been already men- tioned that the tree growth in the eastern part of the Central Prairie region is scarcely to be distinguished from the forest flora of this region. Toward the west the border is more clearly outlined by the hilly uplands of the lowest Tertiary strata rising above the Cretaceous plain. The southern border of this region is frequently overlapped by the pure forests of long-leaf pine of the lower division of the Coast Pine belt, and it can be defined on stratigraphical grounds only by being identified with the lines which mark the most southern outcrops of the underlying Tertiary rocks. Defined on this basis the area in question contains about 9,000 square miles, occupying the following counties or portions of counties: Parts of Sumter; all or nearly all of Choc taw, Clarke, Monroe, Butler, Coneeuh; portions of Covington, Montgomery, Bullock, Barbour, Pike, and nearly all of Coffee, Dale, and Henry. Along its northern border where the ligmtic strata pre- vail the uplands rise to an elevation at the highest of about 400 feet above tide water, spreading out into table-lands of greater or less FORESTS OF UPPER DIVISION OF COAST PINE BELT. 107 width, not rarely interrupted by steep ridges where the lowest Terti- ary strata offered greatest resistance to erosion. The highest ridges are frequently capped with the sands and gravels of the Lafayette formation, which are undercover of the long-leaf pine, as are likewise the rugged hills of flinty clay stones and siliceous rocks of the buhr- stone strata which traverse the central part of this region in a south- easterly and northwesterly direction, sloping toward the east. East of Patsaliga Creek the hills become less prominent, the softer strata of the Eocene Tertiary spread out into undulating table-lands, and the generous brown soil supports the mixed growth of xerophile and mcsophile woody species, evergreen and deciduous, characteristic of the region. Toward the south the surface becomes less broken. East of the Alabama River the drifted deposits form broad table-lands between the streams, occasionally inclosing more or less extensive tracts with the calcareous strata of the Middle Tertiarv for the surface A.- rock, very similar in their soil and vegetation to the post-oak prairies of the preceding region. In Dale County and westward to the State line beds of white sand (Ozark sands) overspread the loamv sands and gravels, rendering the soil arid and sterile. West of the Alabama River, in the southern part of Clarke and Choc taw counties, calcareous strata form the surface rock over large areas identical in their soil conditions and the character of their vege- tation with the isolated tracts farther east just mentioned. Xerophile forests*\u2014The rocky ridges of the Buhrstone, or those capped with the more recent drifted strata, are covered with magnifi- cent forests of long-leaf pine which are nowhere surpassed in their timber wealth within the range of this tree. This applies particularly to the forests which cover the hills between the Alabama and Tom- bigbee rivers. By careful estimates made upon a number of plots, selected at random, the yield of a single acre will vary from 10,000 to 18,000 feet and over of merchantable timber. In these forests, which grow from a deep warm soil consisting of sandy loams, dogwood and black jack form the scanty undergrowth. The rocky crests and most abrupt declivities of the highest of these hills afford but a scanty foot- hold to the pine. The rocky ground is sparingly covered by the fol- lowing shrubs, all of them bushes, except the last, which is a creeper branching pine predominate wherever the older rocks are deeply hidden under the sands and gravels, and where this region passes imperceptibly into the pine uplands of the Lower Division of the Maritime Pine belt. The herbaceous plant associations in these 108 PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA pine forests do not differ from those forming the soil cover in the open pine forests of the adjoining Lower Pine belt. Xerophili herbaceous phmt awtciaiim.\u2014In the parts where the reac- tion of the decomposing limestone strata upon decaying vegetable mat- ter has produced soil conditions similar to those which prevail in the Central Prairie region (which includes the more or less calcareous lands of\" the post oak prairies and cedar hammocks), the plant associations bear the same campestrian character. In Monroe and Clarke counties are found the same tall Compositae, together with various plants of other families, which are characteristic of that region. The following species the above are met with farther south except the last two, which extend to the coast plain. Of xerophile and mesophile plants inhabiting shaded rocky dells and banks, the following damp rocks which line the narrow channels of brooks deeply cut into the limestone strata, the maidenhair fern (Adimiturn capillm- vmerix) occupies every crevice. Toward the southern confines of the region the following, which grow also in the adjoining region, inclosing the bed of the Alabama River, for instance near Claiborne, Dirca jsalustrix, a shrub from the Alleghenian area, finds in deeply shaded situations its extreme southern outpost. PhUaddpkm irwdorm with Ptele.a trifoliata and the river grape rlparm) are also found on the bare ledges of these bluffs on the oppo- site sides of the river. In the southwestern part of this region where the calcareous prairie soils are mixed with the light loams, the red cedar once formed a large portion of the timber growth, making a feature analogous to the cedar hammocks of the Central Prairie region. The cedar hammocks of this region are at present, however, nearly all under cultivation, and the few still covered with cedar are rapidly being stripped of ttoeir valuable timber, mostly for use as pencil wood. In the eastern extension of this region the loose Ozark sands form FORESTS OF LOWER HILLS AND LOWLANDS 109 the arid surface soil, spreading over a large part of western Florida and southern Georgia. These are covered by very open pine barrens, and the latter are inhabited by a number of peculiar herbaceous species. Most widely be spoken of later as an inhabitant of the Lower Pine belt. These and other species common to this region and the dry pine barrens farther south form a scanty covering for the barren sands. Mesophile forest*.\u2014On the lower flanks of the ridges and on the lower hills of the Central Fine region the short-leaf pine mingles with the long-leaf species and with the frequently named declivities merge into the narrow valleys with a fresher soil more retentive of moisture, mesophile species gradually gain the upper hand. Representative trees are: Magnoliafoetida (magnolia). tree). Qucrcw laurijolia (laurel oak). Fagus americana (beech). There is a variety of shrubs in the openings and along the borders of the forest, among which are: Sly rax grandifolia (large-leaved storax virginica (fringe tree). The first of these is frequent in the Louisianian area from North Carolina to Louisiana. In these mesophile forests the same species of the liana formation which prevail in the Central Prairie region are equally frequent. To the small shrubby climbers are to be added Clematis catwhaei, rare from lower South Carolina to Florida and known in Alabama only from the vicinity of Suggsville, Clarke County; O. retlculata, infrequent from South Carolina to Texas; O. ervtpa, fre- quent on low, damp banks southward to the coast plain; and, finally, the yellow jessamine (Gelsemium), in damp and dry situations throughout the Maritime Pine belt. Metiophile and paladial forextx of the htwlandx.\u2014The lowlands of the flood plain of the Alabama and Tombigbee rivers and of their larger tributaries are heavily timbered. Their first terrace, overflowed only 110 PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA. in the times of the heaviest freshets, is covered with a valuable hard- wood timber growth of cow oak, Spanish oak, Texas or Southern red oak, white ash, honey locust, and mocker nut hickory, destined to furnish large supplies for the future. On the almost perpetually submerged banks of both of these rivers a fine timber growth of bald cypress frequently forms brakes of considerable extent, occasionally accompanied by the tupelo gum. It can be safely asserted that fully one-half of the area of this region is under cover of the long-leaf pine, and that in their timber wealth these forests surpass by far the pine forests of the lower division of the Maritime Pine belt. From estimates made in various districts it appears that fully 6,000 feet of merchantable timber can be with safety assumed as the average yield per acre. Mmq>hile herbaeeov# plant association#.\u2014The following herbaceous plants, extending hither from the mountain region, find here their southern the rarest of Southern plants, else- where known only from a few localities in middle Georgia and Texas, and Thalictum debile are thus far known in Alabama only in this region. Cultural plantform/i tioiw.\u2014In its cultural plant formations this region differs but slightly from the next region. The rich hill prairies, cal- careous uplands, formerly bearing a mixed growth of pines and decidu- ous trees, as well as the bottom lands, are for the most part devoted to the cultivation of cotton. Larger or smaller patches of tropical sugar cane arc cultivated on almost every farm. Corn, oats, and sweet potatoes and other root crops are raised to supply the home demand. Less attention is paid to the raising of forage crops, the cattle being left to shift for themselves throughout the year among the hills. In the northern part the peach is raised in perfection, ripening its fruit from the middle of May to August. Grapes can be harvested in .July and August, and strawberries are marketed in the first weeks of April. The fig also bears abundantly. LOWEK DIVISION OP THE COAST PINE BELT, OR LOWER REGION\" OF LONG-LEAF PINE. Physmgraphical features and climate. As the Tertiary strata disappear under the heavy beds of sands and gravels of more recent formations, the topography of the country becomes more uniform, the broad ridges spread out into slightly undulating table-lands, which become somewhat broken in their descent to the drainage channels. The rolling pine uplands rise gradually to CLIMATE OF LOWER DIVISION OF COAST PINE BELT. Ill a height of from 220 to 800 foot above the flat woods and marshes and alluvial forests of the tide-water region. Where the level table-lands, devoid of surface drainage, are underlaid by impervious clays, spongy bogs surround the heads of water courses. On the rolling uplands with a porous siliceous soil the copious rainfall is readily absorbed, giving rise to innumerable springs, the feeders of the numerous limpid brooks and creeks by which this region is traversed. The area of the lower pine region is estimated to embrace a little over 7,000 square miles, including the following counties and parts of counties: Geneva, pail of Covington, Esoambia, part of Monroe, and all of Baldwin, Mobile, and Washington. Both the climate and topography of this region exhibit great uni- formity. Under the moderating influences of the proximity of the sea, the climate is generally mild. According to the records of the Mobile station of the United States Weather Bureau, extending over a period of twenty-three years, the mean annual temperature for that period was with the highest temperature 101 \\ observed in July, 1884, and the lowest 11\u00b0, in January, 1886.1 Mean monthly temperature tritft maxima and minima, Mp&H Maximum Minimum Jan. o SO 11 Fvb. r>r> 78 19 Mar+1 So(>t o fvj 1)7 'JO o 71 W Hi o so UK) it) HI 10t o 80 100 fi7 11 -V> Oct. 70 94 Nov. , Dec, o -\u00b1r> 7lJ 20 iMtkt of U'mjNTatttre hy for period of ttrentiHhree years. 1 Winter.

Xerophile forext.%\u2014On the hills and broad swells of the tablelands the long-leaf pine reigns supreme. The high forest is almost bare of undergrowth and its monotony is frequently unbroken for long distances, no other trees or shrubs appearing among the tall trunks of the pine, which spread their gnarled limbs at a height of from 40 to 65 feet above the ground. It is only in the accidental openings of the forest that a second growth of the predominating species takes posses- sion of the ground, which, if interfered with by human agency, is replaced by black jack and Spanish oaks, not rarely accompanied by the dogwood (Comw p/rida) and the glandular summer haw (Crutatyw dlipfiat). This last, which is a pretty tree from 20 to 25 feet high, ranges from South Carolina to Mississippi, and in Alabama appears to be confined to this region,1 On the sterile ridges deeply covered with the mantle of loose white sands, which hide the sandy loams of the La Fayette strata, the long-leaf pine becomes stunted and is more or less replaced by the barren or turkey oak and blue jack, trees rather below medium size, often dwarfed and scrubby; and among the these shrubs, representing the Empetraceae, which gener- ally inhabit the boreal zone, resembles in its foliage and habit a large heather (Erica). It is truly characteristic of the arid pine barrens from Florida and adjacent parts of Georgia to Mississippi, and in Alabama it reaches its northern limit of vegetation near the northern border of the Maritime Pine belt. The pine forests are open, the crowns of the trees scarcely touching one another. Owing to the poorly timbered ridges of scrubby oaks and the extensive swampy or boggy Hats equally unfavorable to the development of a heavy timber growth, the timber standing in the lower division of the Coast Pine belt is considerably less in proportion to area than that found in the upper division. On the better class of pine lands the quality of the timber is scarcely surpassed, as evinced by a close investigation of the timber resources of the rolling pine uplands near Wallace, Escambia County, which can be considered a typical district,2 The forests of long-leaf pine of this Lower Pine region furnish prin- cipally the enormous supplies of timber used by the sawmills situated in the tide-water region of Alabama and western Florida, with Mobile 1 The spceifie character of this tree does not fully agree with the rather obscure type and it may on nearer investigation prove distinct.

The depletion of their timber wealth with no heed given to their maintenance, and their destruction by the barbarous methods prac- ticed in the extraction of their resinous product, together with the ravages of the tires which one season after another destroy the seedlings and the youngest timber, and with the injuries inflicted by herds of domestic animals which roam through these forests, not only are exhausting their present resources, but will inevitably and within a comparatively short time result in their extermination, notwithstand- ing the fact that in no other region within the wide range of distribu- tion of the long-leaf pine are the conditions more favorable for the spontaneous reproduction of this most valuable timber tree. Xt TophUt herb<tt't>()ux plo/iii (iwoehtt 'ionx.\u2014Thanks to the abundant and evenly distributed rainfall, the floor of these open pine forests is covered with a carpet of grasses and other herbs, mostly perennials, which, under the mild climate of this zone, retains its verdure for the greatest part of the year. The grasses vastly predominate in the number of individuals, and in the diversity of forms they are scarcely exceeded by the species of the pea and composite families. The great bulk of the grasses consists of types of a Southern distribution, the majority being confined to the Louisianian area. But a small number reach the Carolinian area, and those only along the seaeoast. The brart[fofih* is a typical species of the Louisianian area, characteristic of dry pine barrens from North Carolina to eastern Texas, and Puniou-m ncuranthtnH extends to the West Indies.

Fully two-thirds of the numerous Leguminosae and Compositae occur- ring in this region are confined to that area. Omitting the common species of wide distribution, the following, named in the succession of their flowering, give character to the xerophile herbaceous associations of the rolling pine uplands.

Pine-barren flats arid Ifydrophjtic plan t axmclatiom. Toward the northern limit of this region the oldest .strata of the Post-Tertiary (Neocene) beds of loose sands and compact more or less aluminous clays approach or attain the surface. The higher swells of the table-lands covered by the porous sands and gravels include level tracts of badly drained barrens underlaid by the older strata, flooded after every heavy rain, droughty during hot and dry weather. On these flats Cuban pine is thinly scattered and here reaches its northern limit of vegetation, at a distance of about (K) miles from the seashore. Excepting the ink berry (//<,/? ghtbr<t) scarcely any tree or shrub shades the ground; but a small number of grasses find a place among the coarse herbs forming the cover of the extremely poor soil of t hese flats. The bulk of the herbaceous vegetation consists of a few abun- dant species with xei'ophile adapta- tions; that is, they are provided with strong, deeply embedded root- stocks to retain the needed supply of moisture during periods of hot and drv weather, and with rigid leaves of groat I v reduced surface to prevent excessive transpiration. Among such plants may be men- tioned species of Xyris and round rushes. In exposed shallow pools and ditches Sagittarius {Sufjiftaria eh<ip)H(Uu, ,S'. vydoptrroi) having rigid scapes and narrow stiff leaves are most frequent, the latter fre- quently reduced to narrow phyllodia. On the base of the pine-clad ridges bordering the flats /[((benan'a vrixtata and Pnondea simpler are not infrequently observed, the spindle-shaped or top-shaped roots of the latter deeply buried in the sand, where it is constantly moistened by springs. In many localities the declivities of the table-lands are perpetually wet with the water which oozes from the porous silit-ious strata imme- diately overlying the impervious clay, and the depressions inclosed by them arc frequently covered with a dense carpet of peat mosses, interwoven with the long filiform rhizomes of beak rushes, spike rushes, and one nut rush, the following being in Carolinian area. FORESTS OK MOIST AND SWAMPY LANDS 117 With these are associated creeping club moss (Lyeopodium alopecu- roideai) and many species of the paludial plants found also on the flats and in the swamps of the coast plain, including insectivorous sundews, bladder worts, the most prominent, rest their rosettes of urn-shape<l leaves on the water-soaked peat moss. Sarra- cenvt drummondii and X. rtthrd, with their trumpet-shaped, erect leaves, are abundant on the black peaty soil which covers the undula- tions where the impervious aluminous clays and compacted sands prevail. In the middle of the spring these plants produce their one- flowered scapes from stout rootstocks before the appearance of the leaves. In midsummer, when the leaves have attained their full growth, the boggy hillsides and depressions present to a superficial view the aspect of meadows richly adorned with flowers of white and roseate tints, imparted by the white. purple-veined tops of the leaves of these sarracenias. The display of these colors serves to attract insects, which, entering the leaves in search of the sweets secreted within, are entrapped, with no possibility of escape, and thus become sources of nourishment to these plants. MewpkUe and ptdndhd forMx.- Evergreens, nearly all of them types of the Louisianian area, predominate in the tree growth which shades the damp or wet, more or less sandy, banks of the numerous streams rising in the maritime pine belt.

This form of the cypress in the size and quality of its wood is greatly inferior to the typical cypress of the alluvial swamps, and is at once recognized by the leaves, which are closely appressed to the deciduous, annual shoots. By this peculiarity of the foliage a check to excessive transpiration is provided during the time of drought, when the sandy soil is laid bare to the sun and its supply of water is failing.

The ground being almost perfectly level and underlaid by a compact, somewhat impervious subsoil, is consequently more or less deficient in drainage, and being covered with a dense sod formed by the roots and rhizomes of low, perennial monocotyledonous plants, the ground remains damp and the decomposing vegetable matter, under the influence of sun and wind, is converted into an acid humus, giving rise to a peaty soil. This damp, mucky soil, in a semi boggy condition during seasons of rain, supports a vegetation of low, grass-like plants, mostly of the sedge family or sour grasses (Oyperactm) of various genera, which in number vastly rushes {./tw/), and golden-eyed grasses (.Xyridaceue), which find their home in the flat, damp pine barrens of the plain. Horn rushes (Rynchosjxtrav) largely prevail over the other representatives of the sedge family, and numerous species of this extensive genus, almost exclusively confined to eastern North America and the adjacent tropical zones, make up the largest portion of the sod vegetation, thus forming a more or less compact plant formation highly characteristic of this region. Among the mesophile associations which inhabit the scantily shaded, frequently open plain, with its sour, damp, shallow, and during the rainy seasons more or less boggy soil, there is found in many localities a tiny creeping peat moss (Sphagnum imhricatum) and other short-stemmed species (S. compaotum, S. intermedium), which are able to resist the effects of occasional droughts.

Nearly all of the sundews, sarracenias, gentians, and other species already mentioned among the associations which inhabit the sphagnous bogs of the pine hills also enter into the associations of this semi-paludial Rynchsopora formation.

Trees planted about seventy-five years ago, now frequently met with in the suburbs of Mobile and at the older country seats, are from 2 to 3 * feet in diameter and from (SO to 70 feet in height, their sturdy trunks sending out massive horizontal limbs at a distance of from 10 to some- times 15 feet above the ground, their shade frequently covering an area nearly 100 feet in diameter. In these hammocks the magnolia attains its highest development, in diameter rivaling the Cuban and loblolly pines, with which it is often associated, and accompanied by the laurel oak, water oak, and beech, all draped with the wreaths of Spanish moss. Of small trees and shrubs occurring here may be enumerated: OsmaiUhm americanm (American olive, Primus umbellaia (prairie plum). Hex coriacea (holly), The evergreen American olive, rarely seen among the pine hills, occurs here frequently. The last two hollies are shrubs which, together with the others mentioned, form a dense undergrowth.

This leafless saprophyte, of a pale bluish color, grows in dense clusters, its numerous contorted roots deeply buried in the ground. It is also not rarely found in Florida and southeastern Georgia. On the shady borders of the hammock are found, flowering early in the spring, J^emuph'da microm/yx and Aw/'tim arifoflum, lupine paludial types, all char- acteristic of the hammocks, the last three having also a wider range.

The tine sand forming the surface as well as the .subsoil is closely packed, permitting the water to permeate but slowly, and in consequence is overflowed after every rainfall. The great poverty of the soil is mani- fest in the stunted growth of pines scattered over these flats and the dwarfed cypress and white cedar lining the sandy banks of the streams.

Where the banks are almost perpetually submerged they are covered with cypress. This largest of the Atlantic forest trees was formerly found in the upper part of the river delta in great perfection. The mighty trunks rise to a total height of from 100 to 120 feet and over, with a diameter, measured above the buttresses which expand the bases, of from 3 to over 5 feet. The annual rings of growth are extremely narrow ^ f V and difficult to count. On close investigation the age of full-grown trees can be estimated to vary between 300 and i)00 years. They are the sole survivors in this part of the North American continent of an archaic type. The assemblage of these monarchs of the forest in the compact cypress brake, surrounded by the peculiar cone-shaped excrescences (cypress knees) rising from their roots 1 to 2 feet and more above the dark unruffled surface of the water, presents a feature in the arboreal flora of the present at once strange and imposing, As a result of the large demand for their valuable timber, the resources of these brakes in the delta and on the lower Alabama and Tombigbee rivers have been almost exhausted, and in this district the manufac- ture of cypress lumber has at present nearly ceased. The supplies of this timber nee ?ed for the manufacture of cypress shingles at Mobile are at present mostly drawn from the more remote brakes on the rivers named and their principal tributaries along their lower course. In these brakes the tupelo gum (Xyxwr atptaficu) is the only associate of the cypress, which it rivals in size, and the Carolina swamp ash is the only tree of small size thriving in the gloomy shade beneath these trees.

It inhabits the dunes from the southern frontier of Virginia through North Carolina south to Texas and the Mexican coast. By its stout running rhizome, deeply buried in the sand and sprouting from the rather distant nodes, a single plant soon colonizes the bare dune.

The rigid, sharp-pointed, leafless stems which rise 2 feet or more above the water, and are more or less crowded, present a rather compact plant formation highly characteristic of the vegeta- tion of the littoral region of the Southern Atlantic and Gulf States. This formation might fitly be designated as the Southern Jmicaceous formation. This rush also forms the great bulk of the vegetation of the extensive saline marshes lining the shore, which at low tide are above water and which by their position are protected against the violent action of the waves.

Large live oaks, aged magnolias, and pignut hickories cover these heaps, along with dense copses of the red buckeye, the sea plum, and the lime-loving Carolina buckthorn, the last two not known from any other locality in the lower pine region. On these shell banks the West Indian red cedar {Junipem* IxtrharfenN/x) is frequently found in full perfection, the sturdy trunk spreading out its almost horizontal branches, with their drooping branchlets, at from 12 to 18 feet above the ground. This tree is frequently found on the low hammocks lining the shores of the Gulf and its inlets from Mississippi to Florida and along the Atlantic shore to Georgia. On the driest summits of the shell heaps and on the sandy shores of the open sea, exposed to wind and tide, it is frequently of low stunted growth with the trunk divided from the base.

CULTURAL PLANT FORMATIONS OF THK COAST PINK UKLT. Of the 8,500 or !>,000 square miles covered bv the rolling pine barrens and pine flats of the coast plain east of the Escambia and Conecuh rivers, not more than about. 2 per cent is under tillage, and west of 134 PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA these rivers, in the counties of Covington and Geneva, and the lower part of Coffee, Dale, and Henry, about 10 per cent is under cultivation. The large areas of the farm lands are used for the pasture of catt le and sheep, which are left without attention to roam throughout the open pine forests and intervening swamps. The people of these sparsely inhabited regions depend for their livelihood mostly upon the timber and the resinous products of the longleaf pine forests. The land under cultivation is devoted principally to the growing of food crops, chiefly corn, sweet potatoes, rice, with some sugar cane, the several products scarcely sufficing to meet the home demand. It is onlv of late vears that the possibilities of the soil of the better class of pine lands have received a proper appreciation. Wherever the sandy loams rest upon a more retentive, somewhat clayey subsoil, these lands, with the help of a slight outlay for fertilizers, never fail to give satisfactory returns to the tiller. In the few localities where the experiment has been made the cultivation of cotton has proved successful. The tropical sugar eane is grown on every farm for the production of the largely con- sumed table sirup and raw sugar to cover the needs of the homestead. On the best of the pine land this crop will prove to be profitable, if undertaken on a more extensive scale. For on these lands the cultiva- tion of the sugar eane is easier and less expensive than on the heavy alluvial lands, which frequently require large outlays for drainage. Moreover, the cane grown on these pine lands yields a juice of great purity and rich in crvstallizable sugar. With the increased facilities for transportation to distant northern markets, much attention has been given to truck farming all along the railroad lines, and the large shipments of cabbages and Irish potatoes and other vegetables and fruits made every spring show the increasing importance of this industry. Among fruits, strawberries and water- melons are raised in large quantities for shipment. On the rolling pine lands, with a suitable subsoil, peaches and grapes under proper modes of cultivation, succeed well. This industrv of truck fanning is carried on most extensivelv on the Coast plain. Upon this low land, where the winter climate is tempered by the proximity of the sea, the warm, sandy loams produce crops which reach their perfection at an earlier date and with less risk of injury by frosty weather. During the winter and early spring the extensive fields of cabbages present a most peculiar compact plant formation of a bien- nial member of the Brassica tribe, alternating with a tuber-bearing, solanaeeous annual\u2014-the Irish potato. The planting season of the vari- ous crops of early vegetables for northern markets extends from the middle of October to the middle of March. The mean temperature of this period averages about 57\u00b0, with a mean of all the monthly highest temperatures of 78c for the coldest part of the growing season\u2014De- cember to February; conditions highly favorable for starting and fur- TRUCK AND FRUIT GROWING IN COAST PINE BELT. 135 thering the growth of the principal crops named, besides other root crops of minor importance, such as radishes and turnips, and also kales, peas, beans, cucumbers, etc. The plants easily recover from the injuries inflicted by light frosts, particularly when these happen in cloudy weather and whe n the return of the sunshine is gradual. The warmth of the sun raises the temperature of the soil and gives a new impetus to growth in compensation for the cheek it has received. Sudden changes, however, to temperature below the freezing point, succeeded imme- diately by sunny weather, not infrequently prove disastrous to the crops. Cabbage plants are constantly transferred from the cold frames to the field from October to December, and the crop is marketed from December to May. Irish potatoes are generally planted from the beginning of January to the latter part of February, and yield the first (Tops in April. Peas are sown in January and early in February; beans, squashes, and sweet corn about the first of March, when toma- toes, cucumbers, and melons, which have started under glass, are transferred to the open. Large quantities of these vegetables reach the northern markets from April to the beginning of summer. After these various crops have been harvested, chiefly gramineous plant formations take the place of those mentioned above. Field corn is frequently planted after the removal of the first crops of cabbage and Irish potatoes; crops of Italian or golden millet also frequently take their place; cowpeas are planted for fodder, but most frequently for the purpose of fertilizing the fields by plowing under. Far the largest part of the cultivated fields, however, is left to a luxuriant growth of weedy grasses, chiefly crab which furnish abundant, spontane- ous crops of nutritious hay, and also pasturage to the close of the season. In fact, it may be said that forage crops of various kinds can be grown in succession throughout the year. Oats and rye furnish green pas- ture through yield crops for soiling in the earliest days of spring. Oats cut in the milky stage are cured for dry feed in May and June. Cowpeas, millets, various kinds of sorghum, known as durrha or kafir corn, millo maize, and pearl millet; cattail millet, Hungarian grass, and the so-called Johnson grass {Sorghum htdepenxe) furnish green forage and hay crops throughout the summer; to which, near the coast, can be added the Guatemala grass or teosinte (EucJdmna niewicanti) ^ the genuine Guinea grass {Pankum juvnenUrruni), and Para grass (Ptuueum moile). The cultivation of the orange on our coast is wholly confined to the sheltered coves on the shores of the large bays and of the Gulf. The loquat tree, or Japanese medlar (Eriobotri/a japonica), has produced 136 PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA. abundant crops of its luscious fruit, which ripens early in the spring. This tree has, however, during the past few years been threatened with destruction by the same blight which has proved so disastrous to the pear orchards throughout the region. Under the care of experienced cultivators, the raising of peaches as well as of the finer kinds of grapes is of much promise. The fig produces abundant fruit, which is consumed fresh or used for preserves; and the scuppernong grape yields its crops year after year with regular abundance. The cultiva- tion of the fine kinds of pecan nut has greatly increased during the past 15 or 20 years, and the increasing crops of fine nuts are now seeking an outlet to distant markets.

Of the shade trees are to he mentioned the China tree (MeUa azedaraeh), the most frequent, and its variety of lower growth known as the umbrella China tree; also the paper mulberry (Bwuxxonrtiupapyrlftra).

Many of these plants grow to a height of from (> to 8 feet, covering square yards of ground with their low, wide-spreading branches. The single-flowered japonlea, of almost tree-like growth, puts forth its abun- dance of flowers from the middle of January through the winter, as do several kinds of laurestines.

As yet the study of the classes of true thallophytes, embracing the plants generally described as algae, has received scarcely any attention in Alabama. The sandy shoals and the sandy shores washed by the waves along the eastern Gulf coast from Louisiana to northwestern Florida are unproductive of algae, and only a few species of the higher forms find their home on our shore. With the exception of Characeae and Lemaneaceae, it has been uecessary to omit the so-culled fresh- water algae, as we know too little of them at present. The successful efforts of Dr. George II. Taylor and the Messrs, K. M. Cunningham and William McNeil in cleansing samples of the mud of Mobile Bay obtained from the almost fresh water of the estuary of Mobile liiver, the more or 7ess brackish water of the upper bsiy and the brine of the lower bay have brought to light a considerable number of interesting forms of the diatom family, which are here placed on record. The work of these skillful and diligent collectors has been spoken of by Hon. J. 1). Cox, LL. 1)., of Cincinnati, in the American Monthly Microscopic Journal.1 At the same time the following list has been furnished by Mr. Cox, to whom the cleansed material was at the time submitted for examination.

About the middle of the present century, following the work of Baron von Schweinitz in the same field, the liav. M. A. Curtis, of North Car- olina, and the Rev. M. J. Berkeley, of England, devoted their attention to the study of the fungi of the Southern United States. With these mycologists cooperated Mr. Raven el, of South Carolina, and Judge Peters, of Moulton, Ala. The latter proved a most active contributor, exploring a region hitherto si veritable terra incognita to science, and affording further light on the distribution of fungi in this part of our continent. Ilis collections were chiefly made during the period from 1S5-1 to COLLECTIONS OF ALA HAM A FUNGI. 149 1864 in that part of the Tennessee Valley and of the mountain region of Alabama embracing Lawrence, Winston, and Walker counties. Peters submitted his collections to Curtis and also partly to Kavenel. The descriptions of his new species were published in the first to the third volumes of Grevillea (1872 to 187(5) under the \"Notice of North American Fungi,\" by Berkeley and Curtis, and a smaller number were issued in Ravenel's Fungi Caroliniani Exsiccati (1852 to 1860). In his manuscript catalogue of Alabama fungi, left, with his collection, to the University of Alabama, Peters enumerated a little over 500 species under 122 genera, most of them contained in three quarto volumes. These specimens are still in a fair state of preservation. Early in the sixties (>. A. Beaumont, an enthusiastic young botanist, joined Peters in the exploration of the cryptogamic flora of the State, but working in his own surroundings. After a short stay in Lawrence County, Beaumont collected in southeastern Alabama near Brooklyn, in Conecuh County, and Troy, in Pike County. His specimens were also forwarded to Mr. Curtis and were duly noticed in the publications of the authors named above. After a long lapse of years the investigation of the mycological flora of the State was most actively resumed by Prof. George F. Atkinson {Cornell University, New York), chiefly during the years 1889 to 1892, while in charge of the biological department of the Polytechnic Institute and the State Agricultural Experiment Station at Auburn, assisted by some of his graduate students, principally B. M. Duggar, 18S9-90, and C. L. Newman, 18:i0-91. The field work was chiefly con- fined to Lee County, and the results of his labors were published in the Bulletin of the Cornell University, vol. No. 1, Ithaca, N. Y., June, 1897. In this Bulletin Oil species under 20L genera are enumerated, of which three genera and 01 species arc described as new. Prof. L. M. Underwood, while in connection with the biological depart- ment of the Polytechnic Institute (1895-90), and Prof. F. S. Earle, of the horticultural department, and since 1890 in the biological depart- ment of the same institution, continued with great zeal the labors of their predecessors in the field of Southern mycology. Their explora- tions were principally confined to the vicinity of the Institute. Pro- fessor Underwood made a trip to the mountain region of the State from its eastern limit westward to the section first explored by Peters. Professor Earle made, occasionally, some collections in Mobile County, His assistants in field work, Prof. C. F. Baker and Mr. Ben ton of the Alabama Experiment Station, are mentioned. In 1897 appeared the Preliminary List of the known species of Alabama Fungi, by L. M. Underwood and F. S. Earle, as Bulletin No. 80 of the Alabama Experiment Station at Auburn. In this publication, as stated by the authors, are contained all the Alabama species referred to by Berkeley, all contained in the Peters collection, and those con- tributed by Peters and Beaumont to Raven el's Exsiccati; besides these, PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA. those collected by Professor Atkinson or his associates and deposited in the herbarium of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute, the material col- lected by (jr. W. Carver of the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Insti- tute in Macon County, and the species reported upon by the authors in later papers from material collected in 1895 and subsequently. The following list of the Alabama fungi lias been kindly furnished by Prof. F. S. Earle. The writer takes this occasion to express his gratitude for this valuable contribution to his catalogue of Alabama plants. Introductory to this list Professor Earle makes the following remarks: In the Preliminary List of Alabama Fungi, of Underwood and Earle, published during the summer of 181J7' 1,110 species were noted as occurring in the State, and the distribution by counties was given. At about the same time Professor Atkinson published his list of 644 species, which appeared as Bulletin, Vol. 3, No. 1, of the Cornell University. Two hundred and thirty-two of the species were not given in Bulletin 80, These two publications are the busis of the following list, though it contains a number of additional species not reported in either of them. The nomenclature adopted is essentially that of Engler & I'rantl, Die Natuer- lichen Pilanzenfamilien. This necessitates the change for good reason of a few of theSaccardian generic names that were used in the above publication. The sequence of orders and families is that of Englor & Prantl's work, the genera and species being arranged alphabetically. To this the writer has to add that, in order to bring his list into accord with the plan adopted in the present work, the genera had also to be systematically arranged according to the work of the above authors, and the authority for each genus had to be given. Further have been added citations for the more recently described species,2 the names of collectors in Alabama, and the distribution of species by States, as far as could be ascertained from the various 'State floras, occurrence in Europe being also noted.

'Hennings has proposed the name Boletopsis for those species of Boletinae having an annnlus (Engler & Prantl, Pflanzentam, 1 Toil, Abt. 1**: 194. 1898), but as noted by Underwood (Bull. Torr. Club, 25:630) the older name of Boletinus must be retained if the species belonging to it are to be included in the new grouping. %Ilennings's treatment of the Agaricaceae in the Natucrlichen Pfl an xenfa.mil icn does not seem to meet the full approval of American mycologists. It seems best, therefore, for the purposes of this catalogue to follow the generic names used by Saccardo in the Sylloge Fnngorum rather than to make the many new binomial combinations that would be necessary if Hennings's treatment of the family were to be fully adopted.\u2014F, S.

Peters of Mo ill - ton iiml Joseph T\\ Beaumont of Conecuh County, the lichens of north- ern Alabama and of the upper part of the Maritime Pine belt in the southern section of the State have become well known. These enthu- siastic explorers of its cryptogamic ilora communicated the results of their field work to Professor Tucker man. In the Genera Lichenum (1872) and in the Synopsis Lichenum (1882), this author credited 223 species and 2 varieties to the above collectors. Fully one-half of this number are contained in the collection of lichens made by the Honor- able Judge Peters, which he presented to the University of Alabama. The lichens collected by the writer in Mobile and Baldwin counties (early in the seventies) have been identified by Mr. Henry Willey of New Bedford and Miss Maria Wilson, and the collections made in later years in the different parts of the State have been examined by Miss Clara 1% Cummings of Wellesley College, who has also kindly under- taken the revision of the catalogue of Alabama lichens, for which assistance the writer expresses here his thanks. Lately an interesting contribution to our knowledge of Alabama lichens has been made by the biological survey of Alabama, consisting of 74 species, mostly from 26*4 PLANT LIFTS OF ALABAMA. the vicinity of Auburn, which were kindly placed at. the service of the writer by the collectors, Profs. F. S. Earle and Carl Baker. GENERAL DISTIIIIIUTION. Of the 40 genera known at present to be represented in Alabama, the following are of au exclusively southern range: by species inhabiting the Louisianian life area, which frequently extend to the neighboring trop- ics and are rarely found north of tlie Carolinian life area. Represented by a number of species in the southern part of Eastern North America and also in the tropics are: (iraphia, Leptugiunk Pyx inc. PyreuopsiN. CoUciiia, Omphalaria, also frequently met with in the Alleghenian area. Of decidedly northern distribution are such as\u2014 Verrucaria. Khizocarpun. Placodiuin, The representatives of these genera in the Southern States are mostly confined to the mountain region. Elsewhere they are widely scattered from the cooler temperate to the frigid zones and the cooler regions of the Old World. The following are more or less equally distributed throughout the cooler and warmer zones, and many of them have numerous represent- atives in corresponding regions species and U(> varieties of lichens have been recognized in Alabama. uii< J i oNAL I > i ST mm IT ION. Although generally of a wide distribution, the greater number of species and varietal forms of these lowly plants are more or less strictly confined to the several life areas with their lloral regions, which share the State. Nearly one-half (48.0 per cent) are confined within the limit 1 Strigula occur* in Polynesia, REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION OK LICHENS. 265 of the warmer temperate zone or the Carolinian and Louisianian life areas, one-half of this proportion having their home exclusively in the latter. In the mountain region on the ridges of greatest elevation a vertically sharply limited rupestrian lichen formation is met with. At an elevation approaching 2,000 feet the bare Carboniferous sandstone cliffs or the flinty metamorphic rocks which form the brow and summit of the ridges are covered by the black thai his of Umlri Heart a pustulata (variety jmpulosa) not encountered at a lower altitude. Judge Peters, who had been collecting in a section of the mountain region with tlie highest point scarcely exceeding l,fi00 feet, stated that he had not found an Umbilicaria in Alabama. Ashy-gray Endocarpons (E. niuklcnberyii), lead light-gray tions of Verrucarias and Lecanoras invest the rocky crests of these heights with a coating of various tints. The following have been found to prevail throughout the mountain region, having been collected on sandstone by T.

These lime-loving lichens are also found in the adjacent valleys 011 the outcrops of the mountain limestone. In the shallow rocky beds of brooks all over the \"Warrior table-land, at an elevation of 000 to 1,000 feet, Tlphebe fiubcxcens is abundant, where also on the wet rocks of the banks of the head waters of the Sipsey liiver {Winston County) Eiulocarpim of the ferruginous sandstone or conglomerates crowning the crests and Hanks of the Orange sand throughout the Coast Pine belt are covered with the black crusts of Lecanora xanthophana. In the Coast Pine belt, and particularly in the damp Coast plain, lichens abound. The hammocks and wooded swamps which border the 26() PLANT LIFK OF ALABAMA. pine barren streams are inhabited by a formation of bark lichens, which have their filmy thallns more or less deeply embedded in the smooth bark of hollies, wax myrtles, magnolias, and red bay (Persea), such being the favorite sites of Glyphis avhariana, a 1 arge array of species * of Arthonia and Grapbis, Opegrapha tributaries, nearly every one of the species Trypethelium and Thelotrenia enumerated in the strictly southern distribution. Species with a more developed crustaeeous, granular, or agglutinated foliaceous thallus, patticulaily the Southern Heterotheeiums, prefer in similar localities the rough bark of old bark of hoary live oaks and of the laurel oak, frequently covered with mosses, is also inhabited by\u2014 aurata. Pel lit/era polydactyta. At the base and oil the roots of the live oak near the dump ground abound among mosses the webby clusters of the tila-meiitous al^a like thallns of Coenof/onhttti nterposit um. In more open and drier situa- tions the trunks and limbs of smaller varietal forms. In the humid coast plain lichens inhabiting dead and rotten trunks, CUntonia pulchella and Gladonia graeUis arc common.

JO 1 1 1 LIVERWORTS. With tbe exception of a small number contributed by the Biological Survey of Alabama from the vicinity ot* Auburn (M eta in orpl li c II i i 11 s), tlie greater part of these plants known from Alabama Iiave been collected in Mobile County. The northern part of the State, in regard to liver- worts, is yet a iield to be explored. Forty eight species under 125 genera have at present come to our knowledge from this State, being about two-fifths of the species described in the sixth edition of (1 ray's M an Mai. DISTRIBUTION OF LIVERWORTS. 285 Considering tlie proximity of our Southern region to the tropics, where these plants attain such a high development, the small number of forms which are held in common with tropical America, and which, on this continent, are not found outside of warmer temperate regions, such as Dumortiera, Iteboulia, and Sphaerocarpus, is remarkable. Most of the genera represented iu greatest numbers in the cooler tem- perate region (Alleghenian area), and more or less of a cosmopolitan distribution, are met with in every part of the State\u2014for can be little doubt that some of the genera prevailing in the ^Northern States and Canada, not yet known from Alabama, will be added to our flora by a closer search for the plants in the Mountain region. About one-half of the species known from Alabama belong strictly to Kastern North America; 14 species are held in common with Europe, and 11 occur on the Pacific slope, mostly in its northern exten- sion, all of which, with the exception of A sterella teneUa, are also widely distributed in the cooler temperate zone of Europe. Little more than one-half of the liverworts so far reported from the State are of a decided Southern distribution. Strictly confined to the subtropical district (Louisiauian life area) are the data. The species extending to the cooler temperate and frigid regions are scattered over the State from the Gulf shore to its northern limit. The specimens early collected by the writer were identified by the late Mr. C. F. Austin. His collections of later years have been exam- ined by Professor Underwood, to whom thanks are due for this, as also for his assistance in revising the list of Llepaticae from Alabama, PLANT LIFE OF ALABAMA Subkingdom lower Alabama.

Prof. Leo Lesquereux explored in 1848 parts of the mountain region of north 15894 ID 200 PLANT LIKE OK ALABAMA. Alabama, the Raccoon Mountains in Morgan County, and Lookout Mountain in Dekalb County. The writer communicated his collection made in southern Alabama, 1868 to 1878, to the authors of the Manual of the Mosses of North America, and also to C. F, Austin and to Dr. Karl Mueller in Halle, the latter describing Hypnum honwlontcgium 1 as a new species, llis collections made subsequently in different parts of the State were submitted to Mr. Holzinger and Mrs. Elizabeth G. Britton for identification. To the peat mosses special attention was given in the attempt to contribute to the Sphagna exsiecata to be issued by Professor Eaton and Mr. Faxon. Most of the specimens of this difficult genus were placed in the hands of Professor Warnstorf for identification, who found two species among them not described before\u2014Sphagnum mohrii and Sphagnum mobilienser To Mrs. Britton thanks are due for the examination of the species of Bruchia and many others and for the revision of the catalogue of Alabama mosses. The collections made recently by the Biological Survey of Alabama in the vicinity of Auburn have added to our knowledge of the distribution of mosses in the State. To obtain data for the exhibition of the geographic distribution of the mosses known from Alabama, the following authorities S., Musci and Hepaticao of the IT. S. in Gray, Man. Sullivant &. Leeqiier<>nx, Musci Boreali-Americani. 18(55. 1865-1875. Lesqneroux &. James, Manual of the Mossos of North America, 1881. Maconn & Kindberg, Catalogue of Canadian I'lant.n, Part fi. 1872. Besides these, use has been made of the papers 011 mosses published by various authors in the contributions of the department of botany, Columbia University, in the Botanical Studies of Minnesota, Vol. 1, and in the botanical reports and floras of New Jersey, New York, West Virginia, Ohio, Illinois, and Nebraska. In the arrangement of the families, genera, and species, Lesqneroux & James's Manual has been mainly followed. GENERAL DISTRIBUTION. At present 15.'S species and 13 varieties with 4 subvarieties or forms of Musci are known from Alabama. Of these, 112 species, or 70 per cent, 1 Hull.

The number of genera occurring in Alabama endemic to this part of the North American continent is small; although it is difficult to state it with exactness on account of the different views held by authors in regard to their limitation. The following are exclusively Eastern North American: Drumowndia- Clasmatodoit. Thclia. Pytaisiella. Fully 60 per cent of the genera are represented in the warmer parts of the globe, chiefly in tropical America. Such are the following, which are of an almost exclusively tropical distribution: Leucobryum* Scft lotheimia. ostick ella More or less numerously in The following species of the Alabama flora occur in tropical America, those with an asterisk being exclusively American: Sphagnum West Indies.)

Exclusively of northern distribution extending to the Boreal zones are the following: Sphaeroceph a 1 ww. Fontina f is* Glimacinm* 21)2 PLANT LTFE OF ALABAMA. To the Arctic region extend 22 species, of which the following are North American: The rest of the species are widely distributed in the cooler regions of the Old World. Of transcontinental species which on the west const range from California to British Columbia iU occur in Alabama, of which only the following are confined to all cosmopolitan wanderers throughout the cooler temperate region of the Northern Hemisphere, many of them found in Europe. Alabama has 20 species in common with the latter continent, mostly erratic in temperate zones of the globe. Of anomalous distribution Brarhythecium campcatre is a striking example, this species being known only from the White Mountains of New England and the Kocky Mountain region from Colorado to British Columbia. In no other part of the State are mosses found in greater variety and abundance than in the section of the mountain region which embraces the Warrior table-land and the southern spurs of the Cumberland Mountains abutting upon the Tennessee Valley. The manifold differ- ences in the topography and geology of this section of the State give rise to a diversity in conditions of climate, exposure, and soil which afford the peculiar habitat to which each species finds itself best adapted, and to which it clings more tenaciously than most plants of a higher order; for, as Professor Lesquereux, the close student of the moss world, aptly remarks, these humble and apparently useless beings have their geological and lithological preferences far better marked than any other kind of vegetable. The species prevailing in the northern part of the State at an eleva- tion exceeding 1,500 feet are mostly the same as found in the Middle and Northeastern States. On the lower terraces and in the valleys Southern forms intermingle with those of higher latitudes. For example, at the falls of Black Creek near (ladsden, 3,000 feet altitude, the Northern Fiasithms adiantoiths is associated with the tropical Fiwi- dens polypodioideif, and on the Cumberland table land in Jackson and Morgan counties the Southern Sphagnum maerophylhm, 8. ctfclophyUum, and 8. mode 293 anum of the North (800 to 1,200 feet altitude). On the still lower ridges and terraces south of the Tennessee Valley are found the Southern\u2014 Fabronia spp. lirwhia currisela. ('ryphaca sp. Fu is common throughout the mountain region from an elevation of 800 to 2,000 feet. The eastern and most southern of the Appalachian ranges traversing the basin of the Coosa River where the obdurate sandstones and flinty cherts pre- vail, the arid flanks covered with open pine forests, are as poor in mosses as the rolling pine barrens of the Maritime pine belt. Consid- ering the large area unfavorable to the vegetation of mosses, it is not to be expected that the moss flora will be found as rich and luxuriant as in most of the Middle and Northern Atlantic States. In the Louisianian area only the lower division of the Coast pine belt has been closely searched for mosses. In the Coast plain, with its ample rainfall, mosses become again more abundant. Many of the declivities of the pine-clad hills and the depressions between them, of the exposed swampy banks of the pine barren streams, and of the fiats bordering the swamps in the plain, are covered with peat mosses (Sphagnum) of various kinds. The greater part of them are common from the Gulf to the Canadian lakes. Such flat pine barrens of the Coast plain flourish during the winter and the first days of spring the following, mostly FiHsidcnx ttubhaftitarls.

Specimens from the coast pine barrens agree exactly with the description of Michaux, having the stem divided above into long, 8 lender, few-leavedfastigiate branches hearing a rather close corymb, and the acuminate leaves with the truncate base sessile. May prove a good variety. Type locality: \"Hab, in Gray, 240. Chap. Fl. 195^ Gray, Syn. Fl. N. A. 1, pt. 09, Coulter, < 'ontr, Nat. Herh. 2 :17#. Carolinian and Louisianian areas.

Considering that integrifoVnim is not foniul in tlie lower parts of the Southern States, and that the description of Pnrsh is founded on Enslen's plant collected in western Cenrgia, there can he no doubt about its identity with the plant described by Elliott under the same name; accordingly Pursh s name is to bo kept up. In view ot the many doubtful forms which occur in the southern extension of tho Allegheny Mountains, and which have been either described as distinct species or considered as varieties and often confounded with one another, it is not without hesitation that the forms regarded as new by the writer are here introduced, espe- cially when confronted by the confusion of the nomenclature of this group.

GeoL Surv, Herb, Mohr, THE SPONTANEOUS FLORA OF ALABAMA IN ITS RELATION TO AGRICULTURE. The relation of flora to soil has long been recognized by the observing agriculturist, who judges the fertility of the virgin soil by the quality and vigor of the tree growth which it supports. The consideration of the laws which control the distribution of species within certain limits which are recognized as the boundary lines of the life zones of our continent points at once to the crops naturally adapted to them. Directing the attention to the influence of the secondary factors, by which species and their associations are restricted to minor areas within the principal zones, recognized as subordinate floral regions, it becomes evident that among these factors the physical and chemical conditions of the soil are most potent. The character of the vegetation becomes thus clearly the indicator of the soil conditions. Guided further by practical experience and the teachings of science, the fitness of the land for the production of a special crop can often be ascertained by the farmer from the character of the vegetation alone, without having to resort to costly and time-consuming experimentation. In Alabama, as well as in the adjoining States, where the efforts of the agriculturist have been and still are almost entirely confined to a single crop (cotton), recorded experiences of this kind are greatly wanting. The writer has, however, made the attempt to bring together the facts observed by him in this direction, which might serve to stimulate the further investigation of a subject of great practical importance to the farmer. Beginning, in the consideration of the relations of the flora to the agricultural interests, with the subtropical part of the State (the Loui- sianiau life area), the following facts, serving as unfailing guides, present themselves. In the < oast plain, where the upland hammocks prevail, with their growth of evergreen oaks (live oak, laurel oak) and mag- nolias, with their variety of shrubbery\u2014where the Cuban pine in its best development has replaced the original heavy growth of long-leaf pine, with gallberry bushes for the undergrowth, and the ground covered by a dense turf of horn rushes (Rynchospora), tall (A. dumosiis and others)\u2014there is always found a soil of light 821 82 2 PLANT LIKE OF ALA HAM A sandy loam, rich in vegetable matter on the surface, underlaid by a more compact .subsoil of great depth, and ;it a short distance beneath the surface damp throughout the year, but not deficient in drainage. A soil of this character, in this low latitude, unites all the require- ments for the rapid growth of the pecan tree, yielding nnts of finest quality. The presence of the mesophile herbaceous plant asso- ciations, forming the original plant covering\u2014that is, such as prefer a soil of a moderate amount of moisture and a good drainage\u2014points to the litness of the soil for the cultivation of early vegetables in the Meld during the fall and winter seasons, where, in tins part of the Louisianian zone, the proximity of the sea offers greater protection against the in juries caused by sudden and extreme changes of temper- ature, followed by light frosts. Among the fruit trees most successfully grown iu the coast region the lig is to he included, which, in the closer and damper soil, is less liable to suiter from the causes mentioned. In the region of the Lower division of the, Coast Pine belt or the roll- ing pine hills (dry pine barrens), the long-leaf pine reigns supreme, with a scanty undergrowth of black jack, blue jack (^Hcrcio) mary- tamUcai (/. it cHiplim). Her- baceous xerophile associations form a dense carpet beneath, consisting of a variety of panic grasses and Paspalums, broom sedge (Awiropogon scoparins) and Unariifoiivs), sunflowers (I ft'Ii ant hits radnla). These give character to the flora and indicate a soil of warm sandy loam, with a somewhat clayey subsoil capable of retaining moisture. The pine lands where such conditions prevail are particu- larly adapted to the growth of pears of Asiatic origin, such as the Le Oonfce and the Keifter, and the scuppernong grape, and the growing of the peach gives much promise. Watermelons are raised in large quantity and of best quality. The sweet potato, under the application of proper fertilizers, yields large crops, and throughout, the pine belt forms one of the most, important, food products. Treated in the same way, eoru, particularly the white variety, yields satisfactory crops, and the tropical sugar cane is grown with equal success. In the 1 \"pper division of the (!oast Pine belt with its arboreal vegeta- tion of a mixed growth of coniferous and hard wood trees, particularly where the short leaf pine mingles freely with upland oaks, upland hickories, and the chinquapin chestnut, a light sandy loam of a grayish or pale butt' color frequently prevails, underlaid by a retentive sub soil. This class of soils, particularly where they cover the low undu- lating hills, is found especially favorable for the cultivation of the strawberry. Soils of a very similar character, and equally adapted to NATIVK VKOKTATION AS AN\" INDEX OF SOILS. S'i.'i this crop, are, on the Warrior table land, indicated by the mixed growth of pines (Pinna taeda^ P. erhinain) and deciduous trees, Judging by the success achieved with leaf tobacco of highest grade on soils of the same character in the lower part of the South Atlantic States, from North Carolina to middle Florida, it can reasonably be supposed that this profitable crop can be*, not less successfully, raised in southern Alabama. In the same 11 oral region, and also in the eastern extension of the Prairie belt, post oak, associated with black oak ((/u even a tinctoria), southern red oak (Q. te.vu.na), and mocker nut and pignut hickory, with a slight sprinkling of short-leaf pine, forms open forests, with tall rosin weeds, sunflowers, and phloxes in the openings, indicating a warm, loamy, generous soil, which is of a deep chocolate to a deep reddish color, resting upon ledges of the \"rotten limestone/' On the hills with this soil covering the peach produces its choicest kinds of fruit from the earlier part of June to August, and the Concord grape yields its black- purple clusters in perfection. The dense forests of cow oak (Quercm mwhanxii), Texas white oak (Q. scaly-bark, and bitternut hickories, frequently invested with the drapery of the Spanish moss, and in low damp situa- tions more deficient in drainage, the switch cane (Arnndinaria ted(r), forming impenetrable thickets, are the sure indications of a deep black calcareous soil, rich in humus, such as is characteristic of the Western prairies, noted lor greatest fertility. In the eastern Gulf States this soil is also noted for its rich yield of forage crops of the pea family (Leguiiiinosae), of which the white uielilot (Melilotux alba) has proved the most profitable and of greatest value as an ameliorating crop. The so-called bald prairies, originally bare of tree growth, present a varied herbaceous vegetation of a xerophile character, including vari- ous grasses, shallow and drier prairie soil, which, though easily worn out, is adapted to all kinds of root crops and forage plants. On the Metamorphic hills of the Mountain region the extensive oak forests (white oak, Southern red oak, bluck oak (Qm rota rafuliita)), point to a deep fertile soil, the result of the decomposition of the basic horn- blendic rocks and schists. In years past these lands were to a large extent devoted to the production of small grains, chiefly wheat, but owing to the pressure of competition with the wheat lields of the vir- gin prairie soils of the far Northwest, these lands are at present, in the South, almost entirely given over to the cultivation of cotton and of indian corn. The peanut is said to thrive especially well on the lands of the above character. Sorghum is largely raised throughout this Metamorphic area to supply fully the need of sirup. Its region can be 824 PLANT LIFK OF ALA HAM A said to coincide with the belt most favorable to the raising of the peach, as is clearly shown by the success achieved by the growers of this fruit on a large scale in the adjoining parts of Georgia of the same geological formation. The drifted loamy sands and pebbles of more recent formations over- lie to a large extent the heavier and stronger calcareous marls and clayey strata of the old Tertiary, Cretaceous, and Paleozoic formations. Their mingling, indicated by a mixed growth of pines and hardwood trees (mostly oaks), gives rise to a combination of conditions most favorable to the production of cotton, with regard both to the quality of the staple and the amount of the yield. The resultant soils consist of deep mellow loams of a warm and generous character, which are of moderate and lasting fertility, more or less porous and hence naturally well drained, and mostly highly ferruginous. Such soils are peculiarly well adapted for the production of a cotton plant of a sturdy growth, which being restrained from the too exuberant development of branches and leaves tends to a more prolilic yield of the organs of reproduction; that is, the fi uit. They are at the same time more easy of cultivation and less favorable to the rank production of grasses and other weeds, which in wet seasons greatly injure the crop, but which on lands of this character aie easier to overcome. Accordingly the uplands in which this combination of soil conditions prevails, compris ing the larger part of the arable area in the State, oiler decided advantages to the grower of its great staple crop over the most fertile alluvial valley lands. The forests of deciduous leaved trees, which cover the uplands in the Tennessee Valley, with their varied growth, chiefly of white oak, Southern red oak,black oak, shagbark and mockernut hickory, tulip tree (poplar), walnut, elm, maple, white ash, chestnut, aud linden, indicate calcareous, fertile, and somewhat heavy strong soils. These soils, from a reddish to a brown color, yield line crops of cotton and corn, tilled ground being devoted to these in about equal proportion. On the lands of this character, prevailing over the larger part of the Tennessee Val- ley and the larger outlying valleys, in the drainage area of the Warrior and Ooosa rivers, the cultivation of red clover enters successfully into the system of farming, and north of the Tennessee River the establish- ment of the blue grass pasture becomes possible. Apples and pears of numerous varieties cultivated farther north, as well as the peach, are grown successfully on the hills; and the dark grapes on the flanks of ihe valleys make a fine table wine.
