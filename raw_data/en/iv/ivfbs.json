Ayur- life Veda-knowledge Ayurveda is a 5,000 year old holistic medical science from India. Ayurveda teaches us to adopt the patterns and rhythm of nature into our daily lives. Ayurveda is about using every part of your knowledge, yourself and your sensory experiences to create and maintain vitality, longevity and well-being in all areas of your life: physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. Ayurveda defines one's health as not just the absence of disease but rather the balance of body, mind and consciousness. The science of Ayurveda believes that mind and body are not separate entities, but forever connected. The focuses of Ayurveda are to prevent, to maintain and to heal. Ayurveda provides a holistic framework for total health through: diet, yoga and exercise, pranayama (breathwork), daily routines, meditation, sleep, herbs, detox, aromatherapy, organic essential oils, mudra, mantra, seasonal routines and natural skincare. Aromatherapy is the holistic and therapeutic use of plant-derived essential oils to improve all aspects of an individual's health: mental, physical, emotional and spiritual. Aromas have the power to affect our mood in a variety of ways and the benefits of aromatherapy can positively affect the human psyche. The use of organic essential oils includes: stress, anxiety, headaches, insomnia, hormonal problems, musculoskeletal problems, issues with skin, sinus and respiratory issues, and fatigue to list a few. Organic essential oils are a potent and powerful gift to us from plants. According to Ayurveda, organic essential oils contain the prana (life force) of the plant. Aromatherapy is an important part of an Ayurvedic lifestyle and can enhance one's wellbeing. Aromatherapy is a part of living in an Ayurvedic way, also known as living seasonally and mindfully based on your individual constitution as well as any current imbalances you are experiencing. How to bring Aromatherapy into your daily rituals: - Use essential oils during your morning and/or evening routine. For example, applying a roller blend to soles of feet before bed or an uplifting spritz in the morning for energy. - Diffuse an organic essential oil diffuser blend into your office or home space during the day or evening to stay uplifted, yet calm. - Using a remedy roller blend for common ailments such as a headache or stomachache. - Placing a couple drops of your favorite organic essential oil diffuser blend into a warm bath or floor of your shower. All of our Alevan Botanica products are created with the knowledge of aromatherapy and Ayurveda coming together in a way to boost our wellness and health: physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually.
