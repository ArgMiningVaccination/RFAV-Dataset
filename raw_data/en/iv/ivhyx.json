These realities can make alternative treatments appealing options. Complementary and alternative medicines predate Western medicines and persist in their appeal, and physicians are noticing their patients using some type of unconventional treatment with greater frequency \u00e2\u20ac\" such as incorporating acupuncture into a treatment plan or forgoing conventional treatment altogether in favor of herbal supplements or other untested options they believe are more likely to cure their ills. Although it may avoid side effects of chemotherapy, refusing conventional treatment can increase patients\u00e2\u20ac risk of dying from his or her disease.1 The strategy is so dangerous that law enforcement has stepped in when parents have refused conventional treatments for their children. In September 2019, a couple in Florida lost custody of their toddler with leukemia after they decided to take him to a naturopath instead of his third chemotherapy appointment.2 Despite the dangers of skipping traditional treatments for hematologic diseases, many health care providers believe that including at least some type of complementary medicine in a patients\u00e2\u20ac treatment plans may be desirable, and even beneficial. Large cancer centers are opening what they call \u00e2\u20acintegrative\u00e2\u20ac or \u00e2\u20accomprehensive\u00e2\u20ac centers that encourage patients to use some of the therapies that weren\u00e2\u20act previously considered part of conventional therapy, under the supervision of physicians and in conjunction with traditional methods. Health care professionals and patients hope that the therapies will mitigate symptoms or side effects of conventional treatments. Moreover, some clinicians hope that acknowledging the value of these methods will deter patients from skipping treatment in favor of dangerous alternatives. \u00e2\u20acThe worst thing that we can do as providers is create an environment where patients don\u00e2\u20act feel safe talking to us about what they\u00e2\u20acre interested in trying [to treat their cancers],\u00e2\u20ac Skyler Johnson, MD, an oncologist at Yale University School of Medicine who studies cancer outcomes, told ASH Clinical News. \u00e2\u20acThere\u00e2\u20acs a chance that they will do it anyway, unbeknown to us.\u00e2\u20ac ASH Clinical News spoke with Dr. Johnson and several other professionals working with patients open to integrative therapies about how these treatments are being used by patients with blood disorders, the evidence supporting the benefits and harms of these methods, and ethical considerations for implementing them in the clinic. Alternative, Complementary, Integrative:\u00c2 What\u00e2\u20acs in a Name? Any health care approach that is not typically part of conventional treatment or has origins outside of Western practice could be considered alternative or complementary medicine. The distinction comes with the relationship to standard treatments, according to the National Institutes of Health\u00e2\u20acs (NIH\u00e2\u20acs) National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH).3 If a nonmainstream practice is used together with conventional medicine, it\u00e2\u20acs considered \u00e2\u20accomplementary.\u00e2\u20ac If a nonmainstream practice is used in place of conventional medicine, it\u00e2\u20acs considered \u00e2\u20acalternative.\u00e2\u20ac According to a 2018 survey by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, nearly 40% of people in the U.S. believe that cancer can be cured by alternative therapies alone.4 This belief can be deadly: Patients who forgo conventional cancer treatment and opt only for alternative treatments are 2.5 times more likely to die from the disease.\u00c2\u00b9 Alternative therapies, often marketed as \u00e2\u20accancer cures,\u00e2\u20ac can include unproven treatments such as intravenous vitamin C infusions, enzyme and oxygen therapy, herbal supplements, and baking soda infusions. Still, more and more scientists are encouraging research into certain types of therapies that fall outside of conventional disease treatment \u00e2\u20ac\" such as yoga, massage, meditation, and mindfulness. These modalities can be helpful when incorporated into interdisciplinary treatment plans, in conjunction with traditional methods, they argue. This type of interdisciplinary approach, which brings together conventional and complementary therapies, is referred to as \u00e2\u20acintegrative\u00e2\u20ac medicine. It emphasizes a holistic, patient-focused method of care by addressing the mental, emotional, functional, spiritual, social, and community aspects of a patient\u00e2\u20acs wellbeing.3 Doctors who practice integrative care work to understand how yoga, acupuncture, and other techniques could mitigate side effects and increase patients\u00e2\u20ac quality of life, while ensuring that people also receive conventional therapies to cure or manage their disease. When Dr. Johnson was in medical school, his wife was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma. Like many of today\u00e2\u20acs patients and caregivers facing a scary diagnosis, he consulted \u00e2\u20acDr. Google.\u00e2\u20ac The desire to gather information on the treatment and prognosis of Hodgkin lymphoma was \u00e2\u20achuman nature,\u00e2\u20ac Dr. Johnson said. \u00e2\u20acIt was really eye-opening for me to be able to see how much misinformation actually existed out there on the internet \u00e2\u20ac\" and it was shocking how some of it appeared legitimate,\u00e2\u20ac he said. \u00e2\u20acI thought to myself, \u00e2\u20acHow would somebody without any medical background be able to discern what\u00e2\u20acs accurate and what\u00e2\u20acs inaccurate?\u00e2\u20ac\u00e2\u20ac Combating Misinformation Alternative medicines, offered by doctors, naturopaths, or even people with no medical experience at all, have always been available. Desperate patients disappointed by the risk-benefit profiles of current treatments or who distrust conventional medicine have sought them out in hopes of curing cancers and other diseases. Today, the internet and social media can make finding information about diseases and treatments both faster and more confusing than ever. Like Dr. Johnson, many patients and family members scour the internet before or during treatment. Some might find resources from reputable sources like the National Cancer Institute or large health care organizations; others might stumble upon alternative sources that are just as convincing, but with contradictory advice to forgo conventional therapy. One woman with no medical credentials sold the chemical GcMAF as a cure for both late-stage cancers and autism through a private Facebook group.5 The product was unproven and unlicensed, but frustrated patients spent up to tens of thousands of dollars to purchase the chemical or receive GcMAF injections at her \u00e2\u20acclinic.\u00e2\u20ac Eventually her account was shut down, but many similar groups still flourish. One of the issues with curbing the spread of misinformation, according to a Washington Post story, is that social media algorithms may connect innocuous searches (like one for a smoothie recipe) to posts with serious medical claims (like a recipe and testimonial for a smoothie that \u00e2\u20ackills cancer cells\u00e2\u20ac).6 And, even if a person deliberately searches for traditional cancer treatments, misinformation can show up troublingly early in the search results, making it appear legitimate. From \u00e2\u20acQuackery\u00e2\u20ac to Complementary David S. Rosenthal, MD, a hematologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, was deeply involved with integrative and alternative medicine in the early 1970s, when the American Medical Association appointed him to its Committee on Quackery. Times have changed since the mid-1970s, when the committee was disbanded, and a growing number of doctors are tentatively getting on board with addressing \u00e2\u20ac\" and sometimes even offering \u00e2\u20ac\" complementary and integrative therapies for their patients. Dr. Rosenthal now directs Dana-Farber\u00e2\u20acs Leonard P. Zakim Center for Integrative Therapies and Healthy Living, a post he has held since 2000. \u00e2\u20acObviously, there was quackery and there still is quackery,\u00e2\u20ac he said, \u00e2\u20acbut what we\u00e2\u20acve done over the years is modified [our discussions] so that we\u00e2\u20acre talking about approaches that are done alongside standard treatments.\u00e2\u20ac He and his group at the Zakim Center began exploring complementary therapies back in 2000, starting with acupuncture and massage. The center offers these treatments to patients with cancer, as well as reiki, art therapy, meditation, yoga, exercise, and nutritional counseling. These methods \u00e2\u20accan help patients feel better by reducing the pain, stress, and anxiety caused by cancer and its treatment.\u00e2\u20ac7 Many other large treatment centers have developed similar departments to support patients who are interested in trying these therapies in conjunction with conventional treatment: The University of Arizona\u00e2\u20acs Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine has been training physicians in integrative approaches to care for 25 years; and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center operates the Bendheim Integrative Medicine Center. In addition to treatment centers working to fund and provide integrative treatments, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) opened the Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM) in 1998. The program offers grants to study complementary treatments and highlights the results on its website.8 However, many researchers contend that funding for research on complementary medicine is still lacking. While encouraging conversations and offering certain integrative therapies may prevent some patients from engaging in dangerous alternative options and forgoing treatment, there are still questions about who uses complementary medicine and how it affects their other care decisions, Dr. Johnson noted. He recently conducted a study to identify characteristics that make patients with cancer more likely to pursue complementary medicine \u00e2\u20ac\" and whether use of these therapies affects adherence to conventional treatments or has any effect on survival.9 The data revealed a troubling pattern: Patients who received complementary medicine had lower rates of five-year overall survival, compared with those who received no complementary medicine, and patients who engaged with these therapies were more likely to refuse other conventional cancer treatment. Patients who used complementary medicines were more likely than others to pick and choose their conventional therapies \u00e2\u20ac\u00c3 la carte,\u00e2\u20ac explained Dr. Johnson. For example, people may accept surgery but refuse radiation, therefore weakening the efficacy of their overall treatment. He added that the question of \u00e2\u20acwhether including [integrative specialists] in these conversations actually can modify behavior in patients who are interested in alternative therapies is fascinating and needs to be studied further.\u00e2\u20ac Natural Does Not Always Mean Safe Most, if not all groups that offer complementary medicine endorse mind-body methods such as acupuncture, massage, tai chi, and meditation. These options are less controversial, and possibly less likely to be mistaken for a treatment that can replace conventional therapies. Acupuncture is one of the most researched forms of complementary medicine, with studies suggesting it can be useful for managing pain, neuropathy, anxiety, and nausea \u00e2\u20ac\" symptoms commonly experienced during cancer treatment.10 A search on [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov) identifies more than a thousand clinical trials that are testing the therapy\u00e2\u20acs ability to treat these types of side effects. While doctors are more likely to recommend mind-body treatments like yoga and acupuncture as complementary treatments, a small 2015 survey of German patients and physicians suggested that patients were less enthusiastic about these options and showed far more interest in \u00e2\u20acbiological interventions\u00e2\u20ac such as vitamins, supplements, and herbs.11 Research on these types of interventions suggests that, while some modalities may alleviate some treatment side effects, others may interfere with conventional treatment, rendering it less effective or possibly even harmful. For example, while OCCAM cites research showing that ginger can help patients manage nausea, NCI-funded research has shown that certain antioxidants \u00e2\u20ac\" usually considered safe for healthy individuals \u00e2\u20ac\" can interfere with the efficacy of chemotherapy agents like imatinib.12 Alternative medicines also are not put through the same rigorous testing and regulations as traditional medications. Dr. Rosenthal recalled the case of PC-SPES, a mixture of eight herbs that was thought to be promising for the treatment of prostate cancer when it became commercially available in 1996.13 The treatment was believed to slow the growth of prostate cancer cells, but it was later found that the mixture contained some prescription drugs and hormones. Some patients had issues with bleeding. Each lot seemed to contain a different amount of various prescription medications. It was taken off the market in 2002 and is no longer sold in the U.S. It\u00e2\u20acs not clear whether its original positive effects were due to the combination of herbs or the other medicines that contaminated them. \u00e2\u20acThat\u00e2\u20acs the kind of difficulty we get into with herbal therapy,\u00e2\u20ac said Dr. Rosenthal. Another challenge is that patients sometimes disagree with their physicians on the value of certain complementary medicines, according to Kenneth Adler, MD, who is co-liaison to the ASH Committee on Practice from the ASH Practice Partnership. In these instances, said Dr. Adler, a hematologist and oncologist at the Summit Medical Group in New Jersey, his best option is to enlist other doctors in the discussions. He will refer his patient to a \u00e2\u20acreasonable physician who offers opinions about complementary medicine,\u00e2\u20ac as well as another conventional doctor. An Alternative to Sickle Cell Pain? For patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), pain is not just a side effect of treatment, but a lifelong symptom that can worsen with age. The pain often comes on in intense bursts, lasting hours to weeks, that can send patients to the emergency room. Some patients also develop chronic pain. Deepika Darbari, MD, who treats pediatric patients with SCD at Children\u00e2\u20acs National in Washington, DC, explained that often, opioids to treat the pain aren\u00e2\u20act enough. Dr. Darbari works with an interdisciplinary treatment team that ensures all of her patients are seen not only by a hematologist such as herself, but also by a psychologist, a social worker, an anesthesiologist, a licensed acupuncture specialist, and a palliative care specialist who can administer aromatherapy. She also recommends heat packs and massages for pain management. While these services are offered through the hospital, patients (and their families) are mostly responsible for selecting their own complementary therapies \u00e2\u20ac\" and sometimes for paying for them as well. It can be a difficult choice when the evidence for any of these pain treatment options is limited. Dr. Darbari and her team offer each patient all the complementary options available and let them choose what they are interested in trying. To build up the evidence base for complementary pain management techniques, Dr. Darbari\u00e2\u20acs team is running a clinical trial on the effects of acupuncture on SCD\u00e2\u20ac\"related pain. She hopes that better evidence will guide the treatment she delivers and will encourage more insurance companies to cover these options for her patients. Working Outside the Box Patients can easily access all types of information through a Google search, but where do clinicians turn for guidance about complementary, integrative, and alternative medicines? Some professional societies have published guidelines for the use of unconventional techniques in practice, but Dr. Adler pointed out that they are not appropriate for all patients. The Society of Integrative Oncology (SIO) has developed recommendations for incorporating complementary medicine in breast cancer treatment, for example, but solid tumor cancers are not the same as hematologic malignancies, for which the group has not yet published any guidelines.14 The NCCIH collects clinical practice guidelines created by other organizations on its website, which includes two oncology-related resources \u00e2\u20ac\" the SIO document and guidelines regarding exercise for cancer survivors \u00e2\u20ac\" but provides little else for patients.15 Several guidelines address pain and suggest the use of mind-body techniques, but they are not specific to pain associated with hematologic or solid tumor malignancies. Sandra Kurtin, PhD, ANP-C, AOCN, a nurse at the University of Arizona Cancer Center, regularly uses the Natural Medicines Database, a searchable database that lists what\u00e2\u20acs known about the efficacies or interactions of different so-called \u00e2\u20acnatural medicines\u00e2\u20ac that her patients may be taking. \u00e2\u20acThe big thing is to tell the patient, \u00e2\u20acLet us know what you\u00e2\u20acre doing so we are sure that there isn\u00e2\u20act some kind of contraindication,\u00e2\u20ac\u00e2\u20ac she said. Dr. Kurtin errs on the side of caution: If she doesn\u00e2\u20act find much information about a particular herb or supplement, she\u00e2\u20acll suggest a patient not use it during active treatment. While guidelines about which complementary therapies are most effective may be incomplete, most groups, including the NIH and SIO, are encouraging physicians to ask patients what treatments they are using on their own. \u00e2\u20acWe\u00e2\u20acre trying to educate the physicians to ask and the patients to tell,\u00e2\u20ac said Dr. Rosenthal. This is one of the reasons many doctors believe it\u00e2\u20acs worthwhile to have an integrative medicine specialist included on the interdisciplinary care team.\u00c2 Dr. Rosenthal called involving a specialist a \u00e2\u20acno-brainer.\u00e2\u20ac Dr. Kurtin put it succinctly: \u00e2\u20acPatients get to choose [their treatment]. It\u00e2\u20acs their lives and their bodies. Our job is just to tell them what we know and what we "}
