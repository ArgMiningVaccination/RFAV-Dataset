At a mechanistic level, vitamin D boosts antiviral defences against other respiratory viruses, such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.67 Data from observational studies suggest that low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) may be a risk factor for severe covid-19.8 However, this association could be due to reverse causality or confounding910: both covid-19 and vitamin D deficiency are independently associated with obesity, old age (>65 years), and male sex, for example.
