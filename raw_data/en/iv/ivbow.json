THE CHIROPRACTORS' CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS CO)!HITTEE ( '..___ FOREWORD It is the purpose of this Committee to aid in re -establishing in the United States the Constitutional Rights of every American cit\u00ad izen in freedom to choose whatever method or . practitioner he may desire in the care of his health, and freedom to refuse any treatment or practitioner he does not desire\" This freedom was provided by our forefathers when they wrote the Bill of Rights into the Constitution, and is one of the most vital rights of any free people\" That it has not been successfully guarded, against selfish interests, is a national tragedy, one which must not be permitted to continue, contrary to the Constitution of our government. There is no more flagrant imposition upon our American freedom nor impending danger to the welfare of o_ur people than compulsory vac\u00ad cination\" We have prepared this compilation of facts to aid in educating and awakening ,the public to the serious consequences of pollution of the human blood stream through inoculation and vaccination because the vacillati;ng compliance of some can easily lead to compulsory vaccination. of all, its sole' purpose being dollar profit to the few.

ORIGIN VACCINATION To Edward Jenner, a natl ve of Gloucestershire,\u00b7 England, ls attri\u00ad buted\u00b7 the origin of the practice of vaccineA.ion. At tha-t time .there was a supers.ti tion among dairy ma.ids that anyone wh.o had bad cowpox 'fOUld never have smallpox. \"Cowpox consisted in an eruption.which now and ~hen appeared on cows' udders at certain \u00b7seasons and was rubbed by ignorant milkers into huge sores. When. the milkers hands were poi\u00ad soned by\u00b7 the .exudation large blisters \u00b7and ugly in\u00ad fiamed swellings and abscesses frequently resulted. This condition, known as cowpox, bore no more likeness to smallpox than the moon does to cream cheese.\" {From Dr. Walter H. Hadwin of Gloucester, noted authority on smallpox of that day.) No bull ever had cowpox, nor any cow \u00b7that had. not been milked. It developed by ~he d~rty or diseased hands of a milker on the teats of a milch cow. Its character was\u00b7 parallel with syphilis. Jenner who at the age of 16 was apprenticed to a surgeon and apoth\u00ad ecary by the name of Ludlow for a period of five years, never passed a medical examinatlo.n in his li_fe. In 1792, after he had practiced for :twenty years, he bought his medical diploma for the modest sum of . 15 .pounds. His first paper dealing wl th the Causes and _Effects of In\u00ad oculati\"o~ with cowpox was published in 1798. Later he developed what was known as\u00b7 horse-grease cowpox, of which a contemporary Dr. Squ_irrel said: \"On reading of Dr. Jenner's account of the origin of .cowpox (from horse-grease), I was struck with such horror and aver\u00ad sion that~ I could not, as \u00b7man of honor or telling, submit it or coincide with vaccination. What in th\u00b7e name of God could have induced him to have intro~uced a disease of so filthy a na~ure, and apparently, according to his own account, such a dangerous tendency? I s~ould have imagined that his ~wn des\u00ad cription would. have furnished him with the most powerful ar\u00ad gument against _it.\" Jenner inoculated his son, Edward, when a year and a half old with swine pox, and later the r~st of his family, and they all died of tu\u00ad berculosfs. A most ghastly history has followed Jenner's \"wonderful discovery.\" In the 9th edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica we firid that in ;J-870, 1,422 children under year of age were vaccinal syphilis i~-England and Wales; in 1880, these countries. +884, the number vaccination. At an Congress 1889~ Dr~ Gifford of France said: \"To Edward Jenner a great monument in memory has been ~rect-. ed, and upon its columns in -the\u00b7 future, if not in_ the pres\u00ad ent, generations will Acc_ursed be the , man by whos\u00b7e cunn :.ng device the blood of all nations has been poi\u00ad soned.'\" \\_ HOW SERUMS ARE 1 ( MADE (_ HOW SMALLPOX VACCINE IS MADE A calf is tied down to a table, and after its stomach has been shaved, from one to two hundred cuts or scratches are made in this shaven surface. Then a drop of glycerinated lymph - which is a cul\u00ad ture of small pox obtained directly or indirectly from human small\u00ad pox and other animal infections and passed through a solution of gly\u00ad cerine - is dropped into these cuts and thoroughly rubbed in. Within a short time the animal develops a high fever and becomes ,extremely sick. The cuts on its stomach become festering wounds which gradually fill with pus, putrid cells, and ulcerative disease. Natur\u00ad ally the torture which the poor creature suffers is unspeakable. About a week after the calf has been thus inoculated, it is again strappeC: to the table and the pus and scabs from these infected sores are care- . fully scraped and placed in a small crucible\" To this horrible,mass of putrid matter an equal measure of glycerine is added and the two are mixed thoroughly by means of a-small electric motor. It is then passed through a very fine sieve in order to remove the coarse pieces of rot\u00ad ten flesh, hair, etc., again thoroughly mixed and placed in tubes for .distribution throughout the ,country as pure calf lymph or smallpox vac\u00ad cines . It is this rotten stuff that our health boards, school boards and family physicians insist. upon injecting into\u00b7 the blood stream of millions of school children every year! But.this is not the worst. Dr.\u00b7 S. Monchkton Copeman at the Vic\u00ad toria University of Manchester, April 25, !9Oij, said: 11The most satisfactory material was found to be vesicle pulp, obtained in the post morten room from .cases\u00b7 \u00b7of discrete smallpox that had died during a comparatively early stage of the eruption.\" Dr . Copeman goes on to tell how, after this 11pulp\" \u00b7has been .mixed with glycerine, it is inoculated into monkeys, next into calves, and then into ch~ldren. Vaccine lymph made from vesicle pulp from sores in the body\u00b7 of a living patient is revoltingly unsanitary, and we hold, clearly_ an il\u00ad legal product. But what shall be said if made .from the putrid sores Dn a smallpox corpse? Rewritten from: Chas Assn. of Oregon's \"Beware! The Danger of Vaccines Dr. E. 8. Foote of New York put it very well when ne said: \"Give me liberty from pox of any kind, or give me death from something less unclean.\" .. ( Report of the Pennsylvania State Vaccination Commission Dr. Robert N. Willson, pro-vacclnal authority, testified before the Cbmmlsslon that he had made a somewhat extensive bacteriological examination of the contents of vaccine virus, and when asked to st te the kinds of organisms he found in\u00b7 the virus, he answered (Testimony, page 2123): \"All of the pus producing organisms, the streptococcus, the staphylococcus, the peneumococcus, etc.\" It might be added that -Dr. Willson found the above disease germs in vaccine virus that was ready for use when acquired by him ~or exam i .. nation. I \"Since glycerinated lymph in glass tubes has been used, te\u00ad tanus following vacci,,ation has greatly increased.\" -John Pl tcairn, member of the Pennsylvania State Vaccination Com-' mission., -0- In his report Mr. Loyster, a newspaperman who made an exhaustive study of vaccination after it had resulted in the death of his son, says: \"Many investigators, among whom may be mentioned Dr. Flexner$ the greatest living authority on infantile paralysis, have demonstrat .. ed that glycerination, on which manufacturers depend for starving out undesirable organisms, has no neutralizing effec~ upon any'member of a related group of filterable and ultra-microscopic germs to which belong smallpox, syphilis, infantile paralysis, hydrophobia and-others of the most terrible diseases known \" \u00b7 Dr. Victor C. Vaughan, former President of the American Medlcai Assoc- _latlon, Epidemiology and Public Health Vol.ume !, 1922: \":Usually, practically all bacteria disappear from the gly\u00ad cerinated preparation within a month. However, in all in-\u00ad stances whl te mice should be inoculated in order to prove the absence of the tetanus bacillus.\" ~Ba6terla In Vaccine, Encyclopedia Amerlcana 9 Vol. 27: \"All vaccine virus contains many varieties of bacteria, some of these may be pathogen\u00b7. c, but the majority a e harm less.\" Dr. William Brady, in Ohio State Journal, Columbus, Ohio, Octobe 21, 1923: \"Nobody has isolated a specifi,:: virus employed for vaccination. certain that the virus employed convey to . the subject 'vacclna,.ed as well as vaccinia.\" germ or organism f:: om the Nn one can be absolutely f . .:,' vaccination will not some accidental infection 5 6 ADMISSION OF INEFFICIENCY OF SMALLPOX SERUM In The Evening Star of Washingt-on, D. c., of October 9th, 1935, there was published the greatest expose of vaccination that I have\u00b7 ever seen so far. The heading read: \"Giving Smallpox to Test Tube Develops Cleaner TYPe Vaccine.~- There follows: \"Milwaukee, Oct. 9 -Four thousand who escaped scars by a new kindofsmallpox vaccine were cited as reasons for the health officials to reconsider the entire smallpox vacci\u00ad nation technique. The object is . to introduce wholesale tests of a new and cleaner type of vaccine.\u00b7 It has been developed the last three years at the Rockefeller Insti\u00ad tute, New York. * * * It is made by giving smallpox to a laboratory test tube instead of to a calf. The important difference is complete freedom of contamination in the tube - but never. in the calf.\u00b7 The vaccine obtained from the tube is free from the foreign and troublesome impuri\u00ad ties that are inseparable from the calf vaccine. So pure is this new vaccine that Dr. Rivers said it can be inject\u00ad ed hypodermically under the skin. The ordinary calf vac\u00ad cine is supposed to confer immunity for seven years. But this, Dr. Rivers said, has not been verified.\" H. \u00b7 B. Bradford in \"Is Vaccination WQrth the Risk\" points out that medical manufacturers and the medical profession have not waited until they had \"1'acclne free \"from foreign and troublesome impurities\" before they have attempted to force compulsory vaccination upon the public. They did not admit that \u00b7it was anything but \"pure'' nor that j.t \"had not been verified that it did not protect for even seven_years~r He goes on to say_: \"so pure\u00b7 is this new vaccine' - What does that mean? 'Pure' what -- smallpox pus? The only source from which to collect such frlth is from the pustules of smallpox corpses, and that is just where they collect the virus for this 'pure vaccine'\"\u00b7 FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE-VIRUS USED TO VACCINATE The Bureau of Animal Industry, Circular No . 147, and Farmers' Bul\u00ad letin No. 666, contain proof \u00b7 by the United States G~.vernment. that the epidemics of foot and mouth disease which swept this country in 1902- 1903, 1908, and 1914, w~re started from vaccine virus. The same ci~\u00ad cular, No. 147, pages 24-:-26, state\u00b7s that from 1902 to 1908, and very probably to 1914, thousands of school children. were. vaccinated under compulsion with virus containing the germs of foot and -mouth disease with a resultant debasement of the ~ood which may, in after years, result in complications of a very serious nature\" H,/Proffessor Milton J., Rosenau, director Hygjenlc laboratory, Wash\u00ad I n gt o n , D. C. , {one of t he m\"o s t n o te d b act e r I o 1 o g I s ts I n t he Un I t ed States), states in Bulletin No. 12, 1903: \"We are compelled to . vaccinate our patients with a virus d(mtal,.ning those causing vac- . cinia .. ooolt will be shown that there is practically no vaccine on the market free from bacterjal contamination. - We have found tetanus ( lockjaw) spores alive and viru\u00ad lent on dry spot$ after two hundred and ninety-five days and in-f lycednated viri,s sealed in ca,Pi fifty-five days . n ( HOW DIPTHERIA ANTITOXIN IS MADE A specimen is taken ~f the excretion from the throat of a patient suffering from diphtheriao Care must betaken that this excretion con\u00ad tain tl)e diphtheria bacillus, for many diphtheric throats contain no diphtheria bacillus at all~ This specimen is placed in a special beef broth which is kept at a certain even temperature in an incubator for ten to fourteen days, un\u00ad til the germs multiply a millionfold and the broth becomes alive with them. It is recommended that the meit used for making the broth should be kept for some days or until it has begun to putrify. The broth is then filtered and is then ready to be injected into horses. To begin with only a few drops are injected under the skin of the horse. These injections are made twice a week in gradually increasing doses over a period of five or six months until the dose becomes as much as a pint to a pint and a half, At fir!St these injections produce a great deal of constitutional disturbance -:-as we would expect such a blood-poisoning to do, The animal becomes feverish, goes off its food, it may have diarrhea and shivering fitsc But the injections are continued until the animal - if it does not die - ceases to show any reaction whatsoever. It is then said to be \"immune\" and its blood is supposed to contain an.anti\u00ad toxin capable of neutralizing the toxin or poison of diphtheria. Ordinarily, the third day after the last injection of poisoned beef broth the bleeding process be tins. To do this the animal Is head is firmly fastened and a long sharp pointed tube is driven into his neck over a large blood vessel< Through this tube from two to three gallons of blood are drawn from the animal and placed in a receptacle\" The blood coagulates and the clear fluid which rises to the surface---called serum--is put into tubes and sold at high prices under the name of DIPHTHERIA ANTITOXIN.-. This process is repeated from time to time until the animal is exhausted or dies. Even in the horror of the thought of injecting such poisonous matter into the blood stream of men, women and children, most of us are suf\u00ad ficiently humane to exclaim \"What about the horses\"? This continuous poisoning and loss of blood produce a torturing, lingering death\" Their organs often become so friable that they literally break to pieces and death is apt to occur from rupture and hemorrhageo And this is the way that modern medicine man is permitted by the government of a \"Christian country\" to torture an animal! Here is a sworn statement by the New York Anti-Vivisection Society from a former employee of the Rockefeller Institute: \"If Dr. Jobling or Dr. Flexner came .near the horses they would prick up their ears and move back and forth and seem to be afraid of themo They used the twitch, which is a cruel thing they used on the upper lip to keep them stil1 Horses would rather stand the bleeding patiently than have the twit~h. 7 8 \"Horses suffered a great deal after the inoculations. First the horse was inoculated; two weeks later he was bled: two weeks after this he was again inoculated. Then it would swell on the shoulder where he had been inoculated, and a lump would form, and the swelling would subside; afterwards the lump would burst, and then there would be an open ulcer with the pus running down in a steady stream all the time for about a week. That occurs with every horse they in\u00ad oculated for serum. \"The horses were in such pain that they would stand for hours witho.lit moving, and when they did move they would utter sounds I cannot describe, I can hear them yet;, rtcan never forget them; they were indescribable.\" (Oregon Anti-Vivisection Assn., \"BEWARE! The Dangers of Vaccination\") SEEN AND HEARD IN A VACCINE PLANT by Lora Ca Litt 1 e (exerpt) \"We also witnessed and heard of anti toxin production - not here to be described; saw the stable full of big horses, some weakly tott.ering and evidently approaching their end, They purchase broken-down draft horses, the larger the bet\u00ad ter, as they can furnish more blood than smaller animals. We saw one of the noble creatures in a room waiting to be bled, and plainly trembling in anticipation. He had been drenched with an antiseptic bath\" The bperator plillilged a sharp steel instrument into his jugular vein, and the horse jumped and cringedo A tube was placed over the wound and the blood flowed through it into a glass j aro The horses are first infected repeatedlywithdiphtheria cultures. They die in 'time from this abuse. \"No lov~r of horses but must have his heart wrung when he visits this department. The whole place became eloquent of torture; disease, disease everywhere, the silent suffering of the patient brutes, the shallow, calloused wr&tches who were tormenting them, the doomed human victims over the country to be tainted and killed as the result of these superstitious cruel ties - these were the images and re\u00ad flections that occupied my mind.\" \"The Hell of Vivisectton\" -- Anti-Vivisection Association of Oregon, Inc. No vaccine can be entirely satisfactory unless it ls known to con\u00ad tain the virus or germ of the disease in guesti~n. The vaccine issued by the War Office\" and afterwards by the Ministry of Heal th, was con\u00ad fessedly of a provisional nature since the causative agent was still uncertain. Its formula was as follows: TO MAKE ANTI-RABIES VIRUS (The account of an eye-witness, Mr. Herbert J. Reid, Fo S. Ao, Fo Ro S. I. (London), who visited the Institute Pasteur, February 22 and 23, 189~)- \"Upon an ordinary deal table stands a board, with four iron eyelets affixed, one at each corner. Upon\u00b7 the board ls placed the healthy rabbit, held by Jupille. Four leather thongs are produced, and slip\u00ad knots being made, they are passed over the fore and hind legs of the trembling animal. No anaesthetic is given. The unfortunate creature, being now completely bound and helpless, is ready for trepanning. 0The assistant holds the head, the operator uses a pair of sharp, surgical scissors, with curved blades, and clips off all fur from the head, which ls then moistened with an antiseptic solution. He next makes an incision about 3/4 to 1 inch in length, laying bare the skull. A little instrument is then inserted, which serves the purpose of keep\u00ad _lng \u00b7the skin of the rabbit recently cut, open, and facilitates the .coming operationo The wretched creature's skull is now completely bare, and the operator produces his trephine, an instrument used to cut out a pircular portion of the skull. It is worked by a little handle at the side, this movement acting upon a circular saw at the base, and some 30 revolutions are sufficient to pierce the bone. 0When this has been affected, the piece of bone, about \u00bc inch in diameter, is removed with a small instrument, and the animal's brain is exposed to view. The prepared virus is then injected into the brain;\u00b7 a couple of stitches put,through the skin closes the wound, and the rabbit is then removed to its pen, there to linger in incalculable suffering for ten days, dying slowly of artificially inpuced paralytic rabies o When it is dead its spinal marrow will in turn serve to in\u00ad oculate other healthy rabbits, and thus the succession of virus is se\u00ad cured, as also the continuity of dally suffering and torture for the victims. 0When I remarked the absence of chloroform, I was told it was used when necessary \u00a3or dogs, but never \u00a3or rabbits, as its effects would be more painful and injurious to the rabbit than the actual operation of trepanning. The conclusion is this -the rabbit is weakly and can offer but little resistance; moreover, it ls not accustomed to bite. 0The wretched animals I saw inoculated on Friday are today lying on their sides in their pens, slowly dying of paralytic rabies, their hind legs extended and powerless, but their eyes turned pleaqingly to\u00ad wards the visitor.

After Vaccination CASE OF HENRY PLANT ,_ 16 SERIOUS EFFECTS OF VACCINATION IN THE BODY The most scientific objection to the theory and p~aqtice of vaccina\u00ad tion and serum treatment is the harmful effect of vaccines and serums upon the lymphatic system of the body. The injection of these poisons into the lymph causes the lymphatic glands or \"nodes\" to become inflamed and swollen, as\u00b7 shown in the il\u00ad lustrations following; it further results in the poisoning of the body tissues and organs. (See illustrp,tions, following page, by courtesy of American Medical Liberty League, Chicago, Illinois) It ls the function of the lymph nodes to manufacture white blood cells, and, insofar as is possible, these cells destroy the harmful poisonous material which enters the body. However, .in ext-reme cases of vaccine poisoning, the nodes may become blocked and the blood per\u00ad mitted to absorb the toxic material, with the result that death from blood poisoning, gangrene, or other serious complications occurs. \"Hundreds of persons have died from .lymphatic poisoning following vaccination. It is a question whether severe vaccine poisonine is not more difficult to clear. than venereal 'f>oisonine. The sores follo\\tling suppuration after vaccination are almost impossible to heal in some instances. \"Remember\u00b7 this: Six swollen lymphatic glands in certain areas will make one ill. A dozen will put you on your back. And fifty vital glands blocked may cause death \"I would not be -vaccinated and tall:e the risk of complications for a $10,000 draft on the Bank of Englana. \u00b7 \" Dr. F. P.

Next in order, immuni\u00ad zation against whooping cough is advocated by many. Ordin\u00ad arily this procedure~ not advised prior to the second half\u00ad year of life. As a rule, when the child has reached 9 months of age l t should be immunized against diphtheria. At this time the. combined method of establishing immunity against diphtheria and tetanus may be adopted. Between the ages of 1. and 2 years consideration may be given to inoculation of the child with streptococcus toxin for the purpose of estab\u00ad lishing immunity against scarlet fever. Some hesitate to resort to the last named procedure because of the possibility of severe reaction. Vaccination against smallpox should be rep~ated when the child enters school and again before enter\u00ad ing college. Schick and Dick tests should be done when school age is reached in order to determine whether further. immunizing substances are required.\" The following poem was composed by a mediqal student, Winnipeg, Man\u00ad itoba, Canada. The above article makes more pertinent its ironic humor: 1) Inoculate for smallpox \u00b7 Inoculate for \u00b7tetanus, For fevers, chills and other-ills That daily seem to threaten us. 2) Inoculate with owl lymph To stimulate the brain, Inoculate wit~ monkey glands To make .us young again. 3) Inoculate for bunions Inoculate for mumps Inoculate for bald heads, eke nervous slumps 4j Inoculate for typhoid Inoculate for spavin, It's just as good as any way To waft our souls to Heaven. 5) But one fine day the laity Will move in self-defense To inoculate the doctors With a little common sense!

[ 154] 22 STATEMENTS OF AUTHORITIES ON VACCINATION In recent yea~s much discussion has been centered on the advantages and on the grave dangers of vaccination. Answering the question \"Who can be considered an authority on this subjectt\" we may well quote Hon, Arnold Lupton, who said: \"I would suggest that a real authority is a man who has de\u00ad voted years of his life to the study of the vaccination ques\u00ad tion unbiased by pecuniary advantares or. professional sym\u00ad pathy.\" Among these disinterested authorities we may mention the names of men prominent in science, medicine and literature, entirely opposed to vaccination: W. Van R. Bl i ghton, M. D.: \"It may furnish food for candid reflection, that tuberculosis has increased 300 per cent; skin diseases 276 percent, and cancer 600 percent, since the introduction of compulsor7 vac\u00ad cination. You cannot inject poisonous matter. into the blood without corn,pting it.\u00b7\" J. W. Hodge, M.D., Niagara Falls, N.Y., the noted antl-vacclnatlon- ist, exclaimed: \"Think of the unparalleled absurdity of deliberately infect\u00ad ing the organism of a healthy person, in this day of sanitary science and aseptic surgery, with the poisonous matter ob\u00ad tained from a sore on a diseased calf.\" Walter Hadwen, M.D., .M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., J.P.~ etc., England, the Indefatigable successful opponent of i.noculation and vaccination, has said: \"England appropriated 4,000,000 pounds sterling for tbe~care of soldiers (returned invalided from the war); I have treat\u00ad ed many such cases, and attribute their. i ltness to the re\u00ad sults of anti-typhoid inoculation.\" Dr. J. J. G. Wilkinson, England, once a Pro-Vaccinist, was urged to investigate the whole subject, which, with reluctance, he did, then stated: \"Not denying other forms of social wickedness, I, now after careful study, regard vaccination as one of-the greatest and. deepest of all fnf\"7Jls, abolishing the last hope of races, and the new born soundness of all the human family.\u00b5 H.

Crookshank, Bacteriologist, King's College, Eng\u00ad land, made an Independent study of vaccination. The result was the two ponderous volumes, \"The History and Pathology . of Vaccination,\" in which he denounces the practice as being uncertain, unscientific and dangerous. Quoting: \"Unfortunately a belief in the efficacy of vaccination has been so enforced in the education of the medical practition\u00ad er. that it is hardly probable that the futility of it will be acknowledged in our generation, though nothing would redound more to the credit of the profession and give evidence of the advance tnade in patholOBY and sanitary science.\" professor Alfred Russell Wallace, England, the great scientist, after exhaustive study, prep.ared an essay on vaccination, \"Vaccination a Delusion; Its Enforcement a Crime.\" Before the Royal Commission, Professor Wallace testified! \"While utterly powerless for good, vaccination is a certain cause of disease and death in many cases, ls\u00b7 the probable cause of about 10,000 deaths and annually of 5,000 inoculable . diseases of the most terrible and disgusting character ~ I affirm that vaccination is a l{igantic delusion; that it has never. saved a single life; but that it has been the cause of so much disease, so many deaths,\u00b7 such a vast amount of utter\u00ad ly needless and altogether undeserved suffering that it will be classed by the coming generations among the greatest er\u00ad rors of an ignorant and prejudiced age, and l ts penal en\u00ad forcement as the foulest blot on the generally beneficent course of legislation during our. cen-tury 11The successive Vaccination A~ts were 0pass~d by tneans of allegations which were wholly untrue and promises which have all been unfulfilled.

Much of this evidence has been furl'lished \u00b7 by medical doctors who have placed truth and science above the pocketbook needs of their profes&ion. Studies have. been made which strongly indicate that much of the heart trouble among children today ls directly traceable to serums in\u00ad jected into their blood. There has been a pronounced increase in heart ailments amon~ children during the last twenty years, according to re\u00ad searches made by the medical profession. Dr. J. V. De Porte, director of statistics for the New York Department of Health, revealed a sur\u00ad prising amount. of heart disease among _children in school where a survey was conducted. Rheumatic infection vas indicated in more than one-half of the cases. A study made by the famed Mayo Clinic some years ago, revealed that certain varieties of germs have an affinity for the heart valves. In exf,erimenting with g14inea-f,igs, the clinic found colonies of injected germs collected on the valves of the heart. Statistics compiled by the United States PUbllc Heal th Service re\u00ad veal that while heart disease in the United States has increased slight\u00ad ly over seven times in thirty years, endocarditis, which includes valv\u00ad ular troubles, has incr\u00b7eased nearly twenty times. The same source of informa~ion shows that valvular troubles and heart disease as a whole are very much higher in states where the population is dense, such as New York, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, where vaccination is used on a\u00b7greater scale. According to Louis I_. Dublin, statistician for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, heart disease is much higher \u00b7in immigrants from England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland and Germany, where vaccination has been compulsory for a great many years, than it is among native-born Americans~ He also notes that immigrants from Austria and Russia, where they have lagged in the use of vaccines, have a lower death rate than the native Americans, attributed to heart ailments.

McIntosh and Turnbull, two eminent British Medical Scientists informed the British Medical Society in July, 1926 that they' had in\u00ad vestigated hundreds of cases of encephalitis or sleeping sickness which is a form of paralysis. All of these cases had ended in permanent in\u00ad jury or death and had dirictly followed ~accination. (This information is provided by the Encyclopedia Britannica.) Hundreds of other similar reports in medical publications, especial\u00ad ly foreign, are made by doctors who tell of paralysis cases that fol\u00ad lowe-d vaccination of their patients. Epidemics of paralysis, \u00b7when they occur, follow wholesale vaccinations of children or -soldiers. There are other causes of paralysis but animal experiment and experience prove that vaccination and inoculation, serums or shots, are the chief cause. From the Report of the Commission on Smallpox and Vaccination of the Health Organ I zat Ion of the League\u00b7 of Nat ions, Geneva, August 27, 1928: \"The post-vaccinal encephalitis with which we are dealing has become a problem of its elf mainly in consequence of the events \u00b7of the last -few years in the Netherlands and England and Wales.

Brown, D.C. 32 THE PASTEUR TREATMENT FOR HYDROPHOBIA Much undeserved credit has been given to Pasteur for .his contribu\u00ad tions to health science; The National Anti-Vivisection Society of England collected from the official returns of Pasteur Institutes a list of 1,220 deaths after treatment between 1885 and 1901. Concerning these figures, Dr. George Wilson says: \"Pasteur carefully screened his statistics, after some unto\"\u00ad ward deaths occurred during and immeoiately after treatment, by ruling that all deaths which\u00b7 occurred either during treat\u00ad ment or. within 15 days after. the Last injection -should be excluded from the statistical returns. Because of this extra\u00ad ordinary ruling, the death rates in all Pasteur Institutes were kept at a low figure.\" The late Dr. Charles Bell Taylor in the National Review, July, 1890, published .a list of Pasteur's patients who had died after treatment while the dogs that had bitten them got well.

Health Bulletin, \"Tuberculosis, Its Predispos\u00ad ing \u00b7causes\" (Page 2) Tuberculin is an uncertain, unreliable and sometimes dangerous prod\u00ad uct.\u00b7 It is made .by putting tubercle bacilli, the living germs of tu\u00ad berculosis, into broth. These ~erms live and breed in the broth for several weeks until it is full of them. They eat the broth and\u00b7 excrete in it. Then this mixture of tuberculosis germs, their excretions, and the stale broth is cooked, the dead germs strained_ out, and what is left is called \"tuberculin\".. Quoting Dr. F. E. Harrington, Health Com\u00ad missioner of' Minneapolis, Minnesota, \"This substance is a quasi-toxin and is poisonous to the human body.\" This substance is what is introduced into the. human body in making tuberculin tests. Tuberculin tests (the \"Mantoux\" test, \"Von-Pirquet\" test, and others) are represented by their promoters to be reliable tests for tuberculosis infecti'on, \u00b7 and harmless. The following. quo~a\u00ad tions from recognized authorities show their unreliabi),ity and dangers. l \"It has been found that thousands of persons react to the tuberculin test who have no signs of tuberculosis, About 90 percent of all children between the ages of 12 and 13 and practically all adults w~ll give a positive reaction , Most people who react to the tuberculin te5't are apparently healthy and never_ break down from tuberculosis, although they have received living tubercle bacilli into their bodies, per\u00ad haps many tim_es.\" Maurice Fishberg, M. D., In his book on \"Pulmonary Tuberculosis\", quotes Sahli, the tuberculosis authority, as follows: \"When care Lessly ,Performed with excessive doses. latent or quiescent lesions may be flared up into activity, . , Living and virulent tubercle bacilli may appear in the blood after an injection of tuberculin. In some cases it is shown that hemoptysis is provoked by the test ... In general the re\u00ad action consists of a transient toxic injury to the body. and the nervous system bears the brunt of the traumatism .... The use of tuberculin for diagnosis purposes ought to be con\u00ad demned\" It is unreliable both positively and negatively. Diagnostic injections are dangerous.\" Esmond D. Long, Ml. D., in nThe Journal Lancetn, April, 1935, quotes from \"Tuberculosis in College Students\": \"People infected with tuberculosis, for constitutional rea\u00ad sons, vary in their sensitivity to tuberculin about a million times. A dose that will barely elicit a reaction in one will cause superficial necrosis (death of tissue) in the arm of another.\" Minneapolis' experience with Mantoux testing and X-raying of teach\u00ad ers and employees of the city's public schools for 1933 and 193~ was: Number injected with tuberculin (Mantoux test) Number electing to be X-rayed instead Total Mantoux tested or X-rayed 2190 1384 3574 Mantoux test (injected with tuberculin), 1078 or over 48% gave a positive reaction, the reaction claimed to indicate tuberculosis infection. Those giving this positive reaction were re\u00ad quired to have an X-ray taken. Although the Mantoux test indicated. that 1078 of those tested were infected with tuberculosis, as the re\"\"\" sult . of further examination, not one teacher tested by el ther or both methods\u00b7 had to be dropped from the staff because of tuberculosis -- a striking proof of the worthlessness of the Mantoux test as a means of diagnosing tuberculosis. The tuberculin injection and X-raying together cost the city of Min\u00ad neapolis a total of $6598,70. If the Mantoux test with its X-ray fol\u00ad low-aj> had been extended to include the Minneapolis school children, the cost to the city or their parents would have been close to $150.000, In the interests of good health, personal freedom and economy, every citizen should oppose the use of public funds for tuberculin testing and all other kinds of doubtful and dangerous inoculations and vaccin\u00ad ations.

The allocation for 1941 is $6,200. ooo. ( Facts Qleaned from The Journal of the. \u00b7American Medical Association, September, 1940). This tremendous expend! ture of the tax payers mone7 was not be\u00ad grudged by the public-minded tax payer, for he was faced b7 the fact. that in the past few rears, syphilis has steadily increased in the United States, and he realized that somethin~ ~hould be done about '1t. What he did not realize, because such information ls carefully guarded by those who profit from the manufacture of vaccines, ls that vaccina\u00ad tion, as Practiced today, is syphilizin; the human race! To substantiate this alarming statement we offer you the words of world~renowned medical men: H. Valentine Knaggs, L. R. C. P., (Eng.) In his \"The Truth About Vacclnatlonn, says: \"A\u00b7 careful examination of the available data relating to Jenner's first inoculatJons with cowpox matter direct from the cow shows that he was quite unable to produce a safe vaccine lymph from it which, after. inoculation, was free from symptoms indistin;uishabLe from those of syphilis. n Or. Knaggs says further: It ls equall7 significant, according to Dr. Deane, an Amer\u00ad ican physician of ~ood standing, 8that the Wassermann and No~uchi tests show positive in persons recently vaccinated, who have never contracted syphilis nor inherited it. 0 \u00b7 \"The Wassermann test is one upon which physicians now rely as a meane: of diagnosis in cases of syphilis. If the reac\u00ad tion is positive, the patient is considerec to be effected with that disease; if negative, to be free from it. \"1, myself~ subjected three tubes of vaccine lymph, obtained from three separri,t~ 'reliable makers, to the Wasserman-n test. They wert found to show a strong positive reaction. \" Dr. :Knaggs 1s 117~page book is filled with the opinions of high med\u00ad ical authorities on the vaccination q~estion. Every one of them is of the strong opinion that anti-smallpox vaccination is a fertile source of syphili_tic contamination. \"The Syphilis Campaign\", American Medical Liberty League, Chicago Dr. L.

Statistics complete the evidence by showing that the deaths from infantile syphilis per million births were, under enforced vaccination, l, 738, .as compared with 564 under voluntary vaccination.\" When the American government puts a stop to the unclean, unscientif\u00ad ic vaccination fetish, and substitutes education, sanitation, sensible hygiene and decent economic condl tions for the people, there will be 11 ttle to worry about from the standpoin-t. of venereal diseases. All the \"600\", mercury, bismuth and iodides in existence never did and never will cure syphilis. These murderous .concoctions only \"seal up\" within the human organism the ver\u00b0\u00a5 disease which they are claimed to cure. 'Henry Llndlahr, M.

The venereal virus is driven into the system. The poisonous antiseptics, alternatives or germi\u00ad cides lock up' the disease taints in the body. These taints are living germs which grow and multi ply like weeds in the soil they have permeated, _the entire organism. \u00b7 \"The disease diathesis or morbid cons ti tut ion due to such \u00b7suppression is frightfully on the increase. Popular con\u00ad sciousness would be shocked and hoI'.rified if people knew what an enormous percentage of our population ls affected direct\u00ad ly or indirectly by these venereal taints or rather, by the accompanying drug-poisoning.\" No sensible person objects to the sane control of the life-destroy\u00ad ing venereal diseases. But the orthodox medical profession has had thousands of years in which to show what it can do -- which has been worse than nothing at all. Now, let the so-called unorthodox schools of healing go to Washington and DEMAND that they be given sufficient funds to demonstrate the efficacy of THEIR methods of treating venereal diseases. The orthodox medical profession, through local, state and federal health departments, is putting on a campaign of \"scare\" pro_paganda calculated to frighten the people into accept.in~ all sorts of \"prevent\u00ad ive\" for the\u00b7 serum as well as { I ( ( F1G. by finger-nails. 38 The present syphilis campaign caps the climax in \"fear\" propaganda.

Beaney, ilelbourne, Australia, in his work on \"Constitutional Syphilis\", page 373, says: \"And I at once announce at the outset my firm belief that sy~hilis is in very many instances communicated by means of Child's Vaccine Lymph.\" It is a frightful thing to taint the blood of a great nation by vac\u00ad cinal syphilis, and it is about time we halted the infamous process. If the only way to secure immunization from tl1e long chance of smallpox is being vaccinated with a short and. close chance of the re\u00ad volting symptoms and exhibits of syphilis, then let the people have smallpox. If the great authorities we have quoted are to be believed, and they are as worthy of belief as the perpetrators of vaccination, then it is about time the State stopped making vaccination with its dangerous syphilitic tendencies, a condition for the education of the American boy, and the American girl.

While the public is assured that. vaccines are absolutely harmless,' medical journals abound in such articles as that. by A. E. Sennett, M.O. entitled \"Horse Serum Neuritis\" which appeared in The Jo'llrnal of the American Medical Association, February 18, 1939, p. 590. In it the author cites articles by 25 other author~, giving the daneers ad sine from horse serum, such as paralysis, tetanus, serum sickness, diseases of the nervous system, neuritis.

Medical literature shows these vaccines and serums to be not only dan\u00ad ferous, but still in the experimental staee.\u00b7 Or. Bennett goes on to say: \"Serum sickness prob~bly would occur in all cases if enough serum were given. Local itching, swelling, generalized urti\u00ad caria, fever, enlargement of lymph glands, polyarthritis many joints), general malaise, leukopenia, al\u00ad buminaria, fall of blood pressure and decreased coaguability of the blood make up the complete c~inical picture. \"Patients having profound atrophy within six weeks after serum disease are slowest to recover .

Its preparation, while conducted with the utmost care and under the best scientific supervision, does not preclude the chance of serious consequence\u00b7 due to contam\u00ad inating bacteria. The staphylococcus present in the ordinary commercial vaccine virus ( in spite of the\u00b7 glycerol and phenol preservative) may not be in itself pathogenic but by aiding anaerobic condition~ it certainly can, and does, prepare a favorable field for the growth and toxin development of the tetanus bacillus.

[ 153] 58 INFANTILE PARALYSIS SERUM The best informed authorities on the subject, including Dr. Josephine Neal and Dr. William Parks of the New York City Health Department Re\u00ad search Laboratories, have unequivocally condemned the serum on the basis of accumulated data. -They pronounced it to be of questionable value and actually injurious when used in certain manners. As early , as 1929 Dr. Josephine Neal had pointed out in her publications the dan\u00ad ger of the use of the serum in poliomyelitis, and had condemned it in no uncertain terms. All the cumulative evidence pointed to the fact that this supp~sed \"cure\" exploited by the Academy was both worthless and injurious Dr. Williams, himself, characterized the use of this serum at a hearing of the Board\u00b7 of Censors of the New York County Medical Society of March 11, 1932, as a \"clinical study\", or experiment on humans, un\u00ad dertaken by the Cammi ttee to prove or disprove the value, or lack of value, of the serum. At a discussion before the Society of Medical Jurisprudence on October 12, 1931, Dr. Neal said: \"I have always opposed the use of serum intraspinaily on ac\u00ad count of the c:onseque:rit meningeal irritation that so often follows sometimes .with.disastrous results.\" Or. Sobel, an eminent pediatrician, confirmed Dr. Neals statement In the following words: \"If the t.ruth were told about the use of the serum intra\u00ad spinall7, I am afraid that some sad stories would come out. I have some sood reason to believe that several deaths have occurred as a result of its use in this way, and while names s\u00b7ucb as status thymolympbaticus have \u00b7been used for the cause of dea\\h, it h~s been more directJ,y attributable anyt.\"bing else.\" The concurring statements -of Dr. Neal and Dr. Sobel make it clear that it ~s widely known in the medical profession that lt is a collllllon expedient of the medicai-social trust in its exploi tat.ion of public health to falsify records to make them show results desired by them.

He $aid: ~-\u00b7 \"'Her death was caused by an anaphylactic reaction. Such a reacti~n occurs about once in a million times. \"' I used the standard serum for scarlet fever. I took all the usual precautions. When she became i 11, I called in neighboring doctors. We used a pulmotor for half an hour. 111 The above appeared in the New York American, for May\u00b7 31, 1926. Little Margaret Burke was not sick. She had not been sick. There was no reason to think that she was going to be sick. one of her little playmates had developed scarlet fever. Her parents, deluded by the ancient myth of contagion and by the persistent stream of false and mis\u00ad leading propaganda for serums and vaccines which pours forth from our state and municipal health(?) boards, the.public health(?) service, medical societies, serum manufactures, etc., took her to their physi\u00ad cian to have her \"immunized\" against scarlet fever. Result:_ She was carried out of the doctor s office a few minutes later. in a coffin. Her death certificate gives as the cause of her death, ANAPHYLAXIS. They killed her. to save her, She was just one . more.of the millions of victims of medical ignorance and commercialism. While in conversation, recently, with a very prominent serum squirt\u00ad er, here in the East, he told me that he had known of cases where chiropractors had injured patient's spines. And occasionally a heavy\u00ad handed chiropractor does punch somebody a bit too hard,\u00b7 but 'the whole Chiropractic\u00b7 profession couldn't do as much injury with Chiropractic as ten physicians armed with vaccines and serums can do. Besides, there are no laws to force us to submit to spine punching. We can take it or leave it; we can do our own choosing. No one bullies, coerces, or compels us. Thus, in urging and forcing inoculations upo~ everybody, for almost every form of disease, boards of health(?), physicians and serum man\u00ad ufacturers are paving the way for greater evils than those they pretend to be fighting. Besides this, they are laying the foundation for nu\u00ad merous degenerative diseases in those who do not die of serum poisoning . .

It is a mistake to suppose that all the opposi tlon is due to lack of imagination or cranki\u00ad ness. \"Vaccination at the age of six months inflicts an infectious disease on the child at a time when its digestive mechanism is being rapidly modified, and many reasonable people, al\u00ad though convinced that vaccination will prevent smallpox, think that the advantages of immunity do not outweigh the disadvantages of its production. \"There is enough sense in the opinion to make Universal and full vaccination of infants ( as theoretically enforced by Parliament) impracticable in this country at the present time.\" VACCINE MORE DANGEROUS THAN SMALLPOX From Presidential Address by Dr. J. W. Carr, before the Medical So- ciety of London, publ ish~d in The Lancet (London), Oct. 13, 1928: \"An exceedingly mild form of smallpox has now been epidemic in this country for several years; ought we not seriQusly to consider whether a disease which causes such slight consti\u00ad tutional disturbance, such a~ almost inappreciable number of deaths, and so few, if any, after..:.resul ts, really calls for the elaborate and most expensive system of hospital isola\u00ad tion which we maintain for it, especially as we are told that in some districts it is considered preferable to have a pleasant three weeks in hospital with smallpox than to suffer from vaccination at home? Also, if the disease is really not more seriotis than chickenpox, let us treat it according\u00ad ly and not try to prevent it by giving another disease which may cause as much, or more, constitutional disturbance, and ln some cases as long, or even a longer period of incapacity \u00b7 for work. \"'fqe. results of vaccinia are not absolutely negligible, and unfortunately, .whilst the number of deaths from smallpox is now certainly much overstated, there is a possibi-lity that those from vaccinia may be understated. Moreover, it is now recognized that in a certain number of cases recently, the vaccination of children previously perfectly healthy has been followed by an obscure condition of encephal~myeli tis which not uncommonly proves fatal.\" From \"The Facts Against Compulsory Vaccination\" by H.

He received 230 replies which gave the names of 27 children who had died subsequent to vaccination and of nearly 100 who had been made seriously ill, crippled, or deformed for life. He then proceeded to carefully verify these statements through parents, _physicians, and those conversant with the cases. He found physicians reluctant to give details; in no case could he get any in\u00ad formation from hospitals. Faced with this appalling evidence of the evil effects of vaccina\u00ad tion, Mr. Loyster published at his own expense a pamphlet in memory of his son, summarizing the information gained through his investigation. In it he included the case histories and, when possible, the pictures of the more than 50 victims of this practice, together with the follow\u00ad ing conclusions: 1. That vaccination caused, directly or indirectly, the death of over 50 children in rural and suburban districts of New York State in 1914, as well as leaving an appalling train of illness. 2. That the cost in illness and destruction of child life was entirely out of proportion to the amount of.protection against smallpox ai~ tained or needed. 3. That vaccination of children is wrong in principle, not in harmony with the trend of the best medical practice, and should be al?an\u00ad doned. 4. That there was an ov~rwhelming and rapidly growing sentiment a\u00ad gainst -compulsory vaccination. 5. That the Department of Education should be free from the entangling alliances with the Department of Health; that compulsory vaccina\u00ad tiQn as a pre-requisite for an education should be done away with. Mr. 1oyster made a trip back to New York State from Florida in Feb\u00ad ruary, 1915,- expressly to appear before the Heaith Committees of the Senate and Assembly at a public hearing on the Jones-Tallett Bill to amend the sehool vaccination law. * Loyster was a newspaper man, a Republican leader in New Yo:i;-k Legis\u00ad lature, and head of the Globe Ticket Company in Philadelphia.

Siegfried, President of the Vaccination Research As~ sociatlon and publisher of the Quest Magazine presented the following argument on the negative side of the question and was declared winner by the vote cast by the radio listeners. NEGATIVE PRESENTATION The liberal attitude of my distinguished opponent toward the absorb\u00ad ing question of vaccination for smallpox deserves our highest commend\u00ad ation. His consent to discuss the question with me here today will accomp\u00ad lish the highest of all purposes--stimulate the diffusion of healthy thought. Let me emphasize that we bear no malice toward the individual physi\u00ad cian, whom we believe is sincere in preaching what he was taught. We . do oppose the system of exploitation and intimidation by which the questionable and many times dangerous operation of vaccination is made a condition for public scho.ol attendance in a free country. The statistics we will offer to substantiate our contention have for the most part been culled from the literature of medical sources. Were vaccination compulsory for the adult, he would have a measure of resistance. But, the school child is helpless to protest. Dr. ;./illiam Brady, M. D., on October 3('th, 1924-, in a syndicated article appearing in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, said-- \"The tricky method by which vaccination is made practically compul\u00ad sory in some communities is a thing the he21.lth authorities should be ashamed of--I mean the scheme which arranges one law to compel attend\u00ad ance at school and another to exclude the child that isn't vaccinated.\u00b7 That's an illustration of the unworthy methods of bad public health ad\u00ad ministration. People who back such legislation are too shifty to en\u00ad trust with the guardianship of public health.\" The Educational Law is used as a whip to force vaccination. Those advocating compulsion must consantly be reminded that it is the school that is public and not the child.\u00b7 Obsessed with unlimited powers the vaccinatofs not only push compulsion, but intimidate parents to believe that other vaccine inoculations are mandatory. We contend that the risks from vaccination are pox. The Vaccination Inquirer -- London, England, the figures of the Ministry of Health --greater than small\u00ad July, 1931--reports \"Only 94 children ( under 5) in England and Wales died of smallpox in the 25 years ending December, 1929, but 243 died of vaccination,\" \"In the United States, according to the official reports of the United States Public Health Service--64 deaths were reported following vaccination from 1925-1928--this is ten times greater than the smallpox risk,\" \"American Medicine\", March 1914, stated editorially: \"The growing opposition to vaccination is a matter of grave concern. This new move\u00ad ment,., is not the illogical and absurd anti-vaccinationist crusade, but is the conviction on the part of very intelligent men, that it is use\u00ad less to protect arainst an infection which they may never. encounter,\u00b7 This attitude is not confined to laymen, but is taken by those leading men in the medical profession who postpone vaccination of their own kith and kin until the last moment. Two world renowned men have con\u00ad fessed tous that they have had their children vaccinated only in obed\u00ad ience to public opinion and out of the profession So we hear men say\u00ad ing that there is not one chance in a million of their children beinf infected with smallpox, but that there is far more chance of a pus in\u00ad fection or tetanus from the vaccine. \" Remember, I am quoting from a medical publication. The medical profession is divided on the merits of vaccination, and we submit medical authorities to prove that vaccination is not a deter\u00ad rent to smallpox-- Dr. Reece: in Volume I, page 16, says: \"In one family we lately met with seven children laid up with smallpox, all h~d been vaccinated.\" Dr. A. the partic\u00ad ulars of4OO,OOO of smallpox in .,~-~\u00b7'\u00b7\u00b7 82 C I ar e n c e D a r row , t he n o t e d I a w y e r, i n a I e tt e r t o t h e s p e a k e r , o n February 26, 1928 . wrote-- \"I have no objection to anyone being vaccinated who wants it, but I do obje<:;t to compelling anyone to be vaccinated when he does not believe in it. If vaccination does what its advocates claim for it the person who is vaccinated ought to be safe no matter whether anybody else is vaccinated or not.\" The commercialism behind vaccine therapy is in a great measure re\u00ad sponsible for the keen desire to continue compulsion. Fifty-one vaccine manufacturers with an investment of over two hundred million dollars are licensed by our government for this business. What is the cause of smallpox? Perhaps Dr. Bol ker can tell you. The eerm of smallpox has not been isolated. With what measure of assurance can we know what the exudate taken from the festering sores of diseased calves will contain if the germ of smallpox cannot be seen in it? Is it not possible to have also germs of tetanus, tuberculosis, or lockjaw in our questions. He says: \"A quiescent malady might be lighted into activity by vaccination,\" and that \"This has happened with congenital syphilis -- occasionally with tuberculosis.\" We submit that the same agency--hygiene and sani tation--which have been given credit for the eradication of other filth diseases like bu\u00ad bonic plague, cholera, and black death, would have also vanished small-\u00ad pox, were it not for. the continued inf~ction by vaccination. Milton J. Rosenau, M. D.,--Dr. Bolker will verify the renown of Dr. Rosenau--Professor at Harvard, in his textbook \"Preventive Medicine and Hygiene\" .on page 3 says: \"Vaccination, then, consists in introducine the active Principle of cowpox~-cowpox or vaccinia is an acute specific disease to which many animals are susceptible, namely, man, cattle, camels, rabbits, monkeys, guinea-pigs, rats, etc.\" Smallpox, once a dread disease, is now so mild that it cannot be differentiated from chickenpox or poison ivy. Public Heal th News, New Jersey, for July 1931., page 150: \"Six cases of smallpox occurred among the colored residents of Newark, in April and May. The disease had existed for some weeks before a cOTrect diag-\u00ad nosis was made.\" If vaccination is safe, harmless, and gives immunity, why do our vaccinators and Boards of Heal th refuse to give a written guarantee that it will have no ill effects? -..__ schcol expel a single unvaccinated child as a menace to the others. Is it because vaccination does not protect the vaccinated? Vaccination is a graduate of the abandoned blood letting practice founded on a superstitious milkmaid s belief and later commercialized and pushed under the pretense of public health. Only 9 states in the United States have compulsory vaccination--4 states forbid vaccination as a school requirement. Holland has voted for optional vaccination until 1933 in view of the many encephalitis cases following vaccination. In England, where \u00b7vaccination had its birth, after eight years in\u00ad vestigation by a commission, vaccination was made optional in 1908 and has remained so. About 3% of the Australian people are vaccinated. For the last 20 years there has been an average of one death in 5 years from smallpox. NEGATIVE REBUTTAL You have undoubtedly been impressed with the painstaking detailed description of the methods of bringing the vaccine virus from its source--the smallpox patient--its continued passage through several animals and finally the sterilized vial for application by the vacci\u00ad nator. It takes about ten days until the festering sores on the calf have developed on its abdomen. Can you conceive of an animal being held in a holster during that period and kept spotless? Whether the calf and rabbi ts are suspended in the air or on the ground during the period of preparation, their exudate of pus is pus just the same. The addition of glycerine to make it colorless and the carbolic acid to be sure all germs or bacteria are destroyed, is the strongest indictment against vaccination. What does remain, according to Dr. Balker, after everything is destroyed, apparently is glycerine and carbolic acid and the carcasses of\u00b7dead bacteria. Why torture cows and rabbits for a little additional harmless fluid? The truth of it is that it is not harmless and is not devoid of germs. Why? Because the vaccine must be kept at a very low temper\u00ad ature. The ordinary ice box is not sufficient. Public Health Service reprint, number 111-2~, page 2, states: \"Small\u00ad pox vaccine cannot be kept too cold, it deterionztes even in an ice\u00ad box. 11 83 Dr. Balker unintentionally, no doubt, has confused inoculation which was practiced before Jenner was born and vaccination as it is under\u00ad stood today. There is a difference between the two. General vaccina\u00ad tion did not start until about 1850, and if Sweden had a death mortal\u00ad ity of 2050 per million up to 1801;: and during the period 1801 to 1810 without vaccination, the mortality dropped to 680 per million, who or what gets the credit for that reduction to 1/3? If my distinguished opponent wishes to prove his case by citing the 6 cases in Newark as being unvaccinated, permit me to quote from one of his journals, another group of cases, Hygienic Laboratory Bulletin, No. 149--page 3a-- \"Of 23 negroes who had recovered from smallpox and showed definite scars, 1 '7 were successfully vaccinated. Of these 1 was vaccinated suc\u00ad cessfully within a year, 3 between 1 and 3 years, 2 between 3 and 4 years, and 2 between 4 and 5 years after the disease.\" We agree with Dr. Balker as to his definition of a serum. .3ut, vac- cine for smallpox is emphatically not a serum. Vaccine is the substance containing the virus of cowpox. 2ut a serum is made in the division of blood from the solid elements. 1'1Y reference is taken from Dorland's Medical Dictionary. In conclusion, we join the immortal Alfred Russell ~/al lace who said: \"VACCINATION IS A DELUSION, ITS ENFORCEMENT A CRIME. 11 As copied from \"Quest\" Magazine THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF VACCINATION ( . AS A \" \" PREVENTIVE 86 VACCINATION AND INOCULATION DO NOT PREVENT DISEASE '.H111am Howard Hay, M. D., Buffalo, New York: \"We have no real proof of the boasted effectiveness of any form of anti-toxin, vaccine, or serum.\" \"Were not our boys in the army thoroughly protected? They were physically fit on admi.ssion to the army, else they could not have got by the examining boards; they were thoroughly, very thoroughly immunized against typhoid fever, Meningitis, Pneumonia, Influenza, yet they died like flies, not on the firing line, but right here at home, in the concentration camps, where they were surrounded by the finest sanitary pre\u00ad cautions that science could devise, and not only did they die, but they died of the very disease they were supposed to be immuned against. \"ls it any wonder the public is getting a little suspicious of us and our vaunted 'discoveries'? The wonder to me is that there. are still millions of them willing to submit to vaccination and serum treatment. \"The true figures on vaccination for smallpox have never got before the. public, though they can be seen in the files of the various departments of the Army as well as the Govern\u00ad ment, if one cares to ask for them. If the record of vacci\u00ad nation in the Philippines alone were ever to become a matter of general knowledge it would finish vaccination in the whole country, at least among those who are able to read and think for themselves. After three years of the most rigid vaccina\u00ad tion, when almost every little brown man had been vaccinated from one to six times, there occurred the severest epidemic of smallpox that the Islands had ev~r seen, with a death rate running in places to almost seventy percent, and in all, well over sixty thousand deaths.\" p. L. Clark, M. D., Chicago, Illinois, says: \"I hope to see the day when any doctor who so violates the laws of Nature. as to put directly into the blood stream a noxious, virulent poisonous nitrogenous fluid will be put in jail, and I am going to do all I can in enlightening _people to see that brought about. The administration of toxin-anti\u00ad toxin and the Schick test on children is use less, criminal and little short of murder.\" FROM THE RECORDS Massachusetts had her severest epidemic of smallpox after 68 years of continuous vaccination, the last 18 of:which were COMPULSORY! Th.i,s epidemic occurred among people the doctors proudly boasted as \"com\u00ad pletely vaccinated\"! (1873-74). Thousands had it and hundreds died of it, a~cording to the reports. This caused a lull in the boasting among the vaccinating doctors for a while. ( ( ( STATE HOUSE HEARING Revealed two memorable facts: A young Harvard Medical School grad\u00ad uate -vaccinated NINE times in succession - because the first eight \"didn't take\" -died of Confluent Smallpox after the NINTH vaccination-\u00ad in the Smallpox HospitalJII At the same Hearing, by way of contrast: A nurse (Dr. Hale Is Aunt), called the \"Boston Smallpox Nurse\" testi\u00ad fied that she had taken care of more than a hundred smallpox patients of all kinds from mild to \"confluent\" and had no fear of smallpox. She had never been vaccinated, and nothing could persuade her to be, she had seen such terrible results from it. Bulletin 8512 issued by the Surgeon General of the United States, states that one soldier out of each 5,000 contracted smallpox in the World War. --They were supposed _ to be protected. While during the same period our civil population had one case of smallpox to 40,000. Would you call that immunity? VACCINATED PERSONS ACQUIRE SMALLPOX MORE READILY THAN UNVACCINATED During the last great smallpox epidemic in New York City in 1901 and 1902, the City Department of Health issued a printed circular to doc\u00ad tors, dated in 1902, which clearly acknowledged -that the majority of all cases in this epidemic occurred in persons who had been success\u00ad fully vaccinated a few years previously, and not in unvaccinated per\u00ad sons. This statement was signed by Dr. Ernest J. Lederle, Commissioner of Health and Dr. Herman M. Bigg, Chief Medical Officer. \u00b7 Despite rigid vaccination laws, in the epidemic in Germany in 1817 there were 4000 cases of smallpox - all vaccinated that year. VACCINATED PATIENTS ILL WITH SMALLPOX Wm. Blackwood, M, D., of Philadelphia, who saw four thousand vacci\u00ad nated smallpox patients In the Municipal Hospital In that city, says: \"The indiscriminate vaccination of school children, with little or no regard for their state of health, heredity and living conditions, is really a very serious evil, \u00b7and is costing many more lives than you can get any idea of from the occasional accounts published in the newspapers. Cancer ex\u00ad perts have again and again called attention to the per'i L of inoculahng human beings with organisms having a more rapid gr-owth than nonnal ce L Ls of the human tissues.\" He remarks further that these cells may go to all parts of the body .and set up disease. 87 JS HOSPITALIZATION FOR VACCINATION The Report of the Surgeon XXXVIII, gives the number of 1918 on account of vaccinia, vaccination, as 10,830. General of the Army, 1919, Vol. 1, p. admissions to hospitals during the year the diseased conditions resulting from The report of the Surgeon General of the Army gives the number of admissions to hospitals during 1917 on account of vaccinia and typhoid vaccination combined as 19,608. Dr. Edgar M. Crookshank: \"I maintain that where isolation and vaccination have been carried out in the face of an epidemic it is isolation which has been instrumental in staying the outbreak, though vacci\u00ad nation has received the credit. Unfortunately a belief in the efficacy of vaccination has been so enforced in the edu\u00ad cation of the medical practitioner that it is hardly probable that the futility of the practice will be generally acknow\u00ad ledged in our generation, though nothing would more redound to the credit of the profession and give evidence of the ad\u00ad vance made in pathology and sanitary science.\" Dr. Edgar M. Crookshank was professor of Pathology and Bacteriology of King 1s College, London, England, and was writer of one of the great\u00ad est works in the English medical literature, \"History and Pathology of Vaccination\", London, 1889, which consists of two large volumes, pro\u00ad fusely illustrated, with early records of vaccination failures from Jenner. NATURAL IMMUNITY PROTECTS Surgeon J. P\" Leake, in an article published in .\"Pllbl ic Health R-e\u00ad ports\", the Weekly Bulletin of the United States Public Health Service, January 28, \u00b7 I 927: \"Will a non-immunized person contract smallpox if exposed to the disease? By no means uniformly. Exposure to smallpox, especially to the milder forms, without contracting the dis\u00ad ease, frequently occurs and is no definite evidence of immu\u00ad nity. The number of cases of smallpox among the unprotected persons in contact with patients suffering fro~ the disease is very much less than 100 percent . 11 SANITATION A VJTAL FACTOR Dr. C. Killick Millard, Medical Officer of Health for Leicester, England, In book entitled \"The Vaccination Question\", issued in 19111-: \"For forty years, corresponding roughly with the advent of the 'sanitary era', smallpox has gradually but steadily been leaving this country (England). \"Accompanying this decline in smallpox there has been a not\u00ad able diminution during the past decade in the amount of in\u00ad fantile vaccination. This falling off in vaccination is steadily increasing and is becoming very widespread.\" From \"facts Against.Compulsory Vaccination\", H. 8. Anderson (_ ( ( SMALLPOX IN THE PHILIPPINES For years the United States public Health Service boasted of the wonderful record made in clearing up smallpox in the Philippines by vaccination. But this record has been a muted subject since 1918-19 when, after 12 years of systematic vaccination, these Islands exper\u00ad ienced one of the most a1-palling epidemics of smallpox ever known, with an almost unheard of percentage of deaths in prbportion to the cases. According to the Report of the Philippine Health Service for 1918 ( page 8) there were 47,369 cases and 16,477 deaths that year from small\u00ad pox. On page 24 of the Report of the Philippine Heal th Service for 1920 we find that there were 60,612 cases and 43,294 deaths from small\u00ad pox during. 1919. SRys the Masonic Observer, Minneapolis, Minn., December, 1921: \"Think of it -less than 11,000,000 population in the Philip\u00ad pines and 107, 981 cases of smallpox with the awful toll of 59,741 deaths in 1918 and 1919, and bear in mind that, in all human probability, the inhabitants of the Philippines are as thoroughly vaccinated and re-vaccinated as any people in the world. \"Systematic vaccination started in the Philippines in 1905 and has continued ever since. rt is certain that over ten million vaccinations for smallpox were _performed in the Phil\u00ad ippines from 1905 to 1917 inclusive, and very probable that the vaccinations nuF,bered even as many as fifteen million during that ~ime. This can be verified by reference to re\u00ad ports of the Philippine Health Service.\" Speaking of the 1918 epidemic, the Observer has to say: \"***The highest percentage of mortality, 65.3 percent, was in Manila, the most thorouehly vaccinated place in the Islands, the lowest percentage of mortality, 11. 4 percent, was in Min\u00ad danao where, owing to religious prejudices of the inhabit\u00ad ants, vaccination had not been practiced as much as in most other parts of the Islands. To the everlasting shame of the misnamed \u00b7 \"heal th\" service, vaccination has been largely forced on Mindanao since 1918, in the face of this direct proof that their people were safer without it; and with the result of a smallpox mortality increase to above 25 percent in 1920. \"In view of the fact that sanitary engineers have probably done more in Manila to clean up. the city and make it healthy than in any other part of the Islands, there is every reason to believe that excessive vaccination actually brought on the smallpox ~pidemic in spite of the sanitary measures taken to prom\u00b7ote heal th. ''It is also highly significant that the statistics of the Philippines health service show that there has been a steady i:t;i.creas_e in -recent years in the number of especially typhoid, malaria, beriberi and tuberculo\u00ad sis\u00b7. Is it reasonable to believe that the very thorough campaign\u00b7 of vaccination and serum inoculations of various kinds. is responsible in at least some degree for this? You can answer the question for yourself.\" 89 ' I I .90 \"The great smallpox epidemics experienced by highly vaccinat\u00ad ed Germany and Japan have now been duplicated in the Philip\u00ad pines.\u00b7 How much longer will reputable physicians continue to \u00b7 stand sponsor for the deadly delusion that vaccination is a harmless method of immunizing against smallpox?' \"It is not surprising that many hones\u00b7t, conscientious medical men still believe in the merits of smallpox vaccination, be\u00ad cause the truth about its dangers is carefully kept from them by those who should inform them. Neither is it surprising that some doctors who do know the truth refuse to come out openly and condemn the practice. Once the medical profess ion frankly admits that vaccination is a complete failure, and they will have to do it, the bottom falls out of the whole vaccine and serum theory. They are verily 'between the devil and the deep sea.' \"The medical_ly controlled Navy and War Department of the United States still continue to offset sanitary measures taken for the protection of our soldiers and sailors and to lessen their resistance to disease by compelling our men in the service to pollute their blood with vaccines and serums. How long must we wait for heads of these departments with backbone enough to defy the medical clique and protect our men?\" Vaccination - Does Prevention Prevent? \"\"'In the province of Rizal, near Manila, after twelve years of en\u00ad forced vaccination, the smallpox death rate was 67. 24% in 1918, the highest ever reported in the history of smallpox. rn Leicester, Eng\u00ad land, where vaccination had been abandoned for two generations,\u00b7 the death rate in 1904 among the unvaccinated was 1.56%. Is Vaccination Worth its Risk-H. B. Bradford VACCINATION INEFFECTIVE The late Dr. Walter R. Hadwen, M.D., M.R., C.S.

Diphtheria serum has killed, without doubt, thous\u00ad ands of children directly, though it has. never had the slightest effect in preventing or curing diphtheria itself, and I challenge anybody to prove that it has ever saved a single life. rt is based upon superstition, it is built .upon scientific theories, it is manufactured at the expense and\u00b7 the torture of animal life, and it is the ere at est dis\u00ad erace of the medical profession that the world has witnessed i.n the course of the centuries.\" ( ( .. . ) A 2 REPRINT FROM LETTER IN NEW YORK MEDICAL WEEK \"It might be interesting to note that the majority of cases of diphtheria which I have seen during the past -year have been in children who have received toxin-antitoxin at _the hands of our public agencies.

We have used influenza vaccine in great quan\u00ad ii ties, all they could make in the Army Laboratory, and have used all that Dr. McCoy could spare, and also have used that which Dr. Park has furnished us from the New York Laboratory and I do not hesitate to say that it has not done one bit of good Any man, whether he be in private life, in the army or in Public Health Service, who vaccinates anyb<;>dy for pneumonia or for influenza and tells him that it is going to prevent the disease is not telling the truth.\" \"This too must be admitted: Again. and again, our hopes for prevention -by vaccines or nose sprays, and for cure by ser\u00ad ums, have been disappointed.\" ( Our daughter Ivan, age 19 years, had always been one of the beal.th\u00ad ieHt, happiest girls I have ever known. In her whole life she bed nev\u00ad er been sick, BDd she had what seemed to be a perfect body. People veey often remarked about ho\" well she looked, that she \"Just glowed with health\". She simply abounded in energy and _never seemed even to get tired. After working all day she would come ho-full of animation, ready for anything. She loved to dBDce and would turn on t!le radio and dance alaost every evening. The first of May this year, at the insistence of her employer, she was giviln diphtheria anti-toxin. A few hours after she took it she came home aiserably ill, td th a high fever, and delirious. Sha never saw another wall day. Almost immediately her arm b&caJ1e highly inn1111- ed, red, and swollen, BDd a large red lump appeared where the anti\u00ad toxin was injected. It was six weeks before this lu.ap disappeared. The first week after she was innoculated she lost five pounds, BDd while she insisted on tcying to work it was all she could do to stay on her feet. As soon as she begl!ID to recover from the most severe resul ta of the anti-toxin, her em_j)loyer had her vaccinsted for small pox. After that her condition grew steadily worse. Tha first of June we consulted another doctor. He was very much puzzled by her conditiol\\, admitted that he did not know what was wrong with her, and ordered her to bed for six weeks. 1/e asked hi whether he tho'llght it was fr011 the serums she bad taken but he <lid not seem to want to discuss this. He admitted that it could be, but insisted that it probnbly was not. By the aiddle of June she was bedfast and running a temperature of 104 to 105 ~or several hours evmy day. The doctors then pronounced her tubercular, and the Diddle of July, at their insistenco, we took her to the Tubercular Sanitarium in Talihina Oklahoma. ll'e questioned the doctors in the sanitariu:a as to whether the serus she had been giv'!n could have caused her condition, but they said probably not and refused to discuss it further. She grew steadily .-orse, losing weight constantl;y until she was a ere shadow. Fro her normal weight of 115 pounds she went to 80 pouods. Bowever through all her illness she never coughed. _ On September 5rd, Just four onths fro the ti.me that she was giveri the <llphtheria a:oti-torlD, she died.

SERUM FOR POLIOMYELITIS (INFANTILE PARALYSIS} lo the Editor -What ls the present status of convalescent serum in the treatment of anterior poliomyelitis? J. G. Woodin, M.D., Grand Island, Neb. Answer: -A simple and unchallenged answer cannot be given on the beneficial. effect of convalescent serum in the treatment of acute an\u00ad terior poliomyelitis. * * * Al though the early w.orkers in t?,~s field were unanimous in stating that convalescent serum tended to prevent the spread of paralysis and aided in the recovery of paralysis, present day workers view this early opinion with skepticism. At the pr_eserit \u00b7 the matter ls to be considered somewhat undecided but with the potentfal field o~ usefulness of serum markedly narrowed. Reaction against the wholesale indiscriminate use of convale_scent serum dates from the report. of Park on\u00b7 the New York epidemic of 1931, This author reported on the seruin treatment of half. of the patients from\u00b7 a group of 927 i~ the pre-paralytic. stage.

[ 159] 96 DECLINE OF TYPHOID IN THE ARMY According to Sir .William Osler (and these figures have never been disputed) \u00b7the attack rate per 1,000 men in 1898, was 88. 56 and the death rate 9.74. In 1899 the attack rate was 22.98 and the death rate \u00b72.78. The decline continued until 1908 when the attack rate was 3.,2 and the death rate .32. There was no typhoid inoculation in the army previous to March, 1909. It will, therefore, be seen that the disease had almost disappeared before inoculation was begun. This Is from u. S. Health Report: \"During the Chateau-Thierry offensive, diarrheal diseases were prevalent in the troops, approximately 75 percent. The high incidence of intestinal diseases in this sector was due to the entire disregard of the rules of sanitation. \"Following the offensive in the Argonne sector, typhoid and paratyphoid began to be reported from practically all divi- . sions engaged in that offensive -874 typhoids. and paratyph\u00ad oids have been reported in the A.E.F. since October 1, 1918. \"In July, 1918, a unit of 248 men from Camp Cody reached. Eng\u00ad land with typhoid prevailing extensively; 96 men or 39.5 per cent were ill with the disease and the case death rate was 8. 41 percent. It was evident that the men were exposed to infection through contaminated drinking water while travel\u00ad ing in the United States. The unit had been vaccinated a few months prior to the occurrence of the epidemic.\" Protection against typhoid by inoculation seems to be effective only when the men are not exposed to any infection I The statistics of the Registrar General of England say that the typhoid death rate in Great Britain fifty years ago was 390 per million. In 1917 it was only 28 per million. As the reduction at home was not due to inoculation, why ascribe the reduction in the army to that cause? It should be noted that intest~nal diseases, which might ordinarily be classed as typhoid, were listed as paratyphoid dysentery, diarrhea, enteritis, and pyrexia, thus putting typhoid inoculation in less bad repute than is shown by typhoid statistics. A soldier is as a rule quite ill before being ad\u00ad mitted to hospital; yet the U. S. Army Report of the Surgeon General, for 191'7, shows up to that date, the admissions to hospital from ty\u00ad phoid vaccination and vaccinia reached the great number of \"Beware! The Dangers of Vaccination\" Oregon Anti-Vivisection Association TYPHOID FEVER TREATMENT Improved knowledge of the nature and causation of Typhoid Fever has not ledto a specific treatment, nor have means been found to cut short \u00b7the illness, though its fatality has been reduced.

This we atteinpted to do\u00b7 in three ways: first, by education; second, by frirht;- and third, by Pressure.\u00b7 \"We dislike very accomplish more education, which much to mention fright and pressure, yet they than educ at ion, because they work faster than is normally a slow process. * * * :During the months of March and April we tried education, and vaccinated only 820 000. During. May we made use of fright and pressure, and vaccinated 223,000 people. \"Our educational program consisted of warnings in the daily papers, smallpox posters on the streets, in stores and factories, special smallpox bulletins for all large places of employment, and special letters to all large employers from the health de\u00ad ~artment and the association of commerce, calling their attention to a threatening smallpox epidemic. The radio was also made use of in this work. \u00b7 \u00b7 \"As the conditions grew worse, we felt justified in using stronger measures. We had some good pictures taken of patients suffering from the confluent type of smallpox, and had posters, showing these pictures, distributed all over the city. The moving pic\u00ad ture theaters cooperated at this time by issuing warnings on the screen. \"The newspapers published dally the names and-addresses of people dying from smallpox. A second letter was sent to all factories, stores, and other places of business, informing them of a rapidly approaching smallpox epidemic, and advising them to have their employees vaccinated immediately, and thereby prevent a serious financial loss to the city which might occur if a real epidemic developed. \"At this time the department was vaccinating thousands of people dally, but there were still too many who.could neither be educat\u00ad ed nor f-rightened foto vaccination.\u00b7 Cases and deaths each. amolllit-:\u00ad ed to a considerable number, and we now felt justified in using all of the power a health officer has, and if that was not \u00b7enough, to get more. \"We sent out a third- letter to all employers requesting them to have all of their employees vaccinated and at the same time in\u00ad forming them that if a smallpox case developed in their place of employment in the future we would consider their place of busi\u00ad ness a menace to the health of the community and very likely place the entire establishment under quarantine until it could be cleaned up and made safe for the public. Putting tlzis responsi\u00ad bility on the employer drove in thousands of ~nti-vaccinationists who could better afford to get vaccinated\u00b7 than lose\u00b7 their jobs.

We Quote: Gentlemen:- I recently received from you in the mail letters requesting contribu\u00ad tions to ~he several activities in which you appear to be interested. You, Dr. Fishbein, say \"Keeping or lo~ing your health depends largely O?, you. After aJ:l, isn It lack of understanding one of the primary rea\u00ad sons for _ill health and sickness?\" And you, Mr. Brice say If you -- or anyone 'dear to you should develop .cancer or a similar disease you would realize only too well the vital need for, expert c~re.\" And you further say \"How much more hopeless the si:tuation would be if you had no funds for medica]. care -- for an afflic\u00ad ti.o:i;i whicl.l requir~s special treatment for a long time.\" .Ana\u00b7 you, Mr. Letchworth, request a contribution f9r\u00b7 the United Chari\u00ad ties F-uIJ,d in Philadelphia -:--a fund, I am\u00b7 informed, raised in the- name , of''Charit~ a_na\u00b7 used to' a very considerable extent ~o help finance and carry the over-crowded medical profession in its work of combating ill_s brqught upon humanity by such practices \u00b7 as vaccination and inoculation aga~p~t Smallpox and o~her diseases. It.may be that yo~do.not know what vaccination and inoculation are -\u00ad i:t may ,be that you do not lrnow that th~se practices consist of putting the \u00b7pu:t;,rid d~scharge from the running sores of diseased\u00b7 persons and ani- \u00b7. \u00b7ma\u00b7ls '3.nd other of' \u00b7he.alt.by it so\u00b7that in person:S sus\u00ad cepiti!ble- .to particular diseases, _one disease or another may result either imme.diately or at some time in the future.

These practices sow the seed of Infantile Paralysi~, Tet\u00ad anu_s_, Syphilis, Cancer, Consux~p_tion \u00b7and\u00b7 other loathsome makers contend- that their product isnt, so\u00b7 harmful be\u00ad cause it conies .fr.om a calf after origi~ally coming from a human being; believing apparently that calf pus is not so pad as human pus after the hunia~. pus has\u00b7 been smeared into the calf and has festered on the calf ,into:'.,calf pus\u00b7. -~ut there a_re reasons why calf pus is-a worse substance to introduce into. the human c!rculation than human pus ( or human cellular\u00b7 substance), for observe: The calf cells multiply 15 ~r 20 times as rap\u00ad idly as human cells. These calf cells introduced into the human circu\u00ad lation are not digested as they would be if taken into the stomach -\u00ad they rel)lain living cells indefinitely. Killing th.e calf does not at once kiit tne cells of the animal as many Biologists will testify. Thus get\u00ad 'king into the circul~tion, the foreign cells are carried through lymph clluGts to \u00b7\"gla-nds and there deposited. Should. they retain life and sub\u00ad sequently multi ply as they undoubtedly do in many cases, they multi ply according to :.heir nature, rapidly -- c2>u~ 1ng bunches, Tumt\u00b7rs, Cancer, 119 c:!!ri \u00b7 other morbid growths that have had their most rapid \u00b7increase since oovine vaccines have become the rule.

Out of what he\u00b7ll of research could the idea of such eraftine have s\u00b7/vune but fr-om that lowest reeion'where misnamed doctors combine disease cultivation witk animal torture.and carry it on as their life .work? These practices have been made legal in some of our States just as Slavery\u00b7 was\u00b7 legal before the Civil War. But as Abraham Lincoln said\u00b7 You can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time, but not\u00b7 all the people all the time.\" The peop e for the most part have been fooled and misled -- either gnorantly or inten\u00ad tionally -- but they are waking up and sooner or later these pract ces are going to be mad.- illegal and are going to be stopped. No longer will it be req~ired \u00b7by law that a man or his child submit o a medica1 prac\u00ad tice or operation which may induce a disease to which he is ~us\u00b7cept \u00b7 b1e, depriving him of his life, h~s health\u00b7 or his bodily security.

Yours truly, H. EUGENE GARDNER .:u COMMERCIALIZED \"PHILANTHROPY\" It is our firm and honest belief that the influence and results of medicati~n in general, including vaccination and inoculation, are so opposed to natural law, and therefore detrimental and dangerous to the welfare of humanity that, if allowed to run their natural course, these practices would have long since been condemned and discarded. Why then do such practices continue '1 What is the force which pro\u00ad vides for the propagation and enforcement of such nefarious practices on people who would be ~uch better off without them? Probably no. better example of the commercial forces behind medicine can _be found t.han the Rockefeller interests, who are purported to con\u00ad trol 6a% of all the drug stock in the United States, and a goodly por\u00ad tion else\u00b7where in .the world. Oddly enough, the public at large knows only of the Rockefeller oil interests;.the Rockefeller string-pulling, behind~the-scenes control of medicine is zealously guarded from public observation .. There is good reason to believe, however, that the Rocke .... fe.ller. interests \u00b7 have made more of their millions from chemical and drug manufacture than from oil prod~ction itself! L~t us look behind the medical \"front\" for a moment at the Rocke\u00ad feller \"philanthropie~\". There are three: Th~ Rockefeller Institute for Medical \u00b7Research, the General Education Board, and the Rockefeller Foundation, organized in the order named. Through them control reaches \u00b7into manufacture ahd sals of drugs; into the public \"charities\" which dispense \"free\" drugs and medicines; \u00b7to business and legislation; and perhaps their most\u00b7 evil effect of all is the. finger of control which . reaches i~to t~e med.ical. as well as general educational ins ti tut ions of our nationo Upon ~he latter we will elucidate. The following-quotation is from the book,. \"Your Life is Their Toy\" by Emanuel M. Josephson, M. D., pub\u00ad lish~d by\u00b7Chedney Press, New York City: \"CONTROL OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS GAINED\" \"The -prog~ess made by the Board (i.e., the General Education ?oard mentioned abov~) was disclosE:d in an article in the New York Globe on March 28, 1919, by Dr. Wa S. Spillman, formerly Federal Farm Management Chief, ~s follows: 1 I was approached by \u00b7an agent of Mr. Rockefeller with the statement that his object .in\u00b7 establishing the General Education Board was to gain control of the educational insti- . tutions of the country so that all men employed in them might be 'rifht'. I was then informed that the Board had been successf~l with smaller institutions but that the larg\u00ad er institutions had refused to accept the Rockefeller money with strings tied to it. -My informant s~id that Rockefeller was\u00b7going to _add $100,900,000 to the Foundation for. the ex\u00ad \"The -Board event~ally succeeded in gaining control every school, college and university.in the country. over almost They found ( ( ( it hard to resist the lure of the jingle of read7 cash.\u00ad were forced to turn over to the Board power of dictation of f>ersonne L and curriculum. Senator Kenyon, of Iowa, reported to the u. S. Senate in January, 1917.\" They their this What, in simple language, does this report mean? It means that the Rockefeller interests \"endowed'' medical and general educa-r,ional. lnstl\u00ad tutions with huge sums. of money so that they in turn might. control what was tauf!ht, who taught it, and how it would be tauf!ht. In this way public, private and other \"educational\" institutions become simply in\u00ad struments of propaganda for the medical ma-nufa.cturers. \u00b7Their instruc\u00ad tors become mere puppets. They must teach not what they believe is true, but what they are paid to teach by the medical manufacturers whose financial aendowments pull the strings. And what are the dividends to the Rockefeller and like interests? .Dr. E. M. Josephson points them out in hi& Your Life ia Their Toy: GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD DIVIDENDS\" The direct dividends derived from the activities of the G~neral Education Board were many, including: \"Favorable publicity for the founders and advertisin~ of their interests that was worth millions. \"The power to influence public opinion and the policies of the Government by propaganda distributed through the schools, _colleges and universities. \"Control of researches and discoveries and their application and profits. \"The power of vot\"ing the stock holdings of the institutions which they control and of dictating the expenditure of their funds. \"The power of appointment of personnel of the institutions which can be .converted to the uses of nepotism and favori t\u00ad ism.\" These great financial interests co~ld be benevolent instruments for human welfare, but ins \"ead their fingers of greed reach into and pol\u00ad lute every otherwise authentic human health program. The vaunted re\u00ad searches and discoveries of the Rockefeller Institute have ~een few in\u00ad deed\u00b7 in comparison with the large sums .of money expended. And in a large proportion they have later been proved unfounded. But peverthe\u00ad iess, the gre.at medical and politic al pressure continues, to protect the reputations of the pseudo-discoverers and of the Institute. 'And the \"discoveries\" are financed in proportion to the profits .they pro\u00ad vide from the sale of drugs and medicines. The Rockefell'er Foundation functions mainly as a \"tax-exempt [!US\u00ad lness-relations agency and super-diplomatic cor:ps\". Through it, big business gains entry into many governmental circles from which its in\u00ad terests would otherwise be excluded.\u00b7 121 : 'i 122 They are thus able to gain favorable legislation and privileges that result in a virtual medical \"trade monopoly\", to the detriment of the ma.sses, AND THEY DO IT UNDER THE GUISE OF PHILANTHROPY! If ever the blind-fold is stripped from the eyes of the human guinea\u00b7 pigs; if eve\u00b7r the sham\u00b7 of medical \"research\" is exposed, and American educational institutions are left free to teach health TRUTH in place of Prop_afanda, then we are bound to see a revolution in the healing . arts that will be widespread and all-inclusive. Then n,atural healing methods will_ come into the place which their value rightfully deserves. And hum~n health and longevity will be _the beneficiaries. In-all th.is we do not indict the medical practitioner as an indivi - dual. ~e is but a puppet, an advance salesman for the greed. of the medical ~anufacturer; \u00b7 he practices the perversi~n he is taught in ~he schools paid to teach it. If he refuses to do so, he is ostraciz.ed by his prof~ssion, and if he takes his own \"medicine\", he pays the penal\u00ad ty. There are a fev{ exceptions, men in the healing arts courageous e\u00ad . nough to fight the overwhebning tide of medical-maI).ufacturers' influ\u00ad ence: But their punishment for adhering to what they know is true is meted ou.t with a harsh \u00b7and heavy hand. It i~, upon the shoulders of the thinking people of our nation, and the.human gui~ea pigs of the medical.manufacturers, to correct .the con\u00ad dition: to insist upcm their Constitutional right to healtlJ, and life througl). the prac_!,iti6ner and method of their own choosing.

VACCINATION RECORDS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES MEXICO In the ten:-year period 1921-30 inclusive, Mexico had 96,526 fatal-: i ties from smallpox against o_nl.y-3,483 fa tali ties from smallpox in the United States. In Mexico the sanitary _code of_ 1926 prescribed _com\u00ad pulsory vaccination at biri,h, and re-vaccination every 5 years. In the Un~ted States, on the other hand, only 9 states have required vaccina\u00ad tion; 6 have local n~tion. ENGLAND REPUDIATES COMPULSORY VACCINATION England, the home _ of v~ccination, modified her compulsory v_ac.cina\u00ad tion _ \u00b7 Today vac._cina\u00ad tion in England is optional. Since 1930, the incidence of smallpox in England has steadily fallen and in 1933 was at a \u00b7very low level -_ only 631 cases and 2 fatalities being reported in 1933: Less \"than one-half .of - infants are now being vaccinated following the passage of a conscience clause which fias the effect of maki~g vaccinatio~ optional. JAPAN Japan is ii favorite example of the \"blessings\"_ of vaccination. \u00b7In Japan, under the law of 1874, strengthened in 1885,\u00b7 vaccination is com\u00ad pulsory during the first six months bf life, a.gain at six years, still_ again at\u00b7 fourteen, and after this whenever smal,lpox occurs. For all' males there is still further vaccina\"tiion. on entry to the _army or_ navy._ The law is strictly e3:1forced a:np. complied with, there being, as stated _recently as 1906. by Surg!=!on-General Takaki:, no anti-vacc~nist_s in Japan: Of this. paradise \u00b7of_vaccination it is said: \"_Smallp\u00b7ox, once the scourge of the island, . fs now all btit unknown.~ Nevertheless~ the official statis~ics of the Sanitary from 1889 to 1908, s_how t_hat -there were 48,000 \u00b7deaths - a mortal,j.ty of-28-\u00b7percent. \u00b7And in 1908, when the Empire should have been r\u00b7eaping the best fruits of its rigorous vaccination -iaws, the smallpox cases numbered \u00b7;LB, 000 -a :number not exc~eded since 1897 .-and the deaths were nearly 6000, or over 32 percent.

Since 1907 - owing to the conscience clause -only about 1/.3 of the children are being vaccinated and from 1907 to 1919 there were only seven deaths from smallpox among children under five years of age. SMALLPOX IN THE RUSSIAN ARMY A dispatch from Helsinki to the \"Birmingham Post,\" 19th December, 1939, included a reference to a smallpox epidemic in the Russian Army in Finland. The Press Association and Exchange corresopndents said: \"Smallpox has broken out amongst the Russian Army. Reports reaching the capital state that the outbreak is spreading rapidly, and has already reached the proportions of an epi\u00ad demic. Finnish soldiers, together with all persons living in.the frontier regions, are being hastily revaccinated. All vaccine available has been requisitioned, and a public pro\u00ad clamation called -for the wholehearted cooperation of the public in all measures taken by the Government is expected shortly.\" Seeing that vaccination against smallpox is compulsory in Soviet Russia and in the Russian army, and has been so stringently enforced in Finland that the 70-year-old editor of a Nature-Cure magazine has been sent to prison for publishing arguments against the practice, why is there any epidemic of smallpox in Finland? And why all this hasty re\u00ad vaccination when there has already been so much vaccination and revac\u00ad cination in Russia and in Finland. The \"Truth-Teller,\" March, 19qo UNITED STATES Only 9 states have laws that require vaccination for admission to public schools: District of Columbia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York { in cities of 1st and 2nd classes only), Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Carolina. Vaccination of children during infancy is required by law only in Kentucky and Maryland. rt is optional with local authorities whether or not they require vaccination for admission to public schools in Connecticut, Georgia, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, and Oregon. In other states local authorities have ruled vaccination a require\u00ad ment for admission to public schools but in most cases the courts have ruled this action illegal, except during times of epidemic, without specific authority from the legislature.

Provision was made for the protection of personal liberties, property rights, and the freedom to worship God according to the dictates of conscience, or not to worship at all, if the individual should choose. But one important provision was omitted from the document, provision against the meddling, in public anq. private affairs, of the most med\u00ad dlesome group of men who ever trod the face of God's green earth -\u00ad organized. Qrth.odoo'x Medicine. . \u00b7 This omission, whether by accident or design, has caused more grief, \u00b7suffering, mutilation and death than have all the wars in which this nation has engaged. And the end is not yet - unless .this \"oversight\" is corrected\u00b7. , \u00b7 .... ( C Organized medicine is, strictly speaking, a purely private enter\u00ad prise, engaged ill the business of treating the sick, for a fee, just as a railroad or steamboat line is a private enterprise, engaged in the business of transporting people and goods, for a fee. In both cases, competition is frowned upon and laws are sought to stifle com\u00ad petitors, or to \"regulate\" them out of business.\u00b7. Long ago our lawmakers recognized the dangers of private monopolies in restraint of trade and commerce. Drastic laws were enac.ted against\u00b7 some monopolies, and the courts have }leld valid most of these enact\u00ad ments. But our courts, for some unknown reason, allow orthodox medi\u00ad cine a free hand in driving competition from the field and establishing for it~elf an almost complete monopoly in the business of treating the sick and the control of public health. And this in spite of the fact that there are tens of thousands of legally recognized, well-qualified unorthodox medical practitioners in the field. With our legislatures and courts under the almost complete domina\u00ad tion of organized medicine, it ls practically use~ess to expect any measure of freedom from medical oppression. Intimidated judges inte~- . pret, \"very liberally,\" the police powers of the State to the end that the organized medical profession, through the medium of local health boards, foist burdensome and vicious \"rulings\" upon the people, --such as \"preventive\" campaigns against smallpox, diphtheria, infa:p.tile paralysis, venereal diseases and so on.

It is bad enough for School Boards and other civic agencies \u00b7to force those that do not believe in vaccination to submit to it, but for a p~ivate corporation to take upon itself such duties is incompatible w~th the American idea of liberty.\"\u00b7 ( C ( ( Childs Case to he Taken To State Supreme Court Appeal from District and Superior Court Decisions Will Come Up Soon for Ruling on Point of Law Boston-Staunchly defending their rights, the parents of these children, Harano and Althea Childs of Quiricy, Mass., age 13 and 9, will continue the legal battle to determine once and for all the constitutionality of com\u00ad pulsory vaccination in the pub\u00ad lic schools. Driven to Maine for their schooling, these children a year ago excited national support when they were sent home twice daily by the Quincy school au\u00ad thorities because they had not submitted to the vaccination re\u00ad quired of all pupils. Objecting not orily on the grounds of private rights but because vaccination was \"a medical racket which records prove poisonous and sometimes fatal\", the forthcoming test case is expected to be historic. The law which states that all children must attend school and yet further compels pupils to be vaccinated unless granted a cer\u00ad tificate of exemption, met with embarrassment last January when the children of Mr. and Mrs. Harry Childs stopped present\u00ad ing Principals Theodore Silva and Harry Prario with such ex\u00ad emptions. Mrs. Childs pointed out that three sets of physician's certificates had been provided at intervals of two months by a doctor, stating that vaccination would . endanger their health. But the expense of renewing them so often was too much. \"Particularly,\" she said, \"when I find that in some instances in Quincy one certificate has been sufficient to cover a child's school life, sometimes one a year, is asked for~\" It will be remembered that when the Childs' case was re\u00ad ported in the press from coast to coast, even finding cordial re- . ception in England where op\u00ad position to vac cination is power\u00ad ful, ( 1907) the Citizens' Com\u00ad mittee Against Compulsory Vac\u00ad cination in Boston went to the aid of the harassed family. Fines Reduced After nine-year -old Althea and six-foot Harano had been repeatedly turned away from the door of their schools, and de\u00ad barred, court action was taken by the Sch()()! Committee. Mr. Childs was brought to the Crim\u00ad inal Court charged witb \"fail\u00ad ure\" to have He pleaded \"not guilty\". \"We f aiihfully complied with the school attendance law and sent our children to school each day,\" he stated before Judge Kenneth Johnson. \"They were debarred and told not to come again. We shall appeal to a higher court on points of law.\" He was fined the maximum fine of $20. monwealth of Massachusetts up into the group of 39 states which do not compel vaccination. Harry Childs remembers tak\u00ad ing 11 shots of various serums while in the U. S. Army. He was violently sick and to this day his health suffers. Scenes of mass inoculation followed by mass illness, including a percent\u00ad age of fatality, burnt deep the determination to examine what truth lay behind this orgy of medical needle sticlcing. Mrs. Harry Childs recalls be\u00ad ing seized as a child and \"vac\u00ad cinated into sickness\". She too decided that perhaps this prac- Harano and Althea Childs Mr. Childs refused to pay the fines and was locked up until bonds were furnished. He held that he was not in violation of the School Attendance Statute, his children went to school and were-debarred. He was brought before the court three times, the fines totalling $60 . The case was appealed each time and after weeks of delay was heard in the higher court at Dedham, Judge Frederick W. Fosdick reduced the maximum fines from $60 to $3. Soon th~ Supreme Court will be called upon to render a de\u00ad cision which may, according to the growing body of anti-com\u00ad pulsory vaccination supporters, g<> far toward moving the Com-tice of loading one's blood stream with disease poisons in order to prevent contracting it later might be as great a fallacy as the old delusion of arm to arm inoculation. With two vigorous children to care for, these parents dug out the facts on the subject of vac\u00ad cination for themselves before allowing Althea and their son Harano to be pumped full of virus.

The medical profession is recruited from the same class as that which furnishes the lawyers, judges, ministers, teachers, and business men of our country.

So did men and women 1n Texas and California and Northern Maine and the State of Washington. In Capetown, South Africa, a movie audience saw him, in his blue overalls and tan Sunday hat, and began pondering his problem. Two State courts and the Com\u00ad monwealth of Pennsylvania have already bec ome officially con\u00ad cerned with it. And sooner or later, it is almost certain the United States Su\u00ad preme Court will have to decide whether or not John Marsh, of Broad Mountain, need have his 8-:vear-old son vaccinated. ually, It will result In what law- Court Test Due. yers believe ls the first clean-cut The question posed by John test of Pennsylvania's compulsory Marsh 11lmmered here f or more than vaccination act since the Jaw was four years . It's boiling now. Event- passed In 1895. Because Marsh, who spent more than a year In ja!l at various times through his dread of vacclna,tlon, has become a ort of rallying point !or anti-vaccination groups In all parts o! the country . The Background. He he,s three lawyers and receives letters r~gularly from places he _hever heard of. His dispassionately stubborn assertion that \"no child of mine wlll ever be vaccinated with my consent \" has developed legal Im\u00ad plications which are far beyond him and most other laymen. The background of the cBBe la familiar : In 1930, Marsh's brother, WIIJlam , had one ot his three chil\u00ad dren vaccinated . She became blind. A sister, who wa!! not vaccinated but who slept with the .slc1t girl, also lost her sight. The Marsh brothers blamed tbe vaccination. Physician!! said It was not at fault. But John Marsh, a slow-moving man of great determination , swore solemnly to himself he would never submit his Yo'tlnger children to the process. The older one!! were vac\u00ad cinated_ yeara ago, before the tragedy. 1933 Arrest. In 1933, the South Middleton Township School Board refused to admit tbe younger ot John Marsh's children. Marsh wns arrested and fined $5 tar keeping them out of school. He refused to pay the fine and went to jall for five days. At the end of his term he was ordered to have the children vac\u00ad cinated. He refused. He was ar\u00ad rested again, jailed again. The process kept up until late In 193i. Marsh served 55 five-day sentences -a total of 275 days-In 33-'3._ Wards of County. Durfng the last term, his family applied for relief. The two chlla dren or school age were made \"wards -of Cumberland county\"\u00ad and promptly vaccinated . Marllh was released. He still had three small children unvaccinated . The matter was dropped by all parties until last fall, when 8-yea.r\u00ad old Eugene was due in school. No vaccination, said Marsh. \"Flv.e days,\" saliJ. Justice of the Peace Wlllltun Dqsh. 1t was the first of a new series of 20 sentences which brought Marsh's grand total to 75 terms, or 375 days. The series ~ruled last Sunday. Marsh ..was released .

''Well \" said Marsh, \"l guess she'd go along with them, If It wasn't for me. But so long as I say no, she's with me. \"But look what they did to her and the kids while I was away. They jooksed 'em.

I was never in jail before this. I'm not a trouble-maker. I obeyed all the laws and still do. I lived with my neighbors here ever since I was 7. I had no trouble with any\u00ad one. But I saw what I saw. I saw my nieces go blind. And nothing Is going to happen to my family If I can help it.\" It's a healthy-looking family. Plump children, every one of them with gray or gray-blue eyes and a shy friendliness toward strangers. Built Own Howie. They live, not In a mountain shack, but in a solid red-brick white\u00ad trimmed house in a microscopic community called Gardners, about 15 miles from Carlisle. Marsh, who Is 40, built the house with his own hands. Be owns it. and a one-acre truck patch and group of sheds and work houses behind it. He Isn't a farmer. He's a car\u00ad penter by trade. but a measure of what used to be called Yankee in\u00ad genuity enables him to take a hand in anything. When he Isn't In jail he makes a better than average living for the family. If he thinks you are interested, he will show you things he ha.a made out of scraps of metal and bits of junked cars: a complete power workshop; two tractors pow\u00ad ered by 1922 automobile engines; wagons and farm machinery, Spotless Home. His workshop should be run by belts attached to a drum riveted to the wheel of an ancient car. But, when there Isn't any money for gas, handles are affixed to the machines and Marsh or \"the boys\" spin them to make the drills and lathes turn and band-saw hum. The house ls spotless. The stove used for cooking and heating shines with blacking and metal polish. The children glisten with soap, even for unexpected visitors. Their shoes are sturdy, their coats heavy and well\u00ad mended. \"Jail or no jail, says Marsh, '_'I manage to keep 'em in shoes and food.\"-School Process. Eugene walks along a quarter\u00ad mile of macadam road every now and then. crosses a morass of mud and dry pine needles, climbs a pile of broken stones which ~e as a step and presents himself at the school Each time, the teacher explain!! be can't be admlt~d, and he duti\u00ad fully goes home.

Magtatrate Dosh, tall and gentle of manner, with thin w&lte hair says there Isn't anything else h~ can do. A copy of the State School Code rests on his desk. To prove his argument, he turns to section 1~ of the act of March 18, 1911. 'Look at thla,\" he saya. \"Viola\u00ad tors of the law must be fined and go to jail in default of fines. They bring these casea before me and there fan't a thing I can do. I have often said to Marsh, as he was taken out. 'Don't you want a few days to think thia thing over?' He has always aald 'Never!' and marched away. He just seema to be one of thoae\u00b7 men who can't be swayed, once he makes up hia mind.\" Can't Change Law1. W. G. Rice, superviaing principal of the South Middleton achoola, said he haan't any more power than Dosh to change the law. ''We don't\u00b7 have Marsh arraigned for falling to have the children vaccinated,\" lie' said, \"but for fall\u00ad Ing to have his children in school. And we can't admit them ff they aren't vaccinated. If we did. the State appropriaUon would be taken away from us. And I would be liable to a fine of $25 a day for permitting the law to be broken. We can't change the law, All we can do Is enforce it.\" Legal Status. Here la an outline of the legal stepa under way in the caae: L Two weeks ago Marsh was taken before Judge Frederick S. Reese. of the County Quar\u00ad ter Sessions Court, in an effoft to secure his release on a writ of habeas corpus. Reese1 \"l-e\u00ad fused to free him. The re\u00ad fusal was appealed tO the State Superior Court and argument will be heard thla week In Har\u00ad risburg. 2. Marsh's last sentence by Dosh was appealed to the Quar\u00ad ter Ses~ons Court. If th high-er court ruDng ls adverse to the defense It will be carried still higher. 3. An Injunction wl11 be sought this week fn the county court, frohibltlng future ar\u00ad rests o Marsh on the ground his Conatttutlonal rights are being violated. Again, If there 111 a ruling against the defense, there will be an arpeal. And If the State loses, f la expected the ~tate will appeal. Defe.nse PlanL Right now, defense attorneys are trying to figure out a we:y to sim\u00ad plify the proceedings. The lawyers are Ralph Sheetz, of Enola; Baroid R. Prowell, of Harrisburg, and H. Eugene Gardner; of Philadelphia, who Is temporary chairman of the Committee for Medical Freedom In Pennsylvania. The -State Attorney General's office will send counsel to the Su\u00ad perior Court hearing to defend the law. Up until now the State has been reluctant to join what It hoped would remain a local fight. But, aa the other appeals are pressed, It Is expected the Commonwealth will have to take a part in each. Counsel for the school board have already been In conference with the Pennsylvania Department of Justice, according to Rice. Other State agencies are fighting ahy, however. Calls It. Local. Dr. Clarence Ackley, deputy Sec\u00ad retary of Public, Instruction, said the problem ls primarily one for local and State health officials. \"All we can say,\" he declared, \"is that the school law obligates school officials to exclude children who are not vaccinated and pro\u00ad vides a penalty if they do not do so. Apparently, the officials have \u00b7 done that.\" Dr. Edith MacBride Dexter, Sec\u00ad retary of Health, declared: \"The Health Department feels the law should not be broken. It would be a bad t8.ing for PennS,lvania If It were broken down. We have not had a caae ,,f smallpox here for flve and one-half year.: Ohio and other States without a compul\u00ad sory vaccination law have had quite a few. But the problem ap\u00ad pears to be a local one.\" Marsh's statua pending further legal action is a little uncertain. One school official aaid counsel 111 now seeking, from the State, ad\u00b7 vice on whether Marsh shouldn't btr arrested even while he ls otlt' In ball, on the ground hla offense l11 renewed eaeh da.y school ia In se sion.

THE MARSH CASE The st9ry of John Marsh of Gardners, Pennsylvania, and his r1\u00b7ght against the v.accination of his.children is one which makes the blood of every lib\u00ad erty-.l~ving A11erican seethe with indignation. (See newspaper reprint, pre\u00ad ceding page.) In 1929 John Marso s~ his brother William's child Vd.CCinated, s\u00b7:w her go blind; her throat break out, and when the poison struck her heart she died. He saw.another of his brsther's children go blind --her eyes swell\u00ad ing and bursting l.n her head \"'.i :.bin a week after they became infected by the vaccine, leaving empty eye sockets. ( See picture on page 2,.) These horrors led .o his resolve tha1 never agarn should a child .of his be sub\u00ad jected to the dangers of vacc1nati n. It was~ years later --.in 1933. when one of his children became of0eom\u00ad pu~sory sci.col age, that he first faced the necessity of defending .hem a\u00ad gainst vaccination. Pennsylvania is one of the 9 states which still have co\u00b7 pulsory vaccination ano whi6h re\u00b7guires i \u00b7 as to admit\u00ad tance to public schools. Therefoi\u00b7e wl'len he to have his boy vacci\u00ad nated, i-=-was fined $5. QQ. This he ret:use'd to pay and was jailed for -5 days.

Nor can we imag\u00ad ine the rebellion which he \u00b7must .bave felt when it be-came evident that one of;\" the ch~ldre:a thus vacc_inated had never fully recovered fr~m its effects I No more trouble occurred until the next younger child, Epgene, became 8 years old, which is the e.ompulsory school age. Then began a fight for the canst~ tutional rights of this man to protect his child .against vaccination, which. was- known even into \u00b7Africa_. Again John Marsh refused to have his chi'id vace\"\"inated, to secure admission to public 'school\u00b7, and again he wa~ sent to j'ail, losing anot~er \u00b7 good job \u00b7by which he had earned \u00b7a substantial living tpr his wife and eight children. \u00b7 There \"(ere those who were consider\u00ad ably. irked by his _defiance and- th~y made up their minds th.at they were go- . ing \u00b7to break :t\"iim. He was first jailed on November 15, 1937. This time tliree attorneys chie.f\u00b7 of whom was H. Eugene Gardner of Glenside, .Pennsylvania, came to. his a.id, and liave battled loyally ~ithout remuneration for jus~ice in this case.

THEORY OF VACCINATION, INOCULATION, IMMUNIZATJON AND NEGATIVE RESULTS R. C. Ha rt on g , Ph. C. , D. C. , Ph . C . , F. R. C. From his paper, Chemical Aspects or Vaccination, Inoculation & Immunization The human body, 11s the result of many centuries of living and combating all the obstacles of primitive life and later, civilization, has developed a marvel\u00ad ous capacity.to defend itself against what might\u00b7be considered a hostile environ\u00ad ment, and the errors of humanity. A certain group of medical men have conceived of the idea of taking advantage of this natural capacity of the\u00b7body to defend itself, by forcing it to develop special resistance to the expression of certai~ distressing symptoms associated with certain diseases. The theory briefly was that if the body could be forced to develop this spe\u00ad cial resistance to -certain diseases without actually contracting the disease in full force, that that should be a means of controlling, or at least mitigating, the disease. Thus far the theory was fine, but apparently their zeal for devel\u00adoping and expanding this practice caused them to rush into it without having a satisfactory knowledge of the chemistry or physiology involved. After years of exploiting these practices, they still know practically nothing about these es\u00ad sentials. Speaking of immunity reactions, H. G. Wells, Ph.D., M.D., says: \"For the most part their chemical significance was less appreciated, large\u00ad ly because they were' observed as reactions to bacteria, blood serum and cells, all of which are suc.h complex mixtures of unknown cons ti tut ion that any chemical consideration of their behavior is ent.irely impossible. Per\u00ad haps the hypothetical presentation of the subject in the terms of the Erlich nomenclature, with p_ictorial conceptions which had no chemical significance, had some influence in satisfying many investigators that they understood-the principles when they merely understood the hypothesis. 117 \"As Dean has said in this connection, 'Ignorance; however aptly veiled in an attractive terminology, remains ignorance. 118 , \"The critical reader will appreciate that the chemistry of immunology has so far had but a .fragmentary and illogical development -- here, the work of an immunologist struggling with agents of unknown composition and meas\u00ad uring results with a yardstick of most uncertain accuracy; there, the ef\u00ad forts of a physical chemist applying methods of great accuracy to materials of uncertain nature and to reactions modified by an infinity of unknowable variables. No one can expect that, from data so derived, in a new science in which the contributions of tomorrow contradict many of those of yester\u00ad day, any clear picture or final statement can be presented~ 119 This same lack of specific knowledge prevails regarding the destructive action \u00b7 of these poisons upon the biood stream, lymph, lymph glands, kidneys, liver, heart, and particularly the nervous system. 7. Wells, H. Gideon, The Chemical Aspects or Immunity, op. cit., p. 9 8. Iuid. 9. Ibid., p. 10 The natural body defense system is said to be cellular (body cells) and humor\u00ad al (body fluids). The white blood corpuscles or leucocytes are the cellular de\u00ad fenders. against foreign. bodies\u00b7 which are not in solution, such as bacteria or small solid particles, which may gain access into the\u00b7body. , The humoral defense depends upon substances in solution in the body fluids (blood and lymph); they are produced by secretory processes of the body cells. They have the capacity of neutralizing fluid poisons which may\u00b7 develop within the body, or that may gain entrance into the body as the result of damage to the protective tissues (skin and mucous membranes). These natural defenders of the body have the same capacity as the theoretical antibodies, which are supposed to be produced when certain toxins or anti toxins are injected into the body. Any substance which causes the body to develop antibodies is given the name antigen. The antibodies have been classified according to the nature of the physical be\u00ad havior of the blood\u00b7 when certain antigens are injected into it. Foreign cells within the body are usually disposed of by agglutination ( clump inf), and are called agglutinins, or they may be dissolved, in this case they are called ly\u00ad sins. Foreign proteins which exist in solution are usually precipitated (taken out of solution); in this case, they are called precipi tins. \u00b7 In each case na\u00ad ture's efforts are to \u00b7 render t,he foreign cells or substance as harmless as pos\u00ad sible to the body. When the antibody is the r_esult of the injection. of a t\u00b7oxin into the body; it is called an\u00b7antitoxin. cutaneous, alimentary, and probably also placental sur\u00ad faces is an almost perfect barrier to the penetration _of foreign proteins, as illustrated by the fact that ,such foreign proteins as those of toxic ( snake venom \u00b7are harmless when t~ken into the\u00b7 alim~ntary canal.\" 10 Speaking of foreign cells b~ing engulfed or devoured by white corpuscles with-\u00b7 in the living body, \"it seems probable_ that they must be \u00b7first killed --they form no exception to the rule that living protoplasm cannot be digested. 1111 In other words living protoplasm is not food for one -cel],ed organisms including dis ease f e1\"\"1ftS. \u00b7 Paul Erlich, the German scientist,\u00b7 1854 -19151 developed a tlieory as. to how antigens, injected into the blood stream, caused the cel_ls\u00b7 to form antibodies. His theory, briefly, was that the pi::esence of ap antigen or toxin in the :living . blood stream causes the protoplasm of the cell to produce an\u00b7 excess of side chain compounds. These compounds have the specific properties necessary to combine with the certain toxin present, and to form a compound incapable of destroying' the living tissues of the body, and incapable of producing the symptoms of the disease associated with the toxin. Erlich' s theory did not rec~on \u00b7 how much destruction might occur to the body tissues before all of the injected toxin-was completely neutralized by the action 6f the cells. He did not give a workable formula as to how much toxin was neces~ sary in any given case to form a suffiGient quantity.of.antitoxin to prevent the development of a given disease and riot leave an excess of toxin in \u00b7the\u00b7 bloo.d stream. He did not measure the shock to the nervous system or the weakening ac\u00ad tion upon the cells (whic1:_ develop the \u00b7antibodies) to the degree that other \u00b7 forms of disease migpt develop. 10; o_f toxins or\u00b7 antiserums taken from d-is\u00b7~ased ani\u00ad mals should also be considered. It is qui \\e possible that the animals used for \u00b7 the propagation of.toxins or antiserums may have hidden diseases such as cancer, or various other constitutional diseases in a more or less dormant state. Since antibodies have n~t been isolated, per se, they are bound to be contam\u00ad inated with many unknown .substances which abound in the plasma or liquid portion of the blood .stream. When we consider that every physical~ mental, and spiritual quality of the parents are transmitted to their offspring, through the medium of the blood stream, it is. \u00b7not very gratifying to realize that\u00b7 our blood streams are polluted_with the blood of 9iseased animals. If we value the teachings of the Christian Bible which says, \"That whatsoever ye shall sow, also shall\u00b7 ye reap, \"12 should we not wonder what ma;r;ner of diseases we shall reap when\u00b7we deliberately sow disease into the blood stream? The following paragraph is taken from \u00b7Textbook of Physiology by Professor Zoethout, professor of Physiology in Loyola Uni versi-ty, . Chicago. He is recog\u00ad nized as an authority on Physiology; therefore, a careful analysis of the ana\u00ad phylactic phase of vaccination, inoculation,\u00b7 and immunization should be made, in view of its death-dealing power. \u00b7 \"'A~a.phylaxis -- the injection of a single dose of horse serum into.a rab- . bit may have no ill results. But if a week or two later t_he rabbit re\u00ad ceives another injection, grave, results and even death may follow.

The foreign substance calling forth the anaphylaxis 1s of ~ protein nature. The profound dis\u00ad turbances following the second injection are . sometimes spoken of as ana\u00ad phylact~c shock. (Low blood ,Pressure, heart and res,Pir.atory failure). Such shock has been observed in the us-e of anti toxins. The cause of\u00b7 the shock is obscure; it seems as 1,f the rapid\u00b7 formation of toxins after the second -injection may be responsible. The anaphylaxis reaction 1~ specific. 1113 The second\u00b7 injection of a horse serum which, \"otherwise may be regarded as a harmless substance~, into the rabbit, causing \"grave results and even death mB3\" follo~\", shouid not concern us so much, but when\u00b7 it is admitted that antitoxins produce t~e same results in humans, we should know something about this inoculat\u00ad ing-immunizing business \u00b7which is being forced. upon us \u00b7by man-made laws. Those who depend upon such procedure\u00b7 \u00b7to control (?) \u00b7disease admit that \"the cause of the shock ls . o:t,scure.\" They also admit that \"a rapid. ~ormation of toxins after the second injection\" mar be respon_sible. It ls quite evident that the first injection of antit-exin must have had\u00b7 a very . have very little more effect\u00b7 th.an the first injection. It is admitted without qualification that \"rapid formation \u00b7of toxi~s afte_r the second injection\" of antitoxin may be responsible for the death shock. This ls \u00b7equ.i val~nt to saying\u00b7 that the injection of anti toxin into the human body causes the formation of toxins to the extent that they may cause death. When\u00b7 12. \u00b7 Bible. Gal. Chap. 6, verse 7. 13. Zoethout, DA Textbook ot_ Phys1Qlogy~, op. cit., p. 161. the doctors who administer these toxins, anti toxins, and anti-serums admit that the cause of the death shock is\u00b7 obscure, the subject~ who are expected to take these injections should have the right to reject this kind of protective (?). med\u00ad icine in favor of a system of disease-,-prevention based upon natural methods of building health and maintaining hygiene, both outside of the body and within the living blood stream. Toxin means poison, but the idea has been given to the pub- lic that antitoxin is not poison, but against poisop, and that the antitoxin pro\u00ad duced in the blood stream is the thing which is supposed to protect the body from disease. This brings us back to the old idea of fighting poison with poison. The fore\u00ad going facts show how dangerous this old idea is to the welfare and life of our people. It is a known fact that nature is always making an effort to free the body from poison. Poisons within the body inhibit the natural functions of the body. They weaken and destroy the tissues and organs, thus lowering the natural resistance (Potential life\u00b7 force) of the body to destructive environment of all kl\u00b0nds. For this reason when poisons are forced into the blood stream either by vaccination, by scab, or injections (shots), hypodermically, or any other means of inoculation, nature makes a supreme effort to throw off these poisons through the various channels of elimination (kidneys, skin, lungs, and bowels). This is a terrific shock to the body, particularly-the nervous system. It also -consumes considerable of the body's life force or potential energy. In the event that there are vital organs in the body which are already weakened or damaged due to previous disease, these toxins may caus~ failure of such vital organs, resulting in death. Negative Results of Vaccination, Inoculation, and Immunization: Speransky gives a very definite reason why most anti-serum and antitoxin inoculations fail to prevent disease. These substances when injected into the body fluids fail to penetrate _ to any degree into the cerebra - spinal fluid and into the medulla of the brain . In other words the most vulnerable and vital portion of the body is left unprotected. \"I shall\u00b7 not dwe11\u00b7 on this any longer; since we are only interested in the fact, firmly established lorig ago, that, as a rule, antibodies of specific sera either do not pass at all from the blood into the medulla, or pene\u00ad trate into the latter only in a\u00b7 very small quantity -- for instance, when their concentration in the blood reaches a high level.\" 14 Reporting on rabies., \"To sum up, the question of the prophylactic and curative action of anti-rabic serum in all :methods of infection has received a negative decision. 1115 In other words a vast amount. of research and experiment has proven that serum treatment for rabies is no good. In regard .to meningitis, tests show \u00b7that anti\u00ad meningococcus serum has a specific effect on rabbi ts having the disease induced into them, ... but quoting Speransky, \"these facts, however, only inake it more in\u00ad comprehens\u00b7ible why the same serum, employed in enormous doses, proves t.o be use\u00ad less in spontaneous meningitis of human beings, in spite ,of the fact that it is injected directly i:r;it6 the region affected. 1116 14.

(Ed. Note: Vaccination and inoculation are, in the true sense, medicine.) ALEXIS CARRELL, a well-known contemporary authority on health and the philosophy of living, says \" . The future discoverer of a method for inducing tissues and organs to develop harmoniously . will present man with the most precious of all gifts, with an almost divine offering, the aptitude for happiness . \" And\u00b7 again, DR, CARRELL\u00b7 \"Injections of specific vaccine or serum for each disease, repeated medical examinations of. the whole popula\u00ad tion, construction of gigantic hospitals, are expensive and not very effective means of preventing diseases and of developing a nation's health._ Good health should be natural. n The utterances of the~e great men are profound truth. Man for cen\u00ad turies has striven vainly to find the secret of good health; for with\u00ad out.health, no matter what glory or wealth he may attain otherwise, he cannot enjoy the true happiness of abundant living.- But man has been misled in his search onto devious roads. He has sought healing power in witchcraft\u00b7 and potions, in amulets and charms, in fire and bleeding, in self-torture and sacrifice. More recently he has turned to herbs and chemicals -:--experimenting wftl} every product from within the earth to every known element on the earth's surface, whether it be mineral, animal or vegetable life. And still, man gropes blindly in his search, lost in a dark sea mystifying\" acute ailments. Does it not seem reasonable and purely logic that, whatever the ex\u00ad citing cause of disease may be, the real CAUSE, the underlying WEAKNESS lies in MAN1 S BODY ITSELF? Can he hope to correct this underlying weakness by the administration of chemicals ,...-by injections and doses, pills anct inoculations?_ To date, the method hc1:s proven futile, even in behalf of its own practitioners, and it will go on being so, no matter what new chemical devices are compounded. For the very theory is illogical: It i\"s the treatment of symptoms rather than a correction c\"f the, cause of illness . . There is but one true means to health. A NORMAL BODY. And when~~ use that term, we employ its all-inclusiveness. We mean that mans '\u00b7framework, .the 'bony skeleton and especially the spine, must be straight and str~ng; we mean that the muscles attached thereto must\u00b7 be normal in to:Qe, fr~e from strain or atony; we mean that the delicate system 111-8 of nerves throughout the body must be free and uninhibited; that the flow of blood through the arteries and veins, to and from the heart, must be free and regular; that each organ perform its designated func\u00ad tion without over-stimulation or inhibition; and that each gland, small or 1,rge, pour out its secretion in the proper controlling amount. All students and practitioners of natural health methods know that, for the ideal normal to exist in a human body, the framework and spine must be normal, from foundation to its uppermost limit, Only then can the attached tissues and dependent organs be normal in tone; only then can the nerves which pass out through the spinal column, from the spinal cord to all tissues and organs of the body, be free and unin\u00ad hibited, the flow of blood rythmic and natural. And when these normal conditions preside, all other organs and tissues of the body perform normall~r and NATURALLY Organs and tissue cannot become diseased when they are properly fed, when their waste products are properly ca.>:\u00b7r.i.ed away, when their nerve supply is normal, and when they are allowed to rest in their designed and proper positions. The sum total of their function will then be HEALTH Bl,t whet, the reader may ask, would happen if disease invaded the body from outside? Are we not told daily of the millions of germs pervading the air, the soil, the very food and water we drink? What of them? And _we ask in turn, \"'w_hat of them?\" Does it not occur to the think\u00ad ing individual that these same germs are present in all\u00b7 the air, all the soil, and in like amounts in the food and drink consumed by all the people in any gene~~al or circumscribed area at one time? -.,.-And that in spite of this, only a few are ever \"infected';? What makes some . . . few ill, while the others, under identical l.i ving conditions, go hap- pily about their way in abundant health? Readers, IT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN THE BODY OF THE INDIVIDUAL HIJISELF ! rt has l~mg been a question, and is now regarded by some authorities \u00b7as a proven fact, that \"disease germs\" cannot live or reproduce on healthy tissue, that their only habitable medium within the living body is sub-normal or partially dead tissue. The very promoters of the germ theory of d.1sease admit this perforce, when the~ state that the best \"c_ulture medium\" for m2.ny germs 1s stale meat broth, allowe.d to stand from days to weeks before it can be used effectively; when they employ. fermented urine and other .. substances :.:\u00b7ather than the fresh specimen;. when the main base of many cu;J. t.ure media is aga1i, a gelatinous, par\u00ad tially cellulose carbohydrate that is foreign to the body and in fact undigestible by the human. when in practically all cases, chemicals must be added to the culture media to promote germ growth, some to acid:..fy, some to alkaJ.inize, others to \"sensitize\" the media, In nu case is normal animal tissue. blood, or urine used.

This young woman suffered recurrent. attacks of appendicitis, fre\u00ad quent colds, severe constipation, indigestion, acute menstrual dis\u00ad turbances, and a general toxicity and listlessness, when the first X-ray was taken. The astute reader will realize that the cause for these many and varied ailments lay in the dis-arranged spinal column and bodj framework. Notice the curvature in the lower portion of the spine, sufficient to throw the entire body mechanics out of proper function, to make the muscles tight and strained, to disturb the del,\u00ad icate nervous system. But young Mrs. Morgan did not submit to an appendix operation; she did not seek relief through \"cold shots\", nbr did she use medicines or drugs to dull the. symptoms of indigestion, menstrual pain, and toxic\u00ad ity. SHE SAW A CHIROPRACTOR _:.., one who was capable of straightening her spine and . body and removing the CAUSE of her _ailments. She was sensible enough to not be satisfied with having her SYMPTOMS TREATED. The result is that today she fairly \"bubbles over\" with vitality; ~hi ~ttacks a.re\u00b7 -entir\u00b7ely nc,:~\u00b7mal, and she seldom_ if ever has a \"cold\". The improvement 'in he.r spine and body framework c;l,re plainly demonstrat\u00ad ed in the second X-r~y Mrs . \u00b7.M_organ s ce.:se is not unusual, or a miracle. Here is simply an illustration of hundreds, yes, .thousands, of cases\u00b7 who today find nat\u00ad ural, ~bundant health through NATURAL means. When the body framework is wholly normal, there is never the slight\u00ad est need or excuse for inflicting upon the body any poi!,on claimed to be a pre~entativ~. This one simple, fundamental truth stands out from the sea of dark\u00ad ness as a bright-, clear light for all who would seek perfect heal th .. --Dr. Hugh B.
