Throat lozenges, cough mixtures and some painkillers are among the over-the-counter medicines in short supply, according to the Association of Independent Multiple Pharmacies. The industry group warned of supply issues of both branded and unbranded medicines to treat seasonal illnesses. Chief executive Leyla Hannbeck said that pharmacists were \"struggling to obtain the very basic, most common cold and [flu](/topic/flu) medicine\". The warning comes after the UK Health Security Agency said that winter illnesses including flu and [Covid-19](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/covid-19) continue to circulate at \"high levels\".
