Been absent from work or school AA1472 4. Fainted or passed out suddenly AA1473 5. Had a bad time AA1474 2. Description of original scale : Rutgers Alcohol Problems Index (RAPI) The original RAPI ( White & Labouvie, 1989 ) is a 23 -item self -administered screening tool for assessing adolescent problem drinking. It was developed in order to create a conceptually sound, unidimensional, relatively brief, and easily administered instrument to assess problem drinking in adolescence. The response categories are designed to reflect frequency of occurrence (1=Never, 3=Several times). Onl y 5 of the 23 items are selected into use in the MoBa . Psychometric Information: Factor analyses were conducted of test -retest data involving frequencies of a total of 53 symptoms and/or consequences of alcohol use as reported by a nonclinical sam ple of 1308 males and females aged 12 to 18 years at the initial test and 15 to 21 years at the retest. The resulting 23 -item scale has a reliability of .92 and a 3 -year stability coefficient of .40 for the total sample. Base References/Primary Citation s: White, H.R. & Labouvie, E.W. (1989). Towards the assessment of adolescent problem drinking. Journal of Studies on Alcohol 50:30 -37. 3. Rationale for choosing the questions : The advantages of this short, self -administered screening tool lie in its ease of administration and its standardization which makes it possible to compare problem drinking scores across groups. 4.

If I could live my life over, I would change almost nothing AA1531 2. Description of original instrument : Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) The SWLS (Diener et al., 1985) is a 5 -item instrument designed to measure global cognitive judgments of satisfaction with one's life. All answers are scored on a 7-point scale from ' strongly disagree ' (1) to ' strongly agree ' (7). Psychometric Information (sample, reliability, validity): Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) for the SWLS is between .79 and .89. Test -retest coefficients are between .84 and .54, with the d ecline of stability of the scale over longer periods. The SWLS demonstrates adequate convergence with related measures (r=.28~.82), and it has been shown to have potential as a cross -cultural index of life satisfaction ( Diener et Citations : Diener, E., Emmons, R.

Description of original instrument : The Relationship Satisfac tion Scale (RSS) The RSS is a 10 -item scale developed originally in Norwegian for the MoBa. The scale is based on core items used in previously developed measures of marital satisfaction and relationship quality (e.g. Blum & Mehrabian, 1999; Henrick , 1988; Snyder, 1997). All answers are scored on a 6-point scale from 'strongly agree ' (1) to 'strongly disagree ' (6). Psychometric Information : Internal reliability of the RS10 is high (alpha: .85 -.90). Confirmatory factor analyses provide evidence for a unidimensional structure, high loadings and good fit. The RSS correlates .92 with the Quality of Marriage Index (QMI: Norton, 1983). Predictive validity is evidenced by ability to predict future break -up/divorce and life satisfaction (Dyrdal et al., 2011 ; R\u00f8sand, et al., 2013 ; R\u00f8ysamb, Vitters\u00f8 & Tambs, 2014 ). The 5 -item short version (RS5) was empirically derived by identifying the best items in terms of accounting for variance in the full sum -score index. Multiple regression and factor analyses were use d (R\u00f8ysamb, Vitters\u00f8 & Tambs, 2014). The short version correlates .97 with the full scale.

Description of original questions : The (Hopkins) Symptoms Checklist -25 (SCL -25) The Hopkins Symptoms Checklist with 90 items (SCL -90) measures several types of symptoms of mental disorders, two of which are anxiety and depression. The instrument was originally designed by Derogatis, Lipman & Covi (1973) at Johns Hopkins Universi ty. The SCL -25 was derived from the SCL-90 and measures symptoms of anxiety (10 items) and depression (15 items) (Hesba cher, et al., 1980 ). Response categories are the same for all items: \"not at all, bothered ,\" \"a little bothered ,\" \"quite a bit bothered ,\" \"extremely bothered ,\" rated 1 to 4, respect ively. Five of the selected items in this section constitute the short v ersion of SCL-25 (SCL-5; concordance rate of 86.7% was demonstrated between the assessment by the physician and the patient 's own rating of distress on the SCL-25 (Hesbacher , et al., 1980 ). Using and available data material (Tambs & Moum, 1993), the short version scores were estimated to correlate 0.9 2 with the total sco re from the original instrument. The alpha reliability wa s estimated at 0.85 for SCL -5 (Tambs & R\u00f8ysamb, 2014). Sensitivity and specificity for SCL -5 have been estimated at 82% and 96 % (Strand, et al., 2003) . s/Primary Citations: PT, Rickels R, Morris RJ, Newm an H, & Rosenfeld MD. 1980 .

Rationale for choosing the questions : SCL-5 has proven to be a brief, valid and reliable measure of mental distress (Tambs & Moum, 1993 ). 4. Revision during the data collection period: No revisions have been made . 44 139-140. Abuse 1. Name of origina l questions : Questions about past history of abuse Q Response options Variable name 139 Have you ever in your adult life been slapped, hit, kicked or bothered in any way physically? ( you may cross off several) During this pregnancy 1-Yes 2-No 3-Don't remember AA1553 Last 6 months before pregnancy AA1554 Earlier AA1555 140 Have you ever been pressured or forced to have sexual intercourse? During this pregnancy Last 6 months before pregnancy Earlier No, never AA1556 AA1557 AA155 8 Yes, pressured raped AA1565 AA1566 AA1567 2. Description original questions : MoBa specific single questions Psychometric Information: Not relevant . Base Ref erences/Primary Citations : Not relevant. 3. Rationale for choosing the questions : History of abuse before and during pregnancy supposed ly affects the health of both pregnant women and the developing baby . 4. Revision during the data collection p eriod: For both questions, the alternative for 'during this pregnancy' does not exist in version A; instead 'the last 12 months' is used to cover 'during this pregnancy' and 'last 6 months before pregnancy. ' No further revisions have been made. 45 141. Self Esteem 1. Name of original Scale : Selective questions from the Rosenberg Self -Esteem Scale (RSES) Q Response options Variable name 141 How do you feel about yourself? 1. I have a positive attitude toward myself 1-Agree compl etely 2-Agree 3-Disagree 4-Disagree completely AA15 68 2. I feel completely useless at times AA15 69 3. I feel that I do not have much to be proud about AA15 70 4. I feel that I am a valuable person, as good as anyone else AA15 71 2. Description of original Instrument : The Rosenberg Self -Esteem Scale (RSES) The RSES ( Rosenberg , 1965; 1986 ) is a 10 -item scale, intended to measure global self -esteem. In the original version , half of the items are positive ly worded, while the other half negative ly worded. Four of the selected items in this section constitute the short version of RSES (Tambs, 2004) . Four response categories range from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Psychometric Information: Test-retest reliability ranges from .82 to .88. Cronbach's alpha ranges from .77 to .88 (Blascovich & Tomaka, 1993; Rosenberg, 1986). Alpha -reliability f or the whole 10 -item scale was .88 in a Norwegian sample of 250 youths (Ystg yrd, 1993). The four -item short version correlated .95 with the score based on the original 10 -item scale, and the alpha reliability was estimated at .80 (Tambs, 2004).

Rationale for choosing the questions : The Rosenberg Self -Esteem Scale is one of the most widely used self -esteem measures in social science research. 4. Revision during the data collection period: No revisions have been made . 46 142-144. Life Time History of Depression 1. Name of original Scale : Life Time History of Major Depression (LTH of MD) Q Response options Variable name 142 Have you ever experienced the following for a period of 2 weeks or more? 1. Felt depressed, sad 1-No 2-Yes AA1572 2. Had problems with appetite or eaten too much AA1573 3. Been bothered by lack of energy AA1574 4. Blamed yourself and felt worthless AA1575 5. Had problems with concentration or had problems making dec isions AA1576 6. Had at least 3 of the problems named above simultaneously AA1577 143 If you have had 3 or more of these problems at the same time how many we eks did the longest period last ? ____ weeks Number 0 -99 AA1578 144 Was there a par ticular reason for this? 1-No, no particular reason 2-Yes (ex. death, divorce, miscarriage, accident) AA1579 2. Description of original questions : Life Time History of Major Depression (LTH of MD) These items closely correspond to the DSM -III cr iteria for lifetime major depression. DSM criteria are met when i) three types of symptom items are endorsed, ii) one of these is the first, felt depressed, and iii) three types of symptoms occurred simultaneously . The criteria also include that the depres sion was not caused by some externally negative incident. The answers are coded as \"yes\" or \"no\" . Psychometric Information: The reliability of the scale was tested by a new examination a year later, now using the CIDI structured interview. The corre spondence was rather modest (kappa = 0.34, tetrachoric r = 0.56) (Kendler, et al., 1993) . Base References/Primary Citations : Kendler, K. S., Neale, M. C., Kessler, R. C., Heath, A.C. and E aves, L.J. (1993). The lifetime history of major depression in wome n: reliability of diagnosis and heritability, Archives of General Psychiatry , 50, 863-870. 3. Rationale for choosing the questions : The questions aim to measure lifetime symptoms of depression. The measurement precision is not impressing, probably p rimarily because people tend to forget their problems earlier in life, but no alternative measure of life time depression was available. 4. Revision during the data collection period: No revisions have "}
