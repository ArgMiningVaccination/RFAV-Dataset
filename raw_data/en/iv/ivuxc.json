Behavioral choices now could have long-term effects on how people interact with others and the world. The science is far from certain, but it appears at least a proportion of people who have had COVID-19 will be protected from another infection - at least initially. The infamous drug can inhibit the body's inflammatory response, which is why researchers wonder if it can effectively treat COVID-19. Your body can be infected and fight off SARS-CoV-2 without your ever noticing. Who is most likely to survive an infection of the new coronavirus? Two immunologists explain that it is those who mount exactly the right immune response - not too weak, not too strong. Cytokines ensure our immune system responds effectively to pathogens in our bodies. But in some cases, cytokines can cause the immune system to over-react. What does high blood sugar have to do with vulnerability to COVID-19? And is there a role for the controversial drug hydroxychloroquine in lowering blood sugar in COVID-19 patients? There is no evidence that garlic, lemons, and the ketogenic diet can prevent or cure coronavirus. As many as 80% of those infected with coronavirus don't show symptoms. The reasons why are likely to come down to how your immune system responds to the virus. Some things about COVID-19 still don't add up. The science is not so clear cut. Some people's immune systems aren't able to stop foreign invaders, such as COVID-19, as well as the rest of the population. There are many reasons for this, including illness, medications and age. Though it was previously thought vigorous exercise could suppress immune function, research shows that most forms of regular exercise can help your immune system to work its best. OK, we're all getting a little stir-crazy from staying at home. But is a mixed drink with vitamins added really something we should consider? University of Pittsburgh researchers are developing a vaccine patch for COVID-19 that is as easy to apply as a Band-Aid. Officially, not that many people have recovered from the coronavirus. An epidemiologist explains what has to happen for a COVID-19 survivor to get a clean bill of health. To boost your immune defenses against corona and other viruses, one of the most effective things you can do is maintain your natural circadian rhythms. Here's how to do that. The new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, spreads faster than the H1N1 influenza virus and is much deadlier. SARS-CoV-2 is particularly skilled at keeping cells from calling out for help. Before a vaccine is available to teach your immune system to ward off the coronavirus, maybe you can directly use molecules that have already fought it in other people. A test that detects antibodies against the coronavirus behind COVID-19 would reveal those people who have already encountered the virus - and therefore who might be ok to resume normal life. "}
