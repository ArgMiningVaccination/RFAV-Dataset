The 'Calendar of the Soul' reveals Rudolf Steiner's earthly task in a unique way! And its particular importance for his life is evidenced in how, when and with whom he shared it. The inner journey with the Soul Calendar was also significant for Karl K\u00f6nig's life and work. He spent the year he was interned as an enemy alien during WWII in deep contemplation of the Calendar and made 52 drawings to illustrate the enigmatic verses. Rudolf Steiner and Karl K\u00f6nig each left a legacy - and they also left us with a challenge that calls us into the future! That will be theme of my talk, then we can turn to the question in conversation: Is perhaps now the time ripe to take up this Michaelic challenge in a new way that the 52 verses present to us? How does this relate particularly to the present world situation? Both the legacy and the challenge will be highlighted in exhibitions of Karl K\u00f6nig's drawings that the Institute is bringing to venues across North America in 2023 - 2024 including talks in each venue. Check out our events here: [karlkoeniginstitute.org/en/events.asp](https://www.karlkoeniginstitute.org/en/events.asp) * Richard Steel: Was born in Oxford, England and studied linguistics before moving to Camphill in Germany in 1972. He completed the Camphill Seminar for Curative Education and lived and worked in community with young people with multiple disabilities for 36 years. Richard and his family also spent time in Camphill in North America. In 2008 Richard founded the Karl K\u00f6nig Institute which now has offices in Scotland, Germany and North America. He began publishing a new edition of K\u00f6nig's works which currently comprises 24 volumes in English and German. The Institute's aim is to make Karl K\u00f6nig's healing impulses widely available for meeting the world needs of today - and for this purpose Richard also lectures in Europe, Great Britain and Scandinavia. Richard's exploration of the Calendar of the Soul was lit up over five decades by what Rudolf Steiner and Karl K\u00f6nig brought. And after Richard gave a yearlong series of talks on the Soul Calendar and K\u00f6nig's drawings, his new English translation of the 52 verses was published in 2023. * For further details or questions on events and initiatives of the Karl Koenig Institute in North America (including for example the 52 week Calendar of the Soul online program, the Calendar of the Soul artwork reprints, Richard's new book or the Calendar of the Soul Exhibition), please send an email to deborahgrace@karlkoeniginstitute.org.
