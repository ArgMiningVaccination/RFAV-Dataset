Its nourishing and cleansing actions restore resilience to the whole body by encouraging elimination of metabolic waste from the skin, liver, lymph, bowels, and kidneys. As in our bodies, Dandelion offers the Earth their nourishing powers by bringing minerals from deeper layers to the surface and helping to loosen compacted soil.

Regular use of nettles help normalize a variety of allergic responses, ranging from skin conditions, seasonal allergies and chemical sensitivities. One of the first edible plants of Springtime, nettles are a deeply nutritious, mineral - rich herbal food that gently encourage the organs of elimination to function more effectively. Milk Thistle: Our liver works hard to process so much of what we take in day to day. Milk thistle is an excellent remedy to support and protect the liver and kidneys, aiding them to more effectively clear toxins from the body. In addition to its restorative benefits, it also provides gentle toning to the digestive system. * This statement has not been evaluated by the Food & Drug Administration.
