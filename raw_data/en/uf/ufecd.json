Performance Improvement and Patient Safety Initiatives a. COVID -19 - From March 2020 to June 2022, over 200K COVID -19 tests were performed. From March 2022 - June 2022, the number of tests stabilized at 200 -300 tests a day. Testing methods o Hologic Panther and GeneXpert - Majority of testing is performed on the Hologic Panther, a TMA (Transcription Mediated Amplification) method of testing. Testing done with use of GeneXpert takes about 1.5 hours. o Rapid ID NOW and BioFire Torc h Respiratory Virus Panel - Rapid ID NOW takes about 20 -30 minutes to obtain results and is used mainly for ED patients. The BioFire Torch Respiratory Virus Panel detects 22 different virus /bacteria targets that cause respiratory illness, including COVID -19/SARS -CoV-2 virus. Tracking Tests o Volume - The number of COVID -19 tests is tracked daily with aforementioned 4 testing methods. o Location - Tests are tracked by location to monitor unusual surges/outbreaks that might be happening in a particular area; in so doing, laboratory staffing can be properly managed. o Capacity - The laboratory keeps track of its capacity which is sent daily to Department of Public Health Testing Strategy Group ; in case of spikes, assistance from the noted group might be needed. b. High-Sensitivity Troponin Assay in Chemistry - The Troponin Care Path has been implemented in ED. There is on going data collection and monitoring u se in close coordination among Cardiology, ED, and Lab. c. New Testing Algorithm for Syphilis Testing - This allows more rapid screening for treponeme -specific antibodies right up front . A quick screening of syphilis is really important due to the increased cases of women having syphilis and congenital syphilis o ver the past years. Then, confirmato ry testing for initial positive specimens is performed. There is close coordination with Infectious Diseases and City Clinic. d. New C. Difficile Testing Algorithm - First PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is performed on Xpert that detects toxin B gene. The positives are followed by immunoassay to detect GDH antigen and toxin which helps in distinguishing between C. diff disease and colonization. This process will help control C. Diff in the hospital. e. Implementation of New GEM 5000 Blood Gas Analyzers - Last J une 2022, the POCT (Point -of-Care Team) implemented these new blood gas analyzers to replace aging blood analyzers and software. This involved coordination with RCS, ED, ORs, ICUs, and NICU. The new 5000s are easier to operate and have advance quality cont rol systems. f. Other PIPS Introduction of Cystatin C testing with ongoing work on eGFR equations - with Nephrology Expanded HPV Genotype testing access for all women in ZSFG and SF CHN (send out test to reference lab) - with Anatomic Pathology and SFHN Increase quantiferon testing for inpatients and ZSFG clinics - with TB Clinic and SF PHL g. Involvement in Hospital/Medical Staff Committees - A list of positions held by the faculty in various committees was presented. 4. Research - The faculty research ranges from original basic research to translational research with much work on the latter. Extensive research was done on SARS -CoV-2 infection and vaccination with looking into immune response and neutralizing antibodies; all research ers had publications in this area. Moreover, the researchers evaluate new biomarkers to diagnose, treat, and monitor disease. Also, new methods were developed for detection of drugs with use of mass spectrometry. In addition, Dr. Jeff rey Whitman has been m uch involved in measuring antibody responses in patients with Chagas Disease. The publications, presentations, awards, and research by faculty members were highlighted. 5. Financial Report a. Revenue vs Expenses - In FY 21 -22, the revenues and expenses amounte d to about $387M and $27M, respectively. The budget for expenses is usually $32M; there were savings with the departure of many staff members. A new batch of staff members was recently hired which will increase expenses to $32M henceforth. b. Clinical Lab R esearch Report FY 21 -22 - The laboratory has offered research testing for 104 researchers over the last year. A large amount of research testing is done for the HIV/ID/PHP groups. Additional groups served are Medicine, Gastroent erology, Cardiology, and oth ers. 6. 2020 -2022 Achievements - The most recent Laboratory Joint Commission inspection happened in June 2022. An excellent performance was achieved by the incredible leadership and staff with 99% complian ce due to only 8 findings . 7. Summary a. Strengths - These include strong leadership, experienced, and hard -working staff. Also, there is extensive lab menu, along with ability to evaluate and adapt new assay methods (i.e., new Blood Gas instruments and testing algorithms). Moreover, there are consultative ser vices by faculty, residents, and lab leadership team. In addition, there are excellent teaching programs and strong research programs. The UCSF affiliation is an advantage with collaboration in research and training. There is also support fr om ZSFG leaders hip and staff. b. Plan - There is a plan for a Core Lab for Chemistry and Hematology. The current laboratory will be remodeled with the goal of starting the project by the end of the year. c. Challenges - These include the following: Chemistry Lab - There is a need to validate new Atellica Chemistry analyzers, along with re -establishing refe rence ranges for ZSFG patient populations. (The older analyzers are increasingly less reliable .) These validations should be accomplished this fall. Building 5 Retrofit Project - This has greatly impacted Microbiology. Instruments had to be moved and re -validated. pg. 3 Others - These include budget management; nationwide shortage of available clinical lab scientists; retention of clinical lab scientists, supervisors, and support staff; hiring of new Bl ood Bank Director; improvement of life cycle for City Contracts; and LIS projects with DPH (Epic Beaker, Data Innovations, Blood Bank LIS) and setting up automation line with needed connections to report to EPIC. d.

EDUCATION AND RESEARCH Laboratory Medicine Service Rules and Regulations 20 220 Lab Administration Formatted: Left The Laboratory Medicine Service at ZSFG actively participates in and promotes UCSF's academic mission in medical education and research. Graduate and undergraduate medical education and research is conducted in accordance with applicable UCSF and ZSFG administrative policies and procedures and ZSFG Medical Staff Bylaws. The Laborato ry Director is accountable to the UCSF's Associate Dean at ZSFG and the Chair of Laboratory Medicine for establishment, supervision, periodic review, and, if necessary, corrective actions of educational and research programs within the Clinical Laboratory. The Laboratory Medicine Service also actively supports professional staff training and education through offering a Clinical Laboratory Scientist (CLS) student internship program in partnership with San Francisco State University, and by maintaining a C ontinuing Education Program, administered by the Department's Continuing Educati on Committee under the general direction of the Laboratory Director . This program is approved for State of California Continuing Education credits as authorized by the Continui ng Education Accreditation Agency of the UCSF Clinical Laboratory at Zuckerberg San Francisco General , for which the Laboratory Director serves as Administrator. All faculty and staff are encouraged to maintain and enhance their professional skills by attendance at professional meetings and participation in appropriate educational conferences, seminars and courses. VI. LABORATORY MEDICINE SERVICE RESIDENT TRAINING PROGRAM AND SUPERVISION Attending faculty shall supervise house staff in such a way that House staff assume progressively increasing responsibility for patient care according to their level of training, ability and experience (Refer to CHN Website for Housestaff Competencies ). Before starting their rotation residents will be oriented to the Laboratory Medicine Service, provided with a packet of relevant documents including Laboratory Safety Guidelines, and will attest to receipt of these materials (Attachment B: Lab Med Servic e Resident's Packet) A. Description There are 2-3 Laboratory Medicine Residents assigned at all times to individual rotations within the Laboratory Medicine Service s at ZSFG . These rotations are in the Microbiology, Clinical Chemistry/Toxicology, and Hemato logy/Blood Bank Divisions of the Clinical Laboratory. B. Resident Duties Resident duties differ on each of the rotations but fall into 3 major categories: test approval, test interpretation, and clinical consultation. Detailed information on resident duties f or each of the rotations, guidelines for prospective and retrospective review of blood product usage, the recommended management of issues commonly encountered outside of routine working hours , including when to notify attending faculty, are maintained by the Laboratory Medicine Service, reviewed annually and updated as necessary . Orientation and Learning material for Laboratory Medicine Residents is Laboratory Medicine Service Rules and Regulations 20 220 Lab Administration Formatted: Left maintained within each lab oratory division and reviewed by Division Chiefs and Leadership staff as needed. (Attachment C: ZSFG Laboratory Medicine Rotations ). C. Resident Supervision Laboratory Medicine (also referred to as Clinical Pathology) residency training is a three year postgraduate program (for Laboratory Medicine only) or two years of a four year combined residency training program in Anatomic Pathology/Clinical Pathology (AP/CP). The UCSF combined AP/CP residency training program or the straight Laboratory Medicine residency training program has flexibility, such that resident competencies and ski lls are not correlative with year of training. Resident competencies and skills are instead related to type of clinical rotation completed. For example, a resident in his/her final year (4th) year of training may be taking a Clinical Microbiology rotation for the very first time in his/her training. In contrast, another resident may have already completed such a rotation in his/her first year of training. Laboratory Medicine residency training at ZSFG consists of three core rotations - Microbiology, Chemi stry/Toxicology, and Hematology/Blood Bank /Cell Therapy . Microbiology and Chemistry/Toxicology rotation s each last two months, the Hematology/Blood Bank rotation lasts one month. Elective rotations are offered in Toxicology and Consultative Hemato logy / T ransfusion Medicine . Each rotation is supervised by the Chief of the respective Clinical Laboratory Division. The Laboratory Director serves as training site coordinator, ensuring orientation of residents at the beginning of the rotation, appropriate handl ing and resolution of residency -related issues and maintenance of materials and environment for effective education and learning. Each resident assigned to a rotation in the Clinical Laboratory is closely supervised by the responsible Division Chief during the regular work day. Clinical responsibilities typically consist of test approvals, test interpretations, and clinical consultations. All of these resident functions have direct impact on patient care, as residents make decisions about requests fo r esoteric testing, interpret laboratory results for diagnostic or therapeutic decisions, and recommend testing strategies for optimum patient management. Initially, all issues and concerns are discussed with and supervised by the respective Division Chief at least daily. The resident assumes more responsibility and independence later in the rotation when s/he has become familiar with the issues unique to each division, is knowledgeable about the policies governing these issues, and the Division Chief has d eveloped confidence in his/her clinical judgment. Laboratory Medicine residents also participate in a variety of clinical conferences (e.g., Medicine's Morbidity and Mortality report, Infectious Diseases conference, Cardiology conference, Endocrinology Co nference, Poison Control rounds, etc.). These conferences provide a feedback mechanism by which the residents (and respective Division Chief ) can witness the impact of their decisions. These conferences also provide a feedback mechanism for the Clinical Service in general, in which existing Laboratory Medicine policies can be discussed and modified, if necessary. In addition to their daily duties, each Laboratory Medicine Service Resident takes call for all Clinical Laboratory Services at the 5 UCSF teach ing hospitals (UCSFMC, Mission Bay, Mt. Zion, ZSFG , VAMC) on a rotating basis to provide consultation on laboratory - related issues, approve unusual laboratory tests requests and handle transfusion -related Laboratory Medicine Service Rules and Regulations 20 220 Lab Administration Formatted: Left problems arriving outside of routine hours (Mon -Fri 5PM - 8AM , Weekends and Holidays) . Faculty members provide backup at all times by long range beepers and/or telephone. Disagreements between a clinical service and the Laboratory Medicine Resident are resolved by the faculty member responsible for the ser vice. All situations handled by residents while on -call are logged and reviewed and critiqued weekly via internet video conferencing by Clinical Laboratory faculty from all UCSF teaching sites . Laboratory Medicine residents do not perform invasive proced ures, with the exception of bone marrow aspirates / biopsies which would be performed under direct supervision of a Clinical Hematology Fellow or Attending. Some of their duties regarding test utilization or clinical consultation, however, can have serious impact on the acute clinical management and course of the patient (i.e., blood product use, antimicrobial susceptibility test interpretation, etc.). All major decisions having clinical impact are either discussed immediately or reviewed regularly by the responsible Division Chief . D. Resident Evaluation ZSFG Laboratory Medicine residents are evaluated daily by the responsible Division Chief and by all faculty and the Chief of the Service weekly as to their performance while \"on-call\" (Friday morning conferenc e). Residents are given constant informal feedback on their performance as well as recommendations for improvement, if necessary. Residents are given a formal in -person evaluation halfway through their rotation, with concrete recommendations for improving their performance if necessary. Residents are formally evaluated at the end of their rotation by the responsible Division Chief . The evaluation is discussed and the discussion documented by checking the appropriate box on the online evaluation form ( MedH ub). The UCSF Laboratory Medicine Residency Program Director reviews all final evaluations. Copies of all evaluations are available through the Laboratory Medicine Residency Program Director or the Residency Program Coordinator ( contact information: phone: 415-353-7359 , 185 Berry Street 1036, Suite 100, Universi ty of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA. 94143 - 0506 ). The Director of the Laboratory Medicine Residency Training Program meets with each resident twice annual ly to review performance, discuss evaluations, and address concerns. E. Ability to Write Patient Orders ZSFG Laboratory Medicine residents do not independently write patient orders. VII. CLINICAL LABORATORY FELLOWSHIP PROGRAMS In addition to Housestaff training Laboratory Medicine Res idents , the Clinical Laboratory offers accredited postdoctorate fellowship education in Clinical Chemistry /Toxicology. Curriculum development, orientation, supervision and evaluation of fellows is the responsibility of the faculty Laboratory Medicine Service Rules and Regulations 20 220 Lab Administration Formatted: Left member overseeing the respective programs, observing UCSF and ZSFG administrative policies and ZSFG Medical Staff Bylaws Rules and Regulations . VIII. LABORATORY MEDICINE SERVICE CONSULTATION CRITERIA Formal or informal professional consultation will be provided upon request for a member of the Medical Staff, professional or administrative personnel of the SFDPH , or other clients of the Laboratory M edicine Service . Such consultations will be provided by Laboratory Medicine residents , fellows, faculty or Clinical Laboratory Scientists, as appropriate. A consultation may also be initiated by the Laboratory Medicine Service if a potential problem is dis covered that may adversely affect patient care. IX. DISCIPLINARY ACTION The Zuckerberg San Francisco Genera l Medical Staff Bylaws, Rules and Regulations will govern all disciplinary action involving members of the ZSFG Laboratory Medicine Service . X. LABORATORY MEDICINE PERFORMA NCE IMPROVEMENT/PATIENT SAFETY (PIPS) AND UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT A.
