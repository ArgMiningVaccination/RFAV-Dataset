Background The test plan for the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN\u00ae) was developed by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing, Inc (NCSBN\u00ae). The purpose of this document is to provide detailed information about the content areas tested in the NCLEX-RN examination. This booklet contains the: \u00842019 NCLEX-RN\u00ae Test Plan; \u0084Information on testing requirements questions (items); \u0084Item writing exercises; and \u0084Bibliography and Appendix. About the NCLEX-RN\u00ae Test Plan The test plan is reviewed and approved by the NCLEX\u00ae Examination Committee every three years. Multiple resources are used, including the recent practice analysis of registered nurses (RNs), and expert opinions of the NCLEX Examination Committee (NEC), NCSBN content staff, and boards of nursing/regulatory bodies to ensure that the test plan is consistent with nurse practice acts. Following the endorsement of proposed revisions by the NCLEX Examination Committee, the test plan document is presented for approval to the Delegate Assembly, which is the decision-making body of NCSBN. The test plan serves a variety of purposes. It is used to guide candidates preparing for the examination, to direct item writers in the development of items, and to facilitate the classification of examination items. This document offers a comprehensive listing of content for each client needs category and subcategory outlined in the test plan. Sample items are provided at the end of each category, which are specific to the client needs category in that section. There is an item writing guide along with sample case scenarios, which provide nurse educators with hands-on experience in writing NCLEX\u00ae style test items.

To ensure public protection, each jurisdiction requires candidates for licensure to meet set requirements that include passing an examination that measures the competencies needed to perform safely and effectively as a newly licensed, entry-level RN. NCSBN develops a licensure examination, the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN\u00ae), which is used by member board jurisdictions and most Canadian nursing regulatory bodies, to assist in making licensure decisions. Several steps occur in the development of the NCLEX-RN Test Plan. The first step is conducting a practice analysis that is used to collect data on the current practice of the entry-level nurse (Report of Findings from the 2017 RN Practice Analysis: Linking the NCLEX-RN\u00ae Examination to Practice, NCSBN, 2018). Twelve thousand newly licensed RNs are asked about the frequency and importance of performing nursing care activities. Nursing care activities are then analyzed in relation to the frequency of performance, impact on maintaining client safety, and client care settings where the activities are performed. This analysis guides the development of a framework for entry-level nursing practice that incorporates specific client needs as well as processes fundamental to the practice of nursing. The second step is the development of the NCLEX-RN Test Plan, which guides the selection of content and behaviors to be tested. The NCLEX-RN Test Plan provides a concise summary of the content and scope of the licensing examination. It serves as a guide for examination development as well as candidate preparation. The NCLEX\u00ae assesses the knowledge, skills and abilities that are essential for the entry-level nurse to use in order to meet the needs of clients requiring the promotion, maintenance or restoration of health. The following sections describe beliefs about people and nursing that are integral to the examination, cognitive abilities that will be tested in the examination and specific components of the NCLEX-RN Test Plan. Beliefs Beliefs about people and nursing underlie the NCLEX-RN Test Plan. People are finite beings with varying capacities to function in society. They are unique individuals who have defined systems of daily living reflecting their values, motives and lifestyles. People have the right to make decisions regarding their health care needs and to participate in meeting those needs. The profession of nursing makes a unique contribution in helping clients achieve an optimal level of health in a variety of settings. Nursing is both an art and a science, founded on a professional body of knowledge that integrates concepts from the liberal arts and the biological, physical, psychological and social sciences. It is a learned profession based on knowledge of the human condition across the life span and the relationships of an individual with others and within the environment. Nursing is a dynamic, continually evolving discipline that employs 4 2019 NCLEX-RN\u00ae Test Plan critical thinking to integrate increasingly complex knowledge, skills, technologies, and client care activities into evidence-based nursing practice. The goal of nursing for client care is preventing illness and potential complications; protecting, promoting, restoring, and facilitating comfort, health and dignity in dying. The RN provides a unique, comprehensive assessment of the health status of the client. The RN applies principles of ethics, client safety, health promotion and the nursing process to develop and implement an explicit plan of care that reflects unique cultural and spiritual client preferences, the applicable standard of care and legal considerations. The nurse assists clients to promote health, cope with health problems, adapt to and/or recover from the effects of disease or injury, and support the right to a dignified death. The RN is accountable for abiding by all applicable member board jurisdiction statutes and regulations/rules related to nursing practice. Classification of Cognitive Levels Bloom's taxonomy for the cognitive domain is used as a basis for writing and coding items for the examination (Bloom, et al., 1956; Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001). Since the practice of nursing requires application of knowledge, skills and abilities, the majority of items are written at the application or higher levels of cognitive ability, which requires more complex thought processing. Test Plan Structure The framework of Client Needs was selected for the examination because it provides a universal structure for defining entry-level nursing actions and competencies, and focuses on clients in all settings. Client Needs The content of the NCLEX-RN Test Plan is organized into four major Client Needs categories. Two of the four categories are divided into subcategories: Safe and Effective Care Environment \u0084Management of Care \u0084Safety and Infection Control Health Promotion and Maintenance Psychosocial Integrity Physiological Integrity \u0084Basic Care and Comfort \u0084Pharmacological and Therapies \u0084Reduction of Risk Potential \u0084Physiological Adaptation5 2019 NCLEX-RN\u00ae Test Plan Integrated Processes The following processes are fundamental to the practice of nursing and are integrated throughout the Client Needs categories and subcategories: \u0084Nursing Process - a scientific, clinical reasoning approach to client care that includes assessment, analysis, planning, implementation and evaluation. \u0084Caring - interaction of the nurse and client in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust. In this collaborative environment, the nurse provides encouragement, hope, support and compassion to help achieve desired outcomes. \u0084Communication and Documentation - verbal and nonverbal interactions between the nurse and the client, the client's significant others, and the other members of the health care team. Events and activities associated with client care are recorded in written and/or electronic records that demonstrate adherence to the standards of practice and accountability in the provision of care. \u0084Teaching/Learning - facilitation of the acquisition of knowledge, skills and abilities promoting a change in behavior. \u0084Culture and Spirituality - interaction of the nurse and the client (individual, family or group, including significant others and populations) which recognizes and considers the client-reported, self- identified, unique and individual preferences to client care, the applicable standard of care and legal considerations. Distribution of Content The percentage of test questions assigned to each Client Needs category and subcategory of the NCLEX-RN Test Plan is based on the results of the Report of Findings from the 2017 RN Practice Analysis: Linking the NCLEX-RN\u00ae Examination to Practice (NCSBN, 2018) and expert judgment provided by members of the NCLEX Examination Committee. Client NeedsPercentage of Items from Each Category/Subcategory Safe and Effective Care Environment \u0084Management of Care 17-23% \u0084Safety and Infection Control 9-15% Health and Maintenance 6-12% Psychosocial Integrity 6-12% Test Plan NCLEX-RN examinations are administrated adaptively in variable length format to target candidate-specific ability. To accommodate possible variations in examination length, content area distributions of the individual examinations may differ up to \u00b13% in each category. Overview of Content The activity statements used in the 2017 RN Practice Analysis: Linking the NCLEX-RN\u00ae Examination to Practice (NCSBN, 2018) preface each of the eight content categories and are identified throughout the test plan by an asterisk(*). NCSBN performs an analysis of those activities used frequently and identified as important by entry-level nurses to ensure client safety. This is called a practice analysis; it provides data to support the NCLEX as a reliable, valid measure of competent, entry-level nursing practice. The practice analysis is conducted every three years. In addition to the practice analysis, NCSBN conducts a knowledge, skills and abilities (KSA) survey. The primary purpose of this study is to identify the knowledge needed by newly licensed registered nurses (RNs) in order to practice safe and effective care. Findings from both the 2017 RN Practice Analysis and the 2017 RN KSA survey can be found at www.ncsbn.org/1235.htm. Both documents are used in the development of the NCLEX-RN Test Plan as well as to inform item development. All task statements in the 2019 NCLEX-RN\u00ae Test Plan require the nurse to apply the fundamental principles of clinical decision-making and critical thinking to nursing practice. The test plan also assumes that the nurse integrates concepts from the following bodies of knowledge: \u0084Social Sciences (psychology and sociology); \u0084Biological Sciences (anatomy, physiology, biology and microbiology); and \u0084Physical Sciences (chemistry and physics).Management of Care 20% Safety and Infection Control 12% Health Promotion and Maintenance 9% Psychosocial Integrity 9%Basic Care and Comfort 9%Pharmacological and Parenteral Therapies 15%Reduction of Risk Potential 12%Physiological Adaptation 14%Distribution of Content for the NCLEX-RN\u00ae Test Plan7 2019 NCLEX-RN\u00ae Test Plan In addition, the following concepts are applied throughout the four major client needs categories and subcategories of the test and Spirituality Please note: There are certain inconsistencies throughout this document related to word usage and punctuation. Sentences or phrases marked by an asterisk (*) are activity statements taken directly from the 2017 RN Practice Analysis: Linking the NCLEX-RN\u00ae Examination to Practice. In order to provide proper attribution to the original survey these statements have not been altered to fit the overall grammatical style of this document. In addition, the term \"client\" refers to the individual, family, or group, which includes significant others and populations. \"Clients\" are the same as \"residents\" or \"patients.\" In general, if the age or age category of the client is not stated in an item, it can be understood that the client is an adult. NCLEX items are developed based on a variety of practice settings such as: acute care, long-term care/rehabilitation care, outpatient care and community-based/home care settings. 8 2019 NCLEX-RN\u00ae Test Plan MANAGEMENT OF CARE Related Activity Statements from the 2017 RN Practice Analysis: Linking the NCLEX-RN\u00ae Examination to Practice \u0084Integrate advanced directives into client plan of care \u0084Assign and supervise care of client provided by others (e.g., LPN/VN, assistive personnel, other RNs) \u0084Organize workload to manage time effectively \u0084Practice and advocate for cost effective care \u0084Initiate, evaluate, and update client plan of care \u0084Provide education to clients and staff about client rights and responsibilities \u0084Advocate for client rights and needs \u0084Collaborate with interprofessional team members when providing client care \u0084Manage conflict among clients and health care staff \u0084Maintain client confidentiality and privacy \u0084Provide and receive hand off of care (report) on assigned clients \u0084Use approved abbreviations and standard terminology when documenting care \u0084Perform procedures necessary to safely admit, transfer and/or discharge a client \u0084Prioritize the delivery of client care \u0084Recognize ethical dilemmas and take appropriate action \u0084Practice in a manner consistent with a code of ethics for nurses \u0084Verify the client receives appropriate education and consents for care and procedures \u0084Receive and transcribe health care provider orders \u0084Utilize resources to enhance client care (e.g., evidenced-based research, information technology, policies and procedures) \u0084Recognize limitations of self and others and utilize resources \u0084Report client conditions as required by law (e.g., abuse/neglect, communicable disease) \u0084Provide care within the legal scope of practice \u0084Participate in performance improvement projects and quality improvement processes \u0084Assess the need for referrals and obtain necessary ordersSafe and Effective Care Environment The nurse promotes achievement of client outcomes by providing and directing nursing care that enhances the care delivery setting in order to protect clients and health care personnel.

Administration of the NCLEX-RN\u00ae Examination The NCLEX-RN is administered to candidates by computerized adaptive testing (CAT). CAT is a method of delivering examinations that uses computer technology and measurement theory. With CAT , each candidate's examination is unique because it is assembled interactively as the examination proceeds. Computer technology selects items to administer that match the candidate's ability. The items, which are stored in a large item pool, have been classified by test plan category and level of difficulty. After the candidate answers an item, the computer calculates an ability estimate based on all of the previous answers the candidate selected. The next item administered is chosen to measure the candidate's ability in the appropriate test plan category. This process is repeated for each item, creating an examination tailored to the candidate's knowledge and skills while fulfilling all NCLEX-RN Test Plan requirements. The examination continues with items selected and administered in this way until a pass or fail decision is made. Examination Length The NCLEX-RN is a variable length computerized adaptive test and can range from 75 to 265 items. Of these items, 15 are pretest items that are not scored. Regardless of the number of items administered, the time limit for this examination is six hours. The time allotted for the examination includes the tutorial, sample items, all optional breaks and the examination. The length of the examination is determined by the candidate's response to the items. Depending upon the particular pattern of correct and incorrect responses, candidates will receive different numbers of items and therefore use varying amounts of time. The candidate should select and maintain a reasonable pace that will permit them to complete the examination within the allotted time should the maximum number of items be administered. In general, it is recommended that the candidate spend approximately one to two minutes per item in order to maintain this pace. Each candidate is given an examination that adheres to the test plan and is therefore given the opportunity to demonstrate his or her ability. The length of the candidate's examination is not an indication of a pass or fail result. A candidate may pass or fail regardless of the length of the examination. Additional information on passing and failing rules are included in further detail in this section. The Passing Standard The NCSBN Board of Directors (BOD) reevaluates the passing standard once every three years. The criterion that the BOD uses to set the standard is the minimum level of ability required for safe and effective entry- level nursing practice. To assist the BOD in making this decision, they are provided with information on: 1. The results of a standard setting exercise performed by a panel of experts with the assistance of psychometricians; 2. The historical record of the passing standard with summaries of the candidate performance associated with those standards; 3. The results of a standard setting survey sent to educators and employers; and 4. Information describing the educational readiness of high school graduates who express an interest in nursing.43 2019 NCLEX-RN\u00ae Test Plan Once the passing standard is set, it is applied uniformly to every examination according to the procedures laid out in the Scoring the NCLEX section. To pass the NCLEX, a candidate must perform above the passing standard. There is no fixed percentage of candidates that pass or fail each examination. Similar Items Occasionally, a candidate may receive an item that seems to be very similar to an item received earlier in the examination. This may happen for a variety of reasons. Items may contain content pertaining to similar symptoms, diseases, or disorders, yet address different phases of the nursing process. Alternatively, a pretest (unscored) item may contain content similar to an operational (scored) item. Candidates should not assume they received a second item similar in content to a previously administered item because the candidate answered the first item incorrectly. The candidate is instructed to always select the answer believed to be correct for each item administered. Reviewing Answers and Guessing Examination items are presented to the candidate one at a time on a computer screen. There is no time limit for a candidate to spend on each individual item. Once an answer to an item is selected, the candidate has the ability to consider the answer and change it, if necessary. However, once the candidate confirms the answer and proceeds to the next item by pressing the <NEXT> button, the candidate will no longer have the ability to return to a previous item. Every item must be answered even if the candidate is not sure of the correct answer. If the candidate is unsure of the correct answer, the candidate should consider all response options and provide their best answer in order to proceed to the next item. The computer will not allow the candidate to proceed to the next item without answering the current item on the screen. The best advice is to maintain a reasonable pace (one item every minute or two), and carefully read and consider each item before answering. Scoring the NCLEX\u00ae Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) The NCLEX is different from a traditional fixed-length examination, which administers the same items to every candidate. Fixed-length examinations ensure that the difficulty of the examination is constant for every candidate; therefore, the percentage correct is the indicator of the candidate's ability. This approach requires high ability candidates to answer all easy items on the examination and low ability candidates to guess on difficult items. This method provides less accurate information about the candidate's true ability. The NCLEX uses CAT to administer items. CAT is able to produce exam results that are more precise and efficient, using fewer items by targeting items to the candidate's ability. The computer (i.e., CAT scoring algorithm) estimates the ability of the candidate in relation to the passing standard. Every time the candidate answers an item, the computer re-estimates the candidate's ability. With each additional answered item, the ability estimate becomes more precise.44 2019 NCLEX-RN\u00ae Test Plan Each item that the candidate receives is selected from a large pool of items using three criteria: 1. The item is limited to the content area that will produce the best match to the test plan percentages. CAT ensures that each candidate's exam contains enough items from each content area to match the required test plan percentages. 2. An item is selected that the candidate is expected to find challenging. The computer estimates the candidate's ability based on all previous answers and the difficulty of those items, and selects an item that the candidate should have a 50 percent chance of answering correctly. This ensures the next item should not be too easy or too difficult and the examination can obtain maximum information about the candidate's ability from the item. 3. Excludes any item that a repeat candidate has seen in the current item pool. Pretest Items For CAT to function properly, the difficulty of each item must be known in advance. The degree of difficulty is determined by administering the items as pretest items to a large sample of NCLEX candidates. Since the difficulty of pretest items are unknown in advance, these items are not included when estimating the candidate's ability and subsequently making pass-fail decisions. When enough responses are collected, the pretest items are statistically analyzed and calibrated. If the pretest items meet the NCLEX statistical standards, they can be administered on future examinations as operational items. There are 15 pretest items on every NCLEX-RN. Pretest items appear identical to operational items, therefore it is recommended that candidates give their best effort for every item. Passing and Failing The decision as to whether a candidate passes or fails the NCLEX is governed by three different scenarios: Scenario 1: The 95% Confidence Interval Rule This scenario is the most common for NCLEX candidates. The computer will stop administering items when it is 95% certain that the candidate's ability is either clearly above or clearly below the passing standard. Scenario 2: Maximum-Length Exam Some candidate's ability levels will be very close to the passing standard. When this is the case, the computer continues to administer items until the maximum number of items is reached. At this point, the computer disregards the 95% confidence interval rule and considers only the final ability estimate: \u0084If the final ability estimate is above the passing standard, the candidate passes. \u0084If the final ability estimate is at or below the passing standard, the candidate fails. Scenario 3: Run-Out-Of-Time Rule (R.O.O.T) If a candidate runs out of time before reaching the maximum number of items and the computer has not determined with 95% certainty whether the candidate has passed or failed, an alternate criteria is used. \u0084If the candidate has not answered the minimum number of required items, the candidate automatically fails. \u0084If at least the minimum number of required items were answered, the computer looks at the last 60 ability estimates: \u0084If the last 60 ability estimates were consistently above the passing standard, the candidate passes.45 2019 NCLEX-RN\u00ae Test Plan \u0084If the candidate's ability estimate drops below the passing standard even once over the last 60 items, the candidate fails. This does not mean that the candidate must answer the last 60 items correctly. Each ability estimate is based upon all previous items answered. Scoring Items Many items on the NCLEX are multiple-choice, however other item formats exist. Items are scored as either correct or incorrect. There is no partial credit. For updated information on the administration of the examination, access the NCSBN website at www.ncsbn.org/nclex.htm. Types of Items on the NCLEX-RN\u00ae During the administration of the NCLEX-RN, candidates will be required to respond to items in a variety of formats. These formats may include, but are not limited to: multiple-choice, multiple response, fill-in-the-blank calculation, hot spots, exhibit, ordered response, audio and graphics. All item types may include multimedia, such as charts, tables, graphics, and audio. NCLEX\u00ae Terminology Client: Individual, family or group which includes significant others and populations. Prescription: Orders, interventions, remedies or treatments ordered or directed by an authorized primary health care provider. Primary Health Care Provider: Member of the healthcare team (usually a medical physician [or other specialty, e.g., surgeon, nephrologist, etc.], nurse practitioner, etc.), licensed and authorized to formulate prescriptions on behalf of the client. Unlicensed Assistive Personnel (UAP): Any unlicensed personnel trained to function in a supportive role, regardless of title, to whom a nursing responsibility may be delegated. Examination Security and Confidentiality Any candidate that violates test center regulations or rules, or engages in irregular behavior, misconduct and/or does not follow a test center administrator's warning to discontinue inappropriate behavior may be dismissed from the test center. Additionally, exam results may be withheld or cancelled and the licensing board may take other disciplinary action such as denial of a license and/or disqualifying the candidate from future registrations for licensure. Refer to the current candidate bulletin at www.ncsbn.org/1213.htm for more information. Candidates should be aware and understand that the disclosure of examination items before, during, or after the examination is a violation of law. Violations of confidentiality and/or candidates' rules can result in criminal prosecution or civil liability and/or disciplinary actions by the licensing agency including the denial of licensure. Tutorial Each NCLEX-RN candidate is provided information on how to answer examination items. A tutorial is given at the beginning of the examination explaining the various formats that candidates may see on the examination. More information on alternate item formats is available at the NCSBN website at www.ncsbn.org/9010.htm. The following are examples of how screens in the tutorial may appear with examples of possible item formats. 46 2019 NCLEX-RN\u00ae Test Plan Multiple Choice (one answer):47 2019 NCLEX-RN\u00ae Test Plan Multiple Response: 48 2019 NCLEX-RN\u00ae Test Plan Fill-in-the-Blank: 49 2019 NCLEX-RN\u00ae Test Plan Hot Spot: 50 2019 NCLEX-RN\u00ae Test Plan Exhibit Item: 51 2019 NCLEX-RN\u00ae Test Plan Drag and Drop/Ordered Response Item: 52 2019 NCLEX-RN\u00ae Test Plan Audio Item: 53 2019 NCLEX-RN\u00ae Test Plan Graphic Item: To receive updated information, visit the NCSBN website at www.ncsbn.org .54 2019 NCLEX-RN\u00ae Test Plan IV. Item Writing Exercises The following written exercises are designed to provide nurse educators with hands-on experience in writing NCLEX style items. Please note, not all item types are provided in the Item Writing Exercises. Refer to the NCSBN website, www.ncsbn.org, for answers to Frequently Asked Questions and additional information on alternate item formats. NCSBN offers three online web-based courses for nursing faculty (Test Development and Item Writing, Assessment of Critical Thinking and Understanding the NCLEX-A Guide for Nursing Educators). Please utilize these web-based courses as a means of supplementing knowledge of test writing principles and to encourage compliance with the NCLEX style of writing. The above-mentioned courses may be found at www.learningext.com.
