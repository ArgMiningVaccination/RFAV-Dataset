The Certificate protects against the involuntary release of information about your subjects collected during the course of our covered studies. The researchers involved in the studies cannot be forced to disclose the identity or any information collected in the study in any legal proceedings at the federal, state, or local level, regardless of whether they are criminal, administrative, or legislative proceedings. However, the subject or the researcher may choose to voluntarily disclose the protected information under certain circumstances. For example, if the subject or his/her guardian requests the release of information in writing, the Certificate does not protect against that voluntary disclosure. Furthermore, federal agencies may review our records under limited circumstances, such as a DHH S request for information for an audit or program evaluation or an FDA request under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. The Certificate of Confidentiality will not protect against mandatory disclosure by the researchers of information on suspected child abu se, reportable communicable diseases, and/or possible threat of harm to self or others ABSTRACT Despite improvements in outcomes for patients with localized Ewing sarcoma, patients with newly diagnosed metastatic Ewing sarcoma continue to have poor outc omes with standard multiagent chemotherapy. A large body of preclinical data supports a role for IGF -1R inhibition in the treatment of Ewing sarcoma. More recently, clinical trials of IGF -1R monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated single - agent activity in patients with relapsed Ewing sarcoma. Ganitumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against IGF -1R. In this phase 3 randomized trial, patients with newly diagnosed metastatic Ewing sarcoma are randomized at study entry to the comparator arm with interval compressed multiagent chemotherapy or to the experimental arm with interval compressed multiagent ch emotherapy and the addition of g anitumab. The primary endpoint is event -free survival. Feasibility of this approach and evaluation of stereotactic body radiotherapy to sites of bone metastasis are additional clinical objectives. 300 eligible and evaluable patients will enroll. A series of correlative biology studies will explore markers of response to IGF -1R inhibition. These studies include serum markers of the -1 pathway, IGF -1R expression on bone marrow micrometastatic tumor cel ls, and polymorphisms in EGFR as a potential resistance mechanism.

THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 12 2.0 BACKGROUND 2.1 Metastatic Ewing Sarcoma There has been considerable improvement in the outcome of patients with localized Ewing sarcoma over the last two decades. In contrast, the overall survival for patients with initially metastatic disease continues to be less than 30% across multiple studies.1-5 Some groups have reported that patien ts with isolated lung metastases have a better outcome than patients with bone and/or bone marrow metastases.4,5 2.2 Interval Compressed Chemotherapy in Ewing Sarcoma Standard therapy for Ewing sarcoma in COG protocols includes alternating cycles of vincristine/doxorubicin/cyclopho sphamide (VDC) with ifosfamide/etoposide (IE).6 With the positive results of COG protocol AEWS0031, the new standard remains VDC alternating with IE, with cycles now given on an interval -compressed basis every 2 weeks for a total of 14 cycles.7 Of note, the s tandard arm of AEWS1031 includes a total of 17 cycles of chemotherapy in order to maintain uniformity in treatment length with the experimental arm of that study. The effect of the addition of 3 cycles on outcomes is not clear and therefore 14 cycles of th erapy per the interval compressed arm of AEWS0031 has been chosen for the chemotherapy backbone of this study. Sub-analysis of AEWS0031 demonstrated that older patients were able to receive interval - compressed chemotherapy as prescribed. Specifically, the median cycle length for patients 18 years of age was 15 days compared to 15 days for patients < 18 years of age (R. Womer, personal communication). AEWS0031 only included patients with localized Ewing sarcoma. Therefore, the tolerability and activity of interval -compressed VDC/IE in patients with metastatic disease remains unclear. This issue will be addressed in this study. 2.3 Role of IGF -1R Inhib ition in Ewing Sarcoma Several lines of evidence indicate that targeting the insulin like growth factor receptor -1 (IGF -1R) will be an effective strategy in the treatment of Ewing sarcoma. All but one Ewing sarcoma cell line evaluated in 2 early studies de monstrated expression of both IGF - 1 and IGF -1R.8,9 In contrast to wild -type fibroblasts, fibroblasts lacking IGF -1R were not transformed after transfection with EWS/FLI1 .10 EWS/FLI1 appears to repress expression of IGF binding protein -3 (IGF -BP3), an endogeno us inhibitor of the Several small molecule inhibitors of IGF -1R have demonstrated activity in preclinical models of Ewing sarcoma.12-14 In one study, Ewing sarcoma was among the solid tumor histologies most sensitive to inhibition by one such inhibitor, GSK1904529A.14 Early studies demonstrated that a neutralizing antibody against the IGF -1R inhibited the growth of all Ew ing sarcoma cell lines tested.8,9,15 This effect was also observed in Ewing sarcoma mouse xenografts.16 Comp ared to 43% of control -treated mice, no antibody - treated mice developed lung metastases. The Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) has evaluated two IGF -1R monoclonal antibodies (SCH 717454 and IMC -A12) in a panel of Ewing sarcoma cell lines and xen ografts17,18 SCH 717454 demonstrated little in vitro activity. In contrast, 2 of 5 Ewing sarcom a xenografts demonstrated significant prolongation of time to event and significant inhibition of tumor growth after treatment with SCH 717454. One of these xenografts showed tumor regression in response to SCH 717454 and met criteria for \"high\" level acti vity.18 IMC-A12 demonstrated both in vitro THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 13 and in vivo activity. Two of 4 Ewing sarcoma cell lines demonstrated more than 50% reduction in cell growth. Two of 5 Ewing sarcoma xenografts showed reductions in tumor size and 3 of 5 showed prolongation in time to event.17 Ganitumab has also been evaluated in preclinical models of Ewing sarcoma, with demonstrated activity both as a single agent and in combination with rapamycin.19 2.4 Clinical Experience with IGF -1R Monoclonal Antibodies in Patients with Ewing Sarcoma Based on these promising preclinical studies, several groups have evaluated anti -IGF-1R monoclonal antibodies in patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma. A phase 2 study of ganitumab included 18 patients with Ewing sarcoma treated with 12 mg/kg IV every two weeks. One patient had a confirmed partial response ( 6% response rate).20 Closer evaluation of the data demonstrated that 6/18 (33%) patients had regressions of at least 10%. A phase 2 study of R1507 included 115 patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma and demonstrated an objective response rate of 1 0%.21 In COG protocol ADVL0712, one of 10 patients with Ewing sarcoma treated with IMC -A12 at the 6 mg/kg dose level had a confirmed partial respo nse and 4 additional patients had stable disease for at least 3 cycles.22 At the 9 mg/kg dose level, 2 of 20 patients had RECIST partial responses.23 Of 16 patients with Ewing sarcoma treated on a phase 1 study of figitumumab (20 mg/kg IV every 3 -4 weeks), one patient had a complete response, one patient had a partial response, and 6 patients had stable disease for more than 4 months (12.5% response rate).24 A phase 2 study of figitumumab in 106 patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma recently demonstrated a 14% response rate.25 A phase 1 study of MK -0646 included 6 patients with Ewing sarcoma, one of whom had a mixed response.26 These studies ind icate that IGF -1R monoclonal antibodies have single agent activity in patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma, with objective response rates of approximately 10%. 2.5 Rationale for Combining IGF -1R Inhibition and Chemotherapy in Ewing Sarcoma Several preclinical studies have evaluated the strategy of IGF -1R inhibition in combination with chemotherapy. These studies have demonstrated that treatment with an IGF -1R inhibitor increases the sensitivity of Ewing sarcoma cells to the effects of chemot herapy. In one study, the addition of an IGF -1R monoclonal antibody enhanced the cytotoxic effects of or vincristine (additive effect) on Ewing sarcoma cells.27 This effect was observed when cells were treated with IGF -1R monoclonal antibody with concomitant or sequential chemotherapy. Synergistic and additive antipr oliferative effects in in vitro and in vivo Ewing sarcoma studies have also been reported with the combination of chemotherapy and small molecule IGF -1R inhibitors13,28 or with an IGF - 1R dominant negative construct.29 IGF-1R monoclonal antibodies have started to undergo evaluation in combination with chemotherapy in adults and children. COG protocol ARST08P1 is evaluating intensive chemotherapy with and without the addition of IMC -A12 in children and young adults with newly diagnosed hig h-risk rhabdomyosarcoma. The chemotherapy backbone in ARST08P1 is similar to the chemotherapy backbone of this study, including cycles of VDC alternating every two weeks with IE. Toxicity has been consistent with the expected toxicity during intensive chem otherapy alone , though 3 cases of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) at the highest dose level of IMC -A12 prompted dose reduction to the equivalent of the adult recommended phase 2 dose (Doug Hawkins, personal THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 14 communication ). With regard to risk of card iac toxicity, 1 of 20 patients treated with IMC - A12 at a dose of 3 mg/kg developed Grade 3 congestive heart failure and 1 of 19 patients treated without IMC -A12 developed Grade 3 or 4 left ventricular systolic dysfunction. None of the 13 patients treated with IMC -A12 at a dose of 6 mg/kg has developed Grade 3 or 4 cardiac toxicity. Detailed data on Grade 1 and 2 toxicities are not collected on ARST08P1. The addition of IMC -A12 has not impacted the ability to administer interval compressed chemotherapy cycles. The median duration of each reporting period has been similar for patients on ARST08P1 treated with and without IMC -A12 (J. Anderson/S. Malempati, personal communication ). IMC-A12 has been evaluated in combination with doxorubicin in adults with soft tissue sarcoma (median age 64 years with range 29 -80 years).30 In this phase 1 study, 2 dose- limiting toxicities (mucositis and hyperg lycemia) were seen among 13 patients treated with 3 mg/kg IMC -A12. The dose was escalated to the maximum planned dose of 6 mg/kg IMC - A12 in 10 evaluable patients, none with dose -limiting toxicity. Two of 13 patients treated with 3 mg/kg IMC -A12 developed G rade 3 left ventricular systolic dysfunction after a minimum of 4 courses of combination therapy. Figitumumab has also been evaluated in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with non -small cell lung cancer. Patients in a phase 1 study were treated with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and escalating doses of figitumumab.31 A maximum tolerated dose was not identified. A phase 2 study randomized 156 patients to paclitaxel and carboplatin, with or without figitumumab.32 The response rate was higher in pat ients randomized to receive figitumumab. The combination was tolerable, with the rates of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and hyperglycemia somewhat higher in patients receiving figitumumab. With this experience, a phase 3 trial was initiated in patients with new ly diagnosed advanced NSCLC.33 Patients were randomized to receive paclitaxel and carboplatin either with or without figitumumab. The study was discontinued early when a planned interim analysis met futility limits. 2.6 Clinical Experience with Ganitumab Ganitumab is a fully human mon oclonal antibody directed against IGF -1R. The drug has high affinity for IGF -1R, with a K D of 0.3 nM (Ganitumab Investigator's Brochure; October 4, 2011). The drug inhibits binding of IGF -1 and IGF -2 to the extracellular domain of IGF -1R. The IC 50 for bloc king IGF -1R phosphorylation in the presence of IGF -1 or IGF - 2 is 0.6 nM. A phase 1 study included 53 patients with advanced solid cancers treated twice weekly.34 A maximum tolerated dose was not reached and 20 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks was deemed tolerable, though biochemical bloc kade was achieved at levels of 12 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks. Four of 23 patients treated at the 20 mg/kg dose level developed Grade 3 thrombocytopenia. The only other Grade 3 toxicities noted across dose levels were arthralgia (n=1); diarrhea (n=1); and fatig ue (n=1). Aside from aforementioned study of single agent ganitumab in Ewing sarcoma (and desmoplastic small round cell tumor or DSRCT), most phase 2 studies of this agent have focused on combination approaches. Preliminary reports have demonstrated the tolerability of ganitumab at doses 12 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks when used in combination with erlotinib, sorafenib, AMG 655, and gemcitabine.35-37 The combination of ganitumab (12 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks) to gemcitabine improved 6 -month overall survival in patients THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 15 with advanced pancreatic cancer in a phase 2 trial,36 though a randomized phase 3 trial testing this combination in advanced pancreatic cancer was stopped early when futility stopping rules were met. The pharmacokinetic profile of ganitumab appears to differ somewhat between adult patients with various solid tumors and adult patients with Ewing sarcoma and DSRCT treated on a phase 2 trial .20 Specifically, patients on this phase 2 trial treated with 12 mg/kg every 2 weeks had lower trough concentrations after their first and third doses of ganitumab compared to patients with relapsed solid tumors treated on 2 other studies with this same dose and schedule. The mean \u00b1 SD trough concentration after C ycle 1 was 17 .5 \u00b1 8.52 \u00b5g/mL for EWS/DSRCT vs. 22 \u00b1 11 \u00b5g/mL and 26.1 \u00b1 12.5 \u00b5g/mL for other solid tumors. The mean \u00b1 SD trough concentration after Cycle 3 was 15.9 \u00b1 33.6 \u00b5g/mL for EWS/DSRCT vs. 27 \u00b1 15.9 \u00b5g/mL and 42.2 \u00b1 18.5 \u00b5g/mL for other solid tumors (Ganitumab I nvestigator's Brochure; October 4, 2011). 22 of 29 patients (75%) with EWS/DSRCT had ganitumab trough concentrations > 10 \u00b5g/mL after a single dose of 12 mg/kg.20 While a pediatric phase 1 clinical trial of gan itumab has not been performed, several points suggest that proceeding with the proposed pediatric and adult study based on the adult experience with this drug is reasonable. First, IGF -1R monoclonal antibodies as a class have been well tolerated in both ad ults and children. Second, of the compounds in this class in which adult and pediatric phase 1 studies have been performed, the recommended pediatric dose has not been lower than the adult dose. For example, the recommended pediatric phase 2 dose of IMC -A12 is 9 mg/kg weekly,23 which compares favorably to the adult recommended phase 2 dose of 6 mg/kg weekly.38 Likewise, for dalotuzumab, the recommended pediatric phase 2 dose (900 mg/m2 IV every 3 weeks) was similar to the recommended adult phase 2 dose.39 Third, the dose used in this study is below the maximum dose evaluated and deemed tolerable in the adult single ag ent phase 1 study. Fourth, the study includes a pharmacokinetics cohort to confirm that pediatric patients achieve adequate serum levels of ganitumab with the planned starting dose of 18 mg/kg (see Section 2.7 ). 2.7 Rationale for Proposed Ganitumab Starting Dose and Pharmacokinetic Evaluation The starting dose of ganitumab for this study will be 18 mg/kg. This dose was selected for several reasons. First, biochemical blockade of IGF -1R signaling is observed at serum concentrations > 10 \u00b5g/mL .40 Blockade of IGF -1R epitope binding on neutrophils also begins to serum concentrations of 10 \u00b5g/mL (Ganitumab Investigator's Brochure; October 4, 2011). Trough serum concentrations in excess of this target trough concentration value of 10 \u00b5g/mL are anticipated using 18 mg/kg, extrapolating from the experience fro m the phase 2 trial of young adults with relapsed Ewing sarcoma treated with 12 mg/kg (see above). These trough serum concentrations compare favorably with the IC 50 of ganitumab in 2 Ewing sarcoma cell lines of 1.6 and 3.7 nanomolar (0.54 \u00b5g/mL and 0.23 \u00b5g/mL) .19 In in vivo studies of ganitumab against mouse Ewing sarcoma xenografts, activity was noted at doses of ganitumab that yield steady state serum concentrations of 4.7 \u00b5g/mL.19 Second, experience with ganitumab and other IGF -1R monoclon al antibodies have demonstrated clinical activity in patients with Ewing sarcoma at doses below maximal evaluated dose levels of 20 mg/kg.23,41 For example, the phase 2 trial of ganitumab in patients with relapsed Ewing sarcoma used 12 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks.41 Third, combination studies have evaluated doses of 12 -20 mg/kg every 2 weeks.36 Fourth, given the risk of thrombocytopenia that has been observed with IGF -1R monoclonal THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 16 antibodies,21,23,34 use of maximal studied doses of ganitumab (20 mg/kg) may not be feasible in combination with interval compressed chemotherapy used for patients with Ewing sarcoma. Ganitumab has not been formally studied in children. Based on the phase 2 experience with ganitumab in Ewing sarcoma, it appears as though adults with Ewing sarcoma have higher clearance compared to adults with other solid tumors. While the starting dose o f ganitumab has been increased to 18 mg/kg to account for this possibility, it is nevertheless possible that younger patients will not meet the goal trough concentration of 10 \u00b5g/mL. In order to assess this possibility, the first 10 patients < 21 years of age randomized to receive ganitumab in Regimen B provide d trough serum samples for pharmacokinetics of ganitumab in Induction and Maintenance . These data demonstrated trough levels of ganitumab given at 18 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks appear to be adequate . 2.8 Rationale for Open -Label Study Design The study committee considered the possibility of a double -blind placebo -controlled study design. Such a design might have the advantage of reducing bias in the assessment of toxicity as sociated with protocol therap y. Another potential benefit of a placebo -controlled design might be reduction in early withdrawal of patients randomized to receive chemotherapy alone. However, it is not clear that these general benefits of a placebo -control apply to this specific clinical context. First, the toxicity assessments of greatest interest (depth and duration of myelosuppression; reduction in left ventricular systolic function) are objective test measures rather than subjective symptom -based toxicities. Likewise, the ascertain ment of the primary study endpoint (disease progression) is typically clear in this patient population and therefore less likely to be influenced by bias compared to more subjective endpoints. Second, patients who are randomized to receive chemotherapy alo ne will receive a chemotherapy regimen that has become standard in the community outside of a clinical trial. Importantly, the effect of interval compression on outcomes in metastatic Ewing sarcoma has not been studied. It is therefore possible that patien ts randomized to receive chemotherapy alone will have superior outcomes compared to patients treated with previous regimens solely as a result of interval compression. Moreover, the study committee is not aware of a competing trial for patients with newly diagnosed metastatic Ewing sarcoma who have already started chemotherapy and have not had disease progression. Third, the investigator blind associated with a placebo control would be threatened by anticipated hyperglycemia following ganitumab . For all of these reasons, the added cost and complexity associated with adding a placebo control does not appear justified and this study will utilize an open label design. 2.9 Rationale for Maintenance Phase with Ganitumab Several pieces of data suggest that us e of single -agent ganitumab as M aintenance therapy may be beneficial in patients with advanced Ewing sarcoma. First, preclinical data indicate that IGF -1R inhibition reduces formation of bone metastases in an experimental metastasis xenograft model of Ewing sarcoma.12 These findings have implications for using ganitumab to slow the progression of minimal residual disease. Second, as des cribed above, ganitumab has single -agent preclinical and clinical activity in Ewing sarcoma.19,41 Third, the strategy of using biological therapy to eradicate minimal residual disease has been used successfully in the treatment of patients with high -risk neuroblastoma.42,43 This strategy THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 17 has not previously been used in the treatment of metastatic Ewing sarcoma and the current trial provides an opportunity to evaluate this approach in this high -risk population. Based on pharmacokinetic modeling in adults with solid tumors , use of ganitumab at a dose of 18 mg/kg given every 3 weeks is anticipated to yield adequate trough serum concentrations (Ganitumab Investigator Brochure; October 4, 2011) and this protocol includes an assessment of trough concentrations with this dosing schedule . 2.10 Rationale for FDG -PET Imaging of Bone Metastases Previous COG trials for patients with metastatic Ewing sarcoma have relied upon technetium -based radionuclide whole body bone scans to detect and evaluate bone metastases. Since the inceptio n of those previous trials, multiple studies have been published that detail the superior performance of FDG -PET scans for the diagnosis and evaluation of bone metastases in patients with Ewing sarcoma.44-49 For example, one report noted sensitivity and specificity for identifying bone metastases in Ewing sarcoma as 100% and 96% vs. 68% and 87% for bone scan.45 Results were more striking in another analysis of 17 patients with Ewing sarcoma and pai red bone scans and FDG -PET scans.48 The sensitivity for detecting bone metastases was 88% for FDG -PET and only 37% for bone scan. Therefore, the current trial will utilize FDG -PET imaging to detect bone metastasis. A collateral benefit of this change is that FDG -PET allows detection of soft tissue sites of metastasis48, provides information about response at the primary tumor (see below), and may serve as a biomarker of response to IGF-1R inhibition (see below). 2.11 Rationale for Imaging Aims FDG -PET in addition to MRI to evaluate primary tumor response Conventional response assessment of primary Ewing sarcoma tumors involves anatomic imaging, most commonly with MRI. For those patients undergoing surgical local control, histologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy can also be assessed. Recent reports have raised concern that response by MRI may not correlate with histologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patien ts with Ewing sarcoma. For example, one report noted similar changes in tumor volume by MRI between patients with good histologic response and patients without a good histologic response.50 Another study reached the same conclusion using tumor cross -sectional area by MRI.51 FDG -PET imaging has been shown to be a useful tool for monitoring the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed Ewing sarcoma. Several reports have noted that response by FDG -PET correlates with histologic response at the time of def initive surgical resection of the primary Ewing sarcoma tumor.44,50-53 Moreover, at least one report obse rved that favorable response by FDG -PET after neoadjuvant chemotherapy correlated with improved progression -free survival.53 However, it is important to note that the majority of patients in these previous studies had localized Ewing sarcoma. T he ability of FDG -PET to aid in primary tumor response assessment in patients with metastatic disease has been less well studied and differences in FDG -PET imaging may exist between these 2 populations. Indeed, one group has reported that baseline primary tumor standardized uptake values (SUVs) are higher in patients with metastatic Ewing sarcoma compared to localized Ewing sarcoma.54 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 18 Since patients will undergo serial whole body FDG -PET imaging to evaluate their metastatic disease, this study provides an opportunity to evaluate the utility of FDG -PET imaging in assessing primary tumor response in metastatic Ewing sarcoma. Non -invasive measures of tumor response are particularly important in this patient population given lower rates of surgical local control. FDG -PET as a potential biomarker of response to IGF -1R inhibition Agents that inhibit the IGF -1R pathway may result in hyperglycemia due to impairments in cellular uptake of glucose. Not surprisingly, then, FDG -PET imaging has been explored as a potential biomarker of response to IGF -1R inhibition. In preclin of a IGF -1R/insulin receptor inhibitor, drug exposure impeded FDG uptake in cells expressing IGF -1R, but not in cells that lack IGF -1R expression.55 This effect also correlated with direct measures of IGF -1R pathway inhibition, including lower phospho - AKT levels. A similar effect on FDG uptake was observed in a preclinical study following treatment w ith an antibody directed against IGF -1 and IGF -2 ligand.56 Finally, in a phase 1 trial of IMC -A12 plus temsirolimus for adults with advanced solid tumors, change in SUV showed a suggestive correlation with clinical benefit from that drug combination.57 2.12 Rationale for Evaluation of Hypofractionated Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) for Bone Metastases Conventional external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for Ewing sarcoma requires 31 daily treatments totaling 55.8 Gy. Bone metastases are currently recom mended to receive the same dose and fractionation using EBRT, with some evidence of efficacy of this approach.58,59 Because of the volume of bone marrow in the radiation field and concerns about ability to complete chemotherapy, treatment of the metastatic sites is often delayed until after treatment of the primary site and often at the end of therapy. Local control after radiotherapy to metastatic sites is largely unknown, as many patients with multiple or extensive sites of disease are often treated with palliative doses of radiati on which are not expected to provide long -term durable tumor control. Hypofractionated stereotactic radiation therapy has been shown to be a highly effective treatment for brain metastases in both the adult and pediatrics population.60,61 Intracranial stereotactic radiation treatments are often complete in 1 to 5 fractions with similar or improved loca l control outcomes as conventional fractionation and the benefit of minimal interruption to systemic therapy treatments and smaller irradiated volumes. Until recently, treatment of extracranial sites with radiosurgery has not been possible due to inadequat e immobilization and image -guidance to safely administer large doses of highly -targeted radiotherapy.62 Recent technologic advances including full -body immobilization devices, robotic treatment tables, and stereotactic imag e-guidance are now available and have been used to treat extracranial metastases with stereotactic radiotherapy in adults.63 Doses range from 18 -30 Gy in a single fraction to 24 -60 Gy in 5 fractions. Local control rates in excess of 75 -90% have been reported using extracranial SBRT for metastatic tumors of the spine64, lung and liver, which is significantly higher than conventional moderate dose radiation in these locations.65 Toxicity has been minimal in these reports despite the use of very high biological equivalent doses and now over 10 years of experience with this technology.66,67 SBRT has a particularly strong rationale for application in pediatrics given that high biologically effective doses have been shown to increase local control in more radioresistant histologies, such as sarcomas.68,69 With stereotactic radiation therapy techniques, both patient immobilization and rapid dose fall -off result in a reduction in THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 19 normal tissue dose surrounding the target lesion of interest and may result in lower toxicity.65 Reduction in irradiated volumes may also facilitate earlier administration of local control. In addition, the convenience of a 5 -fraction treatment course is expected to improve compliance with the recommendation for definitive radiotherapy at known sites of disease. We hypothesize that aggressive treatment of bone metastases with SBRT will be possible within the context of a COG groupwide study and may improve outcomes by preventing progression at known sites of disease compared with standard EBRT. 2.13 Rationale for Dexrazoxane Cardioprotection myocytes from doxorubicin -induced apoptosis.70,71 At least part of this effect involves signaling through the PI3 -kinase/AKT pathway.72 apoptosis in cardiac myocytes.73 Therefore, a theoretical risk of increased cardiac toxicity exists with the combination of an IGF-1R monoclonal anti body and doxorubicin -based chemotherapy. Dexrazoxane is a cardioprotectant that is recommended for use in adult patients receiving > 300 mg/m2 cumulative doxorubicin doses.74 Several studies in children and adults with sarcoma have demonstrated a role for dexr azoxane in reducing the risk of anthracycline - induced cardiomyopathy.75-79 In COG protocol AEWS1031 for patients with newly diagnosed localized Ewing, dexrazoxane is used as a cardioprotectant during the last 2 courses of doxorubicin -based therapy. In COG trials of agents that may increase the risk of doxorubicin -induced dexrazoxane has been utilized from the start of doxorubicin -based chemotherapy. The addition of dexrazoxane in these studies has not appeared to impact the ability to deliver intensive multi -agent chemotherapy, including a similar chemotherapy regimen in ARST08P1 to the regimen used in the current protocol. Patients i n both arms of the trial will receive dexrazoxane cardioprotection prior to each dose of doxorubicin. This therapy will be administered to patients randomized to chemotherapy alone in order to standardize the therapy received by both treatment groups and a lso due to the anticipated high rates of whole lung radiation to be employed in the treatment of this patient population. 2.14 Rationale for Correlative Biology Studies 2.14.1 Serum Markers of IGF Predictors of Response to IGF -1R n Given the heterogeneous response to IGF -1R monoclonal antibodies in patients with relapsed Ewing sarcoma, identifying predictive biomarkers of response is critical in the development of these agents for patients with Ewing sarcoma. Peripheral bl ood markers of the IGF -1 pathway are among the most promising putative response biomarkers in adults with carcinoma treated with IGF -1R monoclonal antibodies. For example, p reliminary data suggest that patients with non-small cell lung cancer and elevated serum free IGF -1 levels have reduced toxicity and increased survival when treated with figitumumab.80 Similarly, patients with advanced pancreatic cancer and elevated total IGF -1 blood levels appeared to have improved outcomes when treated with ganitumab.81 Recent data have emerged that also support an association between IGF -1 levels and outcome after anti -IGF-1R therapy in patients with relapsed Ewing sarcoma. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 20 These studies demonstrated that elevated baseline and Week 6 total serum IGF -1 as well as higher relative increase in serum IGF -1 correlated with outcomes in patients with relapsed Ewing sarcoma treated with R1507.21 Total and free serum IGF-1 levels also correlated with outcomes in patients with relapsed Ewing sarcoma treated with figitumumab.25 Increases in growth hormone, insulin, and IGFBP3 have also been reported in patients with Ewing sarcoma treated with IGF - 1R monoclonal antibodies, though the impact of these changes on outcomes have not yet been repo rted.23,25 In preclinical studies, upregulation of IGF -2 expression has been described as a mechanism of resistance to IGF -1R inhibition in Ewing sarcoma, though not yet evaluated as a potential biomarker of resistance in clinical studies.82 These results were obtained from uncontrolled trials in patients with relapsed Ewing sarcoma. These results may therefore indicate a role for IGF -1 levels as a prognostic factor rather than a predictive biomarker of response to anti -IGF-1R therapy. Moreover, the extent to which these findings will apply to patients with newly diagnosed Ewing sarcoma remains to be established. 2.14.2 Tumor IGF -1R Expression as Predictor of Response to IGF -1R Inhibition Preclinical data from the PPTP suggest tha t Ewing sarcoma xenograft tumors with higher IGF -1R expression may be more likely to respond to an IGF -1R monoclonal antibody.18 A cohort of 16 patients with Ewing sarcoma treated with an IGF -1R monoclonal antibody had tumor IGF -1R levels measured.23 There was no association between tumor IGF -1R expression and response to IGF -1R inhibition in this small cohort. In contrast, in a cohort of 37 patients with non -small cell lung cancer, higher tumor IGF -1R expression correlated with higher response rate to therapy that included an IGF -1R monoclonal antibody.83 The association between markers of tumor IGF -1R activation and clinical response to IGF -1R inhibitors has not been evaluated. Therapeutic IGF -1R monoclonal a ntibodies both inhibit IGF - 1R function and reduce levels of IGF -1R protein present at the cell surface.84 As such, clearance of cell surface IGF -1R wo uld be anticipated to serve as a pharmacodynamic marker of IGF -1R effect, but also potentially as a predictive biomarker of response to IGF -1R monoclonal antibody treatment. A flow cytometry approach for detecting occult Ewing sarcoma cells amidst a backg round of hematopoietic cells has been developed and depends upon the CD99 -postive / CD45 -negative (CD99+CD45 -) immunophenotype of these cells.85 Among 42 patients with newly diagnosed Ewing sarcoma and no clinical evidence of bone marrow metastases, 45% of patients had CD99+CD45 - bone marrow cell levels greater than observed in controls. In the current study, flow cytometric evaluation of occult bone marrow tumor cells will be evaluated as a possible early marker o f minimal residual disease in patients with metastatic Ewing sarcoma. Moreover, bone marrow micrometastatic cell IGF -1R co -expression will be evaluated as a potential biomarker of response to ganitumab therapy. This assay provides an ideal platform for eva luating tumor IGF -1R expression, activation, and clearance as markers of response to ganitumab. The current study will utilize this flow cytometry assay as well as evaluation of paraffin -embedded diagnostic tumor material to quantify IGF -1R expression at diagnosis and following initiation of protocol therapy. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 21 to IGF -1R Inhibition Increased EGFR pathway signaling may represent one mechanism of resistance to the antic ancer effects of IGF -1R inhibitors.86 In head and neck cancer, IGF - induced signaling is enhanced by EGFR activation and/or EGFR/IGF -1R scaffolding.87 Reciprocal activatio n and been reported after inhibition of either receptor.88 Inducible signaling through EGFR in response to IGF-1R inhibition has been observed in hepatocellular carcinoma.89 In cell lines resistant to a small molecule inhibitor of IGF -1R (BMS -536924), EGFR is Additive activity was observed for BMS -536924 used in combination with gefitinib, a small molecule inhibitor of EGFR, in the Rh26 rhabdomyosarcoma cell line.90 Preclinical studies have demonstrated that the presence of a germline polymorphism (G/G) at site -216 in the EGFR promoter has been associate d with Induction of EGFR gene expression in response to IGF -1R inhibition (E. Anders Kolb, personal communication). the G/G genotype this locus correlated with resistance to inhibition in a panel of Ewing sarcoma xenografts. Whether this promoter polymorphism correlates with EGFR expression and response to IGF -1R inhibition has not been studie d in patients treated with IGF -1R monoclonal antibodies. This protocol includes a correlative study to test the hypothesis that the presence of this polymorphism is associated with resistance to IGF -1R directed therapy. 2.14.4 Evaluation of EWSR1 and Ot her Translocations As detailed above, Ewing sarcoma appears to be particularly sensitive to IGF -1R inhibition and there is a link between the EWSR1 translocation and increased IGF - 1R signaling. Recently, Ewing -like sarcomas have been described that are characterized by translocations involving genes other than EWSR1 .91,92 It is not known to what extent these other sarcomas will be s ensitive to IGF -1R inhibition. It is also not known what proportion of patients enrolling to clinical trials for Ewing sar coma harbor alternative translocations. Two aims will help to addre ss these gaps in our knowledge. First, data on clinical testing performed to assess for the presence of an EWSR1 translocation will be collected in pat ients enrolling to this study. Second , new technology has emerged that enables detection of tumor -specific genetic aberrations in cell free DNA collected from the plasma. This technology enables detection of a range of potential translocations of interest, as well as other potential mutations of interest in this disease (eg. STAG2 and TP53 ).93-95 This testing will be explored on a research basis to assess for EWSR1 translocatio ns, other translocations, and other potential tumor -specific genetic changes of interest at the time of study enrollment and in response to therapy . Expansion of plasma cell free DNA assessment with Amendment #3 C: Preliminary da ta from other groups suggest that circulating tumor DNA may clear rapidly after treatment .96,97 In order to more fully characteriz e the dynamics of ctDNA clearance in this population , additional timepoints have been added with Amendment #3 C. In addition, emerging data suggest that EDTA may not be the THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 22 optimal collection tube for evaluation of plasma cell free DNA in the context of a multicenter clinical trial. With Amendment #3 C, blood for this aspect of the study will be collected in specialized Streck tubes.98 2.14.5 Genomic Testing of Tumor Cells The approach de scribed above ( Section 2.14.2 ) provides the potential to isolate bone marrow metastatic tumor cells for potential future testing. As proof of principle, fluorescent activated cell sorting using the CD99+CD45 - immunophenotype has been used to isolate and then test bone marrow metastatic tumor cells for the presence of the characteristic EWSR1 translocation by fluorescen t in situ hybridi zation (FISH). On both samples tested, the presence of this translocation was detected in 88% of the isolated cells. It is not known to what extent the genomic profile of metastatic Ewing sarcoma mirrors that of localized Ewing sarcoma. The current proto col provides an idea l opportunity to assess the gen omic profile of metastatic Ewing sarcoma by using bone marrow metastatic tumor cells as the source of DNA for detailed genomic analysis. With Amendment #3 C, tumor DNA and RNA sequencing via next gener ation sequencing methods is being added as an optional study to expand the number of somatic markers evaluated as part of Aim 1.3.6. Sequencing data will provide an opportunity to explore potential relationships between key somatic mutations described in a subset of Ewing sarcoma tumors (e.g., STAG2 and TP53 ) and clinical outcome.93-95 Moreover, the RNA sequencing data will provide an opportunity to explore potential relationships between expression of key genes of interest (e.g., genes encoding IGF -1R, IGFBP3, PTEN, insulin receptors) and clinical out come as well as potential relationships between gene expression profiles and clinical outcome. Finally, the RNA sequencing data will allow orthogonal ascertainment of translocation status, with determination of both gene partners involved in the translocat ion. 2.15 Rationale for Amendment #2 AEWS1221 was originally designed as a phas e 2 randomized screening trial. This design was chosen over a definitive phase 3 trial due to concerns about the potential to complete a definitive pha se 3 trial in a timely ma nner. Specifically, 3.5 patients/month were expected to be available. In the context of a screening trial requiring 126 patients, 3 years of accrual were expected. Moreover, at the time the study was designed, it was not clear that sufficient ganitumab wou ld be available to support a larger trial. AEWS1221 activated to enrollment in December 2014 and there have bee n no suspensions to enrollment. As of May 6, 2016, 96 patients have enrolled over 17 months for an average monthly accrual rate of 5.6 patient s/month. Since the study was activated, an additional supply of ganitumab has become available. Given the strong interest in this trial and its underlying rationale along with increased drug supply, the study committee has amended the trial to determine definitively the role of IGF - 1R inhibit ion in this patient population. The study committee is not aware of competing trials in development that would impact interest in this trial. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 23 2.16 Rationale for Amendment #6 The COG DSMC reviewed outcomes t o date as of March 2019. The DSMC recommended closure to accrual and discontinuation of ganitumab for all patients on Regimen B on active therapy. These recommendations were based upon lack of significant benefit of the addition of ganitumab to interval co mpressed chemotherapy in this population as well as the potential for increased risk of toxicity in patients on Regimen B. Specifically, an imbalance between Regimen A and Regimen B was observed in the number of patients with pneumonitis (1 case on Regimen A and 6 cases on Regimen B). The changes recommended by DSMC were implemented via an urgent COG groupwide memo dated March 20, 2019. Amendment #6 now makes these changes to the protocol and adds guidance for the diagnosis and management of pneumonitis. 3.0 STUDY ENROLLMENT PROCEDURES AND PATIENT ELIGIBILITY 3.1 Study Enrollment 3.1.1 Patient Registration Prior to enrollment on this study, patients must be assigned a COG pa tient ID number. This number is obtained via the Patient Registry module in OPEN once authorization for the release of protected health information (PHI) has been obtained. The COG patient ID number is used to identify the patient in all future interactions with COG. If you have problems with the registration, please refer to the online help. For additional help or information, please contact the CTSU Help Desk at 1-888-823-5923 or ctsucontact@westat.com. In order for an institution to maintain COG membership requirements, every patient with a known or suspected neoplasm needs to be offered participation in ACCRN07, Protocol for the Enrollment on the Official COG Registry, The Childhood Cancer Research Network (CCRN) or APEC14B1, Project:EveryChild A Registry, Eligibility Screening, Biology and Outcome Study . A Biopathology Center (BPC) number will be assigned as part of the registration process. Each patient will be assigned only one BPC number per COG Patient ID. For additional information about the labeling of specimens please refer to the Pathology and/or Biology Guidelines in this protocol. Please see Appendix I for detailed CTEP Registration Procedures for Investigators and Associates, and CTSU Registration Procedures including: how to download site registration documents; requirements for site registration, submission of regulatory documents and how to check your site's registration status. 3.1.2 IRB Approval Each investigator or group of investigators at a clinical site must obtain IRB approval for this protocol and submit IRB approval and supporting documentation to the CTSU Regulatory Office befo re they can be approved to enroll patients. Assignment of site registration status in the CTSU Regulatory Support System (RSS) uses extensive data to make a determination of whether a site has fulfilled all regulatory criteria including but not limited to the following: An active Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) number THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 24 An active roster affiliation with the Lead Network or a participating organization A valid IRB approval Compliance with all protocol specific requirements . In addition, the site-protocol Principal Investigator (PI) must meet the following criteria: Active registration status The IRB number of the site IRB of record listed on their Form FDA 1572 An active status on a participating roster at the registering site. For informati on about the submission of IRB/REB approval documents and other regulatory documents as well as checking the status of study center registration packets, please see Appendix I . Institutions with patients waiting that are unable to use the Portal should alert the CTSU Regulatory Office immediately at 1 -866-651-2878 in order to receive further instruction and support. For general (non -regulatory) questions call the CTSU General Helpdesk at: 1 -888-823-5923. Note: Sites p articipating on the NCI CIRB initiative and accepting CIRB approval for the study are not required to submit separate IRB approval documentation to the CTSU Regulatory Office for initial, continuing or amendment review. For sites using the CIRB, IRB approv al information is received from the CIRB and applied to the RSS in an automated process. Signatory Institutions must submit a Study Specific Worksheet for Local Context (SSW) to the CIRB via IRBManager to indicate their intent to open the study locally. T he CIRB's approval of the SSW is then communicated to the CTSU Regulatory Office. In order for the SSW approval to be processed, the Signatory Institution must inform the CTSU which CIRB -approved institutions aligned with the Signatory Institution are par ticipating in the study. Other site registration requirements (i.e., laboratory certifications, protocol -specific training certifications, or modality credentialing) must be submitted to the CTSU Regulatory Office or compliance communicated per protocol in structions . 3.1.3 Reservation Requirements Patient enrollment for this study will be facilitated using the Slot -Reservation System in conjunction with the Registration system in the Oncology Patient Enrollment Network (OPEN). Prior to discussing protocol entry with the patient, site staff must use the CTSU O PEN Slot Reservation System to e nsure that a slot on the protocol is available for the patient. Once a slot -reservation confirma tion is obtained, site staff may then proceed to enroll the patient to this study. If the study is active, a reservation can be made by following the steps below: 1) Log in to https://open.ctsu.org/open/ using your CTEP IAM user name and password. 2) In order to make a reservation, the patient must have an OPEN patient number. Click on the 'Slot Reservation' tab to create an OPEN patient number, under 'Patients'.

Reservations may be obtained 24 hours a day through the OPEN system. 3.1.4 Study Enrollment Patient enrollment will be facilitated using the Oncology Patient Enrollment Network (OPEN). OPEN is a web -based registration system available on a 24/7 basis. To access OPEN, the site user must have an active CTEP -IAM account (check at https:// ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/iam ) and a 'Registrar' role on either the lead protocol organization (LPO) or participating organization roster. Registrars must hold a minimum of a n AP registration type. If a DTL is required for the study, the registrar(s) must also be assigned the OPEN Registrar task on the DTL. All site staff will use OPEN to enroll patients to this study. It is integrated with the CTSU Enterprise System for reg ulatory and roster data and, upon enrollment, initializes the patient position in the Rave database . OPEN can be accessed at https://open.ctsu.org or from the OPEN tab on the CTSU members' side of the websi te at https://www.ctsu.org . To assign an IVR or NPIVR as the treating, crediting, consenting, drug shipment (IVR only), or investigator receiving a transfer in OPEN, the IVR or NPIVR must list on their Form FDA 1572 in RCR the IRB number used on the site's IRB approval. If a DTL is required for the study, the IVR or NPIVR must also be assigned the appropriate OPEN -related tasks on the DTL. Prior to accessing OPEN, site staff should verify the following: All eligibility criteria have been met within the protocol stated timeframes. All patients have signed an appropriate consent form and HIPAA authorization form (if applicable). Note: The OPEN system will provide the site with a printable conf irmation of registration and treatment information. Please print this confirmation for your records. Further instructional information is provided on the CTSU members' web site OPEN tab or within the OPEN URL ( https://open.ctsu.org) . For any additional questions contact the CTSU Help Desk at 1 -888-823-5923 or ctsucontact@westat.com . THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 26 3.1.5 Timing Patients must be enrolled before treatment begins. The date protocol therapy is projected to start must be no later than five (5) calendar days after the date of study enrollment. Patients who are started on protocol therapy on this study prior to study enrollment will be considered ineligible . 3.1.6 Institutional Pathology Report Immediately following enrollment, the institutional pathology report for the diagn osis under which the patient is being enrolled must be uploaded into RAVE. The report must include the associated study number and COG patient registration and accession numbers. Personal identifiers, including the patient's name and initials must be remov ed from the institutional pathology report prior to submission. 3.1.7 Participation in Biology Studies . The investigational nature and objectives of the trial, the procedures and treatments involved and their attendant risks and discomforts, and potential alternative therapies will be carefully explained to the patient or the patient's parents or guardian if the patient is a child. In order to minimize the potential for non- compliance once enrolled, patients/guardians must be made aware that a num ber of the biology research studies are mandatory and understand that a significant number of non -standard blood samples will be required. 3.1.8 Randomization and Treatment Assignment Randomization will take place at the time a patient is enrolled via OP EN. Patients will be assigned to either the comparator arm (Regimen A) with the interv al compressed VDC/IE , or the experimental arm (Regimen B) with VDC/IE and ganitumab. Randomization will be stratified according to age at date of enrollment (< 21 years vs. 21 years) and extent of metastatic disease (lung only vs. any other metastatic site). The first 10 patients < 21 years of age at study entry assigned to Regimen B will submit required ganitumab trough serum samples in Induction and Maintenance (see Section 15.5 ). Note: e nrollment to this cohort completed as of July 2015 . 3.2 Patient Eligibility Criteria Important note : The eligibility criteria listed below are interpreted literally and cannot be waived (per COG policy posted 5/11/01). All clinical and laboratory data required for determining eligibility of a patient enrolled on this trial must be available in the patient's medical/research record which will serve as the source document for verification at the time of audit. All clinical and laboratory studies to determine eligibility must be performed within 7 days prior to enrollment unless otherwise indicated. Laboratory values used to assess eligibility must be no older than seven (7) days at the start of therapy. Laboratory tests need not be repeated if therapy starts within seven (7) days of obtaining labs to assess eligibility. If a post -enrollment lab value is outside the limits of eligibility, or laboratory values are > 7 days old, then the following laboratory THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 27 evaluations must be re -checked within 48 hours prior to initiating therapy: CBC with differential, bilirubin, ALT (SGPT) and serum creatinine. If the recheck is outside the limits of eligibility, the patient may not receive protoc ol therapy and will be considered off protocol therapy. Imaging, bone marrow and ECHO/MUGA must be performed within 4 weeks prior to start of protocol therapy (repeat if necessary). See Section 7.1 for required studies to be obtained prior to starting protocol therapy. INCLUSION CRITERIA 3.2.1 Age Patients 50 years of age at enrollment will be eligible for this study. Note: Infants and small children are eligible for this study, however, the treating physicians and family must be prepared to deliver adequate local control as required in this study (see Section 13.0 and 17.0). 3.2.2 Diagnosis Patients with histologic diagnosis (by institutional pathologist) of newly diagnosed Ewing sarcoma or peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) arising from bone or soft tissue and with metastatic disease involving lung, bone, bone marrow, or other metastatic site. For the purpose of this study , metastatic disease is defined as one or more of the following : Lesions which are discontinuous from th e primary tumor, are not regional lymph nodes, and do not share a bone or body cavity with the primary tumor. Skip lesions in the same bone as the primary tumor do not constitute metastatic disease. Skip lesions in an adjacent bone are considered bone meta stases. If there is any doubt whether lesions are metastatic, a biopsy of those lesions should be performed. Contralateral pleural effusion and/or contralateral pleural nodules. Distant lymph node involvement. Patients with pulmonary nodules are considered to have metastatic disease if the patient has: o Solitary nodule 0.5 cm or multiple nodules of 0.3 cm unless lesion is biopsied and negative for tumor; o Patients with solitary nodule < 0.5 cm or multiple nodules < 0.3 cm are not considered to h ave lung metastasis unless biopsy documents tumor. Bone marrow metastatic disease is based on morphologic evidence of Ewing sarcoma based on H&E stains. In the absence of morphologic evidence of marrow involvement on H&E, patients with bone marrow involvem ent detected ONLY by flow cytometry, RT -PCR, FISH, or immunohistochemistry will NOT be considered to have clinical bone marrow involvement for the purposes of this study. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 28 This study requires bilateral bone marrow biopsies at study entry. The suggested app roach for p atients with large pelvic tumors in which a posterior iliac crest bone marrow biopsy would track through the tumor is to instead undergo 2 marrow biopsies on the contralateral side (either 2 posterior biopsies or one posterior and one anterior b iopsy). Bone metastasis: This study utilizes whole body FDG -PET scans to screen patients for bone metastases. Areas suspicious for bone metastasis based on FDG -PET scans require confirmatory anatomic imaging with either CT (whole body FDG -PET/CT or FDG -PET/MR scan acceptable). Whole body technetium bone scans may be performed at the discretion of the investigator and are not required. For patients without other sites of metastatic disease whose sole metastatic site to qualify for study entry is a si ngle area suspicious for bone metastasis identified by FDG -PET, confirmatory biopsy or anatomic imaging evidence of an associated soft tissue mass at that site is required for study entry. 3.2.3 Adequate Tumor Tissue for Submission Patients must have adeq uate tumor tissue to meet the minim um requirement for submission (see Section 15.2 ). Enrolling institutions are reminded that submission of pre -treatment serum, tumor tissue and whole blood according to Sections 15.1, 15.2, and 15.3 is required. 3.2.4 Prior Therapy : Surgery Patients should only have had a biop sy of the primary tumor without an attempt at complete or partial resection. Patients will still be eligible if excision was attempted or accomplished as long as adequate anatomic imaging (MRI for most primary tumor sites) was obtained prior to surgery. 3.2.5 Organ Function Requirements 3.2.5.1 Adequate Renal Function Defined As: - Creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 - A serum age/gender as follows: Age Maximum Serum Creatinine (mg/dL) Male Female < 6 months 0.4 0.4 6 months to < 1 year 0.5 0.5 1 to < 2 years 0.6 0.6 2 to < 6 years 0.8 0.8 6 to < 10 years 1 1 10 to < 13 years 1.2 1.2 13 to < 16 years 1.5 1.4 16 years 1.7 1.4 The threshold creatinine values in this Table were derived from the Schwartz formula for estimating GFR99 (Schwartz et a l. J. Peds, 106:522, 1985) utilizing child length and stature data published by the CDC. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 29 3.2.5.2 Adequate Liver Function Defined As: - Total bilirubin 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age, and - SGPT (ALT) < 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age (except for patients with liver metastasis who may enroll if ALT < 5 times ULN for age). 3.2.5.3 Adequate Cardiac Function Defined As: - Shortening fraction of 27% or - Ejection fraction of 50% 3.2.5.4 Normal blood glucose for age Patients must have a normal blood sugar level for age to participate. If an initial random draw (ie. non -fasting) blood glucose value is out of range, it is acceptable to repeat this test as a fasting draw. 3.2.6 Exclusion Criteria 3.2.6.1 Patients with regional node involvement as their only site of disease beyond the primary tumor will not be eligible. 3.2.6.2 Patients whose primary tumors arise in the intra -dural soft tissue (eg. brain and spinal cord) are not eligible. 3.2.6.3 Patients who have received prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy are not eligible. 3.2.6.4 Pregnancy and Breast Feeding Female patients of childbearing potential are not eligible unless a negative pregnancy test result has been obtained. Lactating females are not eligible unless they have agreed not to breastfeed their infants for the duration of protocol therapy. Sexually active patients of reproductive potential are not eligible unless th ey have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method for the duration of protocol therapy. 3.2.6.5 Patients with known pre -existing diabetes mellitus will be excluded from study. 3.2.6.6 Concomitant Medications Restrictions (Please see Section 4.2 for the concomitant therapy restrictions for patients during treatment.) Patients receiving chronic pharmacologic doses of corticosteroids are not eligible. For the purposes of eligibility, chronic exposure is define d as anticipated exposure of > 3 weeks, including the sum of both pre - enrollment and antic ipated post -enrollment dosing. Patients on acute corticosteroid therapy ( 3 weeks of total planned exposure) must still meet the normal blood glucose requireme nt in Section 3.2.5.4 . Patients receiving chronic inhaled corticosteroids or chronic physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids are eligible. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 30 3.2.7 Regulatory Requirements 3.2.7.1 All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed consent. 3.2.7.2 All institutional, FDA, and NCI requirements for human studies must be met. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 31 4.0 TREATMENT PROGRAM Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical interventions are based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established standards of care. Minor unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy and/or disease evaluations (and up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family logistical, or facility, procedure and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable (except where explicitly prohibited within the protocol). 4.1 Overview of Treatment Plan 4.1.1 Overview NOTE: As of March 20, 2019, the s tudy closed to accrual and institutions were instructed to immediately discontinue ganitumab for patients on Regimen B. At study entry, patients will be randomiz ed to Regimen A (VDC/IE ) or Regimen B (VDC/IE + ganitumab). Treatment will consist of 4 phases of therapy: Induction; Local Control; Consolidation; and Metastatic Site Irradiation. (Originally a 5th phase of therapy, Maintenance was administered to patients on Regimen B only. However, Maintena nce therapy was discon tinued effective March 20, 2019. ) The chemotherapy backbone for this study is based on the interval compressed arm of AEWS0031. All patients will first receive a total of 14 cycles of chemotherapy; each cycle will be of 2 weeks duration. Induction consists of 6 cycles (12 weeks) of chemotherapy. Induction will be delivered prior to local control therapy, which may involve surgery and/or radiation therapy. Consolidation therapy will consist of 8 cycles ( 16 weeks) of chemotherapy. Patients rando mized to Regimen A will receive Induction, Local Control, Consolidation, and Metastatic Site Irradiation. These patients will then enter follow -up after completion of Metastatic Site Irradiation . Prior to March 20, 2019, p atients randomized to Regimen B receive d this same therapy with the addition of ganitumab 18 mg/kg/dose IV every 2 weeks for a total of 6 doses during Induction and for a total o f 5 doses during Consolidation. In order to avoid jeopardizing local contr ol measures, ganitumab was not to be given immediately prior to, during, or immediately after local control. After completion of Metastatic Site Irradiation , patients in Regimen B receive d an additional 8 doses of ganitumab 18 mg/kg given every 3 weeks as monotherapy during Mainten ance. These patients then enter ed follow -up after completion of Maintenance. Post March 20, 2019 : patients on Regimen B discontinue d ganitumab and instead receive th e same therapy as patients on Regimen A. Given theoretical concerns of possible addit ive cardiac toxicity of IGF -1R inhibition with doxorubicin, dexrazoxane will be given with each dose of doxorubicin in both regimens. Evaluation of cardiac function will be obtained at baseline, after cumulative doxorubicin dose of 150 mg/m2, and then prior to each doxorubicin cycle. See also Section 7.0 for required time points. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 32 The first 10 patients < 21 years of age at study entry assigned to Regimen B will submit required ganitumab trough serum samples in Induction and Maintenance (see Section 15.5 ). Registering sites will be notified of the need to obtain these samples at the time of randomization. (Enrollment to this cohort completed as o f July 2015 ; for patients previously assigned to this cohort , continue to collect samples as detailed in Section 15.5 .)

Consolidation Post-Consolidation Metastatic Site Radiation See Sections 4.1.1.2 and 17.0. No systemic therapy is given during this phase of therapy. Maintenance : Patien ts in Regimen A do not receive M aintenance therapy. Regimen B NOTE: As of March 20, 2019, the study closed to accrual and institu tions were instructed to immediately discontinue ganitumab for patients on Regimen B. This led to the removal of Maintenance therapy. Induction Post-Induction Local Control : See Sections 4.3, 13.0 and 17.0 . Consolidation Post-Consolidation Metastatic Site Radiation See Sections 4.1.1.2 and 17.0. No systemic therapy is given during this phase of therapy. 4.1.1.1 Local Control Local control will take place once patients have recovered from Induction chemotherapy. If surgery is the primary local control, it should be scheduled at the time of recovery from the sixth cycle of Induction chemotherapy - usually at chronological Week 13. When surgery is performed, the next cycle of chemotherapy should be given as soon as possible post -operatively.

Note : If logistical issues (such as surgeon availability) prevent surgery from taking place after completion of the sixth cycle of Induction, then the first cycle of Consolidation chemotherapy should be administered while awaiting surgery For patients who will have radiation alone, Consolidation chemotherapy should be initiated concurrently with the radiation therapy, upon recovery from Induction chemotherapy. Administration of ifosfamide -etoposide chemotherapy concurrentl y with radiation is allowed and the schedule of chem otherapy in Consolidation is designed to accommodate primary site radiotherapy during the first part of Consolidation. If radiation to the primary tumor must occur at a different time for a compelling cli nical indication, then the sequence of chemotherapy cycles should be adjusted to account for this change and to avoid concomitant doxorubicin and radiation administration. For example, if radiation is ongoing at the time Cycle 4 of Consolidation is due, Cycles 4 and 5 should be swapped. Likewise, the sequence of chemotherapy cycles may be adjusted at investigator discretion to avoid resuming doxorubicin shortly after a course of radiation completes. Radiation may begin concurrently or immediately after C ycle 1 of Consolidation (VDC). Otherwise, doxorubicin should not be given during radiation treatment. If radiation therapy is to follow surgery, radiation therapy should be scheduled to start as soon as recovery from surgery permits. 4.1.1.2 Metastatic Site Radiation Patients with lung metastases at diagnosis will receive whole lung irradiation in 1.5 Gy daily fractions after the completion of Consolidation chemotherapy. Bone metastatic sites will also be radiated during this time. The recommended form of radiotherapy will be SBRT (40 Gy in 5 fractions over 5 days) rather than standard EBRT. Metastatic site radiation will begin once patients have recovered from the last cycle of Consolidation chemotherapy, but no earlier than 3 weeks from the start of Week 15 of Consolidation. In rare scenarios, whole lung radiation might occur early due to overlapping fields. If whole lung radiation will occur at the time of primary site radiation due to overlapping fields, then the timing of local control and sequen ce of Consolidation cycles should be modified to avoid receipt of doxorubicin after whole lung radi ation. Consolidation Cycle 4 should be moved to Week 1 Consolidation and r adiation delayed by two weeks. When radiation begins, a VDC cycle can be given at t he start of radiation followed by two IE cycles (original Cons olidation Cycles 1, 2, and 3). THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 35 Post-radiation, patients can resume chemotherapy with Cycle 5 Consolidation. 4.1.1.3 Evaluations Patients will undergo full disease evaluation with MRI or CT of primary tumor site, chest CT, FDG -PET scan, and bilateral bone marrow aspirates and biopsies at study entry. If whole body PET/CT is obtained with thin cuts through chest, this scan may also substitute for required chest CT scan (see Section 10.3.2.1 ). The suggested approach for p atients with large pelvic tumors in which a posterior iliac crest bone marrow biopsy would track through the tumor is to instead undergo 2 marrow biopsies on the contralateral side (either 2 posterior biopsies or one posterior and one anterior biopsy). Tumors with associated soft -tissue mass are recommended to undergo evaluat ion with MRI as MRI is superior at delineating soft -tissue extent. Chest CT to evaluate for lung metastasis should NOT be omitted for patients who undergo thoracic MRI as part of evaluation of the primary tumor. Patients with primary bone tumors are also recommended to undergo plain film of the primary tumor site at study entry as part of good clinical care . Sites suspicious for bone or soft tissue metastasis identified by FDG -PET scan at study entry should be imaged further with MRI or CT (whole body CT obtained as part of PET/CT scan is acceptable). For patients without other sites of metastatic disease whose sole metastatic site to qualify for study entry is a single area suspicious for bone m etastasis identified by FDG -PET, confirmatory biopsy or anatomic imaging evidence of an associated soft tissue mass at that site is required for study entry. All patients will undergo MRI or CT of primary tumor site (ideally with the same modality used at study entry), chest CT, and FDG -PET (or PET/CT) scan at the end of Induction prior to local control. Tumors with associated soft -tissue mass, including chest wall tumors are recommended to undergo evaluation with MRI as MRI is superior at delineating soft - tissue extent. Previous sites of bone or soft tissue metastasis and any new sites of concern for bone or soft tissue metastasis based on FDG -PET should be imaged further with MRI or CT (whole body CT obtained as part of PET/CT scan is acceptable). All patients will undergo MRI or CT of primary tumor site, chest CT, and FDG -PET (or PET/CT) scan before Week 9 of Consolidation and at the end of Consolidation chemotherapy. Tumors with associated soft -tissue mass, including chest wall tumors, are recomme nded to undergo evaluation with MRI as MRI is superior at delineating soft -tissue extent. Plain film of the primary tumor site may be substituted for MRI or CT for patients who have undergone surgical resection with metallic implants though modern MRI tech niques may still allow adequate imaging even in the presence of metallic implants. Previous sites of bone or soft tissue metastasis and any new sites of concern for bone or soft tissue metastasis based on FDG -PET should be imaged further with MRI or CT (wh ole body CT obtained as part of PET/CT scan is acceptable). THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 36 Following completion of Consolidation chemotherapy, patients in both arms of the study are recommended to undergo MRI or CT of primary tumor site, chest CT, and FDG -PET (or PET/CT) every 3 months following the schedule in Section 7.3. This schedule applies to patients in Regimen B who receiv ed Maintenance ganitumab. Previous sites of bone or soft tissue metastasis and any new sites of concern for bone or soft tiss ue metastasis based on FDG -PET should be imaged further with MRI or CT (whole body CT obtained as part of PET/CT scan is acceptable). Patients with clinical evidence of bone marrow involvement at study entry (per Section 3.2.2 ) will undergo repeat bilateral bone marrow aspirates and biopsies after 3 cycles of Induction chemotherapy. For patients with clinically evident persistent bone marrow metastatic disease, repeat bilateral bone marrow aspirates and biopsies will be performed prior to local control and then every 4 cycles until clear . See Sections 10.3.4 and 10.4 for definitions of marrow response and note off -protocol therapy criteria for residual bone marrow involvement at end of Consolidation ). Once clear and in the absence of clinical concern for relapsed dise ase, no repeat bone marrow aspirates / biopsies are required until these patients undergo their disease evaluations at the end of Consolidation chemotherapy. Please see Section 15.4 for submission instructions for the recommended bone marrow correlative biology study. 4.1.2 Dose Adjustment for Obesity There will be no dose adjustments for obese patients. 4.2 Concomitant Medications No other cancer chemotherapy or immunomodulating agents will be used. 4.2.1 Cytochrom e P450 drug interaction Clinically significant drug interactions have been reported when using vincristine with strong CYP450 3A4 inhibitors and inducers. Selected of phenobarbitol, carbamazepine, and St. John's wort (see Appendix V for list of agents) . These drugs should be avoided with vincristine. The clinical outcome and significance of CYP450 interactions with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide and ifosfamide are less clear. CYP450 3A4 inducers or inhibitors should be avoided or used with great caution. Multi -day a prepitant regimen also interacts with CYP3A4 and should be used with caution with etoposide, ifosfamide, or vincristine chemotherapy. 4.2.2 Other supportive care Appropriate antibioti cs, blood products, antiemetics, fluids, electrolytes and general supportive care are to be used as necessary. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 37 For COG Supportive Care Guidelines see: https://childrensoncologygroup.org/index.php/cog -supportive -care-guidelines . 4.3 General Approach to Local Control of the Primary Tumor This study requires definitive treatment of the primary tumor with complete surgical excision, a combination of surgical excision and radiation therapy for microscopic residual disease, or full -dose radiation therapy. A multidisciplinary approach to primary tumor treatment involving the oncologist, the radiation oncologist, and the surgeon is indispensable, and planning should begin immediately upon diagnosis. The guiding principle for local control should be to eradicate the primary tumor and avoid local recurrence with the least amount of functional loss, while minimizing delays in systemic therapy in this metastatic patient population. This will require careful consultation between t he oncologist, the orthopedic or surgical oncologist, and the radiation oncologist. Even for patients anticipated to undergo surgical local control of the primary tumor, early radiation oncology referral is recommended to facilitate planning for metastat ic site radiation, including the need for institutional credentialing to administer SBRT to bone metastases (see Section 17.1.2 ). 4.3.1 Primary Tumor Treatment Modalities 4.3.1.1 Surgery Surgical excision should be considered for all tumors which respond to Induction chemotherapy. Surgery is the local therapy modality of choice if the lesion can be resected with negative microscopic margins (R0) and a reasonable functional result. If surgi cal expertise is not available at a given institution, it is strongly suggested that consultation be made with an experienced orthopedic or surgical oncologist at another institution. Patients with unresectable lesions or inadequate margins after surgery w ill receive radiation therapy. The aim of surgery is to achieve a wide (R0) surgical excision which leaves a clear margin of normal tissue surrounding the lesion. Patients with complete resections (R0) with a clear margin ( defined in next section) will not require radiation therapy. Currently there is no reliable way to assess tumor responsiveness non -invasively. Therefore, in most cases, a wide cuff of normal tissue will surround the tumor consistent with the planned reconstruction. In rare cases, the ma rgin may be closer if an important structure such as a major growth plate, a joint or a structure such as the acetabulum can be preserved. A marginal (R1) excision leaves inflammatory tissue containing residual tumor cells. The pathologic margin is microsc opic. The patient requires post operative radiation therapy. Intralesional or debulking (R2) operations leaves gross residual tumor. This type of surgical procedure is never indicated. Recovery from complicated surgical procedures will delay the resumpti on of chemotherapy. Since gross residual tumor remains, the patient will require full dose radiation therapy (the same dose as if no surgical procedure was THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 38 performed). Radiation will be less effective in the hypoxic post surgical bed and the radiation fiel d size will be larger than if surgery was not attempted. For details on the surgical approach to the biopsy and excision, see Section 13.0. 4.3.1.2 Margins At the time of resection, the surgeon should mark al l margins and orient the specimen at the operative field, so that margin evaluation is precise. Narrow margins are unavoidable in some areas. In these situations, the surgeon should take a number of separate biopsies of the \"normal\" tissue around the margi ns of resection and these should be marked and submitted separately for pathologic review. Communication with the pathologist is mandatory to assure accuracy of margin examination. Consideration should be given to having the pathologist inspect the specime n in the operating theatre to help with orientation. The tumor should not be bisected or cut into separate specimens prior to this discussion. The aim of surgery is to achieve a wide (R0) surgical excision which leaves a clear margin of normal tissue sur rounding the lesion. Patients with complete resections (R0) with a clear margin ( defined as no viable tumor at the cut surface) will not require radiation therapy. In most instances this will be normal non -reactive tissue. In some instances when resected tumors have greater than 90% overall necrosis, the tissue at the margin may be bland scar or loose fibrous tissue. This will be considered a clear margin and no postoperative radiation therapy will be required. If specimens with greater than 90% overall nec rosis have inflammatory tissue or coagulative tumor necrosis at the margin, (the cytoarchitecture of the tumor cells is preserved) the margin will be considered microscopically positive and require post operative radiation therapy. If the tumor specimen ha s less than 90% overall necrosis, the cut surface of the resected tumor must be normal non -reactive tissue in order to be considered pathologically negative. If there is ambiguity about the margin status, investigators should strongly consider post -operati ve radiotherapy. 4.3.1.3 Surgery plus Radiation Therapy Most patients will have either surgery alone, surgery with radiation therapy for positive microscopic margins, or radiation therapy alone. When surgery is done first, followed by radiation therapy, surgery should occur as soon as possible after recovery from Induction Cycle 6 chemotherapy and radiation therapy should begin as soon as feasible thereafter. Pre-operative radiotherapy is not indicated. This approach may result in considerable delays in chemotherapy: thus the benefits must be weighed against risk in each patient. The final decision regarding the best treatment is dependent on patient and tumor characteristics and is left to th e consultants at the patient's institution. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 39 In patients with unresectable tumors treated with definitive radiation, delayed excision is not typically indicated and therefore discouraged. For details on the surgical approach to the biopsy and excision, se e Section 13.0. For details on radiotherapy, see Section 17.0 . 4.3.1.4 Radiation Therapy Only Candidates for radiotherapy alone will include patients with bulky lesion s in surgically difficult sites such as the spine, skull and periacetabular pelvis, pa tients with a poor response to I nduction chemotherapy, or those patients in whom surgery would result in unacceptable functional results. Sites which, if removed, would r esult in significant impairment of function include the skull, facial bones, vertebrae and pelvic bones about the acetabulum. In some cases, resection even in these sites may be feasible in combination with radiation therapy, and decisions regarding a spec ific patient must be individualized. Patients who are to be treated with radiotherapy alone should be treated with radiotherapy at the start of Consolidation Week 1 chemotherapy. Proton therapy is allowed as part of this study. For details regarding radiotherapy, see Section 17.0 . 4.4 Chemotherapy Administration Schedule Chemotherapy will be administered on an interval -compressed schedule every 2 weeks, as allowed by recovery from previous cycles. Recommended guidelines for administering interval -compressed chemotherapy include checking a CBC with differential on Day 1 and 8 of each cycle and then every Monday, Wednesday and Friday (or 3 other nonconsecutive days per week) after Day 12, until the criteria for starting the next cycle are satisfied . Note: See the Parenteral Chemotherapy Administration Guidelines (CAGs) on the COG website at: https://cogmembers.org/_files/disc/Pharmacy/ChemoAdminGuidelines.pdf for special precautions and suggestions for patient monit oring during the infusion. As applicable, also see the CAGs for suggestions on hydration, or hydrate according to institutional guidelines. 4.4.1 Administration Schedules for Induction and Consolidation in Regimen A Patients in Regimen A do not receive ganitumab. Patients in Regimen A do not receive a Maintenance phase. 4.4.1.1 Administration Schedule: Induction (Weeks 1 -12) Regimen A Criteria to start Induction: No count criteria are required to start Induction Week 1 therapy. Criteria to start subsequent cycles: ANC 750/\u00b5L and platelet count 75,000/\u00b5L post nadir (without transfusion). The ANC often falls after discontinuing myel oid growth factor support. If the ANC has risen THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 40 to 750/\u00b5L after the nadir but then falls the next cycle should be given despite ANC < 750/ \u00b5L. To maintain dose intensity, administration of subsequent cycles of chemotherapy should not be delayed as along as the patient meets count recovery criteria, regardless of myeloid growth factor utilized. See Section 5.1 for exceptions in Weeks 1 and 3 for patients with bone marrow metastatic disease. If a cycle of chemotherapy is delayed due to toxicity, see Section 5.0 for criteria to resume chemotherapy. Note: for children less than 1 year of age, chemotherapy should be calculated by weight rather than by surface area. Dose/kg = dose/m2 divided by 30 kg/m2. Example: If patient is less than 1 year of age and weight is 15 kg and dose of Etoposide is 100 mg/m2, then the dose of Etoposide is based on mg/kg = 100 mg/m2 divided by 30 kg/m2 = 3.3 mg/kg x15 kg = 49.5 mg. VinCRIStine: IV push over 1 minute or infusion via minibag as per institutional policy Day 1 of Weeks 1, 5 and 9 Dose: 2 mg/m2/dose. ( Maximum dose is 2 mg.) For patients < 1 year old, the dose is 0.067 mg/kg/dose. Special precautions : FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY. The container or the syringe containing vinCRIStine must be enclosed in an overwrap bearing the statement \"Do not remove covering until moment of injection. Fatal if given by other routes. For intravenous use only.\" Medication errors have occurred due to confusion between vinCRIStine and vinBLAStine. VinCRIStine is available in a liposomal injection, VSLI, Marqibo\u00ae). Use conventional vincristine only; t he conventional and lip osomal formulations are NOT interchangeable. Dexrazoxane : Slow IV Push (eg, over 5 -15 minutes) given immediately prior to DOXOrubicin Days: 1 and 2 of Weeks 1, 5 and 9 Dose: 375 mg/m2/dose (ie, 10 mg of dexrazoxane for every mg of DOXOrubicin). For patien ts < 1 year old, the dose is 12.5 mg/kg/dose. Note : Administer DOXOrubicin after completing the infusion of dexrazoxane and every effort should be made to keep the total combined infusion time for dexrazoxane and doxorubicin to 30 minutes . DOXOrubicin : IV push/infusion over 1 -15 minutes. Days: 1 and 2 of Weeks 1, 5 and 9 Dose: 37.5 mg/m2/dose. For patients < 1 year old, the dose is 1.25 mg/kg/dose. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 41 Administer at a concentration not to exceed 2 mg/mL. It is suggested that DOXOrubicin be administered through the tubing of rapidly infusing solution of D 5W or 0.9% NaCl and that it is infused into a large vein. Special precautions : Medication errors have occurred due to confusion between DAUNOrubicin and DOXOrubicin. DOXOrubicin is available in a liposomal formulation. Use conventional DOXO rubicin only; t he conventional and liposomal formulations are NOT interchangeable . Cyclophosphamide : IV over 30 -60 minutes Day 1 of Weeks 1, 5 and 9 Dose: 1,200 mg/m2/dose. For patients < 1 year old, the dose is 40 mg/kg/dose. May be administered as undiluted drug (20 mg/mL, reconstitute with 0.9% NaCl only to avoid hypotonic solution) or further diluted. Mesna must be administered in conjunction with cyclophosphamide (see below). Hydrate per institutional guidelines or according to recommendations below. Ifosfamide : IV, infuse the diluted solution over 1 hour Days: 1 -5 of Weeks 3, 7 and 11 Dose: 1,800 mg/m2/dose. For patients < 1 year old, the dose is 60 mg/kg/dose. Mesna must be administered in conjunction with ifosfamide (see below). Hydrate per institutional guidelines or according to recommendations below. Suggested hydration for cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide : Administer 3,000 mL/m\u00b2/day (125 mL/m\u00b2/hour) using fluid containing D 5W/0.45% NaCl or 0.9% NaCl. Achieve urine specific gravity 1.010 start of cyclophosphamide/ ifosfamide. May use diuretics (eg, furosemide) to increase urine output. Consider adding potassium and magnesium to prevent electrolyte deficiencies. Mesna with C yclophosphamide Administer MESNA by IV infusion or IV/PO on Day 1 of Weeks 1, 5 and 9. Total IV Dose: 720 mg/m2/day. For patients < 1 year old , the IV dose is 24 mg/kg/day. Mesna with Ifosfamide Administer MESNA by IV infusion or IV/PO on Days 1 -5 of Weeks 3, 7 and 11. Total IV Dose: 1,080 mg/m2/day. For patients < 1 year old , the IV dose is 36 mg/kg/day. Mesna IV short or continuous infusion: THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 42 For prophylaxis of hemorrhagic cystitis, the total daily mesna dose is equal to 60% of the daily ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide dose. Mesna can be administered in 3 divided doses by short infusion over 15 to 30 minutes. The initial bolus dose of mesna may be administered 15 minutes before or at the same time as the ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide dose; subsequent doses are given 4 and 8 hours after the start of ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide). For example: if the cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide dose is 1,000 mg, then the total daily mesna dose is 600 mg; 200 mg of mesna will be given 15 minutes before or at the start of the cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide dose (Hour 0) and 2 boluses of 200 mg each will be given at Hours 4 and 8. This total daily dose of mesna can also be administered as IV continuous infusion (CI) . The continuous infusion should be started 15 -30 minutes before or at the same time as ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide and finished no sooner than 8 hours after the end of the ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide infusion. For example: if the cyclophosphamide/ifosf amide dose is 1,000 mg, then the total daily mesna dose is 600 mg; the 600 mg mesna continuous infusion will start 15 -30 minutes before or at the same time as the ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide and be completed no sooner than 8 hours after the end of the ifos famide/cyclophosphamide infusion. If ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide is administered over 1 hour and mesna is started 30 minutes before the cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide infusion, the total mesna infusion will last at least 9 hours and 30 minutes. Use of oral m esna: The oral dose of mesna is twice the IV dose. Patients able to tolerate oral mesna may receive the last TWO bolus doses (originally at Hours 4 and 8) orally at 40% of the ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide dose. The oral doses will be administered at Hours 2 and 6. For example: if the cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide dose is 1,000 mg, then 200 mg of mesna will be given IV 15 minutes before or with the cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide dose (Hour 0) and the TWO oral doses of 400 mg each will be given at Hours 2 and 6. Administer tablets or diluted parenteral solution. To decrease sulfur odor, dilute mesna parental solution before oral administration. The solution can be diluted 1:1 to 1:10 in water, carbonated cola drinks, fruit juices (grape, apple, tomato and orange ) or plain or chocolate milk. The most palatable is chilled grape juice. Tablets are 400 mg and can be divided into 200 mg/0.5 tabs so dosing can be rounded up to nearest 200 mg. Administer doses on a schedule as determined by timing of cyclophosphamide/if osfamide administration. If a dose is missed, administer dose immediately. Give the next scheduled dose according to the original dosing schedule. Do not deviate from the original schedule. Notify provider if a dose is delayed or missed. If the patient vom its within THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 43 2 hours following an oral dose, repeat the oral dose or administer an IV dose of mesna. Etoposide: IV, infuse the diluted solution over at least 1 -2 hours Days: 1 -5 of Weeks 3, 7 and 11 Dose: 100 mg/m2/dose. For patients < 1 year old, the dose is 3.3 mg/kg/dose. Infuse diluted solution (concentration 0.4 mg/mL); slow rate of administration if hypotension occurs. The use of an in -line filter during the infusion is suggested for prolonged infusion due to risk of precipitation . Special precautions: Etoposide can be mixed in 0.9% NaCl or D 5W. Avoid use of large volumes of D 5W due to potential development of hyponatremia. Growth Factor Support 100-106 Begin myeloid growth factor support (fil grastim or pegfilgrastim or biosimilar products according to institutional standards for patients receiving interval compressed chemotherapy) at least 24 -36 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy. If given daily then continue a minimum of 7 days and unt il ANC 750/\u00b5L post nadir and discontinue at least 24 hours prior to next cycle of chemotherapy.

Consolidation will not begin until 2 weeks post -operatively. For patients receiving radiation therapy for local control, radiation therapy should begin concomitantly with Week 1 of Consolidation therapy. DOXOrubicin may be administered concurrently with ra diation therapy only at Week 1 of Consolidation chemotherapy. See Section 4.1.1.2 for modifying order of Consolidation for patients who receive early whole lung radiation due to overlapping radiation fields with the primary tum or. Criteria to start Consolidation: ANC 750/\u00b5L and platelet 75,000/\u00b5L post nadir (without transfusion). The ANC often falls after discontinuing myeloid growth factor support. If the ANC has risen to 750/\u00b5L after the nadir but then falls the next cy cle should be given despite ANC < 750/\u00b5L. To maintain dose intensity, administration of subsequent cycles of chemotherapy should not be delayed as along as the patient meets count recovery criteria, regardless of myeloid growth factor utilized. Criteria t o start subsequent cycles: ANC 750/\u00b5L and platelet count 75,000/\u00b5L post nadir (without transfusion). The ANC often falls after discontinuing myeloid growth factor support. If the ANC has risen to 750/\u00b5L after the nadir but then falls the next cycle s hould be given despite ANC < 750/\u00b5L. To maintain dose intensity, administration of subsequent cycles of chemotherapy should not be delayed as along as the patient meets count recovery criteria, regardless of myeloid growth factor utilized. If a cycle of c hemotherapy is delayed due to toxicity, see Section 5. 0 for criteria to resume chemotherapy. Note: for children less than 1 year of age chemotherapy should be calculated by weight rather than by surface area. Dose/k g = dose/m2 divided by 30 kg/m2. Example: If patient is less than 1 year of age and weight is 15 kg and dose of Etoposide is 100mg/m2, then the dose of Etoposide is based on mg/kg = 100mg/m2 divided by 30 kg/m2 = 3.3 mg/kg x15 kg = 49.5 mg. VinCRIStine: IV push over 1 minute or infusion via minibag as per institutional policy Day 1 of Weeks 1, 7, 9, and 13 Dose: 2 mg/m2/dose ( Maximum dose i s 2 mg). For patients < 1 year old, the dose is 0.067 mg/kg/dose. Special precautions : FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY. The container or the syringe containing vinCRIStine must be enclosed in an overwrap bearing the statement \"Do not remove covering until moment of injection. Fatal if given by other routes. For intravenous use only.\" THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 48 Medication errors have occurred due to confusion between vinCRIStine and vinBLAStine. VinCRIStine is available in a liposomal injection, VSLI, Marqibo\u00ae). Use conventional vincristine only; t he conventional and lip osomal formulations are NOT interchangeable. Dexrazoxane : Slow IV Push (eg, over 5 -15 minutes) given immediately prior to DOXOrubicin Days: 1 and 2 of Weeks 1 and 7 Dose: 375 mg/m2/dose (ie, 10 mg of dexrazoxane for every mg of DOXOrubicin). For patients < 1 year old, the dose is 12.5 mg/kg/dose. Note: Administer DOXOrubicin after completing the infusion of dexrazoxane and every effort should be made to keep the total combined infusion time for dexrazoxane and doxorubicin to 30 minutes. DOXOrubicin: IV push/infusion over 1 -15 minutes Days: 1 and 2 of Weeks 1 and 7 Dose: 37.5 mg/m2/dose. For patients < 1 year old, the dose is 1.25 mg/kg/dose. Administer at a concentration not to exceed 2 mg/mL. It is suggested that DOXOrubicin be administered through the tubing of rapidly infusing solution of D 5W or 0.9% NaCl and that it is infused into a large vein. Special precautions : Medication errors have occurred due to confusion between DAUNOrubicin and DOXOrubicin. DOXOrubicin is available in a liposomal form ulation. Use conventional DOXO rubicin only; t he conventional and liposomal formulations are NOT interchangeable. Cyclophosphamide: IV over 30 -60 minutes Day 1 of Weeks 1, 7, 9 and 13 Dose: 1,200 mg/m2/dose. For patients < 1 year old, the dose is 40 mg/kg/ dose. May be administered as undiluted drug (20 mg/mL, reconstitute with 0.9% NaCl only to avoid hypotonic solution) or further diluted. Mesna must be administered in conjunction with Cyclophosphamide (see below). Hydrate per institutional guidelines or according to recommendations below. Ifosfamide : IV, infuse the diluted solution over 1 hour Days 1 -5 of Weeks 3, 5, 11 and 15 Dose: 1,800 mg/m2/dose. For patients < 1 year old, the dose is 60 mg/kg/dose. Mesna must be administered in conju nction with IFOS (see below). Hydrate per institutional guidelines or according to recommendations below. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 49 Suggested hydration for cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide : Administer 3,000 mL/m\u00b2/day (125 mL/m\u00b2/hour) using fluid containing D 5W/0.45% NaCl or 0.9% NaCl. Achieve urine specific gravity 1.010 start of cyclophosphamide/ ifosfamide. May use diuretics (eg, furosemide) to increase urine output. Consider add ing potassium and magnesium to prevent electrolyte deficiencies. Mesna with cyclophosphamide Administer MESNA by IV infusion or IV/PO on Day 1 of Weeks 1, 7, 9 and 13 . Total IV Dose: 720 mg/m2/day. For patients < 1 year old , the IV dose is 24 mg/kg/day. Mesna with ifosfamide Administer MESNA by IV infusion or IV/PO on Days 1 -5 of Weeks 3, 5, 11 and 15 . Total IV Dose: 1,080 mg/m2/day. For patients < 1 year old , the IV dose is 36 mg/kg/day. Mesna IV short or continuous infusion: For prophylaxis of hemorr hagic cystitis, the total daily mesna dose is equal to 60% of the daily ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide dose. Mesna can be administered in 3 divided doses by short infusion over 15 to 30 minutes. The initial bolus dose of mesna may be administered 15 minutes before or at the same time as the ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide dose; subsequent doses are given 4 and 8 hours after the start of ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide). For examp le: if the cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide dose is 1,000 mg, then the total daily mesna dose is 600 mg; 200 mg of mesna will be given 15 minutes before or at the start of the cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide dose (Hour 0) and 2 boluses of 200 mg each will be given at Hours 4 and 8. This total daily dose of mesna can also be administered as IV continuous infusion (CI) . The continuous infusion should be started 15 -30 minutes before or at the same time as ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide and finished no sooner than 8 hours after the end of the ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide infusion. For example: if the cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide dose is 1,000 mg, then the total daily mesna dose is 600 mg; the 600 mg mesna continuous infusion will start 15 -30 minutes before or at the same ti me as the ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide and be completed no sooner than 8 hours after the end of the ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide infusion. If ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide is administered over 1 hour and mesna is started 30 minutes before the cyclophosphamide/ ifosfamide infusion, the total mesna infusion will last at least 9 hours and 30 minutes. Use of oral mesna: The oral dose of mesna is twice the IV dose. Patients able to tolerate oral mesna may receive the last TWO bolus doses (originally at Hours 4 and THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 50 8) orally at 40% of the ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide dose. The oral doses will be administered at Hours 2 and 6. For example: if the cyclopho sphamide/ifosfamide dose is 1,000 mg, then 200 mg of mesna will be given IV 15 minutes before or with the cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide dose (Hour 0) and the TWO oral doses of 400 mg each will be given at Hours 2 and 6. Administer tablets or diluted parente ral solution. To decrease sulfur odor, dilute mesna parental solution before oral administration. The solution can be diluted 1:1 to 1:10 in water, carbonated cola drinks, fruit juices (grape, apple, tomato and orange) or plain or chocolate milk. The most palatable is chilled grape juice. Tablets are 400 mg and can be divided into 200 mg/0.5 tabs so dosing can be rounded up to nearest 200 mg. Administer doses on a schedule as determined by timing of cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide administration. If a dose is m issed, administer dose immediately. Give the next scheduled dose according to the original dosing schedule. Do not deviate from the original schedule. Notify provider if a dose is delayed or missed. If the patient vomits within 2 hours following an oral do se, repeat the oral dose or administer an IV dose of mesna. Etoposide: IV, infuse the diluted solution over at least 1 -2 hours Days 1 -5 of Weeks 3, 5, 11 and 15 Dose: 100 mg/m2/dose. For patients < 1 year old, the dose is 3.3 mg/kg/dose. Infuse diluted solution (concentration 0.4 mg/mL); slow rate of administration if hypotension occurs. The use of an in -line filter during the infusion is suggested for prolonged infusion due to risk of precipitation . Special precautions: Etoposide can be mixed in 0.9% NaCl or D 5W. Avoid use of large volumes of D 5W due to potential development of hyponatremia. Growth Factor Support Begin myeloid growth factor support (filgrastim or pegfilgrastim or biosimilar products according to institutional standards for pa tients receiving interval compressed chemotherapy) at least 24 -36 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy. If given daily then continue a minimum of 7 days and until ANC 750/\u00b5L post nadir and discontinue at least 24 hours prior to next cycle of chemoth erapy. Note: Use of GM -CSF (sargramostim) is not permitted. See Section 5.0 for Dose Modifications based on toxicities.

Criteria to start subsequent cycles: ANC 750/\u00b5L and platelet count 75,000/\u00b5L post nadir (without transfusion). The ANC often falls after discontinuing myeloid growth factor support. If the ANC has risen to 750/\u00b5L after the nadir but then falls the next cycle should be given despite ANC < 750/\u00b5L. To maintain dose intensity, administration of subsequent cycles of chemotherapy should not be delayed as along as the patient meets count recovery criteria, regardless of myeloid growth factor utilized. See Section 5.1 for exceptions in Weeks 1 and 3 for patients with bone marrow metastatic disease. If a cycle of chemotherapy is delayed due to toxicity, see Section 5.0 for criteria to resume chemotherapy. Note: for children less than 1 year of age, chemotherapy should be calculated by weight rather than by surfac e area. Dose/kg = dose/m2 divided by 30 kg/m2. Example: If patient is less than 1 year of age and weight is 15 kg and dose of Etoposide is 100 mg/m2, then the dose of Etoposide is based on mg/kg = 100 mg/m2 divided by 30 kg/m2 = 3.3 mg/kg x15 kg = 49.5 mg. VinCRIStine: IV push over 1 minute or infusion via minibag as per institutional policy Day 1 of Weeks 1, 5 and 9 Dose: 2 mg/m2/dose. ( Maximum dose is 2 mg.) For patients < 1 year old, the dose is 0.067 mg/kg/dose. Special precautions : FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY. The container or the syringe containing vinCRIStine must be enclosed in an overwrap THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 58 bearing the statement \"Do not remove covering until moment of injection.

VinCRIStine is available in a liposomal injection, VSLI, Marqibo\u00ae). and liposomal formul ations are NOT interchangeable. Dexrazoxane : Slow IV Push (eg, over 5 -15 minutes) given immediately prior to DOXOrubicin Days: 1 and 2 of Weeks 1, 5 and 9 Dose: 375 mg/m2/dose (ie, 10 mg of dexrazoxane for every mg of DOXOrubicin). For patients < 1 year old, the dose is 12.5 mg/kg/dose. Note : Administer DOXOrubicin after completing the infusion of dexrazoxane and every effort should be made to keep the total combined infus ion time for dexrazoxane and doxorubicin to 30 minutes. DOXOrubicin : IV push/infusion over 1 -15 minutes. Days: 1 and 2 of Weeks 1, 5 and 9 Dose: 37.5 mg/m2/dose. For patients < 1 year old, the dose is 1.25 mg/kg/dose. Administer at a concentration not to exceed 2 mg/mL. It is suggested that DOXOrubicin be administered through the tubing of rapidly infusing solution of D 5W or 0.9% NaCl and that it is infused into a large vein. Special precautions : Medication errors have occurred due to confusion between DAUNOrubicin and DOXOrubicin. DOXOrubicin is available in a liposomal formulation. Use conventional DOXO rubicin only; t he conventional and liposomal formulations are NOT interchangeable. Cyclophosphamide : IV over 30 -60 minutes Day 1 of Weeks 1, 5 and 9 Dose: 1,200 mg/m2/dose. For patients < 1 year old, the dose is 40 mg/kg/dose. May be administered as undiluted drug (20 mg/mL, reconstitute with 0.9% NaCl only to avoid hypotonic solution) or further diluted. Mesna must be administered i n conjunction with cyclophosphamide (see below). Hydrate per institutional guidelines or according to recommendations below. Ifosfamide : IV, infuse the diluted solution over 1 hour Days: 1 -5 of Weeks 3, 7 and 11 Dose: 1,800 mg/m2/dose. For patients < 1 year old, the dose is 60 mg/kg/dose. Mesna must be administered in conjunction with ifosfamide (see below). Hydrate per institutional guidelines or according to recommendations below. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 59 Suggested hydration for cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide : Administer 3,000 mL/m\u00b2/day (125 mL/m\u00b2/hour) using fluid containing D 5W/0.45% NaCl or 0.9% NaCl. Achieve urine specific gravity 1.010 start of cyclophosphamide/ ifosfamide. May use diuretics (eg, furosemide) to increase urine output. Consider adding potassium and magnesium to prevent electrolyte deficiencies. Mesna with C yclophosphamide Administer MESNA by IV infusion or IV/PO on Day 1 of Weeks 1, 5 and 9. Total IV Dose: 720 mg/m2/day. For patients < 1 year old , the IV dose is 24 mg/kg/day. Mesna with Ifosfamide Administer MESNA by IV infusion or IV/PO on Days 1 -5 of Weeks 3, 7 and 11 . Total IV Dose: 1,080 mg/m2/day. For patients < 1 year old , the IV dose is 36 mg/kg/day. Mesna IV short or continuous infusion: For prophylaxis of hemorrhagic cystitis, the total daily mesna dose is equal to 60% of the daily ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide dose. Mesna can be administered in 3 divided doses by short infusion over 15 to 30 minutes. The initial bolus dose of mesna may be administered 15 minutes before or at the same time as the ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide dose; subsequent doses are given 4 and 8 hours after the start of ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide). For examp le: if the cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide dose is 1,000 mg, then the total daily mesna dose is 600 mg; 200 mg of mesna will be given 15 minutes before or at the start of the cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide dose (Hour 0) and 2 boluses of 200 mg each will be given at Hours 4 and 8. This total daily dose of mesna can also be administered as IV continuous infusion (CI) . The continuous infusion should be started 15 -30 minutes before or at the same time as ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide and finished no sooner than 8 hours after the end of the ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide infusion. For example: if the cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide dose is 1,000 mg, then the total daily mesna dose is 600 mg; the 600 mg mesna continuous infusion will start 15 -30 minutes before or at the same time as the ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide and be completed no sooner than 8 hours after the end of the ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide infusion. If ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide is administered over 1 hour and mesna is started 30 minutes before the cyclophosphamid e/ifosfamide infusion, the total mesna infusion will last at least 9 hours and 30 minutes. Use of oral mesna: The oral dose of mesna is twice the IV dose. Patients able to tolerate oral mesna may receive the last TWO bolus doses (originally at Hours 4 and THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 60 8) orally at 40% of the ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide dose. The oral doses will be administered at Hours 2 and 6. For example: if the cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide dose is 1,000 mg, then 200 mg of mesna will be given IV 15 minutes before or with the cyclopho sphamide/ifosfamide dose (Hour 0) and the TWO oral doses of 400 mg each will be given at Hours 2 and 6. Administer tablets or diluted parenteral solution. To decrease sulfur odor, dilute mesna parental solution before oral administration. The solution can be diluted 1:1 to 1:10 in water, carbonated cola drinks, fruit juices (grape, apple, tomato and orange) or plain or chocolate milk. The most palatable is chilled grape juice. Tablets are 400 mg and can be divided into 200 mg/0.5 tabs so dosing can be roun ded up to nearest 200 mg. Administer doses on a schedule as determined by timing of cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide administration. If a dose is missed, administer dose immediately. Give the next scheduled dose according to the original dosing schedule. Do not deviate from the original schedule. Notify provider if a dose is delayed or missed. If the patient vomits within 2 hours following an oral dose, repeat the oral dose or administer an IV dose of mesna. Etoposide: IV, infuse the diluted solution over at le ast 1 -2 hours Days: 1 -5 of Weeks 3, 7 and 11 Dose: 100 mg/m2/dose. For patients < 1 year old, the dose is 3.3 mg/kg/dose. Infuse diluted solution (concentration 0.4 mg/mL); slow rate of administration if hypotension occurs. The use of an in -line filter during the infusion is suggested for prolonged infusion due to risk of precipitation . Special precautions: Etoposide can be mixed in 0.9% NaCl or D 5W. Avoid use of large volumes of D 5W due to potential development of hyponatremia. Growth Factor Support Begin myeloid growth factor support (filgrastim or pegfilgrastim or biosimilar products according to institutional standards for patients receiving interval compressed chemotherapy) at least 24 -36 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy. I f given daily then continue a minimum of 7 days and until ANC 750/\u00b5L post nadir and discontinue at least 24 hours prior to next cycle of chemotherapy.

This total daily dose of mesna can also be administered as IV continuous infusion (CI) . The continuous infusion should be started 15 -30 minutes before or at the same time as ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide and finished no sooner than 8 hours after the end of t he ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide infusion. For example: if the cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide dose is 1,000 mg, then the total daily mesna dose is 600 mg; the 600 mg mesna continuous infusion will start 15 -30 minutes before or at the same time as the ifosfam ide/cyclophosphamide and be completed no sooner than 8 hours after the end of the ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide infusion. If ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide is administered over 1 hour and mesna is started 30 minutes before the cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide infusi on, the total mesna infusion will last at least 9 hours and 30 minutes. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 68 Use of oral mesna: The oral dose of mesna is twice the IV dose. Patients able to tolerate oral mesna may receive the last TWO bolus doses (originally at Hours 4 and 8) orally at 40% of the ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide dose. The oral doses will be administered at Hours 2 and 6. For example: if the cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide dose is 1,000 mg, then 200 mg of mesna will be given IV 15 minutes before or with the cyclophosphamide/ifosfamid e dose (Hour 0) and the TWO oral doses of 400 mg each will be given at Hours 2 and 6. Administer tablets or diluted parenteral solution. To decrease sulfur odor, dilute mesna parental solution before oral administration. The solution can be diluted 1:1 to 1:10 in water, carbonated cola drinks, fruit juices (grape, apple, tomato and orange) or plain or chocolate milk. The most palatable is chilled grape juice. Tablets are 400 mg and can be divided into 200 mg/0.5 tabs so dosing can be rounded up to nearest 200 mg. Administer doses on a schedule as determined by timing of cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide administration. If a dose is missed, administer dose immediately. Give the next scheduled dose according to the original dosing schedule. Do not deviate from the original schedule. Notify provider if a dose is delayed or missed. If the patient vomits within 2 hours following an oral dose, repeat the oral dose or administer an IV dose of mesna. Etoposide: IV, infuse the diluted solution over at least 1 -2 hours Days 1-5 of Weeks 3, 5, 11 and 15 Dose: 100 mg/m2/dose. For patients < 1 year old, the dose is 3.3 mg/kg/dose. Infuse diluted solution (concentration 0.4 mg/mL); slow rate of administration if hypotension occurs. The use of an in -line filter during the infus ion is suggested for prolonged infusion due to risk of precipitation . Special precautions: Etoposide can be mixed in 0.9% NaCl or D 5W. Avoid use of large volumes of D 5W due to potential development of hyponatremia. Growth Factor Support Begin myeloid growth factor support (filgrastim or pegfilgrastim or biosimilar products according to institutional standards for patients receiving interval compressed chemotherapy) at least 24 -36 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy. If given daily t hen continue a minimum of 7 days and until ANC 750/\u00b5L post nadir and discontinue at least 24 hours prior to next cycle of chemotherapy. Note: Use of GM -CSF (sargramostim) is not permitted. See Section 5.0 for Dose Modifications based on toxicities.

The ANC often falls after discontinuing myeloid growth factor sup port. If the ANC has risen to > 750/\u00b5L after the nadir but then falls the next cycle can be given despite ANC < 750/\u00b5L. If a cycle is delayed for more than 7 days, the next time the chemotherapy combination causing the delay is administered doses of myelos uppressive chemotherapy agents (doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide/etoposide) should be reduced by 25%. Vincristine does not require dose modification for slow blood count recovery. For patients who have chemotherapy dose reduction, r e-escalation in chemotherapy dose in 25% increments should be attempted if the next cycle with the chemotherapy combination causing the initial delay is administered at reduced dose and does not result in treatment delay. If the bone marrow is involved at diagnosis, the above guidelines for ANC and platelet counts do not apply during the first 2 cycles of chemotherapy. In patients who have bone marrow involvement at the time of initial diagnosis and in whom chemotherapy has been delayed for more than 14 days due to persistent neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, obtain a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. If bone marrow shows persistent tumor, proceed with next scheduled cycle of chemotherapy regardless of counts. Repeat bone marr ow aspirate after this cycle to rule out progressive marrow involvement . Also, if a patient had achieved a complete response in the bone marrow and presents with prolonged myelosuppression, early repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should be considered. If marrow had previously cleared and then becomes positive, the patient is considered to have progressive disease and should be removed from protocol therapy . 5.2 Renal Toxicity 5.2.1 Ifosfamide Renal toxicity is the primary, long -term dose -limiting side effect of ifosfamide. Available information indicates that the renal in jury produced by ifosfamide may be permanent, and in some cases progressive. Renal irradiation, young age (< 3 years of age), and absence of one kidney are risk factors for severe renal toxicity. The elements below define incomplete and significant Fanconi 's syndrome for the purposes of this study. In the event a patient appears to have evidence of Fanconi's syndrome, the investigator may consider evaluation as detailed below and consider modifying therapy as detailed below. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 76 Elements of Fanconi Syndrome in clude: 1. Renal phosphorus wasting with hypophosphatemia. (serum phosphate < 2.5 mg/dL = 0.8 mmol/L). 2. Renal bicarbonate wasting with acidosis (Bicarbonate < 16). 3. Renal potassium wasting with hypokalemia (< 3.0 mEq/L). 4. 1+ glycosuria with serum gluc ose < 150 5. Proteinuria: a ratio of urine protein: urine creatinine > 0.2 occurring in the absence of significant malnutrition and acidosis due to sepsis/infection. Incomplete Fanconi Syndrome, with only one or a few of these elements, is common. Over time, these abnormalities may resolve, remain static, or progress. For the purposes of this study, significant Fanconi Syndrome will be defined as: 1. GFR is < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2, not due to other causes such as aminoglycoside toxicity, amphotericin B, etc., in the presence of mineral/electrolyte wasting, OR 2. The GFR is any level, but there is significant evidence of persistent Renal Tubular Acidosis (RTA) as evidenced by serum bicarbonate less than 16 mmol/L and serum phosphate 2 mg/dL (or < 0.6 mmol/L) without supplementation on measurements taken before the next ifosfamide cycle. Modify therapy for significant Fanconi syndrome as follows : Delete ifosfamide from all subsequent cycles and substitute cyclophosphamide 440 mg/m2/day or 15 mg/k g/day for those < 1 year old with Mesna uroprotection (60% of the cyclophosphamide dose = 265 mg/m2/day or 9 mg/kg/day for those < 1 year old) for 5 days to be given together with 5 days of etoposide. This schedule of fractionated cyclophosphamide has prev iously been used in National Wilms Tumor Trial V, Regimen I. 5.2.2 Etoposide If Grade 2 or greater renal toxicity (creatinine > 1.5 X ULN) occurs, nephrotoxic agents should be discontinued, chemotherapy held and renal function tests repeated in one week. If toxicity persists a GFR or creatinine clearance should be obtained. The following initial dose modification should be considered based on measured creatinine clearance: for CrCl > 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 give full dose, for CrCl of 15 - 50 mL/min/1.73m2 give 75% of the dose (a 25% dose reduction). Etoposide should be held if CrCl < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2. 5.2.3 Cyclophosphamide If Grade 2 or greater renal toxicity (creatinine >1.5 X ULN) occurs, nephrotoxic agents should be discontinued. Cyclophosphamide, sinc e it is subject to renal clearance, should be held and renal function repeated in one week. If estimated creatinine clearance (eGFR) drops by 33% (1/3) from the eGFR at study baseline or if the eGFR drops into the abnormal range, cyclophosphamide will re quire dose modifications . Prior to dose adjustment the local investigator should confirm the subject was well -hydrated when renal chemistries were obtained and a validated 24-hour creatinine clearance or a radionuclide GFR should be obtained. The followi ng initial dose modification should be instituted: Renal function Cyclophosphamide dose If drop in eGFR < 33% AND CrCl > 40 mL/min/1.73m2 Full dose THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 77 If drop eGFR > 33% BUT CrCl > 40 mL/min/1.73m2 90% dose If drop in eGFR > 33% BUT CrCl < 40 but > 10 mL/min/1.73m2 50% dose If CrCL < 10 mL/min/1.73m\u00b2 Withhold until toxicity resolves 5.3 Cardiac Toxicity Dexrazoxane will be used as a cardioprotecant prior to each dose of doxorubicin. 5.3.1 Monitoring An electrocardiogram and echocardiogram with determination of shortening fraction, or radionuclide angiogram for ejection fraction should be performed before treatment and then according to the schedule in Section 7.0. Use the same test each time for consistency in evaluation. 5.3.2 Management If prolongation of the QTc interval (> 0.48 sec), a decrease in the ejection fraction to < 50%, or a decrease in the left ventricular shortening fraction to < 27%, the doxorubicin -containing chemotherapy should be postponed 1 week, any existing electrolyte or micronutrient deficiencies corrected and the tests repeated. If the abnormalities persist during that 1 week delay or at any time patients have Grade 3 (symptoma tic) left ventricular systolic dysfunction, doxorubicin should be PERMANENTLY DISCONTINUED. Substitute dactinomycin 0.045 mg/kg/day (max dose 2.5 mg) for 1 day, IV slow push on Day 1 only of the VDC cycle. The chemotherapy cycle administered following dact inomycin - contianing cycles should be administered after 21 -days (and not 14 days) since interval compression is not possible when dactinomycin is administered (a 2 -week interval may still be maintained following I/E cycles). No change in doxorubicin dosing is recommended for an asymptomatic decrease in cardiac ejection or shortening fraction provided they remain at or above 50% and 27% respectively. 5.4 Neurological Toxicity Neurological toxicity can result from tw o of the agents used in this study, vincristine and ifosfamide. 5.4.1 Vincristine Neuropathy Grade 1 and 2 neuropathy requires no dose modification. For Grades 3 and 4 (interfering with activities of daily living) hold indefinitely until symptoms decrease to Grade 1 (present on exam/testing but not symptomatic) or less and resume at 50% dose. Increases to 75% and full dose should be considered at the start of each vincristine containing cycle based on patient's symptoms. Anticipate autonomic neuropathy resulting in constipation. Laxatives and/or stool softeners should be used preemptively during vincristine containing cycles. If severe paralytic ileus occurs vincristine should be stopped until normal bowel movements are re -established and then resumed at 50% dose. Mild to moderate constipat ion (< 4 days) is not an indication for interrupting vincristine. 5.4.2 Ifosfamide Neurotoxicity This is an organic brain syndrome that ranges from mild confusion and disorientation to seizures, ataxia, and coma. It may be aggravated by impaired renal function. It usually, but does not always, resolve spontaneously, and it may or may not recur with su bsequent doses. If symptoms are mild and transient cycle may THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 78 continue with strict avoidance of potentially aggravating co -administered medications such as sedatives and anticholinergic drugs. If Grade 4 neurotoxicity occurs during ifosfamide administration , investigators may consider administration of methylene blue. Patients who have experienced mild symptoms ( Grade 2) may receive ifosfamide in subsequent cycles. If patients with Grade 2 neurotoxicity are to be re -treated, the ifosfamide infusion may be prolonged at the investigator's discretion . If neurotoxicity > Grade 2 occurs or symptoms are prolonged, delete ifosfamide from all subsequent cycles and substitute cyclophosphamide 440 mg/m2 per day with Mesna uroprotection (60% of the cyclophosphamid e dose = 265 mg/m2/day or 9 mg/kg/day for those < 1 year old) for 5 days, with 5 days of etoposide. This schedule of fractionated cyclophosphamide has previously been used in National Wilms Tumor Trial V, Regimen I. 5.5 Mucositis A few simple remedies for mucositis are available, and all should be pursued before doses are reduced. The incidence and severity of mucositis have been related to degree of pre - existing mucosal disease and oral hygiene. Good mouth care, including use of mouth rinses should be considered. Medications include the following: Glutamine: Oral swish -and-swallow glutamine suspension at 2 gram/m2 swish - and-swallow twice daily has been shown to reduce the severity and duration of mucositis associated with chemotherapy and radi otherapy in a randomized controlled trial. Sucralfate: Though its effectiveness is controversial, sucralfate suspension 1 gram/10 mL (40 -80 mg/kg/day, max 1 gram per dose) swish -and-swallow 4 times daily may reduce the symptoms or severity of mucositis f rom chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Chemotherapy doses should not be reduced for mucositis unless all supportive care remedies outlined above have been exhausted. For Grade 3 or 4 mucositis (mouth or throat pain interfering with ability to hydrate or aliment adequately or diarrhea resulting in incontinence and interfering with daily activities) which persists more than 15 days after a vincristine -doxorubicin - cyclophosphamide cycle, and is unresponsive to the measures described, decrease the doxorubici n dose by 25% in subsequent cycles. Do not decrease the doses of the other drugs. For Grade 3 or 4 mucositis which persists more than 15 days after an ifosfamide -etoposide cycle, reduce both the ifosfamide and etoposide doses by 25% in subsequent cycles. Re- escalation should be attempted if mucosal toxicity > Grade 2 does not recur. 5.6 Hematuria or Hemorrhagic Cystitis 5.6.1 Microscopic Hematuria For treatment modifications, microscopic hematuria is a count defined as > 50 RBCs/HPF without visible blood in the urine. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 79 For transient microscopic hematuria (no more than 2 abnormal urinalyses on 2 separate days during a cycle of therapy), do not modify the cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide dose. Administer with increased hydration (3500 -4000 mL/m2/day) using a total daily mesna dose equal to 60% of the daily cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide dose as a continuous infusion over at least 9 hrs. For example, if the full cyclophosphamide dose is 1200 mg, then administer at least 720 mg of mesna by continuous infu sion. For persistent microscopic hematuria (more than 2 abnormal urinalyses during a cycle of therapy), do not modify the cyclophosphamide/etoposide dose. Administer with increased hydration (3500 -4000 mL/m2/day) using a total daily mesna dose equal to 10 0% of the daily cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide dose as a continuous infusion over at least 9 hrs. 5.6.2 Gross Hematuria Gross hematuria is defined as visible blood in the urine. All episodes of gross hematuria should be evaluated in conjunction with a pediatric surgical or urologic consult. Further testing, such as cystoscopy, urine culture, excretory urogram, and voiding cystogram should be considered based on good clinical judgment. For transient gross hematuria (only 1 episode, which clears to less than gross hematuria) during or following a cycle of therapy, hold cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide indefinitely until hematuria clears. When hematuria clears, restart at 50% of the previous cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide dose. Use hydration of 3500 -4000 mL/m2/day and mesna at 100% of the cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide dose as a continuous infusion over 24 hrs/day. The cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide dose may be escalated back to 100% if tolerated. For persistent gross hematuria after completion of a cycle of therapy, ho ld subsequent cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide doses until the urine clears to less than gross hematuria. Reinstitute cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide at 50% of the initial dose, with of 3500 -4000 mL/m2/day and the mesna at 100% of the cyclophosphamide/ifo sfamide dose given as a continuous infusion over 24 hours. If this regimen is tolerated, the cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide dose may be escalated back to the original dose (100%). For persistent or recurrent gross hematuria on the mesna continuous infusion re gimen, discontinue cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide. 5.7 Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity is not expected to occur frequently on this study and if observed, causes should be investigated. However, abnormal liver function may be associated with increased vincristi ne and doxorubicin toxicity. Dose adjustments for vincristine, doxorubicin and etoposide should be made based on the level of direct bilirubin. Vincristine doses omitted due to toxicity will not be replaced. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version 05/01/19 Page 80 Hepatotoxicity Doxorubicin adjustment Etoposide adjustment Grade 1 (Direct bilirubin < 1.5 X ULN) Full Dose Full Dose Full Dose Grade 2 (Direct bilirubin 1.5 -3 X ULN) Delay 1 week.

Full dose if resolved to Grade 1 or less. 50% if still Grade 2. Grade 3, 4 Delay 1 week and until resolved to Grade 1 , then resume at full dose. Delay 1 week and until resolved to Grade 1 , then resume at full dose. Delay 1 week and until resolved to Grade 1 , then resume at full dose. 5.7.1 Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome (SOS, Formerly Known as Veno -occlusive Disease [VOD]) of the Liver (Hepa topathy) Treating physicians are advised to monitor closely for signs of SOS. Criteria for diagnosis of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome of the liver a. Pathologic confirmation by liver biopsy OR b. Reversal of portal venous flow by ultrasound OR c. Two or more of the following: Serum Total Bilirubin > 2.0 mg/dL Unexplained weight gain greater than 10% of baseline weight or ascites Hepatomegaly or RUQ pain without other explanation SOS is graded as below. MILD MODERATE SEVERE Total Bilirubin < 6 mg/dL > 6 and < 20 mg/dL > 20 mg/dL Weight Gain < 5% of baseline of noncardiac origin > 5% of baseline of noncardiac origin Ascites None Clinical or radiologic documentation Compromising respiratory function Hepatic Dysfunction Reversible Reversible Hepatic encephalopathy For any SOS (mild, moderate, or severe), a CTEP -AERS report must be filed per Section 11.10 and 11.11 . 5.8 Dermatologic Toxicity 5.8.1 Nails Patients receiving interval compressed chemotherapy may rarely slough their fingernails. This is painless and reversible, and no countermeasures are indicated. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 81 5.8.2 Palms and Soles Patients may rarely experience painful inflammation and desquamation of the palms and soles, more often after ifosfamide -etoposide cycles. If this occurs, allow a 21-day interval in the next cycle, and attempt a 14 -day cycle again subsequen tly. 5.9 Allergy to Etoposide Pre-medication (such as diphenhydramine, +/ - ranitidine and +/ - hydrocortisone) and slowing of the rate of infusion with etoposide can be tried. Substitution with etoposide phosphate should be considered if a patient develops a reaction that would put him/her at risk if further etoposide were given. Etoposide phosphate may be substituted for etoposide with pre -medication and administered given at the same dose and rate. 5.10 Pneumonitis Thoracic radiation may be used in this patient population for management of primary tumor (e.g., chest wall primary site) or for management of metastatic disease (e.g., whole lung radiation for patients with lung metastasis). The extent to which ganitumab may increase the risk or severity of pneumonitis is not known , though an interim analysis in March 2019 showed a higher number of cases of pneumonitis in patients treated with ganitumab . Investigators should be vigilant for development of pneumonitis in patients trea ted with or without ganitumab. Oxygen saturation evaluation at time of protocol mandated physical examinations is required for patients who have been trea ted with whole lung radiation. Investigators should consider additional evaluations in patients who ha ve been treated with whole lung radiation who present with unexplained cough, dyspnea, or physical exam findings on lung auscultation. Pneumonitis will be managed according to local practice, individualized to each patient's clinical scenario: Grade 1: Patients with Grade 1 pneumonitis (asymptomatic) should be monitored according to local practice for potential worsening to higher grade pneumonitis (symptomatic). Grade 2 or higher: A typical approach to Grade 2 and higher radiation pneumonitis includes a protracted course (2 -4 weeks) of high dose corticosteroids (prednisone) followed by a slow taper over 3 to 12 weeks. Prophylaxis for pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is required for patients receiving > 20 mg prednisone daily. Consultation with pulmonology is strongly encouraged. For questions about radiation pneumonitis, sites may reach out to the study chair (Steven DuBois), vice -chair (Julia Glade -Bender), and lead radiation oncologist (Nadia Laack). Sites are to report pneumonitis of any grade in an exp edited manner via CTEP -AERS and through routine reporting (see Section 11). 5.11 Any Other Grade 3 or 4 Toxicities Delay chemotherapy until toxicity has resolved to Grade 1. Dose reduction of 25% may be considered at investigator's discretion. Attempts sh ould be made to re -escalate dose if toxicity does not recur.

Cyclophosphamide is inactive metabolized by P450 isoenzymes ( CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4) in the liver to active compounds. The initial product is 4 -hydroxycyclo phosphamide (4 -HC) which is in equilibrium with aldophosphamide which spontaneously releases acrolein to produce phosphoramide mustard. Phosphoramide mustard, which is an active bifunctional alkylating species, is 10 times more potent in vitro than is 4 -HC and has been shown to produce interstrand DNA cross -link analogous to those produced by mechlorethamine. Approximately 70% of a dose of cyclophosphamide is excreted in the urine as the inactive carboxyphosphamide and 5 -25% as unchanged drug. The plasma ha lf-life ranges from 4.1 to 16 hours after IV administration. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 87 Toxicity: Common Happens to 21 -100 children out of every 100 Occasional Happens to 5 -20 children out of every 100 Rare Happens to < 5 children out of every 100 Immediate: Within 1 -2 days of receiving drug Anorexia, nausea & vomiting (acute and delayed) Abdominal discomfort, diarrhea Transient blurred vision, nasal stuffiness with rapid administration, arrhythmias (rapid infusion), skin rash, anaphylaxis, SIADH Prompt: Within 2 -3 weeks, prior to the next course Leukopenia, alopecia, immune suppression Thrombocytopenia, anemia, hemorrhagic cystitis (L) Cardiac with high dose (acute - CHF hemorrhagic myocarditis, myocardial necrosis) (L), hyperpigmentation, nail changes, impaired w ound healing, infection secondary to immune suppression Delayed: Any time later during therapy Gonadal dysfunction: fibrosis2 (L) Late: Any time after completion of treatment Secondary malignancy (ALL, ANLL, AML), bladder carcinoma (long term use > 2 years), bladder fibrosis Unknown Frequency and Timing : Fetal toxicities and teratogenic effects of cyclophosphamide (alone or in combination with other antineoplastic agents) have been noted in humans. Toxicities include: chromosomal abnormalities, multiple anomalies, pancytopenia, and low birth weight. Cyclophosphamide is excreted into breast milk. Cyc lophosphamide is contraindicated during breast feeding because of reported cases of neutropenia in breast fed infants and the potential for serious adverse effects. 1 Dependent on dose, age, gender, and degree of pubertal development at time of treatment. 2 Risk increased with pulmonary chest irradiation and higher doses. (L) Toxicity may also occur later. Formulation and Stability: Cyclophosphamide for injection is available as powder for injection or lyophilized powder for injection in 500 mg, 1 g, and 2 g vials. The powder for injection contains 82 mg sodium bicarbonate/100 mg cyclophosphamide and the lyophilized powder for injecti on contains 75 mg mannitol/100 mg cyclophosphamide. Storage at or below 25\u00baC (77\u00baF) is recommended. The product will withstand brief exposures to temperatures up to 30\u00baC (86\u00baF). Guidelines for Administration: See Treatment and Dose Modifications sections of the protocol. Cyclophosphamide for Injection : If the drug will be administered as undiluted drug at the 20 mg/mL concentration, then reconstitute to 20 mg/mL with NS ONLY to avoid a hypotonic solution. If the drug will be further diluted prior to administration, then first reconstitute with NS, SWFI, or Bacteriostatic Water for Injection (paraben preserved only) to a concentration of 20 mg/mL. Following reconstitution , further dilute in dextrose or saline containing solutions for IV use. Supplier: Commercially available from various manufacturers. See package insert for further information. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 (05/09/11) Source and Pharmacology: Dactinomycin is a member of a class of antibiotic compounds isol ated from Streptomyces parvullus . chromophore (phenoxazone) to which two identical cyclic polypeptides are attached. The compound binds to DNA by intercalation, depending on a specific interaction between the polypeptide chains and deoxyguanosine. This interaction blocks the ability of DNA to act as a template for RNA and DNA synthesis in a concentration -dependent manner. Low drug concentrations inhibit RNA synthesis more than higher drug concentrations, w hich block both RNA and DNA syntheses. Dactinomycin can also cause topoisomerase -mediated single -strand breaks in DNA . Dactinomycin is minimally metabolized and is concentrated in nucleated red blood cells with very little diffusion into the CNS. After an IV bolus, dactinomycin has a very short initial distribution half -life of about 1 -minute but a prolonged terminal plasma half -life of 36 hours. Dactinomycin is primarily eliminated by renal and biliary excretion. Approximately 30% of the dose is recovered in urine and feces in one week. Toxicity: Common Happens to 21 -100 children out of every 100 Occasional Happens to 5 -20 children out of every 100 Rare Happens to < 5 children out of every 100 Immediate: Within 1 -2 days of receiving drug Nausea, vomiting Anorexia Anaphylaxis, abdominal pain, extravasation (rare) but if occurs = local ulceration Prompt: Within 2 -3 weeks, prior to next course Myelosuppression, alopecia (L) Diarrhea, mucositis, cheilitis, radiation recall lethargy, malaise Elevated LFTs, hepatitis, hepatomegaly, sinusoidal obstruction (SOS, formerly myalgia lat er during therapy Growth retardation, pneumonitis Late: Any time after completion of treatment Secondary malignancies Unknown frequency and timing: Fetal toxicities of dactinomycin have been noted in animal models. It is not known if dactinomycin is excreted into breast milk (L) Toxicity may also occur later. Formulation and Stability: Lyophilized powder, in vials containing 500 mcg of dactinomycin, with 20 mg of mannitol. Store at controlled room temperature, 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F); excursions permitted to 15 -30\u00b0C (59 - 86\u00b0F). Protect from light and humidity. Reconstitute with 1.1 mL of sterile wa ter without preservative to give a final concentration of 500 mcg/mL (0.5 mg/mL). The resulting solution should be clear to gold colored.

Stable at room temperature, 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) protected from light for up to 24 hours. Guideli nes for Administration: See Treatment and Dose Modifications sections of the protocol. Dactinomycin can be injected directly into the vein or preferably administered t hrough the tubing of a rapidly infusing solution of D5W or NS. The line should be flushed thoroughly at the end of the dactinomycin infusion. Significant binding of dactinomycin by cellulose ester membrane filters used in some intravenous in -line filters has been reported. Supplier: Commercially available. See package insert for more detailed information. 6.4 DEXRAZOXANE a synthetic chemical, a cyclic derivative of EDTA that readily penetrates cell membranes. Results of laboratory studies suggest that dexrazoxane is converted intracellularly to a ring opened chelating agent that interferes with iron mediated free radical generation th ought to be responsible, in part, for anthracycline -induced cardiomyopathy. The disposition kinetics of dexrazoxane are dose -dependent with administered doses from 60 to 900 mg/m2. The plasma half -life is 2 to 2.5 hours. Qualitative metabolism studies have confirmed the presence of unchanged drug, a diacid - diamide cleavage product, and two monoacid -monoamide ring products in the urine of animals and man. Metabolite levels were not measured in the pharmacokinetics studies. Urinary excretion plays an importan t role in the elimination of dexrazoxane: 42% of the drug (500 mg/m2) was excreted in the urine. In vitro studies have shown that dexrazoxane is not bound to plasma proteins. The pharmacokinetics of dexrazoxane have not been evaluated in patients with hepa tic or renal insufficiency. There was no significant effect of dexrazoxane on the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin (50 mg/m2) or its predominant metabolite, doxorubicinol, in a crossover study in cancer patients. Toxicity: Common Happens to 21 -100 children out of every 100 Occasional Happens to 5 -20 children out of every 100 Rare Happens to < 5 children out of every 100 Immediate: Within 1 -2 days of receiving drug Pain on injection, phlebitis, transient increases in triglycerides and amylase, incr ease in SGPT (ALT)/ SGOT (AST) and bilirubin, mild nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, increase in serum iron, decrease in serum zinc and calcium Anorexia, malaise, extravasation (rare) but if occurs may = ulceration Prompt: Within 2 -3 weeks, prior to the next course Myelosuppression Prolongation of PT/PTT Late: Any time after completion of treatment Secondary malignancies (have been reported with oral razoxane; the racemic mixture, of THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 90 which dexrazoxane is the S(+) - enantiomer) Unknown Frequency and T iming : Fetal toxicities and teratogenic effects have been noted in animals.

The cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin on malignant cells and its toxic effects on various organs are thought to be related to nucleotide base intercalatio n and cell membrane lipid binding activities of doxorubicin. Intercalation inhibits nucleotide replication and action of DNA and RNA polymerases. The interaction of doxorubicin with topoisomerase II to form DNA -cleavable complexes appears to be an importan t mechanism of doxorubicin cytocidal activity. Doxorubicin cellular membrane binding may affect a variety of cellular functions. Enzymatic electron reduction of doxorubicin by a variety of oxidases, reductases, and dehydrogenases generate highly reactive s pecies including the hydroxyl free radical (OH). Free radical formation has been implicated in doxorubicin cardiotoxicity by means of Cu (II) and Fe (III) reduction at the cellular level. Cells treated with doxorubicin have been shown to manifest the char acteristic morphologic changes associated with apoptosis or programmed cell death. Doxorubicin -induced apoptosis may be an integral component of the cellular mechanism of action relating to therapeutic effects, toxicities, or both. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 92 Doxorubicin pattern is multiphasic. The initial distributive t \u00bd is approximately 5 minutes suggesting rapid tissue uptake of doxorubicin. The terminal t \u00bd of 20 to 48 hours reflects a slow elimination from tissues. Steady -state distribution volumes exceed 20 to 30 L/kg and are indicative of extensive drug uptake into tissues. Plasma clearance is in the range of 8 to 20 mL/min/kg and is predominately by metabolism and biliary excretion. The P450 cytochromes which appear to be involved doxorubicin metabolism are CYP 2D6 and CYP3A4. Approximately 40% of the dose appears in the bile in 5 days, while only 5 to 12% of the drug and its metabolites appear in the urine during the same time period. Binding of doxorubicin and its major metabolite, doxorubicinol, to plasma prot eins is about 74 to 76% and is independent of plasma concentration of doxorubicin. Toxicity: Common Happens to 21 -100 children out of every 100 Occasional Happens to 5 -20 children out of every 100 Rare Happens to < 5 children out of every 100 Immediate: Within 1 -2 days of receiving drug Nausea, vomiting, pink or red color to urine, sweat, tears, and saliva Hyperuricemia, facial flushing, sclerosis of the vein Diarrhea, anorexia, erythematous streaking of the vein (flare reaction), extravasation (rare) but if occurs = local ulceration, anaphylaxis, fever, chills, urticaria, acute arrhythmias Prompt: Within 2 -3 weeks, prior to next (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia), Delayed: Any time later during therapy Cardiomyopathy1 (CHF occurs in 5 -20% at cumulative doses 450 mg/m\u00b2) (L) Cardiomyopathy1 (CHF occurs in < 5% at cumulative doses 400 mg/m\u00b2) (L), ulceration and necrosis of colon, hyper -pigmentation of nail bed and dermal crease, onycholysis Late: Any time after completion of treatment Subclinical cardiac dysfunction CHF (on long term follo w up in pediatric patients) Secondary malignancy (in combination regimens) Unknown Frequency and Timing: Fetal and teratogenic toxicities.

Its main effect appears to be in the S and G 2 phase of the cell cycle. The initial t \u00bd is 1.5 hours and the mean terminal half-life is 4 to 11 hours. It is primarily excreted in the urine. In children, approximately 55% of the dose is excreted in the urine as etoposide in 24 hours. The mean renal clea rance of etoposide is 7 to 10 mL/min/m \u00b2 or about 35% of the total body clearance over a dose range of 80 to 600 mg/m \u00b2. Etoposide, therefore, is cleared by both renal and non renal processes, i.e., metabolism and biliary excretion. The effect of renal disea se on plasma etoposide clearance is not known. Biliary excretion appears to be a minor route of etoposide elimination. Only 6% or less of an intravenous dose is recovered in the bile as etoposide. Metabolism accounts for most of the non renal clearance of etoposide. The maximum plasma concentration and area under the concentration time curve (AUC) exhibit a high degree of patient variability. Etoposide is highly bound to plasma proteins (~94%), primarily serum albumin. Pharmacodynamic studies have shown th at etoposide systemic exposure is related to toxicity. Preliminary data suggests that systemic exposure for unbound etoposide correlates better than total (bound and unbound) etoposide. There is poor diffusion into the CSF < 5%. Etoposide phosphate is a w ater soluble ester of etoposide which is rapidly and completely converted to etoposide in plasma. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data indicate that etoposide phosphate is bioequivalent to etoposide when it is administered in molar equivalent doses.

It is unknown whether the drug is excreted in breast milk. Formulation and Stability: Etoposide for Injection is available as a 20 mg/mL solution in sterile multiple dose vials (5 mL, 25 mL, or 50 mL each). The pH of the clear, nearly colorless to yellow liquid is 3 to 4. Each mL contains 20 mg etoposide, 2 mg citric acid, 30 mg benzyl alcohol, 80 mg modified polysorbate 80/tween 80, 650 mg polyethyle ne glycol 300, and 30.5 percent (v/v) alcohol. Vial headspace contains nitrogen. Unopened vials of etoposide are stable until expiration date on package at controlled room temperature ( 20-25C or 68 -77F). Etoposide phosphate for injection is available for intravenous infusion as a sterile lyophilized powder in single -dose vials containing etoposide phosphate equivalent to 100 mg etoposide, 32.7 mg sodium citrate USP, and 300 mg dextran 40. Etoposide phosphate must be stored under refrigeration (2\u00b0 -8\u00b0C o r 36\u00b0 -46\u00b0F). Unopened vials of etoposide phosphate are stable until the expiration date on the package. Guidelines for Administration: See Treatment and Dose Modification sections of the protocol. Etoposide : Dilute etoposide to a final concentration 0.4 mg/mL in D5W or NS. Etoposide infusions are stable at room temperature for 96 hours when diluted to concentrations of 0.2 mg/mL; stability is 24 hours at room temperature with concentrations of 0.4 mg/mL. The time to precipitation is highly unpredictable at concentrations > 0.4 mg/mL. Use in -line filter during infusion secondary to the risk of precipitate formation. However, the use of an in - line filter is not mandatory since etoposide precipitation is unlikel y at concentrations of 0.1-0.4 mg/mL. Do not administer etoposide by rapid intravenous injection. Slow rate of administration if hypotension occurs. Leaching of diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags occurred with etoposide 0.4 mg/mL in NS.

Acrolein is thought to be the cause of the hemorrhagic cystitis as seen with cyclophosphamide. Ifosfamide demonstrates do se-dependent pharmacokinetics whereby the terminal half -life ranges from 7 to 16 hours at doses of 1.6 -2.4 g/m\u00b2 to 3.8 -5 g/m\u00b2, respectively. At 1.6 -2.4 g/m\u00b2/d, 12 to 18% of the dose was excreted as unchanged drug in the urine, whereas at a 5 g/m\u00b2 single -dose, 61% was excreted in the urine as the parent drug. Evidence also exists to suggest that ifosfamide metabolism is inducible, with more rapid clearance occurring in the second and later doses when a course of therapy is given as fractionated doses over 3 to 5 days. There is more chloroethyl side chain oxidation of ifosfamide (up to 50%) than of cyclophosphamide (< 10%), and the degree of such metabolism is more variable than with cyclophosphamide. Oxidation of the chloroethyl groups produces chloroacetalde hyde, which is thought to be responsible for the neurotoxicity and renal toxicity that have been seen with ifosfamide therapy.

Guidelines for Administration: See Treatment and Dose Modification sections of the protocol. Reconstitute ifosfamide lyophilized powder with sterile water for injection or bacteriostatic water for injection(use 20 mL for the 1 g vial and 60 mL for the 3 g vial) to produce a final concentration of 50 mg/mL. Use sterile water for injection without benzyl alcohol for neonates and infants < 2 years of age or patients with hypersensitivity to benzyl alcohol . Although the reconstituted product is stable for 7 days at roo m temperature and up to 6 weeks under refrigeration, the manufacturer recommends refrigeration and use within 24 hours to reduce the possibility of microbial contamination. Store unreconstituted vials at room temperature emperatures above 30\u00b0C Ifosfamide may liquefy at temperatures > 35\u00b0C. Reconstituted solutions of ifosfamide or ifosfamide solution should be diluted further to concentrations of 0.6 to 20 mg/mL in dextrose or saline containing solutions. Such admixtures, when stored in large volume parenteral glass bottles, Viaflex bags or PAB bags, are physically and chemically stable for 1 week at 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F) or 6 weeks at 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F).

Mesna is (dimesna). Mesna disulfide remains in the intravascula r compartment and is rapidly eliminated by the kidneys. In the kidney, the mesna disulfide is reduced to the free thiol compound, reacts chemically (acrolein and 4 -hydroxy -ifosfamide) resulting in their detoxification. The first step in the detoxification process is the binding of mesna to 4 -hydroxy -ifosfamide forming a nonurotoxic 4 -sulfoethylthioifosfamide. Mesna also binds to the double bonds of acrolein and to other urotoxic metabolites. In multiple human xenograft or rodent tumor model studies, mesna in combination with ifosfamide (at dose ratios of up to 20 -fold as single or multiple courses) failed to demonstrate interference with antitumor efficacy. After an 800 mg dose the half lives for mesna a nd dimesna are 0.36 hours and 1.17 hours, respectively. Approximately 32% and 33% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine in 24 hours as mesna and dimesna, respectively. The majority of the dose recovered was eliminated within 4 hours.

There are however no adequate and well -controlled studies in pregnant women. It is not known if mesna or dimesn a is excreted into human milk 1All currently available products in the U.S. are preserved with benzyl alcohol. Benzyl Alcohol has been associated with death in pre -term infants weighing less than 2500 g and receiving 99 - 405 mg/kg/day. Benzyl alcohol is normally oxidized rapidly to benzoic acid, conjugated with glycine in the liver, and excreted as hippuric acid. In pre -term infants , however, this metabolic pathway may not be well developed. Onset of toxic illness in these infants occurred between several days and a few weeks of age with a characteristic clinical picture that included metabolic acidosis progressing to respiratory distress and gasping respirations. Many infants also had central - nervous -system dysfunction, including c onvulsions and intracranial hemorrhage; hypotension leading to cardiovascular collapse was a late finding usually preceding death.

Mesna tablets have an oral bioavailability of 45 -79% and a urinary bioavailability which ranged from 45 -79% of intravenously administered mesna. The oral bioavailability is unaffected by food. When compared to intravenously administered mesna, the intravenous plus oral dosing regimen increases systemic exposures (150%) and provides more sustained excretion of mesna in the urine over a 24 - hour period.

G -CSF is a lineage specific colony -stimulatin g factor which regulates the production of neutrophils within the bone marrow and affects neutrophil progenitor proliferation, differentiation, and selected end - cell functional activation (including enhanced phagocytic ability, priming of the cellular meta bolism associated with respiratory burst, antibody dependent killing, and the increased expression of some functions associated with cell surface antigens). After subcutaneous injection the elimination half -life of pegfilgrastim ranges from 15 to 80 hours and the time to peak concentration ranges from 24 to 72 hours. Serum levels are sustained in most patients during the neutropenic period postchemotherapy, and begin to decline after the start of neutrophil recovery, consistent with neutrophil -dependent elimination. After subcutaneous administration at 100 mcg/kg in 37 pediatric patients with sarcoma, the terminal elimination half -life was 30.1 (+/ - 38.2) hours in patients 0 to 5 years - old, 20.2 (+/ - 11.3) hours in patients 6 to 11 years -old, and 21.2 (+/ - 16) hours in children 12 to 21 years -old.

THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 114 9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 9.1 Statistical Design 9.1.1 Randomization The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of ganitumab in the treatment of newly -diagnosed metastatic Ewing sarcoma. All patients enrolled on AEWS1221 will be randomized at the time of enrollment, after confirmation of eligibility. Randomization will be done in the ratio of 1:1 to the non -ganitumab containing therapy ('comparator regimen') v. the ganitumab containing therapy ('experimental regimen'). Randomization will be stratified according to age at enrollment (< 21 years vs. 21 years) and extent of disease (lung only vs. any other metastatic site): (1) stratum 1 - patients < 21 years with metastatic disease in one or both lungs only; (2) stratum 2 - patients < 21 years with any extra -pulmonary metastases; (3) stratum 3 - patien ts 21 years with metastatic disease in one or both lungs only; and (4) stratum 4 - patients 21 years with any extra -pulmonary metastases. 9.1.2 Primary Endpoint and Hypothesis The primary outcome measured on each participant will be time to adverse an alytic event (EFS), defined to be disease -related event, diagnosis of a second malignant neoplasm, or death. A disease -related event will be: (1) disease progression as defined in Section 10.1 -10.3; (2) persistent diseas e in bone marrow at the end of Consolidation therapy as defined in Section 10.4. 1; or (3) biopsy -proven viable tumor after radiation of metastatic disease is completed, as described in Section 10.4. 2. The primary analysis will entail estimation of the relative risk of adverse analytic event for patients on the experimental therapy compared with that for the standard therapy. The primary statistical n ull hypothesis is H 0: The relative risk of an EFS - event associated with the ganitumab containing therapy is 1 and the statistical alternative hypothesis is H 1: The relative risk of an EFS -event associated with the ganitumab containing therapy is 0.67. 9.2 Patient Accrual and Expected Duration of Trial Under the statistical null hypothesis we expect to observe 218 events in the study population at the time of analysis for the primary study goal (Table 2 B). This will entail 5 years enrollment plus 1.5 years of follow -up of 300 randomized patients . With one -sided test of size 0.025, we will achieve 81% power under the alternative hypothesis. Table 1 A. Aggregate EFS from previous COG studies of newly diagnosed metastatic Ewing s arcoma.

The study design w ill require the enrollment of 300 eligible patients with 1 .5 years of follow -up after the last enrollment. We will enroll up to 330 patients to account for ineligible patients. The study will be open for accrual for approximately 5 years if 300 patients are required. In summary, the study will require 6.5 years to obtain sufficient data to address the primary stud y goal (5 years of enrollment plus 1.5 years of follow -up after the last patient is enrolled ). Design Summary The two regimens will be compared using the relative risk regression model with strata representing those used for randomization. Each patient's outcome will be associated with that individual's assigned regimen regardless of received therapy. A log -partia l-likelihood one-sided test of size 0. 025 will be used to compare the two regimens. This level of -error is commonly utilized in superiority designs intended to collect substantive evidence for a new treatment, particularly in a rare indication in which m ultiple definitive trials are not feasible . A one -sided comparison is used because the experimental regimen will be identified as the preferred therapy only if it is judged to be superior to the comparator regimen according to the statistical criteria desc ribed above. If the statistical alternative hypothesis is true, the experimental regimen will be identified for further development with probability 0.8 1. This probability was calculated using the method of Barthel et al ,107 as illustrated in the evaluations of the statistical properties of t he proposed design presented below: THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 116 Table 2A: Characteristics of the Proposed Design If the Alternative Hypothesis is True ART - ANALYSIS OF RESOURCES FOR TRIALS (version 1.1.0, 10 December 2013) --------------------------------------------------- --------------------------- A sample size program by Abdel G Babiker, Patrick Royston & Friederike Barthel,MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, London WC2B 6NH, UK. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Type of trial Superiority - time-to-event outcome Statistical test assumed Unweighted logrank test (local) Number of groups 2 Allocation ratio Equal group sizes Total number of periods 13 Length of each period 6 months Survival probs per period 10 Number of follow -up periods 3 Method of accrual Uniform Recruitment period -weights 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 Hazard ratios as entered (groups 1,2) 1, . 666666666667 Alpha 0.025 (one -sided) Power (calculated) 0. 809 Total sample size (designed) 300 Expected total number of events 196 1 Group 1- Comparator Regimen (Regimen A): The median EFS occurs at 16.6 months 2 Group 2 - Experimental Regimen (Regimen B): The median EFS occurs at 24.4 months Table 2B: Projected Number of Events Observed at Various Time Points After the Start of Enrollment If the Null Hypothesis is True Number of Elapsed Six Month Periods Since Study Opening Expected Cumulative Number of Patients Enrolled Expected Cumulative Number of Events - Comparator Regimen Expected Cumulative Number of Events - Experimental Regimen 1 30 1 1 2 60 5 5 3 90 12 12 4 120 21 21 5 150 31 31 6 180 41 41 7 210 52 52 8 240 63 63 9 270 75 75 10 300 86 86 11 300 97 97 12 300 105 105 13 300 109 109 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 117 Table 2C : Projected Number of Events Observed at Various Time Points After the Start of Enrollment If the Alternative Hypothesis is True Number of Elapsed Six Month Periods Since Study Opening Expected Cumulative Number of Patients Enrolled Expected Cumulative Number of Events - Comparator Regimen Expected Cumulative Number of Events - Experimental Regimen 1 30 1 1 2 60 5 3 3 90 12 8 4 120 21 14 5 150 31 22 6 180 41 31 7 210 52 40 8 240 63 49 9 270 75 57 10 300 86 67 11 300 97 75 12 300 105 82 13 300 109 87 We expect many of the instances of disease progression will be identified at the time of regularly scheduled follow -up visits. This can lead to underestimation of the true relative risk associated with experimental regimen when rela pse times are treated as exact.108 Various solutions have been proposed .108,109 To assess the effect of this possible bias we will use the method ology proposed by Whitehead.110 Briefly, if all recurrences are detected at a scheduled screening time at the end of a reporting or follow -up period, we will apply Method 2 proposed by Whitehead.110 That is, the data will be treated as a discrete t ime survival process with the effect of treatment acting multiplicatively on the conditional probability of relapse. If some recurrences are detected at times other than scheduled screen times, w e will adopt Method 4 proposed by Whitehead.110 That is, we will fit a parametric model that treat s disease progressions identified at routine visits as interval censored observations with the left censoring time as the date of the last screening prior to the identification of the relapse and othe r relapse times as being know exactly . Initially we will fit generalized Gamma model for the exact time of relapse and use the Weibull model if this provides adequate fit. Interim Monitoring of Primary Endpoint The study will be monitored for evidence of reduction in EFS -event risk associated with ganitumab at 3 times after the start of randomization and prior to the final analysis . The flexible -spending function approach will be used with the function (t)=t2. Each of these analyses will occur at the first report preparation date where the information fraction identified in Table 3A has been met or exceeded. Given the model for the outcome for the comparator arm delineated in Table 2B above, the calendar timing of these analyses will be approximately 2.5 years, 3 .5 years and 4.5 years after the study is opened. The boundaries for the test statistic that will result in identifying the study to the DSMC for possible closure are summarize d in Tabl e 3A. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 118 The planned time for the final analysis is that time at which 218 EFS-events have been observed (Table 2 B). If the enrollment rate and the EFS -event rate for the comparator arm are as predicted, and study enrollment is not terminated becau se of interim monitoring or futility monitoring, this will occur with 5 years of accrual and 1.5 years of follow -up after the last patient is enrolled .

Overall Toxicity of the Addition of G anitumab to VDC/IE Chemotherapy Patients who receive treatment during: (1) Induction; or (2) Consolidation phases will be considered in this analysis. Any of these phases in which a patient receives all planned chemotherapy, has an adverse experience that requires termination of protocol therapy or stops protocol therapy because of a disease related event will be considered in this analysis. A phase where a patient experiences a Grade 4 non -hematological toxicity, Grade 3 left ventricular systolic dysfunction, or terminates protocol thera py because of a CTC codeable adverse experience will be considered a phase with a toxicity -event. The frequency of toxicity -events for each of the two phases will be modeled according to the formula: ( )1 1 0Pr | ; 1 :k o ijij j k o jx ieToxicityeventx e Wherexarethereportingperiodcharacteristics isthebaselinetoxicityeventcoefficient =+ + = + The phase characte ristics are indicator variables including the randomized regimen as well as the local control modalities used on the primary tumor site. The null hypothesis randomized THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 121 regimen = 0 will be tested using a one -sided test against the alternative that the expe rimental regimen has an increased frequency of toxicity -events for each of the phases each time the study progress report is prepared for this trial. If this is significant at the 0.05 level, the study committee will alert the COG DSMC and CTEP that the ex perimental regimen has an increased toxicity -event rate. The committee will consult with the DSMC and CTEP to determine whether the experimental regimen should be modified. No adjustment will be made for multiple testing, since this is the most conservativ e approach to monitoring. For the Induction phase , where we expect 150 patients on each regimen to contribute to the analysis, the method proposed will identify the experimental regimen as having increased toxicity -event rate with at least probability 0.8 0 when the experimental regimen's toxicity - event rate is 33.2% and the comparator regimen's toxicity -event rate is 20%. At the time of the preparation of each study progress report, we will construct the 95% confidence interval for the toxicity -event rate f or each phase noted above for patients enrolled on the comparator therapy. If this lower bound of this confidence interval exceeds 33.2%, the committee will consult with the DSMC and CTEP to determine whether the study treatments should be modified. This a nalysis will be presented only to the COG DSMC except when consultation as described above is required. Sinusoidal Obstructive Disease (SOS) Associated with the Addition of G anitumab to VDC/IE Patients who receive treatment during: (1) Induction; or (2) Consolidation phases will be considered in this analysis. Any of these phases in which a patient receives all planned chemotherapy, has an adverse experience that requires termination of protocol therapy or stops protocol therapy because of a disease related event will be considered in this analysis. Each phase will be evaluated for the occurrence of SOS according to the definition in Section 5.7. 1. A phase where a patient experiences a ny SOS will be considered a phase with a n SOS toxicity -event. The relative frequency of toxicity -events for each of the t wo phases will be modeled according to the formula: PrToxicity-event|xi ( )=ebo+b1xi 1+ebo+b1xi; Where:xiis1ifthepatientisrandomizedtoganitumab;0otherwise b0isthebaselinetoxicity-eventcoefficient b1isthecoefficientassociatedwiththerandomizedregimen The null hypothesis 1 = 0 will be tested using a one -sided test against the alternative that the experimental regimen has an increased frequency of SOS toxicity -events for each of the phases each time the study progress report is prepared for this trial. For this analysis, initially all patient -phases will be considered as independent analytic units. If the exact conditional test of the hypothesis 1 = 0 is signi ficant at the 0.10 level (one- sided) , the study committee will alert the COG DSMC and CTEP that th e experimental regimen has an increased SOS toxicity -event rate. The committee will consult with the DSMC and CTEP to determine whether the experimental regimen should be modified. No adjustment will be made for multiple testing, since this is the most con servative approach THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 122 to monitoring. At the time of the primary analysis, under the null hypothesis and given the historical EFS experience, we expect 286 patient -phases to be accumulated for each regimen. The method proposed will identify the experimental re gimen as having increased toxicity -event rat e with at least probability 0. 80 when the experimental regim en's SOS toxicity -event rate is 5.7% and the comparator regimen's SOS toxicity -event rate is 2% during each of the Induction and Consolidation phases . We will explore the effect of possible correlations between analytic units that arises because some analytic units are contributed by the same individual. We will employ a random effects binomial model where a Normally distributed random effect with 0 mea n and unknown variance 2 is contributed by each unit in a pair of analytic units that arise from the same individual. The results with respect to estimated regimen coefficient and p - value for the null hypothesis for the two analytic approaches (completely independent v. random effects) 1 = 0 will be compared. A separate rule will monitor risk of SOS during the M aintenance phase. Because the experimental therapy has a M aintenance component that is not present in the comparator regimen, monitori ng the inci dence of SOS during M aintenance will be restricted to patients who are randomized to the experimental therapy a nd start the M ainte nance phase of the protocol. A M aintenance phase in which a patient receives all planned ganitumab as prescribed by the protoc ol, has an adverse experience that requires termination of protocol therapy or stops protocol therapy because of a disease related event will b e considered in this analysis. Each phase considered in the analysis will be evaluated for the occurrence of SOS according to the definition in Section 5.7.1. A phase where a patient experiences a ny SOS will be considered a phase with a n SOS toxicity -event. All evaluable M aintenance phases will be aggregated and the statistical hypothesis: ( )0: Pr SOS Toxicity-Event is observed during main tenance 0.02 H = will be tested using a one sided exact binomial test of size 0.10 . Evaluation of COG experience with the treatment of newly -diagnosed metastatic Ewing sarcoma indicates at least 90% of patients will remain event -free throug h Induction and C onsolidation. We expect, therefore, to have approximately 135 phases available for evaluation per regimen . If 5 or fewer patients experience SOS the treatment will be considered to have an acceptable r ate of SOS during Maintenance. If the true probability of SOS during Maintenance is 2%, the probability of declaring that M aintenance is associated with an excessive SOS rate is 0.0 55. If the true SOS toxicity probability is 5.8%, the method proposed will identify the Maintenance phase SOS toxicity rate as elevated with probability 0.80. If the number of phases available for analysis differs from 135, we will adjust the cutoff values for the binomial test to maintain a type I erro r rate of at most 10% and a type II error rate of at most 20%, if possible . The above -noted analyses will be presented only to the COG DSMC except when consultation as described above is required. Further, if an incident of severe SOS is identified, a rep ort describing the incident will be prepared by the AEWS1221 study committee and presented to the COG DSMC within one month of the reporting of such an incident. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 123 In an effort to capture and monitor for potentially undiagnosed cases of SOS, the study commi ttee will tabulate all episodes of G rade > 3 AST, ALT, and bilirubin according to randomized regimen twice yearly for review by the sponsor and COG DSMC. Comparing Risk for Death The two randomized regimens will be compared with respect to risk of death. The outcome measure for this secondary aim will be overall survival (OS) defined as the time from enrollment to death regardless of cause or last patient contact. A patient who is alive at last contact will be censored at that time for the purpose s of this analysis; otherwise the patient will be considered to have experienced an event for the analysis described below. Based on this historical result, we estimate the survivor function for OS for patients randomized to the comparator arm as the piec ewise exponential survivor function with the times since enrollment and probabilities of remaining event -free given in Table 1B: Table 4A: OS from Enrollment Expected for Patients Enrolled to the Comparator Therapy Time in Months Since Enrollment Proport ion Alive 6 0.975 12 0.853 18 0.696 66 0.340 72 0.333 78 0.333 We will use a relative risk regression model with strata representing those used for randomization. Each patient's outcome will be associated with that individual's assigned regimen regardless of received therapy. A log -partial -likelihood one -sided test of size 0. 05 will be used to compare the two regimens for this secondary analysis. A one -sided comparison is used because the experimental regimen will be identified as the preferred therapy only if it is judged to be superior to the comparator regimen according to the statistical criteria described above. One analysis will be conducted at the time the analysis utilizing the primary outcome measure (EFS) is done . The statistical alternative hypothesis for the OS endpoint is quantified as the hazard ratio for death for Reg imen B relative to Regimen A is 0.67 or lower. If the statistical alternative hypothesis is true, the experimental regimen will be identified for further development with probability 0.796 . This probability was calculated using the method of Barthel et al,107 as illustrated in the evaluations of the statistical properties of the proposed design presented below: THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 124 ART - ANALYSIS OF RESOURCES FOR TRIALS (version 1.1.0, 10 December 2013) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ A sample size program by A bdel G Babiker, Patrick Royston & Friederike UCL, London WC2B 6NH, UK. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Type of trial Superiority - time-to-event outcome Statistical test assumed Unweighted logrank test (local) Number of groups 2 Allocation ratio Equal group sizes Total number of periods 13 Length of each period 6 months Survival probs per 10 Number of follow -up periods 3 Method of accrual Uniform Recruitment period -weights 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 Hazard ratios as entered (groups 1,2) 1, .666666666667 Alpha 0.050 (one -sided) Power (calculat ed) 0.796 Total sample size (designed) 300 Expected total number of events 150 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1 Group 1 - Comparator Regimen (Regimen A): The median OS occurs at 30.4 months 2 Group 2 - Experimental Regimen (Regim en B): The median O S occurs at 63 months Comparing Bone Marrow Response Rates All eligible randomized patients who are enrolled on the trial with clinical evidence of bone marrow metastatic disease and who receive at least one dose of protocol chemotherapy will be considered for the evaluation of this endpoint. Each bone marrow evaluable patient will be assessed for the presence or ab sence of bone marrow metastatic disease over the interval between enrollment and the time of first local control measure or the end of the I nduction reporting period, whichever comes first. Only one evaluation of best response will be used to classify the patient as complete responder (no evidence of marrow disease) or incomplete responder (residual marrow disease or progression according to Sections 10.3.4 and 10.4). We will provide an estimate of the proportion of patients who achieve complete bone marrow response and an associated 95% confidence interval. We expect approximately 20% of the 300 randomized patients to have bone marrow disease detected at enrollment. Sin ce the assignment to ganitumab is done through randomization, we expect approximately half of such patients will be assigned to the experimental regimen, providing approximately 30 patients for the evaluation of this endpoint for each treatment arm. The ma ximum expected confidence interval will occur if 50% of patients achieve a bone marrow CR, and the expected interval is 0. 31-0.69. Tolerability of Maintenance with Ganitumab Each patient who receives ganitumab M aintenance will be evaluated for toxicity -event as described above. At the time each study progress report is prepared, the toxicity -event rate will be calculated and the one -sided test of size 0.05 of the null hypothesis that the toxicity - THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 125 event rate is 25% will be performed. No adjustmen t for multiple testing will be made. If the true toxicity -event rate is 35% and 135 patients are evaluable for M aintenance toxicity, the therapy will be identified as associated with an elevated toxicity -event rate with probability 0.8 0. Ganitumab Pharmac okinetics The first 10 patients < 21 years of age at enrollment ('younger patients') assigned to Regimen B will be considered in the evaluation of dosing adequacy for younger patients. These patients will be required to submit samples for pharmacokineti c (PK) testing in Induction as described in Section 15.5 . The proportion of patients achieving a trough serum concentration 10 \u00b5g/mL prior to the second dose of ganitumab in Induction will be obtained. If 7 or more of these 10 patients achieve this trough concentration, then the dose of 18 mg/kg will be deemed adequate in younger patients and randomization will continue for this age group. If < 7 patients achieve this trough concentration, the study committe e will discuss the PK results with CTEP in order to determine if protocol modification is required prior to continuing the randomization for younger patients. Randomization will continue without interruption wh ile PK data from these first 10 patients are a nalyzed and reviewed, up to 3 months from Induction Day 29 of the 10th patient < 21 years of age at enrollment. If the true proportion of patients with trough levels that are 10 \u00b5g/mL is 0.45, the dose will be identified for modification with probability 0.90. If the true proportion of patients with trough levels that are 10 \u00b5g/mL is 0.81, the dose will be identified as providing sufficient trough levels with probability 0.9 0. Additional trough levels in Induction will allow for estimation of accumulation, half -life, and steady state clearance of ganitumab. The first 10 patients < 21 years of age assigned to Regimen B will be required to submit samples for PK testing in Mai ntenance as described in Section 15.5 . Results of this PK testing will be reported descriptively , with an emphasis on the proportion of patients achieving a trough serum ganitumab concentration 10 \u00b5g/mL at a dose of 18 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks . Additional trough levels in Maintenance will allow for estimation of accumulation, half -life, and steady state clearance of ganitumab. Feasibility and Efficacy of SBRT for Bone Metastases Based on data obtained from INT -0091, we expect approximately 45% of patients with newly -diagnosed metastatic Ewing sarcoma to present with bone metastases as a component of their metastatic disease burden. We expect at least half of these patients will receive SBRT, acknowledgi ng there may be selection bias with respect to which patients receive SBRT. Compliance with protocol recommendations for SBRT timing (during local control vs. after completion of chemotherapy), dose and fractionation, and sites treated will be assessed in collaboration with IROC Rhode Island (formerly QARC) . A patient will be considered an SBRT -feasibility -success if that individual has SBRT planned for at least one site, starts the treatment of metastatic disease phase of the protocol and has at least 85% of tumor sites planned to be treated with SBRT receive successful SBRT. Patients who are removed from protocol therapy prior to the planned start date of radiation to metastatic sites will not be considered in this evaluation. Successful treatment delivery is defined as a treatment plan that is acceptable or has only minor variation as assessed by IROC Rhode Island (formerly QARC) (see Section 17.14 ). In addition to this feasibility assessment, efficacy will be evaluated by comparing the failure rate at irradiated bone metastases with SBRT and EBRT, recognizing selection bias between patients treated with SBRT or EBRT. Failure at a radiated bone meta stasis will be defined according to Section THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 126 10.3.3 . The cumulative incidence of local failure as a function of time will be estimated using cumulative incidence methods as described by Kalbfleisch and Prentice.112 Finally, the rates and grade s of soft tissue ulceration and compression/insufficiency fractures at sites of SBRT will be reported descriptively. Association between Serum IGF Pathway Components and Tissue Markers and Outcome We will conduct exploratory analyses of initial IGF -1 level as well as other serum IGF-1 pathway components as well as tissue protein, DNA, and RNA markers . One of the analyses that will be conducted will be to segregate the population into groups according the median value of the particular biological charac teristic. Given the current aggregate outcome, a plausible long -term EFS for one of the median groups is 35% and for the other is 21%; this corresponds to a 1.5-fold increase in risk. If such a difference is present, we will identify the median division in initial IGF -1 levels as prognostic for outcome with probability of greater than 86% when using a test of size 0. 10 when 90% of pa tients submit evaluable samples . It is of interest to compare the effect of each of the biological markers across groups defined by randomized treatment assignment. This will be done using the proportional hazards regression model: ( ) ()1 2 3 0 ; , [9.2.1]z f z ft z f t e + + = Where: z takes on the value 0 if the patient is enrolled on the comparator arm and 1 otherwise; and f takes on the value 0 if the patient's biological characteristic is at the median or below and 1 otherwise. A formal statistical of 03:0H= will be conducted and a two -sided p -value of 0.20 or less will be considered suggestive of an interaction between the assigned treatment and the biological characteristic . Linear trend in EFS -risk will be investigated by segregating the marker level according to quartiles . For bone marrow response rate analyses, Fisher's exact test will be used to compare the objective bone marrow response rate (complete response vs. incomplete response) at start of local control between patients with biomarker levels above and below the g roup median. In addition, exploratory analyses will be performed using marker divided according to quartile of IGF -1 level. These analyses will be repeated for other serum and tissue markers . Evaluation of Bone Marrow Micrometastatic Disease and Tumor Cel l Surface IGF -1R Expression The percentage of patients with detectable bone marrow micrometastatic disease at baseline who clear their bone marrow micrometastatic disease after three and six cycles of study therapy will be reported descriptively according to treatment arm. Extent of tumor cell IGF -1R co -expression will also be reported. Moreover, the change in tumor cell IGF - 1R co -expression in patients treated with and without ganitumab will be reported descriptively. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 127 Germline Polymorphisms EGFR will undergo genotyping for EGFR promoter polymorphism at -216. EFS will be compared between patients with and without the presence of the minor allele using the log rank test . We will use a two sided test of size 0.10 for this exploratory analysis. Power calculations are provided below for various participation rates for genotyping and allele frequency for the entire population : Proportion Participation Proportion with G/G Absent Long -Term EFS with G/G Absent Relative Risk for EFS-Event with G/G Ab sent Power 1.0 0.50 0.35 1.5 0.89 0.75 0.50 0.35 1.5 0.81 0.50 0.50 0.35 1.5 0.66 1.0 0.25 0.35 1.5 0.79 0.75 0.25 0.35 1.5 0.69 0.50 0.25 0.35 1.5 0.53 The presence of the promoter polymorphism may have different prognostic implications depending on treatment assignment. We will fit the model specified by equation [9.2.1] and test for an interaction between polymorphism status and treatment regimen. A for mal statistical of 03:0H= will be conducted and a two -sided p -value of 0.20 or less will be considered suggestive of an interaction between the assigned treatment and polymorphism status . EFS also will be compared between patients with and without the presence of the minor allele using the log rank test within groups defined assigned treatment. Additional analyses will compare overall survival and objective bone marrow response rate prior to local control as clinical outcomes of interes t. Association between the number of copies of the minor allele and these clinical endpoints will be evaluated. Aim 1.3.11: The institutional result of EWS tumor testing will be categorized as translocation detected (yes v. no) and the type of translocation de tected will also be recorded. From previous experience, we expect translocation testing will be don e for at least 80% of patients. The proportion of patient s with a particular EWS translocation variant will be tabulated. Risk for EFS -event will be compared across groups defined by translocation positivity using the log rank test . The power associated with such comparisons, as a function of patients evaluated for translocations and frequency of translocation positivity, can be obtained from the table above for Germline Polymorphisms in EGFR . The prognostic significance of each particular type of translocation, and any modifying effect of treatment assignment, will be assessed using a proportional hazards regression with indicator variables for the presence of each particular type of translocation and an indicator var iable for treatment assignment. Since this is an exploratory exercise, a two -sided p -value of 0. 10 or less will identify any particular coefficient as of interest for further exploration. Aim 1.3.12 : The results of ctDNA testing will be used to provide planning data for future trials. We expect baseline plasma samples obtained from the required EDTA baseline sample will be available from at least 250 patients (those who consented to future research for leftover samples prior to Amendment #1 and those who consent to the ctDNA THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 128 correlative study with Amendment #1 and beyond). With Amendment #1, we will also collect serial samples and expect that serial testing will be accompli shed in at least 75 patients . The proportion of patients with detectable EWSR1 translocations and key somatic mutations such as STAG2 and TP53 , along with the allelic frequency for these mutations will be reported along with the proportion of patients with these characteristics from samples done at later time points. For patients who are evaluated serially, we will report the proportion of patients that have a change in translocation result associated with ctDNA testing across time periods. Aim 1.3.13: The results of serial genomic profiling from cells identified by flow cytometry will be used to provide planning data for future trials. We expect such testing will be accomp lished in at least 50 patients , though the proportion of patients with insufficient bone marrow tumor cells to support genomic testing will be described. The profiles will be presented graphically, and samples obtained from different sites of tumor within the same individual will also be presented. Statistical Considerations for Imaging Correlative Studies Aim 1. 3.9: This analysis will be conducted using modeling via the proportional hazards regression model. The outcome measure for this aim will b e the e vent-free survival post Induction therapy. Analytic events include disease progression, disease recurrence, diagnosis of a second malignant neoplasm or death. Any patie nt who completes I nduction chemotherapy without an analytic event and has received a PET scan at bo th start of therapy and end of I nduction will be considered in this analysis. The change in average SUV (S) betwe en start of therapy and end of I nduction and randomized treatment assignment will be independent variables in this analysis. Below, the variable zi will be used to represent variously S, including a categorical variable which takes on the value 0 if S is below the median S and 1 otherwise; S categorized in tertiles ; Z, where Z is 1 if all PET signal disappears and 0 otherwise; and actual S. RECIST response is represented by the variable Ri below . The proportional hazards regression model: ( ) ()12 0 ;,iizR iit z t t e+= The partial likelihood ratio test of H 0: 1 = 0 will be conducted with R present in the relative risk regression model. A significance level of 0.10 will be considered suggestive of an augmentation of the predictive value of RECIST response in this population. We expect approximately 70% of patient s will have the initial PET scan and of these, a pproximately 95% will complete I nduction chemotherapy. Thus we expect 200 patients will be available for this analysis, fifty percent of whom will be randomized to ganitumab. The power for test noted above de pends the correlation between Z, the characterization of S and Ri, as seen in the following table for the variable Z which takes on the value 0 if S is below the median S and 1 otherwise : Relative Hazard Rate Associated with Z = 1 Correlation between Z and R Probability the Variable Z will be Identified as Of Interest According to the Criteria Above 2.2 0 0.80 2.5 0.5 0.80 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 129 Aim 1. 3.10: This analysis will be conducted using modeling via the proportional hazards regression model. The outcome measure for this aim will be the event -free su rvival post Induction therapy. Analytic events include disease progression, disease recurrence, diagnosis of a second malignant neoplasm or de ath. Any patient who completes I nduction chemotherapy without an ana lytic event and has received a PET scan at both start of therapy and end of induction will b e considered in this analysis. The change in average SUV (S) betwe en start of therapy and end of I nduction and randomized treatment assignment will be independent variables in this analysis. Below, the variable ai will be used to represent variously S, including a categorical variable which takes on the value 0 if S is below the median S and 1 otherwise; S categorized in tertiles : 1 if all PET signal disappears and 0 otherwise; and actual S. The randomized treatment assignment, bi, will be included if there is evidence of a treatment effect. The proportional hazards regression model: ( ) ()12 0 ;,iiab iit a b t e+= will be fitted to the data at the time of analysis for the primary study analysis. We will test H0: 1 = 0, a measure of effect of S . A p -value less than 0.15 will be indicative of a possible relationship in this exploratory analysis. Estimated relative risks and 85% confidence intervals associat ed with the various characterizations of S will be constructed from the proportional hazards regression model with all significant (as defined above) terms included. We expect approximately 70% of patients will have the initial PET scan and of these, a pproximately 95% will complete I nduction chemotherapy. Thus we expect 200 patients will be available for this exploratory analysis . The correlation between S and percent necrosis in the resection specimen from the primary site of disease will be estimated. The correlation will be estimated treating the data as arising from a bivariate normal distribut ion. Any patient who completes I nduction chemotherapy without an analytic event, has S calculated and has the primary tumor site resected prior to the administ ration of primary site radiation treatment will be considered for this analysis. Of the 200 patients we expected will be available for the exploratory PET analysis described in the first paragraph of this section, we expect at least 50% of these individual s will also have resection of the primary disease site. With 100 patients, a test of size 0.10 of the null hypothesis of zero correlation between the results will be rejected with probability 0.80 if the true correlation is 0. 245 or greater.

A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_ applications/ctc.htm ). Additionally, toxicities are to be reported on the appropriate case report forms. Please note: 'CTCAE v4.0' is understood to represent the most current version of CTCAE v4.0 as referenced on the CTEP website (ie, v4.02 and all subse quent iterations prior to version 5.0). 10.2 Disease Assessment Requirements and Definitions See Section 7.0 for required disease staging at study entry, after initiation of protocol therapy, and during follow -up. 10.2.1 Definitions Evaluable for event -free survival : All eligible patients will be evaluable for the event -free survival primary endpoint from the time of randomization (intent -to- treat analysis). Evaluable for overall survival : All eligible patients will be evaluable for the overall survival secondary endpoint from the time of randomiz ation (intent -to-treat analysis). THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 131 Evaluable for bone marrow m etastatic disease response : Patients with morphologic evidence of Ewing sarcoma bone marrow involvement based on H&E stains at study entry will be will be evaluable for the bone marrow response secondary endpoint. In the absence of morphologic evidence of marrow involvement on H&E, patients with bone marrow involvement detected ONLY by flow cytometry, RT-PCR, or immunohistochemistry will not be considered to have clinical bone marrow involvement for the purposes of this study. Evaluable for toxicity : All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment with protocol therapy. 10.2.2 Event -free Survival The following will constitute an event for the purposes of the primary study endpoint: Death from any cause; Development of a second malignant neoplasm other than non -melanoma skin cancer (see Section 11 for reporting requirements); Disease progression according to Section 10.3 . 10.3 Disease Response Criteria Disease progression will be defined according to site of disease involvement and will be based upon local investigator assessment . Progression at any site of previous or existing disease involvement will constitute disease pr ogression. Development of disease involvement at a previously uninvolved site by imaging and/or biopsy will also constitute disease progression. 10.3.1 Disease Assessment of Primary Bone Tumors This study will use three -dimensional measurements of primary bone tumors (not metastatic bone lesions) rather than single dimension as used in RECIST. The value of 3D volume measurement has already been substantiated in several studies.113-115 Moreover, bone tumors are considered non -measurable according to RECIST guidelines. 10.3.1.1 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) MRI is the preferred imaging m odality for primary bone tumors. Axial images and at least one additional plane are acquired. At least two pulse sequences, such as T1, T2, and STIR images are obtained. Post -contrast images are obtained if appropriate. Measurements should be made using the same sequence best showing the tumor in follow up for comparisons. Only axial images will be used for measurement. The cranio -caudal diameter is represented by the distance between the most cranial and caudal slice positions plus one slice thickness (or [slice thickness + gap] x number of slices showing the tumor minus one gap distance). THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 132 -sectional imaging computed tomography (CT) All CT scans should be done with technical factors using the lowe st radiation exposure possible (ALARA principle). 2. CT slice thickness should be 5 mm or less. 3. The diameter of a \"measurable\" mass should be at least twice the reconstructed slice thickness. Smaller masses are considered detectable, but will be counted as \"non -measurable.\" 4. Edge -enhanced lung windows, liver, and bone windows should be photographed, if recorded in hard copies. Digital images are submitted either electronically or in CD using DICOM format. 10.3.1.3 The primary tumor will be measured in the largest anterior -posterior, transverse and longitudinal dimensions. Reporting of these three dimensions will be required. These dimensions will be used for central estimation of tumor volume using the formula for a prolate ellipsoid: volume in mm3= /6 (d 1\u00b7d2\u00b7d3) = (AP x transverse x longitudinal) x 0.5. Measurements should be obtained as described in the figure below. Z AXISWTA B C D ECOG GUIDELINE: TUMOR SIZE MEASUREMENT BASED ON CROSS- SECTIONAL IMAGING A, B, C, D, & E are contiguous parallel slices in the X-Y plane (usually axial) showing the tumor W and T are the maximal perpendicular diameters on the slice (C in this example) showing the largest surface area Tumor length in the Z-axis (L) (perpendicular to X-Y plane) can be obtained either by the [a] (difference in table position of the first and last slices showing the tumor plusone slice thickness), or [b] the product of ([slice thickness + gap] and the number of slices showing the tumor) minusone gapdistance WHO criteria: TxWis used RECIST: the larger of the two (T & W) is used (W in this example) Elliptical model volume=0.5 LxWxT The same modality and measurement method used in the initial imaging should be used in follow upsX-Y PLANE L 10.3.1.4 Response of the Primary tumor Based on previously published data correlating tridimensional measurements to bi -directional and unidirectional measurements the following response criteria for the primary tumor will be used116: THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 133 Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of the tumor. Partial Response (PR): At least 64% decrease in volume compared to the baseline. Progressive Disease (PD): At least 40% increase in tumor volume compared to the smallest measurement obtained since the beginning of therapy. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qual ify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as reference the smallest disease measurement since the treatment started. 10.3.2 Disease Assessment of Soft Tissue Primary Tumors and Metastatic Lesions Assessment of soft tissue primary tumors and soft tissue metastatic lesions (including lung and node metastasis) will follow revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1)117 Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria. Measurable disease: Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as 20 mm by chest x -ray, as 10 mm with CT scan, or 10 mm with calipers by clinical exam. All tumor measurements must be recorded in milli meters (or decimal fractions of centimeters). Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be considered measurable. Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. Non-measurable disease: All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest d iameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with 10 to < 15 mm short axis), are considered non -measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, a nd abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non -measurable. Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non - measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts. 'Cystic lesions' thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the s ame patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 134 Target lesions: All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of th eir size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itsel f to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculate d and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the m easurable dimension of the disease. Non-target lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measur ements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up. 10.3.2.1 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Soft Tissue Disease All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam. Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (eg, skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (eg, skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. Chest x -ray: Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT is preferable. Conventional CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assu mption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (eg, for body scans). THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 135 MRI is wi dely available, has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution and should be used as the modality of choice for staging of most primary tumors, except some chest wall tumors. MRI is also evolving as a radiation -free imaging modality for whole bod y staging. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed with breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible. PET-CT: Modern PET/CT scanners allow one to obtai n a diagnostic, low dose CT scan, which can be both used for diagnostic purposes and for attenuation correction of PET data. In addition to reconstructing the whole body CT data in a soft tissue algorithm, the chest CT scan should be reconstructed in the l ung algorithm. Most sites would be expected to be able to obtain such a combined scan in order to avoid duplicate irradiation of the patient. If a diagnostic CT (with IV contrast) is acquired as part of a PET -CT, then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be us ed for evaluation of pulmonary nodules and RECIST measurements. However, some centers with older scanners may not be able to generate diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements and may have to obtain an additional, diagnostic CT scan on a sep arate CT scanner as a separate imaging procedure, and use this scan for RECIST measurements. This would be considered suboptimal based on ALARA guidelines. Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a meth od of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one asses sment to the next. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances. Endoscopy, Laparoscop y: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. Cytology, Histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 136 between partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (eg, residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandat ory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease. FDG -PET: While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FD G-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG - PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm: a. Negative FDG -PET at a site at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is concerning for progressive disease based on development of a new lesion. For the purposes of this study, confirmatory imaging with CT scan or MRI scan is required. Biopsy is strongly encouraged, but not required to confirm new site of bone metastasis. See Section 15.0 for submission of biopsy material at time of relapse in patients consenting to correlative biology studies. b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up: If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, MRI or biopsy, this is progressive disease. If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, MRI, or biopsy, additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan). If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD. c. FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring. The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and supported by disease -specific medical literature for the indication. However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. 10.3.2.2 Evaluation of Target Soft Tissue Lesions Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions. Any THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 137 pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm. Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Progressive Disease (PD) :At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression). Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. 10.3.2.3 Evaluation of Non -Target Soft Tissue Lesions Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non - pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis). Note: If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivoc al progression of existing non -target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase. Although a clear progression of \"non -target\" lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator). 10.3.2.4 Evaluation of Be st Overall Response for Soft Tissue Lesions The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since t he treatment started). THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 138 For Patients with Measurable Disease (ie, Target Disease) Target Lesions Non-Target Lesions New Lesions Overall Response CR CR No CR CR Non-CR/Non - PD No PR CR Not evaluated No PR PR Non-CR/Non - PD/not evaluated No PR SD Non-CR/Non - PD/not evaluated No SD PD Any Yes or No PD Any PD Yes or No PD Any Any Yes PD For Patients with Non -Measurable Disease (ie, Non -Target Disease) Non-Target Lesions New Lesions Overall Response CR No CR Non-CR/non -PD No Non-CR/non -PD* Not all evaluated No not evaluated Unequivocal PD Yes or No PD Any Yes PD * 'Non -PD' is preferred over 'stable disease' for non -target disease since SD is increasingly used as an endpoint for assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be measured is not advised 10.3.3 Disease Assessment of Bone Metastases Radiographic assessment of bone metastasis can be difficult as remodeling bone may lead to residual abnormalities on bone scan, CT scan, and MRI scan. For the purposes of the current protocol, response at bone metastasis will be graded as follows: Complete response (CR) = FDG -PET negative at all previous sites of bone metastasis. Progressive disease (PD) = Any of the follow ing will constitute PD: Development of new bone metastasis at a previously uninvolved site. FDG - PET imaging may NOT be the only study to document development of a new bone metastasis. Confirmatory imaging with bone scan, CT scan, or MRI scan is required. B iopsy is strongly encouraged, but not required to confirm new site of bone metastasis. See Section 15.0 for submission of biopsy material at time of relapse in patients consenting to correlative biology studies. Development of a new soft tissue mass 1 cm in maximum axial dimension at a previous site of bone metastasis without a soft tissue component or with a soft tissue component < 1 cm in maximum axial dimension on previous evaluations. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 139 For bone metastasis with a soft tissue component 1 cm in maximum axial dimension on previous evaluations, an increase in the longest axial diameter of the soft tissue component by > 20%. A previous bone metastasis that was positive on FDG -PET, became negative with protocol th erapy, and then becomes positive again should prompt concern for progression at that site. Confirmatory testing is required to document progression at a previous site of bone metastasis. Together with return of FDG - PET uptake, MRI scan with documentation o f an enhancing bone lesion will constitute adequate evidence to support progression at that site. Biopsy is strongly encouraged, but not required to confirm progression at a previous site of bone metastasis. See Section 15.0 for submission of biopsy material at time of relapse in patients consenting to correlative biology studies. Biopsy evidence of viable Ewing sarcoma at a previously radiated bone metastasis , at least 8 weeks after completion of treatment . Stable disease (SD) = Patients not meeting either CR or PD criteria. 10.3.4 Disease Assessment of Bone Marrow Metastatic Disease Since disease involvement can be patchy, bilateral bone marrow aspirates and biopsies are recommended for assessing bone marr ow metastatic involvement. Bone marrow metastatic status is based solely on standard morphologic review of H&E stained bone marrow aspirate and biopsy material. For the purposes of this study, flow cytometry, FISH, RT-PCR for EWSR1 fusion transcripts, and immunohistochemistry for CD99 are considered investigational for assessing bone marrow metastatic status. The suggested approach for p atients with large pelvic tumors in which a posterior iliac crest bone marrow biopsy would track through the tumor is to instead undergo two marrow biopsies on the contralateral side (either two posterior biopsies or one posterior and one anterior biopsy). Bone marrow metastatic response will be graded as follows: Complete response (CR) = No morphologic evidence of Ewing sarcoma Progressive disease (PD) = Development of new marrow involvement in a patient without previous marrow involvement or in a patie nt who had previously achieved bone marrow CR. For patients in the latter category with < 10% bone marrow involvement, a confirmatory biopsy should be performed 2 -4 weeks after initial biopsy showing recurrent marrow involvement. Stable disease (SD) = Pat ients not meeting either CR or PD criteria. 10.4 Demonstration of Residual Viable Tumor In addition to the above definitions of disease progression, the following criteria will constitute failure of protocol therapy to clear disease sufficiently at benc hmark timepoints for the patient to continue on protocol therapy. Patients meeting these criteria will be THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 140 considered to have had an analytic event for the purposes of the primary study endpoint, even in the absence of disease progression as defined above. 10.4. 1 Residual bone marrow metastatic disease by end -Consolidation Patients who have not achieve a bone marrow CR as defined in Section 10.3.4 by the end of the Consolidation phase of therapy will constitute failure of protocol therapy to eradicate disease and patients will be removed from protocol therapy at that time. 10.4. 2 Biopsy -proven residual tumor at any site after completion of Metasta tic Site Radiation Phase Patients with biopsy proven residual Ewing sarcoma following completion of the Metastatic Site Radiation phase of therapy and at least 8 weeks after completion of radiation treatment (if applicable) will constitute failure of proto col therapy to eradicate disease and patients will be removed from protocol therapy at that time. Biopsy is not mandated or recommended at this timepoint. Note that this criterion applies to patients in both Regimen A and Regimen B. This criterion also app lies to radiated sites or non -radiated sites. This criterion applies to primary tumor sites and metastatic sites. 11.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 11.1 Purpose Adverse event (AE) data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies using similar agents. Certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to allow for timelier monitoring of patient safety and care. The following sections provide information about expedited reporting. 11.2 Determination of reporting requirements Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient has received an investi gational or commercial agent ; 2) the characteristics of the adverse event including the grade (severity), the relationship to the study therapy (attribution), and the prior experience (expectedness) of the adverse event; 3) the Phase (1, 2, or 3) of the trial; and 4) whether or not hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization was associated with the event. An investigational agent is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New Drug Application (IND). In some instances, the investigatio nal agent may be available commercially, but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved package label. Commercial agents are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from a commercial source. The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, may on some occasions distribute commercial agents for a trial. When a study includes both investigational and commercial agents, the following rules apply. Concurrent administration : When an investigational agent is used in combination THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 141 with a commercial agent, the combination is considered to be investigational and expedited reporting of adverse events would follow the guidelines for investigational agents. Sequential administration : When a study includes an investigational agent and a commercial agent on the same study arm, but the commercial agent is given for a period of time prior to starting the investigational agent, expedited reporting of adverse events which occur prior to sta rting the investigational agent would follow the guidelines for commercial agents. Once therapy with the investigational agent is initiated, all expedited reporting of adverse events follow the investigational agent reporting guidelines. 11.3 Expedited Re porting Requirements - Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) To ensure compliance with these regulations/this guidance, as IND/IDE sponsor, NCI requires that AEs be submitted according to the timeframes in the AE reporting tables assigned to the protocol, using th e NCI's CTEP Adverse Event Reporting System ( CTEP - AERS ). Any AE that is serious qualifies for expedited reporting . An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. A S erious Adverse Event (SAE) is any adverse drug event (experience) occurring at any dose that results in ANY of the following outcomes: 1) Death. 2) A life -threatening adverse drug experience. 3) An adverse event resulting in inpatient hospitalization or p rolongation of existing hospitalization (for 24 hours). This does not include hospitalizations which are part of routine medical practice. 4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions . 5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardi ze the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 11.4 Special Situations for Expedited Reporting 11.4.1 SAEs Occurring More than 30 Days After Last Dose of Study Drug Any Serious Adverse Event that occurs more than 30 days after the last administration of the investigational agent/intervention and has an attribution of a possible, probable, or definite relationship to the study therapy must be reported according to the CTEP -AERS reporting tables in this protocol. 11.4.2 Persistent or Significant Disabilities/Incapacities Any AE that results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions (formerly referred to as disabilities), congenital anomalies or birth defects, must be reported via CTEP -AERS if it occurs at any time following treatment with an agent under a NCI IND/IDE since these are considered to be serious AEs THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 142 11.4.3 Death Reportable Categories of Death Death attributable to a CTCAE term. Death Neonatal: Newborn death occurring during the first 28 days after birth . Sudden Death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5. Death NOS: A cessation of life that canno t be attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5. Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 \"Disease progression \" in the system organ class (SOC) \" General disorders and administration site conditions \". Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease ( e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should be submitted. Any death occurring within 30 days of the last dose, regard less of attribution to the investigational agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within 24 hours. Any death occurring greater than 30 days after the last dose of the investigational agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within 24 hours only if it is possibly, probably, or definitely related to the investigational agent/intervention. 11.4.4 Secondary Malignancy A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous malignancy (eg, treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A metastasis of the initial neoplasm is not considered a secondary malignancy. The NCI requires all secondary ma lignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP -AERS . Three options are available to describe the event: Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy Myelodysplastic syndrome Treatment related secondary m alignancy Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) must also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in this protocol. 11.4.5 Second Malignancy A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require ONLY routine reporting via CDUS unless otherwise specified. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 143 11.4. 6 Pregnancy, Pregnancy Loss , and Death Neonatal NOTE : When submitting for \"Pregnancy\", \"Pregnancy loss\", or Information Form, available at http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/Pregna ncyReportForm.pdf , needs to be completed and faxed along with any additional medical information to (301) 897 -7404 . The potential risk of exposure of the fetus to the investigational agent(s) or chemotherapy agent(s) should be documented in the \"Description of Event\" section of the CTEP -AERS report. 11.4. 6.1 Pregnancy Patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure of the fetus to agents which may be teratogenic. For this reason, pregnancy needs to be reported in an expedited manner via CTEP - AERS as Grade 3 \"Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal condition s - Other (pregnancy )\" under the \"Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions \" SOC. There is a possibility that the sperm of male patients treated on studies involving possible teratogenic agents may have been damaged. For this reason, pregnancy in par tners of men on study needs be reported and followed in the same manner as a patient pregnancy . Pregnancy needs to be followed until the outcome is known . If the baby is born with a birth defect or anomaly, then a second CTEP -AERS report is required. 11.4.6.2 Pregnancy Loss ( Fetal Death ) Pregnancy loss is defined in CTCAE as \" Death in utero .\" Any pregnancy loss should be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 \"Pregnancy loss \" under the \"Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions \" SOC . Do NOT report a pregnancy loss as a Grade 5 event since CTEP -AERS recognizes any Grade 5 event as a patient death. 11.4. 6.3 Death Neonatal Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as \"Newborn death occurring during the first 28 days after birth \", should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4, \" Death neonatal \" under the \" General disorders and administration \" SOC, when the death is the result of a patient pregnancy or pregnancy in partners of men on study . Do NOT report a neonatal death resulting fro m a patient pregnancy or pregnancy in partners of men on study as a Grade 5 event since CTEP -AERS recognizes any Grade 5 event as a patient death. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 144 11.5 Reporting Requirements for Specialized AEs 11.5.1 Baseline AEs Although a pertinent positive finding identified on baseline assessment is not an AE, when possible it is to be documented as \"Course Zero\" using CTCAE terminology and grade. An expedited AE report is not required if a patient is entered on a protocol with a pre -existing condition (eg, elevate d laboratory value, diarrhea). The baseline AE must be re -assessed throughout the study and reported if it fulfills expedited AE reporting guidelines. a. If the pre -existing condition worsens in severity, the investigator must reassess the event to determ ine if an expedited report is required. b. If the AE resolves and then recurs, the investigator must re -assess the event to determine if an expedited report is required. c. No modification in grading is to be made to account for abnormalities existing at baseline. 11.5.2 Persistent AEs A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution between treatment cycles/courses. ROUTINE reporting: The AE must be reported only once unless the grade becomes more severe in a subsequent c ourse. If the grade becomes more severe the AE must be reported again with the new grade. EXPEDITED reporting: The AE must be reported only once unless the grade becomes more severe in the same or a subsequent course. 11.5.3 Recurrent AEs A recurrent AE i s one that occurs and resolves during a cycle/course of therapy and then reoccurs in a later cycle/course. ROUTINE reporting: An AE that resolves and then recurs during a subsequent cycle/course must be reported by the routine procedures. EXPEDITED reporti ng: An AE that resolves and then recurs during subsequent cycle/course does not require CTEP -AERS reporting unless: 1) The grade increases OR 2) Hospitalization is associated with the recurring AE. 11.6 Exceptions to Expedited Reporting 11.6.1 Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER) SPEER: Is a subset of AEs within the Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks (CAEPR) that contains a list of events that are considered expected for CTEP -AERS reporting purposes. (Formerly referre d to as the Agent Specific Adverse Event List (ASAEL).) AEs listed on the SPEER should be reported expeditiously by investigators to the NCI via CTEP -AERS ONLY if they exceed the grade of the event listed in parentheses after the event. If the CAEPR is p art of a combination IND using multiple investigational agents and has an SAE listed on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is required. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 145 11.6.2 Special Situations as Exceptions to Expedited Reporting An expedited report may not be required for a specific protocol where an AE is listed as expected. The exception or acceptable reporting procedures will be specified in the protocol. The protocol specific guidelines supersede the NCI Adverse Event Reportin g Guidelines. These special situations are listed under the CTEP -AERS reporting Table A for this protocol. 11.7 Reporting Requirements - Investigator Responsibility Clinical investigators in the treating institutions and ultimately the Study Chair have the primary responsibility for AE identification, documentation, grading, and assignment of attribution to the investigational agent/intervention. It is the responsibil ity of the treating physician to supply the medical documentation needed to support the expedited AE reports in a timely manner. Note: All expedited AEs (reported via CTEP -AERS ) must also be reported via routine reporting. Routine reporting is accomplish ed via the Adverse Event (AE) Case Report Form (CRF) within the study database. 11.8 General Instructions for Expedited Reporting via CTEP -AERS The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE) version 5.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . An expedited AE report for all studies utilizing agents under an NCI IND/IDE must be submitted electronically to NCI via CTEP -AERS at: https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers In the rare situation where Internet connectivity is disrupted, the 24 -hour notification is to be made to the NCI for agents supplied under a CTEP IND by telephone call to 301 -897- 7497. In addition, once Int ernet connectivity is restored, a 24 -hour notification that was phoned in must be entered into the electronic CTEP -AERS system by the original submitter of the report at the site. Expedited AE reporting timelines are defined as: o 24-Hour; 5 Calendar Days - The AE must initially be reported via CTEP - AERS within 24 hours of learning of the event, followed by a complete expedited report within 5 calendar days of the initial 24 -hour report. o 7 Calendar Days - A complete expedited report on the AE must be submit ted within 7 calendar days of the investigator learning of the event. Any event that results in a persistent or significant incapacity/substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an IME, which based upon the medical judgment of the investigator may jeopardize the patient and require intervention to prevent a serious AE, must be reported via CTEP -AERS if the event occurs following investigational agent administration. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 146 Any death occurring within 30 days of the last dose, regardless of attribution to an agent/intervention under an NCI IND/IDE requires expedited reporting within 24 hours . Any death occurring greater than 30 days of the last dose with an attribution of possible, probable, or definite to an agent/intervention under an NCI IND/IDE requires expedited reporting within 24 hours . CTEP -AERS Medical Reporting includes the following requirements as part of the report: 1) whether the patient has received at least one dose of an investigational agent on this study; 2) the characteristics of the adverse event including the grade (severity), the relationship to the study therapy (attribution), and the prior experience (expectedness) of the adverse event; 3) the Phase (1, 2, or 3) of the trial; and 4) wh ether or not hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization was associated with the event. Any medical documentation supporting an expedited report (eg, H & P, admission and/or notes, consultations, ECG results, etc.) MUST be faxed within 48 -72 hours to the NCI. NOTE: English is required for supporting documentation submitted to the numbers listed below in order for the NCI to meet the regulatory reporting timelines. Fax supporting documentation for AEs related to investigational agents supplied und er a CTEP IND to: (301) 897 -7404 .

A submission schedule is included. 12.1 CDUS This study will be monitored by the Clinical Data Update System (CDUS). Cumulative CDUS data will be submitted quarterly to CTEP by electronic means. Reports are due January 31, April 30, July 31 and October 31. This is not a responsibility of institutions participating in this trial. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 150 12.2 Data and Safety Monitoring Committee To protect the interests of patients and the scientific integrity for all cli nical trial research by the Children's Oncology Group, the COG Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) reviews reports of interim analyses of study toxicity and outcomes prepared by the study statistician, in conjunction with the study chair's report. The DSMC may recommend the study be modified or terminated based on these analyses. Toxicity monitoring is also the responsibility of the study committee and any unexpected frequency of serious events on the trial are to be brought to the attention of th e DSMC. The study statistician is responsible for the monitoring of the interim results and is expected to request DSMC review of any protocol issues s/he feels require special review. Any COG member may bring specific study concerns to the attention of th e DSMC. The DSMC approves major study modifications proposed by the study committee prior to implementation (eg, termination, dropping an arm based on toxicity results or other trials reported, increasing target sample size, etc.). The DSMC determines wh ether and to whom outcome results may be released prior to the release of study results at the time specified in the protocol document. 12.3 CRADA/CTA NCI/DCTD Standard Language to Be Incorporated into All Protocols Involving Agent(s) Covered by a Clinical Trials Agreement (CTA), a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) or a Clinical Supply Agreement, hereinafter referred to as Collaborative Agreement: The agent(s) supplied by CTEP, DCTD, NCI used in this protocol is/are provided to the NCI under a Collaborative Agreement (CRADA, CTA, CSA) between the Pharmaceutical Company(ies) (hereinafter referred to as \"Collaborator(s)\") and the NCI Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis.

Minor unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy and/or disease evaluat ions (and up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family logistical, or facility, procedure and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable (except where explicitly prohibited within the protocol). COG member institutions are encouraged to enroll patients on a specimen collection study (such as AEWS07B1 or APEC14B1 ). In addition, patients are encouraged to participate in the embedded correlative biology studies in this trial (see Section 15.0 ). Submission of material from initial tumor biopsy is required for participation in this study and this requirement should be considered when planning the initial biopsy. Surgeons, treating team and pathologists should rev iew specimen requirements for tissue collection and handling for these studies prior to biopsy and definitive surgery. 13.1 Surgical Guidelines for Biopsy 13.1.1 Technique Open, incisional biopsy of the primary is recommended to allow procurement of enough tissue for all biologic studies. Consultation with a surgical and/or orthopedic oncologist prior to open or needle biopsy is strongly recommended as the approach used for the initial biopsy may impact the future surgical approach. A move to performing open biopsy may be against the current practice in many institutions where a needle biopsy provides adequate tissue for diagnosis. Biologic studies are becoming increasingly important and may lead to changes in therapeutic approach. Multiple passes with a needle may not provide enough aggregate tissue for all of the studies currently done. A minimum of 1 cubic centimeter of tissue is required for special studies. An additiona l amount of fresh tissue must be obtained for diagnostic studies. Most children require a general anesthetic for needle biopsy, and often a venous access device can be inserted at the time of biopsy. Changing the practice to doing open biopsies therefore s hould not result in increased morbidity for the patients. In most instances the diagnosis can be made from the surrounding involved soft tissues avoiding the need for obtaining bone. Creation of a bone defect during biopsy significantly weakens the bone thus increasing the risk of pathologic fracture. This risk is markedly increased if radiotherapy is later given as the definitive local therapy. A bone biopsy will also preclude the possibility of performing a frozen section to determine the adequacy of ma terial for diagnosis. 13.1.2 Specimen Quality Biopsy material should be sent to pathology in a fresh state in normal saline or tissue culture medium. Ewing sarcomas are often necrotic, therefore intra - operative frozen section or touch preparations should be done to be certain that the tissue obtained is adequate and sufficient for diagnosis. It is strongly recommended THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 153 that adequate tissue be obtained for biologic studies (AEWS07B1 and Section 15.0 of the current tri al). The specimen should be handled in an expeditious manner and not left on the back table for more than a few minutes as substantial degradation begins immediately ex vivo.118 13.1.3 Specimen Quantity and Handling Proper handling of biopsy tissue requires kn owledge of the objectives to be studied. A minimum of 3-5 grams of fresh, viable, non -necrotic tumor tissue should be sent immediately to the Pathology Department. Material must be obtained for multiple analyses (routine histopathology, cytology, touch preparations, electron microscopy, tissue culture, flow cytometry, cytogenetics, etc.) to permit full evaluation for diagnosis and cancer biology studies. 13.1.4 Therapeutic Considerations Future surgical excision and radiation therapy must be borne in mind during the biopsy. Imaging, in particular MRI, should be obtained prior to biopsy. Principles of biopsy should be followed. These include: longitudinal incisions; the ability to remove the biopsy tract with the lesion at the time of surgical excision; avoi dance of neurovascular structures; and a direct route to the tumor through muscles rather than retracting them. If appropriate management of the tumor requires a compartmental resection, one should be able to proceed after biopsy and neoadjuvant chemothera py without significantly extending the margins beyond those previously planned. If one is unfamiliar with the suspected extension of the lesion and the three dimensional compartmental anatomy of the extremity, a simple error on incision orientation and pla cement or injudicious exposure of a major neurovascular structure could result in the need for amputation. Postoperative hematoma formation can render a previously resectable lesion unresectable. Techniques that will diminish the likelihood of hematoma for mation and dissection could include the use of a tourniquet (after gravity exsanguination), thrombogenic agents (activated a hemostatic subarticular closure. The tourniquet if used at all should be deflated prior to closure in order to assure absolute hemostasis. Anatomic structures and planes dissected by hematoma should be considered contaminated and may have to be included in the subsequent definitive surgical margins. If a drain is left in place, it should exit in line wi th the longitudinal biopsy incision and close to the margin of the incision. 13.1.5 Regional Lymph Node Evaluation Soft tissue Ewing sarcoma has higher rates of regional lymph node involvement compared to bone Ewing sarcoma. For patients with soft tissue primary tumors, clinical and imaging evaluation of regional lymph nodes must be performed before therapy begins. Pathologic evaluation of clinically suspicious nodes in patients with bone or soft tissue primary tumors should be performed. Regional node debulking or resection is not recommended. Open biopsy of the involved node is recommended, but needle biopsy or fine needle aspiration may be appropriate based on the surgeon's judgment and pathologist's recommendations. Sentinel node techniques may be used if lymph node sampling is planned. 13.2 Surgical Guidelines for Consideration of Amputation at Diagnosis While the role of amputation in the management of the extremity primary in Ewing sarcoma is controversial, in certain clinical situations amputation may be the best THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 154 alternative. In compliance with the objectives of the study, if necessary, amputation should be done after the completion of neo -adjuvant chemotherapy. In the case of pathologic fracture, in most instances it is preferable to attempt to spl int, cast or brace the extremity for the Induction neo -adjuvant phase of chemotherapy before resorting to amputation. Large destructive lower extremity lesions in children less than the age of 10, where considerable limb length inequality will be anticipat ed, may be the best managed by amputation though definitive radiotherapy remains a viable option, particularly in this high-risk patient population. Consultation with an experienced orthopedic or surgical oncologist is encouraged, because newer methods of limb length equalization, the use of growth plate sparing operations (especially for diaphyseal lesions) and \"expandable\" prosthesis may make amputation unnecessary. 13.3 Surgical Guidelines for Primary Bone Lesions Tumors arising in the extremities are usually situated in recognized anatomical compartments.119,120 Utilizing standard radiographic techniques (e.g., plain films, bone scan, MRI and at times CT or CT angiography), the precise anatomic location of the lesion should be defined prior to biopsy and the studies repeated prior to resection. Furthermore, the extent of the lesions is usually dramatically reduced following Induction chemotherapy, rendering lesions that are huge at diagnosis smaller and more \"resectable\" after chemotherapy. A surgical staging system for extremity musculoskeletal sarcomas which incorporates histopathological grading has been extensively tested and devised, whereby the histologic grade (high or low) and the extent of the disease (compartments invol ved, presence or absence of metastases) can be linked to the type of surgical procedure.121,122 The procedures are defined based upon the margins they achieve relative to the tumor and its pseudocapsule. In the setting of pre -operative chemotherapy t he aim of surgery should generally be to achieve a wide (R0) surgical margin of normal tissue around the lesion. The second surgical margin that may be acceptable is a marginal (R1) excision. In this surgery there are microscopically positive cells at the cut surface of the tumor which remain in the patient and must be treated by radiotherapy. The histologic response of the tumor to chemothera py is also important but there is no means of making this assessment prior to resection. For the purpose of this study, viable tumor at the cut surface of the specimen is considered a positive margin and requires radiotherapy. The plane of dissection sho uld be through non-inflamed, non -edematous tissue to avoid leaving tumor cells in this tumor reactive zone. Pre-resection consultation with a radiation oncologist is recommended, even if it seems likely a wide excision with a clear margin will be achieved. If a lesion is considered inoperable, that is, gross residual tumor would be left behind (an intralesional R2 excision), surgery should not be attempted. A partially removed tumor leaves the patient with a worse situation since full dose radiotherapy will be needed. The field size will be considerably larger since all of the surgical wound would have to be irra diated rather than the original tumor volume with a small margin. The post surgery tumor bed will be more anoxic rendering radiation less effective. 13.3. 1 Eligibility for Local Control Following Induction chemotherapy, patients will undergo disease rest aging according to Section 7 .0. It is recommended that all patients with a good clinical/radiologic response be considered for surgical resection with negative margins (i.e., \"de - THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 155 bulking\" R2 excision is not an acceptable term or procedure). If initial surgical excision is elected, using the criteria defined below, the procedure should be performed following recovery from Week 11 Induction chemotherapy and prior to Consolidation therapy. 13.4 Anatomic Guidelines for Resectability The choice of local treatment will be left to the treating physicians, and may include: radiation alone, radiation followed by resection, resection followed by radiation, or surgical resection alone. The trend for loca l management of Ewing sarcoma has changed recently toward surgical resection whenever possible for non -metastatic disease. The guidelines for determining \"resectability\" and \"adequate margins\" are still being defined and require considerable judgement on t he part of the entire treatment team. In general, the goal should be to remove the entire tumor and involved bone with a cuff of normal tissue around the tumor (a wide excision). Since the response of Ewing sarcoma to preoperative chemotherapy is often dra matic, the soft tissue extent of the tumor is frequently much less than at diagnosis. The exact thickness of the \"cuff\" of normal tissue oncologically \"safe\" (with respect to local recurrence) is not known, and probably depends upon the type of tissue form ing the cuff. Fascia, periosteum and intermuscular septae are good barriers to tumor spread. On the other hand, fat and muscle are relatively poor barriers and require a thicker cuff . If margins are deemed \"positive\" after review of the treatment team (see Section 4.3.1.2 ), or if there is intra -operative tumor spill or cut through, then post -operative radiotherapy is indicated. Otherwise wide surgical resection alone is the goal when feasible. The decision about whether a g iven patient is \"resectable\" should be made by the treatment team which should include an experienced orthopedic/surgical oncologist, radiation oncologist and oncologist. Consideration must be given at each site to the neurovascular structures, uninvolved muscles, the adjacent joint(s) and the growth centers. Not every tumor is resectable, nor should this necessarily be a goal. Experience and wisdom are needed to make this decision for an individual patient. Some specific guidelines by site are as follows: 13.4.1 Tibia Proximal tibial lesions must be evaluated for the status of the adjacent knee joint. If it is free of tumor involvement, an intra -articular resection may be employed, followed by reconstruction in using osteo -articular allografts or metallic prostheses. An estimation of growth remaining should be made and plans for limb length equalization considered. Lesions with joint involvement will require an extra -articular resection and reconstruction with an arthrodesis or metallic prosthesis or rotati onplasty. Tibial lesions of the diaphysis may be treated by resection and diaphyseal reconstruction using allograft bone, autografts or metallic spacers. If it is possible to preserve the joint and growth plates at either end, near normal function can be expected. The posterior neurovascular bundle is often protected by the deep posterior compartment muscles. Distal tibial lesions (supramalleolar) are probably best managed by definitive radiation. Rarely are lesions suitable for resection and intercalary reconstruction or ankle arthrodesis. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y 05/01/19 femoral lesions may be resected if there has been a good response to Induction chemotherapy. At times it is possible to preserve the femoral head and neck and perform an intercalary reconstruction . If an intra -articular resection is necessary, reconstruction with a metallic prosthesis, or allograft -prosthesis composite is indicated. Extra -articular resections can be achieved if the joint is involved and reconstruction carried out by means of an art hrodesis using allograft and/or autograft bone, or at times a modified total hip replacement or rotationplasty. Diaphyseal lesions are frequently resectable using the vastus intermedius as a muscle cuff around the tumor. Intercalary reconstructions with allograft, autografts or - metallic spacers are possible with good functional results if the adjacent joints and growth plates are possible to preserve. As in the tibia, if a growth plate must be sacrificed to achieve an adequate margi n, plans should be considered for limb length equalization after the completion of the drug protocol. Distal femoral lesions may be resected either as an intra -articular procedure or an extra -articular procedure (depending upon the analysis of the staging studies with regard to joint involvement) if the neurovascular bundle is free. Intra -articular resections can be reconstructed with osteoarticular allograft or metallic prostheses, whereas extra -articular resections will require arthrodesis, metallic pros theses or allograft prosthesis composites. In skeletally immature patients less than age of 10, or in those with strong athletic inclinations, a rotationplasty may be considered. 13.4.3 Bones of the Hands and Feet Lesions involving the digits, metacarpals , and metatarsals may be managed by ray amputation or resection, depending upon the degree of soft tissue and joint involvement following Induction chemotherapy. If surgically managed, the aim should be for complete resection with negative margins. Selecte d lesions may be managed by radiotherapy. Large destructive lesions of the hind portion of the foot may not be suited for either radiation or resection (due to the degree of destruction and lack of reconstruction options). Below -knee amputation is frequent ly the treatment of choice for these sites. 13.4.4 Fibula The proximal fibula can be resected if the response to Induction chemotherapy is good. Soft tissue involvement noted at operation may be more extensive than that anticipated by pre -operative stagin g studies, therefore one should plan to take a wide cuff of tissue around the lesion. Extra -articular excision of the proximal tibial fibular joint can be done if there is epiphyseal involvement. MRI is the best imaging study from which to judge the extent of bony and soft tissue involvement. Reconstruction is not necessary as long as the distal 6 -8 cm of fibula near the ankle can be preserved. The peroneal nerve may need to be sacrificed, but a posterior tibial tendon transfer or ankle foot orthosis compen sates for its loss reasonably well. In some cases the soft tissue extent mandates that the toe and foot extensor muscles be removed with the tumor. Attention to varys instability should also be assessed. If present, the surgeon should consider lateral coll ateral ligament reconstruction. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 157 Lesions involving the distal fibula may also be resected. Ideally, the lateral malleolus should be preserved, but if it is resected, adequate ankle function can be achieved by soft tissue reconstruction long term, bracing or, at times, an ankle arthrodesis. Occasionally a reconstruction is done with the uninvolved proximal fibular moved distally. 13.4.5 Ankle Region in the distal tibia, calcaneus and hindfoot a below knee amputation at the classical lev el is usually the best alternative (radiotherapy may be an alternative). Very small lesions might be managed by resection, but these are extremely unusual. 13.4.6 Pelvis The pelvis is one of the most difficult areas for surgical resection. All pelvic lesi ons should be carefully studied by MRI with or without CT (and, at times CT or MR angiography) at the completion of Induction chemotherapy to decide if a resection is possible. Smaller lesions limited to the iliac wing, ischium or pubis, with good response , should be resected. Surgical complication rates are high particularly when they follow high dose radiotherapy. In this patient population, surgical resection is generally not indicated after a patient has received definitive radiation. Delays in resumpti on of chemotherapy may contribute to the poor prognosis of pelvic Ewing tumors. Lesions confined exclusively to the iliac wing (Zone I) are generally resectable without imparting significant morbidity. The surgeon should reconstruct the abductor mechanis m as best as possible. Lesions in the periacetabular area (Zone II) require careful consideration. There are no good reconstruction options for a resection at this site. The decision will be individualized and require consultation with an experienced Orth opedic oncologist and radiotherapist, and full discussion of the local management options with the patient and his or her family. Possible reconstruction options include allografts (with or without hip joint prostheses), metallic implants, or arthrodesis ( ilio- femoral or ischio -femoral). Definitive radiation may be the best option in this population with metastatic disease. For pubo -ischial lesions (Zone III), the difficulty of resection depends on the extent of interior pubic -ischial involvement. Reconstru ction is generally not necessary. Pelvic lesions which cross the sacroiliac joint (Zone IV) to reach the sacrum also require careful consideration. Most of these lesions will be managed by radiation alone. The ability to perform a resection will depend up on the extent of the lesion within the sacrum and the expected neurologic deficits (including possible loss of bowel and bladder function) which would remain following a resection. A combined radiotherapy/surgical approach may be appropriate if the improve ment in disease control outweighs the functional loss. The role of complete hemipelvectomy (Zone I -III +/ -IV) for large \"unresectable\" lesions of the pelvis is unclear. In most instances it is to be avoided in favor of definitive radiotherapy. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 158 13.4.7 Spine Patients with symptoms of spinal cord compression should be considered for emergency radiotherapy (see Section 17.3.2 ). In many cases chemotherapy will relieve the cord compression and destabilizing laminectomies should be avoided. Surgical resection of primary lesions arising in the vertebrae may be indicated when there has been a good response to Induction chemotherapy . There are a variety of spine implants and bone grafts that are available for reconstruction following wide excision. Consultation could be made with a local orthopaedic spine surgeon. Radiation dose is limited at this site due to the sensitivity of the spinal cord. Special techniques can be used such as proton therapy (see Section 17.0), for protection of spinal cord and adjacent structures. The final decision regarding local management is ideally made after the response to Induction chemotherapy is assessed. It is expected that patients with vertebral and/or paraspinal tumors will most likely require radiation therapy. Before attempting local control with surgery only, the plan should be discussed with the treatm ent team. 13.4.8 Ribs Initial resection is strongly discouraged. Patients should receive Induction chemotherapy prior to resection. Defining the extent of the rib involvement is difficult due to the curvature of the chest wall. MRI is the best modality fo r documenting extent around the curvature of the chest. Consideration can be made to marking the extent of involvement by a metallic marker inserted at the margins with pre -operative CT. The rib with a cuff of surrounding normal tissue should be resected e n bloc. Generally the resection has included one normal rib above and one below the lesion. The depth of the resection should include at least the full thickness of the musculoskeletal chest wall with pleura, and wide resection of any areas of attachment t o underlying lung parenchyma, pericardium or diaphragm. More conservative procedures may also yield good oncologic results and eliminate a need of chest wall reconstruction. Half of the circumference o f the uninvolved rib above and below can be excised wit h all of the soft tissues on the adjacent upper and lower ribs. Limiting factors for effective resection are lesions encroaching on vertebrae, great vessels, and brachial plexus. Resection of posterior rib lesions may necessitate consultation with a surgeo n with expertise in spine / paraspinal surgery. Primary radiotherapy is an alternative to resection if resection is unreasonable, and post-operative radiotherapy is indicated if the margins are microscopic. If gross residual tumor is the expected outcom e, surgery should not be attempted. 13.4.9 Scapula Lesions presenting in the body of the scapula which do not invade the chest wall or glenoid can be resected without significant impairment of shoulder function. Primary lesions which involve the glenoid are possible to resect but reconstruction options are limited and there will be some loss of function (shoulder abduction active rotation strength). If the arm and brachial plexus can be preserved, resection may be attempted, even if it requires total scap ulectomy. Reconstruction options include soft tissue repairs and fascial or artificial ligament slings to stabilize the proximal humerus to the chest wall. Metallic prostheses for the scapula and allografts have been attempted, but the functional results a re as yet not well established. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version 05/01/19 Medial One -fifth of Clavicle Most lesions of this site are resectable if there is a reasonable response to pre - operative chemotherapy, but there is risk to the underlying normal structures in this area. Great care must be exercised regarding the heart, great vessels, trachea, esophagus, pleura and nerves. No reconstruction is necessary. 13.4.11 Clavicle (Lateral four -fifths) A surgical resection should be considered unless this is precluded by the extent of the soft tissue involvement. The clavicle can be readily resected without appreciable loss of function. 13.4.12 Humerus The proximal one third of the humerus may be resected in either an intra or extra - articular fashion, along with surrounding soft t issues (deltoid). A reduction in abduction arc and power is almost a certainty. Reconstructions employing allografts or vascularized fibula grafts cuff) or as osteoarticular impl ants (if the rotator cuff can be preserved at time of an intra -articular resection), or employing metallic implants are possible. Clavicula pro humero is also an attractive and viable option. The diaphyseal region of the humerus frequently lends itself to resection if the adjacent shoulder and elbow joint can be preserved and the neurovascular structures are free. Reconstruction of the intercalary defect with allograft or VFG autograft bone, or metallic implants is possible and offer excellent functional results. The distal humerus (elbow) is a rare site of occurrence, and decisions relative to resection will depend on the size of the lesion and its relationship to the adjacent neurovascular structures. Reconstructions at this site are not commonly performed and require innovation depending upon the exact clinical situation. Radiotherapy may be a superior option at this site. 13.4.13 Radius and Ulna Small lesions localized to one of the two bones may be considered for resection if there has been a go od response to chemotherapy. Lesions which lend themselves to intercalary resections of one of the bones are ideal, as are lesions of the distal ulna which can be sacrificed without reconstruction. The distal radius can be resected as well, and reconstruct ed with auto - or allografts to re -create the radiocarpal joint or to establish an arthrodesis. Radiotherapy is an alternative. 13.4.14 Wrist Fortunately, tumors arising in the small bones of the carpus are rare. Small well - localized lesions may be managed by radiation or resection; however, a below elbow amputation may be required. 13.4.15 Skull and Mandible Tumors in these locations are beyond the scope of these guidelines. Consultation with a surgical oncologist or neurosurgeon experienced in tum ors of these sites should be made. Resections are sometimes feasible, again with the aim of complete tumor excision with negative margins, but radiotherapy is usually required alone or as an adjunct for tumors in these locations. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 160 13.4.16 Soft Tissue Ewing /PNET In general, soft tissue lesions should be staged and treated along the same guidelines as those for bone tumors. At the completion of Induction chemotherapy, the site of the primary tumor should be re -imaged, usually with MRI scan. In most cases, a n enbloc resection of the lesion, the biopsy tract and a cuff of normal tissue surrounding the lesion en bloc should be attempted. If the lesion is adjacent to a major neurovascular structure or bone, definitive radiotherapy may be the best option. It is n ot necessary to resect the entire muscle compartment of involvement if the staging studies indicate lesser involvement, but in all cases the goal should be to achieve a wide or marginal excision as defined by Enneking.121,122 Once transected a muscle is non -functional so generous margins of the muscle can be removed with the tumor. If the adjacent bone is clearly involved by tumor, trea tment principles for bone tumors should be employed. In most cases, lesions adjacent to bone with no recognizable involvement by CT or MRI can be resected without removing the bone; periosteum should be taken as a margin in these cases. When postoperative radiation therapy is required, the denuded bone is more susceptible to late pathologic fracture. Major nerves should be preserved when feasible. If they are directly involved by tumor, a combined radiotherapy and surgical approach or radiation alone may b e necessary. Similar guidelines apply to major vascular structures, but resection with vascular reconstruction is an alternative for involved vessels. Most major muscle groups can be sacrificed without much loss in function. Local muscle transfers to rest ore function, achieve soft tissue coverage or to prevent dead space are sometimes necessary either at the time of resection or at completion of therapy. Some surgeons recommend tendon transfers at the time of resection. 13.5 Resection of Residual Lung Met astases The role of resection of residual lung metastasis remains unclear in Ewing sarcoma. In general, lung metastases resolve completely duri ng the course of chemotherapy. Resection of lung metastases remaining at the completion of Conso lidation therapy is allowable. If performed, resection should take place prior to planned whole lung radi otherapy. See Section 15 .0 for submission of resection specimens for correlative biology studies. 14.0 PATHOLOGY GUIDELINES AND SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Central pathology review will not be done. Submission of specimens for required and optional correlative biology studies is detailed in Section 15.0 . Submission of tumor material from initial biopsy is required for study participation and this requirement should be considered in planning biopsy and tissue triage. COG member institutions are also encouraged to enroll patients on a Ewing sarcoma specimen collection study , such as AEWS07B1 or APEC14B1 . Please see the specimen collection study for directions for specimen preparation and shipment. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 161 14.1 Biopsy Specimen Gross Surgeons and interventional radiologists should be encouraged to send fresh tissue from all biopsy proce dures. Every effort should be made to obtain viable, undistorted tissue for study. Fixation and processing in a manner with which the laboratory routinely obtains good results (e.g., 10% neutral buffered formalin) is satisfactory. Whenever the amount of t issue is sufficient, fresh and frozen tissue should be obtained for cytogenetics and diagnostic biologic studies. A 1 mm slice from the cut surface of the tumor should be placed in buffered glutaraldehyde or other electron microscopy (EM) fixative and save d or processed for electron microscopy, if sufficient tissue is present. Touch preparations should be made for cytologic screening. Institutions are strongly encouraged to perform cytogenetics on fresh specimens when sufficient tissue is available and when this service is available. Microscopy The tumor must have a light microscopic appearance [by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining] consistent with tumor [Ewing sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET)] of bone or soft tiss ue. In addition, there should be no immunohistochemical or ultrastructural evidence suggesting lymphoma or another sarcoma such as rhabdomyosarcoma. Immunohistochemistry In addition to routine H&E staining, it is recommended that institutional pathologists perform immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a panel of antibodies to aid in the diagnosis and exclude entities other than Ewing sarcoma/PNET. A suggested panel would includ e: CD99 (MIC2, (desmin, muscle -specific actin, myogenin lymphoid antigens ( CD45, TdT, and additional B and T cell ma rkers); and other exclusionary antibodies as indicated by a particular case. While CD99 (MIC2; 12E7, O13) positivity suggests Ewing sarcoma/PNET, CD99 positivity is not sufficient for a diagnosis Ewing sarcoma/PNET, as lymphomas, synovial sarcoma, and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, among other tumors, may express this antigen. 14.2 Molecular and Cytogenetic Studies for Initial Diagnosis Molecular studies The most common cytogenetic abnormalities in EWS/PNET include t(11;22) and t(21;22); other, less common translocations have also been described. It is strongly recommended that tissue be obtained for molecular biologic study of these and other abnormalities by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR) and/or fluorescence in situ hybridi zation (FISH) using probes for the involved regions of chromosomes 11, 21, and 22. Evidence of an EWS rearrangement consistent with a Ewing family tumor may be used as supporting evidence for a Ewing sarcoma/PNET diagnosis. Cytogenetic Studies THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 162 If sufficie nt tumor is available after submission of tumor for molecular studies, it is suggested that tumor cytogenetics be done at the home institution, if available. Fresh, sterile, unfixed tumor tissue should be submitted as specified by the local institution's c ytogenetics laboratory. 14.3 Specimen from Surgical Resection Gross Resection margins must be marked with India ink or other color indicator. Description of the specimen, including measurements, should be recorded. Gross assessment of the completeness of resection should be made. A specimen radiograph (when facilities are available) should be made prior to taking sections. A single slice through the largest axis of the tumor should be fixed, decalcified if necessary, and entirely submitted for processing, with the location of blocks clearly marked on a photograph or diagram of the gross specimen. These sections will then be used for assessment of histologic response to chemotherapy. Additional sections of primary tumor, extraosseous tumor, any grossly or radiographically abnormal areas and margins of bone and/or soft tissue should be obtained. If viable tumor is grossly recognizable, obtain tissue for cytogenetics, flow cytometry, biologic studies, and EM as described in Section 14.1 . 14.3.1 Surgical margins Completeness of resection and the status of the margins should be assessed. A positive margin will be any margin in which either viable tumor or tumor displaying coagulative necrosis is present at the inked surface. The presence of bland scar or loose fibrous tissue, in the absence of coagulative tumoral necrosis at the margin (where the cytoarchitecture of tumor cells is preserved) will n ot be considered as a positive margin, provided that there is 90% or greater overall tumor necrosis. In tumors with less than 90% overall necrosis, the presence of abnormal fibrosis or reactive inflammatory tissue at the margin (indicative of treated tumor bed) will be considered a positive margin. The distance of the tumor from the margins should be measured in millimeters, and positive margins should be described as going through a solid nodule of viable tumor, going through individual viable infiltrating tumor cells, or going through necrotic tumor. 14.3.2 Histologic Response Following definitive surgery the tumor should be examined to determine \"histologic response.\" Since the effect of the preoperative chemotherapy may not be uniform throughout the tu mor, adequate sampling as described in Section 14.3.3 is required to grade the histologic response accurately. The institutional pathologist should assess the tumor's pathologic response using the method for quantit ation of necrosis described in Section 14.3.3 and utilizing the grading system below as a guideline. Pathologic response Grade Percent Necrosis I Less than 50% necrosis II 50% -89% necrosis III 90% -99% necrosis IV 100% necrosis 14.3.3 Procedure for Quantitation of Necrosis Quantitation of necrosis is performed on the sections prepared from a single slice through the largest axis of the tumor. Only the areas representing tumor (viable THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 163 and necrotic) should be included in the quantitation. Areas representing normal tissue shoul d not be included in the quantitation. In some cases, the amount of residual viable tumor is obvious (e.g., less than 50% necrosis or 100% necrosis). In these instances, one can assign response to the appropriate grade listed in Section 14.3 . For problematic (non -obvious) cases, the total area occupied by tumor (both viable and necrotic) should be outlined using a marking pen on each glass slide containing tumor. Using a different color marking pen, the area occupied by viable tumor should be demarcated on the same slides. Lightly cross -hatching the demarcated viable areas may improve the ease of subsequent quantitation. Graph paper with 2 mm squares can be photocopied (actual size) on to acetat e sheets for overhead projection. These sheets can then be cut into rectangles and fixed over the cover slip using transparent double -sided tape. The total area occupied by tumor (viable and necrotic) and the area occupied by viable tumor can thus be quant ified, and the per cent necrosis can be quantified using the following formula: % Necrosis = 100 x [1 - (Area occupied by viable tumor/total area occupied by tumor)]. Quantitation of necrosis should not be performed by adding the estimated per cent necro sis on each slide and dividing by the number of slides containing tumor. This method does not take into account differences in the total area occupied by tumor on each slide and may result in inaccurate assessment of the amount of necrosis. Special atten tion to quantitation is essential, as one of the secondary aims is to compare the histologic response with the response as determined by MRI and FDG - PET. 14.4 Pathology Specimen Requirements Submission of materials from the diagnostic biopsy and resection /amputation specimens for pathology central review is not required for this study, though biopsy material must be submitted for the biology studies in Section 15.0 .

Quantitative Proteomics Analysis (NantOmics): For patients who enroll with Amendment #3 C and beyond, proteomic analysis of baseline samples b y NantOmics will be performed for each patient with an available baseline tissue block . For patients who provide additional consent for follow -up samples, proteomic analysis of follow -up samples by NantOmics will also be performed. For patients who submit a tissue block, the BPC will cut an additional two (2) 10 micron sections per time point to be placed onto DIRECTOR\u00ae slides (provided by NantOmics). Sections along with one (1) H+E slide will then be transferred to NantOmics. NantOmics will perform protein extraction and quanitif ication of IGF -1R pathway protei ns using a mass spectrometry method. Proteomic analysis will be performed in batches. All efforts will be made to perform proteomic analysis should samples not meet the above specifications. Whole Genome DNA and RNA Se quencing (NantOmics): For patients who enroll with Amendment #3 C and beyond, DNA and RNA sequencing of baseline samples by NantOmics will be mandatory. For patients who provide additional consent for follow -up samples, DNA and RNA sequencing of follow -up samples by NantOmics will also be performed. The BPC will perform co-extraction of tumor DNA and RNA using established methodology. The following materials (per sample time point) will be batch transferred by the BPC to NantOmics: 500 ng of tumor DNA at 5 ng/microliter (minimum acceptable: 50 ng at 1 ng/microliter) 1 microgram of tumor RNA at 50 ng/microliter (minimum acceptable: 250 ng at 25 ng/microliter) 500 ng of germline DNA at 5 ng/microliter (extracted by BPC as described in Section 15.3 ). NantOmics will perform whole genome DNA and RNA sequencing of tumor (and germline to enable designation of aberrations as somatic events) using next generation sequencing methods. Sequencing will be performed in batches. All efforts will be made to perform DNA and RNA sequencing should samples not meet the above specifications. 15.3 EGFR Promoter Polymorphisms 15.3.1 Specimen Schedule and Requirements A single pretreatment sample is mandatory .

THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 170 15.4. 4 Methodology Bone marrow mononuclear cells will be isolated on a Ficoll gradient. One to five million bone marrow mononuclear cells will be prepared for staining using standard methods and then stained with commercially availa ble flow cytometry monoclonal antibodies against CD99, CD45, and IGF -1R. Cells will then be washed and one to five million cells will be assayed and collected on a BD FACS Aria flow cytometer . The proportion of CD99+CD45 - cells will be quantified. Among CD99+CD45 - cells, the intensity of IGF -1R co -expression as well as the percentage of tumor cells co -expressing IGF -1R will be determined. Additional analytes may be assessed as new information emerges. Samples with sufficien t CD99+CD45 - cell burden will undergo fluorescent activated cell sorting to isolate CD99+CD45 - cells to support Aim 1.3.13 . DNA will be isolated from these cells followed by next -generation sequencing to identify primary oncogenic translocations, mutations in TP53 and STAG 2, and extent of somatic heterogeneity in tumor cells. When available, primary tumor material will be tested to allow comparison between paired primary and metastatic tumors. 15.5 Ganitumab Pharmacokinetic Study The first 10 patients < 21 years of age assigned to Regimen B are required to provide serial blood samples for the assessment of ganitumab serum concentrations in Induction and Maintenance. Enrollment to this coho rt completed as of July 2015 . For p atients previously assigned to this cohort , continue to collect samples as detailed in the following sections. 15.5.1 Specimen Requirements Note : The samples for ganitumab pharmacokinetics can be drawn from a central line, including a central line used to admin ister ganitumab. Induction Serum samples are to be obtained: Prior to first dose of ganitumab Just prior to the second dose of ganitumab on Induction Day 15 Just prior to the third dose of ganitumab on Induction Day 29 Just prior to the sixth dose of ganitumab on Induction Day 71 If the second dose of ganitumab is delayed due to toxicity, serum should still be obtained on Induction Day 15 even if the patient will not receive ganitumab that day. If the third and/or sixth dose of ganitumab is delayed beyond Induction Day s 29 and/or 71 due to toxicity, serum should be obtained 14 days after the second and/or fifth dose of ganitumab. At each time point, 2 mL of blood should be drawn into a serum separator tube without any a dded anticoagulant. After collection, the tubes should be gently inverted 5 times and held at room temperature for 30 -60 minutes before processing according to Section 15.5.2 . Samples should not sit for longer than 60 minutes before processing. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 171 Maintenance Serum samples are to be obtained: Prior to first Maintenance dose of ganitumab Just prior to the third Maintenance dose of ganitumab at W eek 7 Just prior to the fourth Ma intenance dose of ganitumab at W eek 10 Just prior to the sixth Maintenance dose of ganitumab at Week 16 At each time point, 2 mL of blood should be drawn into a serum separator tube without any added anticoagulant. After collection, the tubes should be gently inverted 5 times and held at room temperature for 30 -60 minutes before processing according to Section 15.5.2 . Samples should not sit for longer than 60 minutes before processing. 15.5.2 Specimen Processing Centrifuge tubes 1500 x g for 15 minutes at room temperature (if you have a temperature controlled centrifuge, set it to 20\u00b0C). With a pipette, remove serum from the top of the tube without disturbing the blood cells and transfer an equal volume (ideally 0.5 mL each) into labeled 2 mL cryovials (recommended vials: Sarstedt screw cap micro tube, self standing external thread, Catalog number 72.694.005, 2.0 mL capacity). If there is an inadequate amount of serum for 0.5 mL per cryovial, then split the available serum volume equally into all cryovials. Immediately place the labeled 2 mL cryovials containing the serum sample in a - 70\u00b0C or colder freezer. If a -70\u00b0C freezer is unavailable, alternatively samples can be stored in a -20\u00b0C freezer for up t o 3 months. If a -70\u00b0C or a -20\u00b0C freezer is unavailable, then freeze on dry ice and ship frozen to PPD on the day of collection.

A capture NGS sequencing approach will be used to detect relevant translocations and mutations from cell fr ee DNA extracted from approximately 2 milliliters of plasma for each patient using a commercial kit. After extraction, capture sequencing of cell free DNA will be performed utiliz ing oligonucleotides complementary to the genomic regions of interest. Sequen cing of the captured cell free DNA and data analysis will be preformed by the Center for Cancer Genome Discovery (CCGD) at Dana -Farber Cancer Institute to identify genomic rearrangements in the intronic regions of the EWSR1 , FUS, CIC, and BCOR genes as well as the coding regions of the STAG2 and TP53 . 15.7 Additional correlative studies If the patient consented to banking of material for future research then blood, bone marrow, and paraffin -embedded material or unstained slides remaining after the studies detailed in Sections 15.1-15.4 have been completed may be used for future research exploring the biology of Ewing sarcoma or other diseases. Assays to be performed include sequencing (including whole exome or whole genome sequencing) and creat ion of cell lines. If used THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 174 for such additional biologic research, specimens would be de -identified prior to use. If biologic studies required linkage to treatment / outcome data (e.g., immunogenicity assays on banked serum) such linkage would be performed by an honest broker as is typical for this type of study. All material to be used for future research will be banked at the Biopathology Center. 16.0 IMAGING STUDIES REQUIRED AND GUIDELINES FOR OBTAINING Timing of protocol therapy administration, resp onse assessment studies, and surgical interventions are based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established standards of care. Minor unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy and/or disease evaluations (an d up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family logistical, or facility, procedure and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable (except where explicitly prohibited within the protocol). 16.1 Imaging Guidelines CT and MRI guidelines are available on the COG Member site at: https://www.cogmembers.org/_files/reference/RefMaterial/DiagnosticImagingGuidelines _MRICT.pdf . For PET scan guidelines please refer to the NCI guideline s for the recommended set of procedures for the acquisition and analysis of 18F-FDG PET scans of patients participating in NCI -sponsored diagnostic and therapeutic clinical trials, which can be found in the consensus statement by Shankar and colleagues.123 See also Section 10 for overview of response assessment and preferred imaging studies. For local staging, MRI scans are preferred in the vast majority of cases. CT is also useful in assessing cortical changes and for chest wall tumor s. MRI for local staging should be performed at field strength of 1 -3 Tesla, using dedicated surface coils for the anatomical area of interest, and should always include axial fat plane, among other site -specific sequences. Diffusion -weighted scans and ADC maps are desirable. Gadolinium -chelates may be used in patients with an eGFR of > 60. Tumor measurement in three dimensions will be requested (see separate data forms packet). Metastatic disease should be evaluated by FDG -PET scan and CT scan of the lungs. For FDG -PET scans, 18F-FDG should be injected intravenously 45 -60 min prior to image acquisition, and patients should be asked to void their urine immediately before the scan. For centers with PET/CT capability, a diagnostic quality chest CT with slice thickness of 5 mm or less is required of all patients. Diagnostic CT data will be reconstructed using soft tissue and lung algorithms. The same CT dat a can be used for attenuation correction of the PET emission data. PET and CT images will be merged and reconstructed in the transaxial, coronal and sagittal planes. Sites suspicious for bone or soft tissue metastasis should be imaged further with MRI or CT (whole body CT or MRI obtained as part of PET/CT or PET/MRI scan is acceptable) THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 175 at study entry. Confirmed sites of bone or soft tissue metastatic involvement at study entry should have repeat MRI or CT at each follow -up re -staging evaluation. For pat ients having a separate dedicated chest CT for metastatic staging, helical CT of the lungs should be obtained in low dose mode with a slice thickness of 5 mm or less. Contrast agent injection is optional and might be favored in case of a chest wall primary tumor and/or clinical suspicion for mediastinal or pleural disease. While some centers may utilize whole body MRI scans to evaluate for metastatic disease, these scans are optional and should not replace required imaging studies. Whole body MR images ca n be obtained using whole body surface coils and STIR and/or diffusion weighted sequences. Data sets obtained at different bed positions will be post -processed to generate \"whole body\" scans. The study radiologist is available for consultation for questi ons related to diagnostic imaging. 16.2 Correlative Imaging Aims As part of routine clinical care, patients will undergo MRI (less commonly CT) of the primary tumor as well as whole -body FDG -PET scans. Scans from study entry and end - Induction will be sub mitted to IROC Rhode Island (formerly QARC) for batched central review and fusion of PET and MRI images by the study radiologist . MRI (or CT) data will be used to obtain the largest anterior -posterior, transverse and longitudinal dimensions. Reporting of t hese three dimensions will be required. These dimensions will be used for central estimation of tumor volume using the formula for a prolate ellipsoid: volume in mm3= /6 \u00b7 (d 1\u00b7d2\u00b7d3) = (AP x transverse x longitudinal) x 0.5. Institutions will also repo rt primary tumor FDG -PET standardized uptake value from the primary tumor at study entry and again at end -Induction. 16.3 Instructions for Submitting Imaging for Correlative Imaging Aims Anatomic imaging (MRI or CT) and FDG -PET scans from study entry , end-Induction , and first episode of disease progression / relapse will be submitted to IROC Rhode Island as follows to support the correlative imaging aims 1.3.4, 1.3.9 and 1. 3.10. If images already submitted to IROC Rhode Island as part of radiation oncolo gy review, duplicate images do not need to be submitted to support the se aims. The corresponding radiology reports will also be submitted to IROC Rhode Island . Submission of diagnostic imaging data in digital format is required. Digital files must be in DICOM format. These files can be submitted via sFTP. Information to obtain an sFTP account and submission instructions can be found at http://irocri.qarc.org/ . Follow the link labeled digital data. Alternatively, if sFTP is not feasible, the imaging may be burned to a CD and mailed to IROC Rhode Island . Multiple studies for the same patient may be submitted on one CD; howe ver, please submit only one patient per CD. Please submit to: IROC Rhode Island QA Center 640 George Washington Highway, Building B, Suite 201 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 17.0 RADIATION THERAPY GUIDELINES Radiation Therapy for patients on COG protocols can only be delivered at approved COG RT facilities. 17.1 General Guidelines The radiation therapy guidelines for this study were developed specifically for patients with newly diagnosed, metastatic Ewing sarcoma. These guidelines apply to patients who require radiation therapy as a component of treatment of the primary tumor durin g the Local Control phase of therapy and also to patients who require radiation to metastatic sites during the Metastatic Site Radiation phase of therapy. 17.1.1 Special Note for Very Young Children The long -term morbidity of RT or aggressive surgery for very young children makes appropriate local control challenging. Many clinicians are unwilling to follow standardized local control guidelines for very young children. This study encourages adherence to standardized local control guidelines for all childr en regardless of age. Consult with study surgeons and radiation oncologists as appropriate for a specific case. 17.1.2 Credentialing All therapy units used on this protocol must have their calibrations verified by IROC Houston (RPC) . The table in Section 17.5 indicates allowable modes of treatment delivery. IMRT : Institutions treating with IMRT and not previously credentialed for use of IMRT in COG trials must irradiate IROC Houston's head and neck phantom. Contact IROC Houston (http://irochouston.mdanderson.org ) for information about their phantoms. Proton Therapy : The Proton Questionnaire (available at http://irochouston.mdanderson.org ) must be completed. Each beam line used to treat patients on this study must be credentialed for clinical trial use by IROC Houston . See Section 17.1.4 below. Motion Management : If patients are treated with IMRT a nd gating or tracking methods are used to compensate for respiratory motion, IROC Houston 's Thorax -Lung Phantom must be irradiated with its accompanying reciprocating platform to simulate motion. SBRT : Use of SBRT is encouraged for treatment of bone metast ases <5 cm (based upon maximal dimension at diagnosis) , but credentialing is Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical interventions are based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established standards of care. Minor unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy and/or disease evaluations (and up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family logistical, or facility, procedure and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable (except where explicitly prohibited within the protocol). THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 177 required for its use . SBRT credentialing includes the following three components: (1) completion of the Motion Management Questionnaire (2), irradiation of IROC Houston 's Spine Phantom and (3) approval of the institution's IGRT process. See http://irocri.qarc.org/ for the Motion Management Question naire and a description of IGRT credentialing requirements. NOTE: SBRT is not to be used for sites other than bone metastases . COG will accept SBRT credentialing through NRG provided that the credentialing included irradiation of IROC Houston 's Spine Phantom (RTOG 0631). 17.1.3 Guidelines and Requirements for the Use of IMRT Investigators using IMRT will be required to comply with the guidelines developed for the use of IMRT in National Cancer Institute sponsored cooperative group trials. These guidelines are available through http://irocri.qarc.org/ . These guidelines require that the protocol explicitly state their requirements and methods for localization and immobilization; the use of volumetric imaging; target and organ motion management; nomenclature, definitions and rationale f or targets and organs at risk; target volume coverage and normal tissue dose constraints; effects of heterogeneity in tissues; and quality assurance. 17.1.4 Guidelines and Requirements for the Use of Proton Beam Therapy Proton therapy may be used to deliv er radiation therapy on this protocol. The proton therapy method will be limited to scattering , uniform scanning and pencil beam scanning depending on institutional availability . Investigators using proton beam radiation must comply with current NCI proto n therapy guidelines as outlined in the Guidelines for the Use of Proton Radiation Therapy in NCI Sponsored Cooperative Group Clinical Trials , available at http://rpc.mdanderson.org/RPC/home_page/Proton_guidelines .htm. 17.1.5 Guidelines and Requirements for the Use of Brachytherapy or Intraoperative Radiation Therapy Brachytherapy, using either high dose rate or low dose rate radioactive sources may be used on this protocol. Typically, brachytherapy or intraopera tive radiation therapy will be used to deliver focal RT to residual disease in the operative bed of the primary tumor for select patients. 17.1.6 Institutional Requirements to Offer SBRT All sites treating with SBRT to sites of bone metastasis must be c redentialed. COG will accept SBRT credentialing NRG (see Section 17.1.2 ). As radiotherapy for metastatic sites is not performed until the completion of therapy, sites that are not credentialed at the initiation of therapy should have adequate time to obtain SBRT credentialing prior to its use. The pediatric radiation oncologis t should be involved at the time of diagnosis to assess if imaging is adequate for local therapy and to ensure that all required credentialing tests for SBRT have been met. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 178 17.2 Indications for Radiation Therapy All patients should have all local and dis tant disease addressed with an appropriate local control modality. Definitive local therapy (surgery, SBRT, EBRT) is recommended to all metastatic sites documented at the time of diagnosis. SBRT is recommended to all bone metastatic sites < 5 cm in maximal dimension (based upon maximal dimension at diagnosis) if not treated surgically . Optimal local control will be determined by the treating institution and should involve input from pediatric oncology, surgery, and radiation oncology. The pediatric radiatio n oncologist should be involved at the time of diagnosis to assess if imaging is adequate for local therapy and to ensure that all required credentialing tests for SBRT have been met. It is expected that the majority of patients will receive radiotherapy t o the often multiple sites of metastatic disease. Because of the option of SBRT for metastatic sites, RT guidelines follow for treatment of primary site and then separately for treatment of metastatic sites. Note : SBRT is not to be used for sites other t han bone metastases. See Section 4.3 for a general discussion of local control. RT for Primary Site Definitive radiation therapy Unresected tumor Pre-operative radiation therapy Resectable tumor* Post-operative radiation therapy (1) Post -operative gross or microscopic residual tumor (2) Intra -operative spill Special presentations (1) Chest wall tumor with ipsilateral pleural -based secondary tumor nodules or positive pleural fluid cytology (2) Path ologically involved lymph nodes RT for Metastatic Sites Definitive radiation therapy Unresected tumor > 5cm Definitive SBRT Unresected/post -operative gross disease in bone mets that were <5 cm at diagnosis Post-operative radiation therapy (1) Post-operative gross or microscopic residual tumor (2) Intra -operative spill Special presentations (1) Pulmonary metastases (2) Pathologically involved lymph nodes *Pre-operative radiotherapy is generally not indicated in this patient population (see Section 4.3.1.3 ). Patients having microscopic or gross residual disease after planned pre -operative radiation therapy will receive additional radiation therapy (see table Section 17.7.2.1 ). Patients who have had a complete surgical excision of the involved area of bone and/or soft tissue mass with adequate surgical margins (see Sections 4.3.1 , 14.3.1 and 17.7.2.1 ) will not receive postoperative radiation. Radiation is not indicated for the following conditions: bone marrow lesions with no evidence of bone involvement or sites not as sessable clinically or by imaging and radiation that would exceed normal marrow tolerance. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 179 17.3 Timing of Radiotherapy 17.3.1 Radiation Oncology Consultation All patients should be seen in consultation by a radiation oncologist as early as possible if RT may be indicated according to the protocol. The purpose of the consultation is to participate in staging and to review the adequacy of the initial diagnostic imaging studies that will be used for subsequent RT planning , as well as to discuss and plan for potential use of various radiation modalities (SBRT, proton therapy) . Patients treated with radiation as the local control measure to the primary site, or preoperatively or postoperatively, will have radiotherapy delivered beginning concurre ntly with the beginning of Consolidation chemotherapy. If wound healing is incomplete, the possibility of a delay in initiation of radiation should be discussed with the protocol radiation oncologist. Ifosfamide and etoposide chemotherapy may be given conc urrently with radiotherapy (See Section 4.1.1.1 ). If radiation is used for metastatic sites, radiotherapy should be given at the end of Consolidation chemotherapy during the Metastatic Site Radiation phase of therapy. An exception may be made for treatment of limited lesions immediately adjacent to the primary site which may be difficult to treat without overlap of radiation volumes if treated at a later date. These metastatic sites will be treated concurrently with the pr imary tumor site. See Section 4.1.1.2 for modifying order of Consolidation for patients who receive early whole lung radiation due to overlapping radiation fields with the primary tumor. 17.3. 2 Timing of Emergency/Urgent Radiation T herapy Patients who require emergency radiotherapy, such as patients with spinal cord compression, may receive radiotherapy to their emergency site on Day 1 if deemed necessary by the treating physician. This is expected to be a rare event, since most patients will respond quickly and dramatically to chemotherapy. In addition, early therapy intensity appears to be associated with improved outcomes in this disease. The entire course of the emergency radiotherapy should be administ ered starting Day 1, rather than splitting the treatment and concluding the course at the beginning of Consolidation. In cases requiring urgent or emergency radiotherapy, notify the study radiation oncologist. Note that doxorubicin courses must not be gi ven during radiation with the exception of Consolidation C ycle 1 where concurrent start of chemotherapy and radiation is allowed. If emergency radiotherapy is required during Induction the order of the six planned chemotherapy cycles may be altered in orde r to avoid concurrent administration of doxorubicin with radiation (except Days 1 and 2 of doxorubicin in week 1 Induction, which may be given at the start of emergent radiation). Ifosfamide/etoposide courses may be given c oncurrently. Ganitumab must not b e given concomitantly with radiation and therefore the schedule of ganitumab administration must also be altered while administering a to tal of 11 doses of ganitumab across Induction and Consolidation for patients in Regimen B. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 180 17.3.3 Mesna In the past, mesna was held during radiation therapy. There are no data to suggest that mesna is a radioprotector. Mesna will therefore not be held during radiation. 17.4 Emergency Radiation Therapy Radiation therapy may be delivered on an emergent basis to patients w ith spinal cord compression, loss of vision or other function -threatening conditions. The decision to irradiate emergently should be made by the treating physicians. If emergent radiation is initiated, the entire course of the radiotherapy for that site sh ould be delivered using the protocol specified doses, rather than waiting until the protocol specified times for irradiation. Doxorubicin should be withheld if patients receive emergency radiation therapy (except Days 1 and 2 of doxorubicin in week 1 Induc tion, which may be given at the start of emergent radiation). Ifosfamide/etoposide courses may be given c oncurrently. Ganitumab must not be given concomitantly with radiation and therefore the schedule of ganitumab administration must also be altered while administering a to tal of 11 doses of ganitumab across Induction and Consolidation for patients in Regimen B. 17.5 Equipment and Methods of Delivery and Verification Equipment Photons** (any energy) Electrons (any energy) IMRT (4-10MV) Protons Brachytherapy* Linear Accelerator X X X Proton Beam X Intraoperative Radiation Therapy X X X Brachytherapy - high or low dose rate X * Permanent radioactive implants are not allowed on this protocol. ** For tumors adjacent or included in lung tissue, photon beam energy should be < 10 MV. 17.5.1 Treatment planning CT-treatment planning : All patients will undergo CT treatment planning for this protocol. Slices no more than 0.5cm thick (0.2 -0.3cm is recomme nded) shall be taken throughout the extent of the irradiated volume. CT (volumetric) based planning is required to optimize dose to the target volumes while protecting normal tissues. Organs within the irradiated volume should be contoured including those required by treatment site ( Section 17.10 ). A DVH is necessary to determine target coverage and evaluate dose to normal tissues. In the event that a patient must start radiation emergently with a non -volumetric treatmen t plan, a volumetric plan will be accomplished as soon as is reasonably possible and the previously utilized beams must be incorporated into the composite plan. 17.5.2 In-room verification of spatial positioning Two-dimensional or volumetric imaging may be used to verify correct patient positioning. Portal imaging using EPIDs is the most common two -dimensional method, particularly when the target volume possesses a fixed spatial relationship with visualized bony anatomy. Film is discouraged but is accept able. For IMRT THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 181 and 3 -D CRT treatments, a pair of images (usually orthogonal AP and lateral) is required to verify that the isocenter is in correct alignment relative to the treatment plan; these may be MV or kV images. When proton radiation is employed, da ily image guidance with either 2 -D or volumetric imaging is required . Volumetric imaging for position verification may be in -room kV or MV cone beam or conventional CT imaging. For CT tomography where isocenters are not used, a printout of the isodoses overlaid on the fused CT images can be printed to demonstrate in room ver ification. 17.6 Target Volumes 17.6.1 Standard tumor and target volume definitions International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) Reports 50, 62 and 78 ( www.icru.org ) define prescription methods and nomenclature that will be utilized for this study. Treatment planning will be based on the following definitions and applies only to the primary tumor site: Photons Gross tumor volume (GTV) is the volume occupied at diagnosis by visible or palpable d isease. Clinical target volume (CTV) includes the GTV and sites with potential occult tumor involvement including lymph nodes adjacent to the GTV that may be clinically involved. Planning target volume (PTV ) is the CTV surrounded by a geometric margin to account for variability in set -up, breathing or motion during treatment. Protons GTV is the same for protons and photons. CTV is the same for protons and photons. PTV will be uniquely defined for proton therapy. The planning target volume (PTV) for proton therapy will include a margin which is added to the CTV in 3 -dimensions. The margin should be consistent with the motion control and setup accuracy for the particular type of treatment (scattered versus scanning) at the treating proton center. When proton therapy is used, t he PTV will be used for dose reporting and not specifically for treatment planning. The goal of treatment planning will be CTV coverage at 100% wi th measures taken for each specific uncertainty . The PTV will vary with each individual field and will require additional adjustment including (1) the lateral margins, (2) smearing of compensator (if applicable) , (3) range of beam (depth of penetration) a nd, (4) modulation (number of required Bragg peaks). Adjustments to any of the aforementioned parameters (usually 3-15 mm) will be based on the range uncertainty, CT number uncertainty, internal motion, and set up error THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 182 determined for the particular body s ite at the individual proton institution. The following parameters must be explicitly reported for each beam: range, modulation, smearing radius of the compensator, set -up margin (SM) and PTV margin. The specifics of dose reporting for the proton PTV and r ecommendations regarding the PTV margin are discussed in Section 17.7.3 . Brachytherapy GTV is the same as for photons. CTV is the same as for photons. PTV is equal to CTV. 17.6.2 Initial tumor and target volume definitions The definitions for GTV1, CTV1 and PTV1 apply to all definitive, preoperative and postoperative treatment scenarios for which radiation therapy is indicated. Treatment will be prescribed to the PTV, which will be derived from the GTV and CTV 17.6.2.1 GTV1 GTV1 is defined as the visible and/or palpable disease defined by physical examination, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET scan) prior to any surgical debulking or chemotherapy. It also includes enlarged but unresected, regional lymph nodes. For patients who undergo initial surgery, operative notes and pathology reports may be helpful. GTV1 may require modification for initial tumors that exhibit a \"push ing margin\" into body cavities (ie, thorax, abdomen). If the tumor has responded to chemotherapy and normal tissues have returned to their natural position, GTV1 excludes the pre -chemotherapy volume where that volume extends into the cavity. Examples inclu de tumors that indent the lung, intestine or bladder that clearly return to a more normal anatomic position following chemotherapy. The modified GTV1 includes initially infiltrative disease which has responded to chemotherapy. 17.6.2.2 CTV1 If there are n o sites that warrant irradiation for potential occult tumor, then the CTV1 is defined as the GTV1 plus 1 cm (but not extending outside of the patient). It also includes regional lymph node chains for clinically or pathologically involved nodes. For tumors with no evidence of nodal involvement (N 0), the draining regional lymph nodes are not irradiated. For some sites, the definition of CTV is modified to account for specific anatomic barriers to tumor spread. When lymph nodes are clinically or pathologically involved with tumor, the entire lymph node drainage chain should be included in the CTV. 17.6.2.3 PTV1 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 183 For external beam photon techniques, the PTV1 is defined as the CTV1 plus an institutional specified margin to account for day -to-day setup variation related to the ability to immobilize the patient and physiologic motion of the CTV1. The minimum margin is 0.5 cm without daily image guidance but does not have to be uniform in all dimensions. Institutions with daily image -guidance may be able to reduce P TV based on institution -specific guidelines. For proton planning, beam specific PTV expansions will be required as described in Section 17.6.1 . Motion of the target volume in three dimensions (cranial, caudal, anterior to posterior, and lateral) may be determined by 4 -dimensional CT, respiratory gated CT, or other accepted techniques. An ITV (internal target volume) may be created to account for internal motion if average CT based planning is employed using the guidelines outlined in 17.8.6. 17.6.3 Volume reduction tumor and target volume definitions The definitions for GTV2, CTV2, and PTV2 apply to all definitive, preoperative, and postoperative treatment scenarios for which radiation therapy is indicated. 17.6.3.1 GTV2 GTV2 is defined as residual visible or palpable tumor as assessed by CT, MRI, PET s can or physical exam following I nduction chemotherapy with or without surgery. For unresected tumors, GTV2 includes the pre -treatment abnormalities in bone and the gross resid ual tumor in soft tissue after I nduction chemotherapy. For partially resected tumors, GTV2 includes residual abnormalities in bone and the gross residual tumor in soft tissue and the tumor bed harboring microscopic residual tumor. For tumor s with microscopic residual and >90% necrosis, this is the post -induction chemotherapy target volumes determined on pre -operative imaging. Special Considerations: In the case of extraosseous primaries with a complete response to chemotherapy or with intra -operative spill, there is only a single GTV (GTV1=GTV2). 17.6.3.2 CTV2 CTV2 is defined as the GTV2 + 1 cm (but not extending outside the patient) and areas at risk for microscopic disease and modified to account for specific anatomic barriers to tumor sp read. CTV2 includes lymph nodes adjacent to the GTV when appropriate. CTV2 should not extend outside of the patient. 17.6.3.3 PTV2 PTV2 is defined as the CTV2 with an institution and modality specific margin (minimum: 0.5 cm) to account for day to day set up variation and physiologic motion of the CTV2. For proton planning, beam THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 184 specific PTV expansions will be required as described in Section 17.6.1 . Special Presentations: 1) Chest Wall Tumors with eural Nodules and/or Pleural Fluid Involvement (CTV3, PTV3) These patients will require irradiation of the ipsilateral hemithorax followed by irradiation to the primary site, and if applicable, pleural based nodules. Target volumes for ipsilateral hemithorax irradiation are designated CTV3, PTV3 and will be irradiated first. Irradiation of the primary site or pleural based disease will follow. The GTV1, CTV1, PTV1 and GTV2, CTV2, and PTV2 for the primary are defined and treated as outlined in previous sections after completion of hemithorax irradiation. If the primary has been resected with adequate margins, and irradiation of the primary site i s not indicated, the primary will not be treated and radiation will be administered only to PTV3. For ipsilateral or bilateral lung irradiation, the lung and pleural cavity is defined as the CTV3. PTV3 is an expansion of CTV3 to account for organ motion during respiration as well as a 0.5 -1 cm geometric expansion to account for day to day set -up uncertainty. Organ motion can be determined with a 4D simulation, fluoroscopy, or lateral chest radiograph at full inspiration to document diaphragmatic excursion. The GTV1 and GTV2 for the primary and for the pleural based metastases are defined and treated as outlined in previous sections, however, there will be no GTV2 assigned to pleural based metastases having complete response to chemotherapy. The CTV1 and CTV2 of the primary and the CTV1 and CTV2 for the pleural based metastases respectively, may be combined if they can be treated in a single field based on the judgment of the radiation oncologist. Similarly a composite for the CTV3 including the pleural surfac es of the entire hemithorax and including the primary site and the pleural based metastases may be created to simplify treatment planning as long as dose requirements to these regions are met. 2) Pathologically Involved Lymph Nodes Nodal target volumes are included in the definitions of GTV1, CTV1, PTV1. Nodal target volumes are included in the definitions of GTV2, CTV2, and PTV2 with some modifications: In the case of a primary tumor which is resected with adequate margins, the nodal PTV should be drawn without the primary site and will be the only volume treated. The GTV for the primary site and GTV for the lymph nodes should initially be determined independently. If the volumes are contiguous the treating radiation oncologist should consider c ombining the volumes (especially after CTV and PTV expansions). The doses for the primary site and lymph nodes should be determined independently. GTV2 is only defined for unresected lymph nodes and includes the nodal volume after chemotherapy. GTV2 canno t be defined THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 185 for resected lymph nodes or when there has been a complete response to chemotherapy. CTV2 is only defined for unresected lymph nodes and its definition depends on the response to chemotherapy. CTV2 is defined as the original involved nodal re gion for unresected lymph nodes that have had a complete response to chemotherapy. CTV2 is defined as the original involved nodal region with an additional margin of 1.0 cm surrounding GTV2 for unresected lymph nodes after a partial response to chemotherap y. PTV2 is only defined for unresected lymph nodes and includes an additional margin of 0.5 -1.0 cm surrounding CTV2. When proton radiotherapy is employed, beam -specific PTV2 should be determined as described in Section 17.6. 1. Vertebral Body Tumors The GTV1 and GTV2 are defined as outlined in previous sections. At a minimum, CTV1 is defined as the entire vertebral body. PTV1 is the CTV1 volume with an institution specific margin of approximately 0.5 cm to account for day to day variation in set -up and physiologic motion. For the field -reduction boost, CTV2 is defined as GTV2 plus an additional 0.5 -1.0 cm margin to account for sub -clinical areas of residual disease but confined by anatomic boundaries (e.g. does not enter the spinal canal if initial disease did not enter the canal). PTV2 is the CTV2 volume with an additional margin of approximately 0.5 cm to account for day to day variation in set -up and physiologic motion. Again, this may be further adjusted and bea m-specific when protons are utilized. Institutions with daily image -guidance may be able to reduce PTV based on institution -specific guidelines. Extremity Tumors The CTV should be modified at the discretion of the radiation oncologist to avoid circumferen tial irradiation of extremity lymphatics and treatment across a joint unless absolutely necessary for tumor coverage. A strip of tissue must be provided for extremity tumors, so that lymphatic obstruction and unacceptable morbidity can be avoided. If any o f the treatment margins necessitates irradiating the epiphysis of an adjacent bone and there is no extension across the joint space, a smaller margin may be considered so that the adjacent epiphysis can be excluded. If the patient has a diaphyseal lesion, every attempt should be made to exclude at least one epiphysis (or both) of the affected bone. The most active growing epiphyses are those about the knee in the lower extremity and those in the shoulder and wrist area of the upper extremity. The gross tumo r volume (GTV) should be treated to the prescribed dose whenever possible. Head and Neck Tumors Many of these tumors may be considered unresectable due to close proximity to critical structures and surgical risks contributing to THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 186 functional or cosmetic def icits. Every attempt should be made to minimize dose to the brain, cochlea, optic chiasm and orbit including eye, lacrimal gland, and optic nerve. Orbital Tumors For orbit primaries, the CTV will not extend outside of the bony orbit, providing there is no bone erosion of the orbit. Chest Wall/Intrathoracic Tumors Tumors which have displaced a significant amount of lung parenchyma then returned to normal anatomic position following surgery or chemotherapy will have the GTV defined as the preoperative (prechemotherapy) tumor volume excluding the component of intrathoracic tumor which was removed by surgery or decreased in size by chemotherapy. All areas of pleural involvement will be included in the GTV regardless of whether the radiation is delivered pre or postoperatively. Intra -abdominal/Retroperitoneal/Pelvic Tumors Tumors which have displaced a significant amount of bowel then returned to normal anatomic position following surgery or chemotherapy will have the GTV defined as the preoperative (prechemo therapy) tumor volume excluding the component of intra - abdominal or intra -pelvic tumor which was removed by surgery or decreased in size by chemotherapy. All areas of peritoneal or mesenteric involvement will be included in the GTV regardless of whether th e radiation is delivered pre - or post -operatively. Whole abdomen RT is indicated for malignant ascites or diffuse peritoneal involvement. In such cases the entire peritoneal cavity is considered the CTV. Pulmonary Metastases and Pleural Effusions (CTV3, P TV3) These patients will require bilateral whole -lung radiation. Whole lung volume is designated CTV3. PTV3 is an expansion of CTV3 to account for organ motion during respiration as well as a 0.5 -1 cm geometric expansion to account for day to day set -up un certainty. Organ motion can be determined with a 4D simulation, fluoroscopy, or lateral chest radiograph at full inspiration to document diaphragmatic excursion. Note : IMRT is not allowed for whole lung radiation. Surgical management of residual pulmonary tumors after Consolidation chemotherapy is allowed. If the lung metastases are resected with adequate margins, boost irradiation is not indicated, and radiation will be administered only to PTV3. If metastatectomy of residual lung lesions is not performed, a field reduction boost will be administered based on a volume designated GTV2. As the post -chemotherapy volume (GTV2) is used, there will be no GTV1 in these patients. GTV2, CTV2, and PTV2 for the residual THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 187 lung lesions are defined and treated as outlined in previous sections and treated at the completion of whole lung irradiation. Non-Pulmonary Metastases Treated with Standard RT (not SBRT) The GTV2 for metastatic sites is the area of residual tumor defined on CT or MRI (post -chemotherapy/sur gery) and involved bone. In cases where there is a discrepancy in volume between the scans, the larger volume will be irradiated. To minimize irradiated volume, no GTV1 will be defined for metastatic sites. CTV2 is defined as GTV2 plus an additional 1.0 cm margin to account for sub -clinical areas of residual disease but confined by anatomic boundaries. PTV2 is the CTV2 volume with an additional margin of approximately 0.5 cm. Radiation is recommended to all non -marrow metastatic sites. Bone marrow deposits of tumor must have bone disruption/erosion to qualify as bone disease. CT may be useful to determine bone involvement. However, feasibility of delivering metastatic site radiation diminishes as the number of metastatic sites increases and will be determined by the treating radiation oncologist. SBRT has been introduced to improve the feasibility of treating multiple metastatic sites. If the treating radiation oncologist does not feel treatment of all sites is feasible, radiation is recommended to t hose metastatic sites if there remains a concern about disease control at that site and the patient can tolerate further radiotherapy without undue morbidity. Re -evaluation imaging at the completion of therapy will help the radiation oncologist determine i f the various remaining sites are in need of further treatment and will consider the following: (1) sub -optimal response to chemotherapy by clinical or imaging criteria, (2) sites which will be problematic in the event of disease progression ( i.e., tumor i n a weight bearing bone), and (3) sites that can be imaged with sufficient accuracy for treatment, and (4) expected tolerance and morbidity (i.e., bone marrow tolerance). Surgical resection of metastases can be considered if it can be done with reasonably low or acceptable morbidity. Bone Metastases Treated with SBRT The GTV2, CTV2 and PTV2 for metastatic sites is the area of residual tumor defined on MRI and/or CT (post -chemotherapy/surgery) and pre-treatment abnormalities in bone (see Section 17.6.3.1) . In cases where there is a discrepancy in volume between the scans, the larger volume will be irradiated. To minimize irradiated volume, no GTV1 will be defined for metastatic sites. For SBRT, modifications to CTV2 and PTV2 are as follows: CTV2=GTV2+1cm e xpansion for microscopic disease but limited by anatomic constraints such as bone cortex PTV2=CTV2+2mm expansion for setup error, but can be limited to avoid critical normal structures such as spinal canal THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 188 Definitive local therapy (surgery, SBRT, EBRT) is recommended to all bone metastatic sites documented at the time of diagnosis. SBRT is recommended to all bone metastatic sites < 5 cm in maximal dimension (based upon maximal dimension at diagnosis) if not treated surgically . Bone marrow deposits of tumo r must have bone disruption/erosion to qualify as bone disease. CT may be useful to determine bone involvement. SBRT has been introduced to improve the feasibility of treating multiple metastatic sites. If the treating radiation oncologist does not feel tr eatment of all sites is feasible, radiation is recommended to those metastatic sites if there remains a concern about disease control at that site and the patient can tolerate further radiotherapy without undue morbidity. Re -evaluation imaging at the compl etion of therapy will help the radiation oncologist determine if the various remaining sites are in need of further treatment and will consider the following: (1) sub -optimal response to chemotherapy by clinical or imaging criteria, (2) sites which will b e problematic in the event of disease progression ( i.e., tumor in a weight bearing bone), and (3) sites that can be imaged with sufficient accuracy for treatment, and (4) expected tolerance and morbidity (i.e., bone marrow tolerance). 17.7 Target Dose Integrated boost radiotherapy plans are not permitted. 17.7.1 Dose Definition Photon dose is to be specified in centigray (cGy) -to-muscle. For proton beams, the absorbed dose, ICRU 78's D RBE, is specified in Gy(RBE), using a standard RBE of 1.1 with respect to Cobalt -60. 17.7.2 Prescribed dose and fractionation Dose should be prescribed to an isodose surface that encompasses the PTV and allows the dose uniformity requirements to be satisfie d. The protocol -specified dose per fraction is 180cGy. The treatment should be limited to one fraction per day. The dose per fractionation may be reduced from 180cGy to 150cGy when large volumes are treated ( i.e., whole abdomen and pelvis) or when toleranc e is poor (i.e., mucositis or diarrhea). Changes to the fractionation regimen should be noted in the treatment record and submitted information. 17.7.2.1 Radiation dose guidelines for all targeted volumes, excluding lymph nodes, and chest wall tumors with involved plueral fluid or nodules . All doses are described in Gy; however, equivalent doses should be prescribed in Gy (RBE) when proton therapy is utilized.

Dose (cGy) Total recommended dose for gross disease 5580 If resected with microscopic residual 5040 Non-osseous, complete response to chemotherapy 5040 If resected with no microscopic residual 0 3500 PTV1 = CTV2+2mm 600 3000 17.7.3 Dose uniformity - Conventional fractionation At least 95% of the protocol -specified dose should encompass 100% of the PTV1/PTV2 and no more than 10% of PTV1 (PTV2 for patients with a volume reduction) should receive greater than 110% of the protocol dose as evaluated by DVH. The 100% isodose should be equal to the prescribed dose. Wedges, compensators and other methods of generating more uniform dose distributions are encouraged. Proton Specific Guidelines: For protons, the PTV concept differs from photon therapy. All uncertainties are taken into account explicitly to create a robust plan that provides full dose coverage of the CTV Proton plans should be evaluated for adequate PTV coverage from the summation of all beams. For scattered and uniform scanning beams, the aperture margin must include the appropriate beam penumbra for the selected beam energy, and setup and internal margins (SM and IM). These margins depend on the patient setup techniques used at the treating proton center. The aperture margin may be expanded further if a cold spot occurs near the edge of CTV due to insufficient lateral scatter. The smearing radius for the range compensator must be equal to the setup and i nternal margins (SM and Age PTV1* PTV2* PTV3 < 6 years 0 36 Gy 12 Gy > 6 years 0 34.2 Gy 15 Gy THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 191 IM). The beam range should be equal to the maximum water equivalent depth of the CTV plus a range margin. Most proton centers use 3.5% of the maximum water -equivalent depth of the CTV to account for CT HU uncertainty and then add another 3 millimeters to account for uncertainties in beam range calibration and compensator fabrication. Additional range margin should be applied if internal motion could increase the water equivalent depth of the CTV. The modulation width should ensure pr oximal coverage of the target volume. A PTV should be created by a uniform expansion from CTV for reporting purposes. The expansion margin should be consistent with SM and IM and is typically 3 mm for a static target volume when daily imaging is perform ed. With the planning guidelines provided herein, no more than 10% of PTV should receive greater than 110% of the protocol dose as evaluated by DVH. In most cases, at least 95% of the protocol -specified dose should encompass 100% of the PTV. A potential ex ception is when the range margin is smaller than the PTV expansion (e.g., 3mm). As a result, the beam may not penetrate deep enough to sufficiently cover the distal portion of the PTV. This may occur for shallow target volumes where the maximum depth of th e CTV is small and the range margin is small. This scenario is not expected for this protocol; however, such incomplete coverage of the PTV will not constitute a planning deviation because the plan should be sufficiently robust to cover the CTV with the pr otocol specified dose accounting for all uncertainties. 17.7.4 Tissue heterogeneity Calculations must take into account tissue heterogeneity and should be performed with CT -based treatment planning to generate dose distributions and treatment calculations from CT densities. When IMRT is used in lung, planning must be performed using an ap proved dose calculation algorithm. Approved algorithms include: convolution superposition, collapsed cone convolution, and Monte Carlo. When protons are used, tissue heterogeneity calculations should be performed with the CT -based treatment planning system to generate dose distributions from the proton relative stopping power. Proton therapy should be used with extreme caution when any of the treatment beams traverse normal lung parenchyma. Please see explicit planning guidelines for this situation in Section 17.9.1.1 . 17.7.5 Environment of care - Interruptions, delays and dose modifications There will be no planned rests or breaks from treatment. Once radiation therapy has been initiated, treatment will not be interrupted except for severe myelosuppression associated with complications which in the opinion of the treating physicians preclude administration of RT. Blood product support should be instituted according to institutional/protocol guidelines. Side effects that re quire treatment interruption include significant stomatitis or mucositis ( > Grade 3). The reason for any interruptions greater than three treatment days should be recorded in the patient's treatment chart and submitted with the QA documentation. When interruptions or delays occur, the total number of fractions or cumulative dose should not be modified. 17.8 Treatment Technique THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 192 17.8.1 Beam Configuration Every attempt should be made to minimize dose to organs at risk without compromising coverage of the tar get volume. Three -dimensional conformal therapy (coplanar or non -coplanar) IMRT or proton therapy are required to minimize dose to normal tissues. 17.8.2 Selection of proton beam arrangements There are uncertainties (1 -3 mm) in the distal range of the pr oton beam in which the RBE may be greater than 1.1; therefore, single proton beam plans which stop in a critical organ will not be allowed. Critical organs include, but are not limited to, spinal cord, brainstem, trachea, and mainstem bronchus. Individual proton beams which are a component of a multi -field proton beam, which stop within such an organ, will be allowed. 17.8.3 Field Shaping Field shaping for photons will be done with either customized cerrobend blocking or multileaf collimation. The field shaping for protons will be done with either brass or cerrobend apertures or proton -specific multileaf collimation for scattered and uniform scanning beams. Pencil beam scanning does not require additional accessories for field shaping . 17.8.4 Simulation including patient positioning and immobilization 17.8.4.1 Patient positioning Reproducible setups are critical and the use of immobilization devices is strongly encouraged. The patient may be treated in any appropriate, stable position. Consideration should be given to implications for inter and intrafraction motion when using non -standard position approaches. Immobilization devices Standard immobilization devices for the torso, extremities or head and neck are to be used. For IMRT and proton delivery approaches, the methods used for localization and immobilization of both patient and tumor are critical. The imaging studies should provide a clear assessment of the target volume with the patient in the treatment position. 17.8.5 Special considerations Anesthesia or sedation may be required in certain patients, such as very young patients, to prevent movement during simulation and daily treatments. 17.8.6 Motion Management and Margins to Account for Target Volume and Organ Motion Considering motion of normal tissues and target volumes is important. The internal target volume (ITV) is defined as the CTV surrounded by the internal motion (IM) component of the PTV and is meant to account for potential motion of the CTV. If adequa te clinical data do not exist to define the IM component of the PTV margin, the following suggestions are provided: THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 193 For a CTV susceptible to physiologic motion, a margin of at least 0.5cm should be added to the CTV prior to PTV margin expansion or a PTV margin of 1.0cm should be chosen. For tumors of the thorax or abdomen, an assessment should be made to determine the extent of motion present. PTV margins should include this motion as a component. IMRT may be used for tumors of the thorax only if the degre e of tumor motion is assessed and can be limited to 0.5cm in any direction. If required to achieve this goal, techniques for managing or suppressing tumor motion shall be applied. Protons may be used for tumors of the thorax only if the degree of tumor motion is assessed and can be limited to 0.5 cm in any direction. Motion should be accounted for in an ITV determined by 4 -dimensional CT, respiratory gated CT, or other accepted techniques. A description of the method used and evidence (i.e., observed motion during fluoroscopy, motion of surrogate markers using camera systems, or analysis of 4 -D CT) of the remaining tumor motion should be submitted on the Motion Management Reporting Form with the Quality Assurance Documentation materials as noted in Section 17.11 . NOTE : For patients treated with IMRT, use of gating or tracking methods to compensate for respiratory motion requires irradiation of IROC Houston 's Thorax -Lung Phantom with accompanying reciprocating platform to simulate motion. Contact IROC Houston (http://irochouston.mdanderson.org ) for information about their phantoms. 17.8.7 Brachytherapy Single Plane Implant It is expected that most patients will be treated by a single plane implant to the tumor bed after gross resection with microscopic residual disease or in the case of less than minimal margins. The target volume should include all sites of potential microscopic disease with at least 1.0 cm margin on all sides. A template, mesh or applicator can be used to keep the catheters parallel. If the area to be implanted is larger than 50cm2, external beam radiation therapy should be considered. Catheters should be parallel and positioned 1cm apart. To ensure sufficient coverage the catheters should be placed with the distal end of the catheter projecting 1 -2cm beyond the target volume. Double or Multiple Plane Implant A double plane implant will be performed for unresectable tumors less than 2 cm thick. A larger tumor may require a volume (multiplane) implant. T hese techniques should not be used for patients with unresected boney disease. The target volume should include the entire palpable or post chemotherapy tumor volume with at least a 0.5cm margin on all sides. If the thickness of tissue to be implanted is l arger than 3 cm, external beam radiation therapy should be considered, but is not required. Catheters are to be implanted 1 cm apart throughout the tumor volume for these cases. The target volume is the entire palpable or post chemotherapy tumor with at least a 0.5 cm margin on all sides. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 194 Brachytherapy be for post -implant dosimetry. The GTV, CTV, and PTV shall be outlined on the CT. DVHs for the GTV, CTV, and PTV shall be calculated and submitted for review. Sources used s hall have assay directly traceable to NIST. CT or MRI planning shall be used for postimplant dosimetry. The GTV and CTV shall be outlined on the CT or MRI. The PTV is identical to the CTV for purposes of brachytherapy planning. DVHs for the GTV, CTV, and PTV shall be calculated and submitted for review. Implants should be designed to meet the following dose uniformity criteria: CTVD100 95% of the 100=VV VHI CTVCTV CTV Where CTVD100 the dose received by 100% of the CTV, CTVV100 is the fraction of the CTV receiving the prescribed dose, and CTVV150 is the fraction of the CTV receiving 150% of the prescribed dose. It is recognized that the dose distribution from brachytherapy implants is inherently non-uniform and that for some implant geometries the above criteria for dose homogeneity index may be difficult to meet. When a brachytherapy implant is used, the isodose distribution shall be calculated in descriptive planes (3 perpendicular planes passing through the target center and in two transverse planes 2cm from the ends of the implant). CT -based planning shall be used. Total dose/fractionation and dose rate In the rare circumstance that postoperative brachythe rapy is used instead of external beam radiation, then the following recommendations apply: LDR brachytherapy Dose fractions by 6 hours) Number of fractions: 7 Brachytherapy should not begin until postoperative Day 5 to allow for wound healing. In the rare circumstance that brachytherapy is used instead of external beam radiation for an unresectable tumor, the following r ecommendations apply: LDR 5000 cGy Dose rate range: 40 -100cGy/hour. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 195 17.8.8 SBRT Guidelines This study includes a secondary objective focused on evaluating the role of SBRT directed to sites of bone metastasis < 5 cm (based upon maximal dimension at diagnosis) . For the purposes of this study, bone metastases are defined radiographically as lesions causing disruption of bone on anatomic imaging. All sites treating with SBRT to sites of bone metastasis must be credent ialed. COG will accept SBRT credentialing through NRG . See Section 17.1.2 for full details of the credentialing process. Note : SBRT is not to be used for sites other than bone metastases. 17.8.8.1 Localization Stereotactic radiation requires meticulous definition of the target, normal tissue structures, and visualization for localization during treatment delivery. Although CT is superior for evaluating bone changes due to tumor involvement, the extent of intramedul lary involvement is difficult to determine on CT. Thus MRI within 4 weeks of treatment is required for planning for lesions treated with SBRT. This can either be in the form of treatment planning MRI or an MRI fused for treatment planning. A separate PET -CT is optional but can be used for treatment planning with fusion -- this study would be done identically if the patient were having standard fractionated radiation. These studies can assist with delineation of the target and visualization for stereotactic treatment. Patients will be positioned in a reproducible treatment position with an appropriate immobilization device custom -made for each patient and specific to treatment site. A variety of immobilization systems can be used on study such as stereotact ic frames which surround the patient on three sides or large rigid pillows that reference to a stereotactic coordinate system. For cervical spine or cervicothoracic junctional areas, a rigid head and neck immobilization device should be used. Patient immob ilization must be reliable enough to achieve the accuracy requirement of image -guidance. 17.8.8.2 Simulation CT simulation will be performed. The simulation study must include the target and all organs at risk for treatment planning. Simulation scan length should be 5 -10 cm superior and inferior to the target. All organs at risk within the scan length should be c ontoured for dose -volume histogram analysis. For stereotactic treatment, tomographic slice thickness of 1 -3 mm through the target is recommended. Special consideration should be given to the analysis of internal organ motion if the target lesion is locat ed in a site subject to motion such as the chest wall. Techniques to image moving targets such as active breath -hold techniques, accelerator gating with respiratory cycle, tumor tracking, 4D CT scan acquisition in conjunction with maximum THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 196 intensity project ion (MIP), will be considered acceptable maneuvers to account for organ motion. All systems used to account for internal organ motion must be accredited by the Study Committee. If the target cannot be visualized or localized on the planning imaging modalit y as a result of motion or metal artifact, stereotactic treatment should not be used. The treating radiation oncologist will identify the location of the tumor. Gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation will be performed with a diagnostic tial axial computed tomography images. A radiosurgical treatment plan will be developed based on tumor geometry and location. Accurate contouring of normal structures is critical in SBRT (please see Table 17.10 for a list of normal tissue dose constraints to be used on protocol as well as constraints for high and low -dose spillage). OAR dose constraints are primary planning priority in SBRT treatment planning. Tumor coverage is seco ndary. Patients in whom optimal tumor coverage is not possible while meeting planning constraints should not receive SBRT and instead should be treated with standard fractionation EBRT. The following are examples of contouring requirements for bone lesions near these critical structures: Spinal Cord The spinal cord is the visualized spinal cord based on image fusion with T2-weighted MRI, T1 -weighted MRI with contrast, or CT myelogram. Because of curvature in the spine that is dependent on position and immo bilization, MRI in the treatment position is ideal but not required. The spinal cord should be drawn of every slice of simulation CT (ie not interpolated). Spinal cord volume will be defined as 5-6 mm above and below the radiosurgery target volume . Theca l Sac The spinal cord can move within the thecal sac. The thecal sac will be contoured based on T2 MRI or bony limit of spinal canal and will serve as a PRV (planning organ at risk volume) for the spinal cord. Thecal sac volume will be defined as 6 mm above and below the radiosurgery target volume . Skin The skin will be defined as the outer 0.5 cm of the body surface. The skin is essentially a rind of 0.5 cm enveloping the entire body in axial planes. The cranial and caudal surface of the superior and inferior limits of the planning CT should not be conto ured as skin unless skin is actually present in these locations. Ribs within 5 cm of the PTV should be contoured by outlining bone and bone marrow. The intercostal spaces should not be included as part of the ribs. Esophagus The esophagus will be contour ed using mediastinal windowing on CT to correspond to the mucosal, submucosa, and muscular layers. The THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 197 esophagus should be defined starting at least 10 cm above the superior extent of the target volume and continuing on every CT slice to at least 10 cm bel ow the inferior extent of the target volume. Larynx and Pharynx The larynx and pharynx will be contoured to the mucosa, submucosa, cartilages and airway channels associated with these structures. Trachea and Airway The trachea and airway adjacent to the spines will be contoured including the mucosa, submucosa, cartilage rings and airway channels. Lung Both the right and left lungs should be contoured using pulmonary windows. All inflated and collapsed lung should be contoured; however, paraspinal gro ss tumor, if any, should not be included in this structure. Kidney Both the right and left kidneys should be contoured. Paraspinal gross tumor as defined above should not be included in this structure. 17.8.8.3 Treatment Planning OAR dose constraints are primary planning priority in SBRT treatment planning. Tumor coverage is secondary (See Section 17.14 for assessment of deviations). Patients in whom optimal tumor coverage is not possible while meeting planning constraints shoul d not receive SBRT and instead should be treated with standard fractionation EBRT. The main criteria for dose prescription for tumors of or in proximity to the spine will be the achievement of the spinal cord dose constraint (see table below): For tumors distant from the spinal cord, the main criteria for dose prescription will be OAR as per table 17.10. Patients treated with SBRT will receive a prescribed dose of 40 Gy in 5 fractions to cover at least 90% of the defined target volume. The minimum, mean, and maximum dose to the PTV will be reported. Only 1 cc or 1-5% of unspecified tissue outside of the PTV can receive 100-110% of the prescribed dose. 17.8.8.4 Treatment/Localization Within four weeks of the initial treatment planning imaging study, SBRT will be administered using image -guidance. This protocol allows conventional linear accelerators and specialized linear Normal Tissue Volume Volume Max (cGy) Max Point Dose (cGy) Endpoint (Grade 3) THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 198 accelerators with image guidance (e.g. Novalis, Trilogy, Synergy , Artiste) capable of conformal dose delivery and IMRT. Specialized accelerators (e.g. Cyberknife or Tomotherapy) are also allowed provided that institutions have satisfied all credentialing requirements . SBRT is an image -guided procedure. In -room imagin g technology allowing imaging of the target bone should be used. Coordinate systems between imaging system and delivery system should be aligned for SBRT. During treatment, real time cone beam CT images or orthogonal kilovoltage images of the patient's body site of interest will be obtained. Cone beam CT scan or kilovoltage orthogonal images will be obtained immediately prior to treatment and will be repeate d until the treatment shift, required to align the CT planning scan and the cone beam CT scan performed on the day of treatment, is within 2 mm. Imaging should be performed during and at the end of treatment to ensure maintenance of patient positioning thr oughout treatment. Anesthesia or sedation may be required in certain patients, such as very young patients, to prevent movement during simulation and daily treatments. Anesthesia will be delivered by a dedicated pediatric anesthesiologist. 17.9 Organs at Risk - Conventional Fractionation The organs at risk guidelines in this section are recommendations. If the recommended doses to the organs at risk are exceeded because of target volume coverage requirements or other conditions, an explanation should be included in the quality assurance documentation. Normal tissue dose recommendations are the same for photons and protons (proton dose measured in Gy(RBE) ). 17.9.1 Use of Proton Therapy in Treatment of Thoracic Tumors During treatment of thoracic tumors, or tumors in locations that require beams to traverse normal lung tissue, proton therapy should be used with extreme caution. The following specific constraints will apply in this situation: When considering the total lung volume less the PTV: o The volume of lung receiving 20 Gy (V20) should be less than 20% o The volume of lung receiving 5 Gy (V5) should be less than 60% o The mean lung dose should be less than 20 Gy When considering the spinal cord: o The maximum dose should be 45 Gy o A structure called P AR-Cord should be created, and consist of the contoured spinal cord plus a 5 mm expansion. The maximum dose to the PAR -Cord structure should be 50 Gy. Additionally, the distal end of the bragg peak of a single beam should not stop in a critical structure, such as the spinal cord, trachea, or mainstem bronchus due to uncertainty with regard to dose deposition at the distal end THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 199 of the beam. Individual proton beams which are a component of a multi - field proton beam, which stop within such an organ, will be all owed.

Any dose > 105% of the prescription dose should occur primarily within the PTV itself and not within the normal tissues outside the PTV. Therefore, the cumulative volume of all tissue outside the PTV receiving a dose > 105% of prescription dose should not be more than 15% of the PTV volume. 2. Conformality of PTV coverage will be judged such that the ratio of th e volume of the prescription isodose meeting criteria 1 through 4 to the volume of the PTV is ideally < 1.2 (see table below ). These criteria will not be required to be met in treating very small tumors (< 2.5 cm axial GTV dimension or < 1.5 cm craniocaudal GTV dimension) in which the required minimum field size of 3.5 cm results in the inability to meet a conformality ratio of 1.2.

We have been talking with you about your illness, Ewing Sarcoma (EWS). EWS is a type of cancer that grows in the bones . After doing tests, we have found that you have this type of cancer and it has spread into other areas of your body. 2. We are asking you to take part in a research study because you have EWS that has spread to other areas of your body. A research study is when doctors work together to try out new ways to help people who are sick. We will do this by adding a new drug to the treatment often used for the type of cancer you have . This new drug is called ganitumab and it is an experimental drug. Some childre n in this study will get the new drug and some children will not. We do not know how well the new drug will work in children. That is why we are doing this study. 3. All children who are part of this study will be treated with chemotherapy (anti -cancer drug s) on 1 of 2 treatment plans. Children on one plan will get the drug ganitumab and children on the other plan will not get ganitumab . Children who are part of this study will be given either: Chemotherapy or Chemotherapy + ganitumab All children who are part of this study will also have surgery and/or receive radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is the use of high energy X -rays to kill cancer cells. 4. Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These good things are calle d \"benefits.\" We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is a better chance of getting rid of the cancer for as long as possible. But we do not know for sure if there is any benefit to being part of this study. 5. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These bad things are called \"risks.\" One risk to you from this study is that the study treatment may not work as well as other therapies. Also, the study treatment may cause more side effects than other therapies. Your doctors will watch you for signs of any side effects. 6. We want to see if there are ways to tell how the cancer will respond to treatment. To do this, we will collect extra blood and tumor samples from you for research tests . These samples would be taken when other standard blood draws or tumor surgery are being performed, so there would be no extra procedures. 7. Your family can cho ose to be part of this study or not. Your family can also decide to stop being in this study at any time once you start. There may be other treatments for your illness that your doctor can tell you about. Make sure to ask your doctors any questions that yo u have. THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLIC Y AEWS1221 Version date: 05/01/19 Page 213 8. We also would like your permission to collect extra bone marrow when you have standard bone marrow tests. We want to look for small amounts of cancer cells in your bone marrow. We will not perform an extra bone marrow test just to collect bone mar row for research. We would also like your permission to save any leftover samples. You can still take part in this study even if you don't allow us to collect the extra bone marrow for research or let us save any leftover samples.

We have been talking with you about your illness, metastatic Ewing Sarcoma (EWS). EWS is a type of cancer that grows in the bones . Metastatic means the cancer has spread into other areas of your body. After doing tests, we have found that you have this type of cancer. 2. We are asking you to take part in a research study because you have metast atic EWS. A research study is when doctors work together to try out new ways to help people who are sick. We will do this by adding a new experimental drug called ganitumab to the treatment often used for metastatic EWS. Some people in this study will get ganitumab and some will not. We do not know how well ganitumab will work in children and teens with metastatic EWS. That is why we are doing this study. 3. Children and teens who are part of this study will be treated with chemotherapy (anti -cancer drugs) on 1 of 2 treatment plans. People on one plan w ill get the experimental drug \"g anitumab\" and people on the other plan will not get ganituma b. A computer decides which treatment plan you will get and not your doctor. The reason for this is to make sure there is same number of p eople on both treatments. You have an equal chance of getting ganitumab or not getting ganitumab . Children and teens who are part of this study will be randomly assigned to receive either: Chemotherapy ; or Chemotherapy + ganitumab All children and teens who are part of this study will also have surgery and/or receive radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is the use of hi gh energy X -rays to kill cancer cells. 4. Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study.

But we do not know for sure if there is any benefit of being part of this study. 5. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These bad things are called \"risks.\" One risk to you from this study is that the study treatments may be less eff ective than other therapy options. If you receive ganitumab, there is a chance that you will have more side effects. Your doctors will monitor you closely for signs of any side effects. Other things may happen to you that we don't yet know about. 6. We want to see if there are ways to tell how the cancer will respond to treatment.
