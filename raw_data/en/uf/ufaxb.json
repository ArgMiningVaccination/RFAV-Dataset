Whole Dog Journal has science-backed answers to everything you ever wanted to know about your dog's health.", "sitename": "Whole Dog Journal", "date": "2023-08-23", "cleaned_text": "Tips](https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/health/safe-canine-weight-loss-tips/) Recent studies indicate that up to 40 percent of dogs in the United States may be obese. The risks associated with canine obesity include musculoskeletal disorders such as osteoarthritis, compromised immune function, problems during surgical procedures, delayed wound healing, skin infections, and diabetes. [Your Dog's Bad Breath Can Signal Oral Health Problems](https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/health/your-dogs-bad-breath-can-signal-oral-health-problems/) Chronic bad breath is not a normal, healthy condition. Even though it is true that dogs will sometimes eat UFOs (Unidentifiable Fetid Objects), unpleasant things collected from unspeakable sources that can make their mouths smell unbearable for short periods of time, their breath should never remain foul. And while hal-itosis (bad breath) is sometimes caused by indigestion or other imbalances deeper in the digestive tract, it is more commonly attributable to plaque; a buildup of anaerobic bacteria on the teeth and gum tissues. [How to Best Utilize Your Dog's Next Blood Test](https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/health/how-to-best-utilize-your-dogs-next-blood-test/) Why a blood test is an integral part of your dog's requisite annual wellness exam, and how to get the most out of the blood chemistry test results. Most of the dog's organ systems can be targeted by one chemical analysis or another, and with proper interpretation of one (or a combination of) these analyses, I can, at least in part, assess the dog's current health/disease status. From this interpretation then, we can often derive a treatment regime, whether it is based on Western or alternative medicines. Isn't science wonderful? [Dog Cancer Diet](https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/health/anti-cancer-diets-for-dogs/) Cancer profoundly alters a dog's metabolism, even before any malignancies are advanced enough to be detected; these changes persist even after remission. Ask any dog owner about his biggest health fears for his pet, and his response is likely to include cancer. It's a leading cause of death in canines and can be indiscriminate, striking young and old dogs alike. [Not Just for Sore Backs](https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/health/not-just-for-sore-backs/) Chiropractic treatment can solve seemingly unrelated health issues. [Holistic Veterinarians Discuss Holistic Healing](https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/health/holistic-veterinarians-discuss-holistic-healing/) My dog has Qi; your dog has Qi; all God's creatures have Qi. In fact, the earth below, the heavens above, and the entire universe around us has Qi. More than energy, more than air, more than life itself, Qi is an ever-present essence that gives us, our animal comrades, and our surrounding environment the vitality we call life. Qi, pronounced \"chee,\" is also spelled chi or ch'i. In Japanese, it is expressed as Ki. Prana is Qi's sister from India, and some of the other \"relatives\" of Qi include the \"vital force\" of homeopathy, Improves Your Dog's Digestion](https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/health/digestion/acupressure-improves-your-dogs-digestion/) If not for their dinner bowls, dogs would still be wolves. In many ways our devoted, domesticated dogs are still wolves, especially when it comes to their digestion. In the past 10 years, holistically oriented guardians and healthcare practitioners have become proponents of fresh food diets plus supplements for dogs. There are many authoritative books, journals, and magazines that are doing their best to raise the consciousness of the general public about the health issues associated with manufactured dog foods. [Cod Liver Improves Dogs' Heart and Circulatory Systems](https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/health/heart-disease/cod-liver-improves-dogs-heart-and-circulatory-systems/) People don't like the taste, but dogs love cod liver oil. That's convenient, because cod liver oil is inexpensive, easy-to-use canine health insurance. Centuries ago, people in the fishing communities of Scotland, Greenland, Iceland, and Norway thrived despite their intensely cold winters by taking a daily dose of cod liver oil. By the 1800s, folks around the world were taking a tablespoon a day because it relieved aching muscles, stiff joints, and rheumatism in addition to improving overall health. [Herbal Remedies for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)](https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/health/digestion/herbal-remedies-for-inflammatory-bowel-disease-ibd/) Conventional approaches to inflammatory bowel disease often involve a controlled diet of highly digestible foods that are rich in supplemental dietary fiber. Often, cortico-steroid drugs (such as Prednisone) and other immunosuppressive drugs are prescribed to rapidly reduce pain and inflammation. These drugs may bring fast, temporary relief from painful symptoms, but they can be risky, especially if employed long-term. [Veterinary Housecalls - Make the Most of Them](https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/health/veterinary-housecalls-make-the-most-of-them/) It's not uncommon for animals to show signs of stress or trauma at the veterinarian's office. These kinds of reactions at a veterinary hospital can become a conditioned response. Housecalls, then, offer a particularly desirable option for those who wish to limit their dog's exposure to infectious agents, such as guardians who practice natural rearing methods and either don't use vaccinations at all or limit their use significantly (particularly for well-puppy exams), or people whose dogs have a compromised immune system. [Post-Surgical Procedure Protective Collars or \"Coneheads\"](https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/health/post-surgical-procedure-protective-collars-or-coneheads/) The lampshade, satellite dish, or cone no matter what you call it, it is hard not to alternately laugh and feel sorry for any dog wearing one. Often used after surgical procedures, these cone-shaped collars are designed to keep dogs from licking sutures or wounds, potentially opening the wounds or tearing the stitches. They are also used to keep a dog with an injury or surgical site on his head from scratching it with his paws. [Supplements and NSAIDs for Dogs](https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/health/supplements-and-nsaids-for-dogs/) My brother's Lab retriever-mix was diagnosed with extensive cancer about a month ago.
