It is worth noting (marveling, really) that we now have an authorized vaccine for a novel virus that was isolated less than a year ago. And so far, the data that have emerged on the efficacy of the major vaccine candidates has been impressive, far exceeding the modest expectations that many of us had when vaccination trials were launched several months ago. Even before the pandemic there was a small but vocal anti-vaccine community, something that we at SBM [have written about regularly](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/reference/vaccines-and-autism/) since the blog's inception. COVID-19 has paradoxically not silenced this group, but has accelerated and arguably grown their rhetoric to the point where [widespread hesitancy to a COVID-19 vaccine has been reported in some countries](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1124-9). Amazingly, there are even those who still seem to believe that drugs like hydroxychloroquine are better than vaccination, because...vaccination is bad, apparently. And then there are those, like at least one US Senator, who seems to imply that a case of COVID-19 may actually be preferable to a vaccine. It's like the [measles parties](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/438150-new-york-officials-warn-parents-to-stop-holding-measles-parties-amid-latest), 2021 edition. Concerns about vaccination may not be as uncommon as you might think, even when COVID-19 is killing thousands every day. With that in mind I developed a short table that might help the uncertain decide between the vaccine, getting a COVID-19 infection, and for the handful of people that still think it's a useful COVID-19 therapy, hydroxychloroquine. |The Vaccine (e.g., | - ALC-0315 (DPSC) - cholesterol Salts (to balance the pH of the injection) - potassium chloride - monobasic potassium phosphate - sodium chloride - dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate Other - sucrose (to protect the nanoparticles in the state) [One notes:](https://pdf.hres.ca/dpd_pm/00033436.PDF) polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide. [the six trials I previously reviewed](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/dexamethasone-and-hydroxychloroquine-why-randomized-controlled-trials-matter/), 6,853 patients in RCTs, of which 2,619 received hydroxychloroquine.

Some seemingly rare [cases of re-infection](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/10/14/immunity-and-re-infection)have been documented but the actual incidence remains unknown (but is probably very low). How long natural immunity will last is unclear. [less than $30](https://www.goodrx.com/hydroxychloroquine). Conclusion: The SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could end the pandemic Evidence that has emerged on the Pfizer-BioNTech and also the Moderna vaccine give us good reason to be cautiously optimistic, perhaps for the first time in this pandemic. The fact that both of these vaccines show such high rates of efficacy is reassuring: Immunization of populations against this disease appears possible. These are the earliest days with these vaccines, however and there is a long road ahead of safety monitoring and follow-up as these vaccines are offered to thousands, and then millions of people. We will also see additional trials report and additional vaccines move forward for regulatory approval. It is absolutely possible that there will be some adverse events identified that we haven't seen yet. It is also very likely that vaccines will be blamed for events that are completely unrelated to the vaccine itself. But the alternative is killing thousands of people per day and injuring countless others, just in the United States alone, in a trend that continues to worsen with no end in sight. This is the largest logistical and immunization event of its kind in history. And we need it now. "}
