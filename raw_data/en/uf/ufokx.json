They offer groundbreaking new opportunities for the treatment of disease and injury. ATMPs can be classified into three main types: - gene therapy medicines: these contain genes that lead to a therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic effect. They work by inserting 'recombinant' genes into the body, usually to treat a variety of diseases, including genetic disorders, cancer or long-term diseases. A recombinant gene is a stretch of DNA that is created in the laboratory, bringing together DNA from different sources; - somatic-cell therapy medicines: these contain cells or tissues that have been manipulated to change their biological characteristics or cells or tissues not intended to be used for the same essential functions in the body. They can be used to cure, diagnose or prevent diseases; - tissue-engineered medicines: these contain cells or tissues that have been modified so they can be used to repair, regenerate or replace human tissue; In addition, some ATMPs may contain one or more medical devices as an integral part of the medicine, which are referred to as combined ATMPs. An example of this is cells embedded in a biodegradable matrix or scaffold. For detailed definitions of the different groups of [advanced therapy medicinal products](/en/glossary/advanced-therapy-medicinal-product), refer to [Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32007R1394) and [Directive 2001/83/EC](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1410944582971&uri=CELEX:02001L0083-20121116). In April 2020, EMA's [Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT)](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/committees/committee-advanced-therapies-cat) advised patients and the general public to beware of unproven cell-based therapies. This followed the appearance of advertisements for cell therapies as cures for serious conditions across the European Union in early 2020. In its statement, the [CAT](/en/glossary/cat) warned against the use of unregulated cell-based therapies, which may be ineffective and increase the risk of [serious adverse reactions](/en/glossary/serious-adverse-reaction). Healthcare providers should explain the benefits and risks of the cell-based therapies that they are providing to patients, as well as confirming that regulatory authorities have approved their use. Anyone with doubts can contact EMA or their [national competent authority](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/partners-networks/eu-partners/eu-member-states/national-competent-authorities-human). The [CAT](/en/glossary/cat)'s statement replaces a statement it issued in 2010 following reports of unregulated stem-cell therapies being offered to patients. All advanced therapy medicines are authorised centrally via the European Medicines Agency (EMA). They benefit from a single evaluation and authorisation procedure. As with all medicines, the Agency continues to monitor the safety and [efficacy](/en/glossary/efficacy) of advanced therapy medicines after they are approved and marketed. The Agency also gives scientific support to developers to help them design [pharmacovigilance](/en/glossary/pharmacovigilance) and [risk management systems](/en/glossary/risk-management-system) used to monitor the safety of these medicines. In October 2017, the European Commission and EMA published a joint action plan on ATMPs, which aims to streamline procedures and better address the specific requirements of ATMP developers. It contains several actions for the European Commission and EMA. In February 2018, as part of the joint action plan, EMA published - an update to the procedural advice on the evaluation of ATMPs. For more information, see [Marketing-authorisation procedures for advanced therapies](/en/human-regulatory/marketing-authorisation/advanced-therapies/marketing-authorisation-procedures-advanced-therapy-medicinal-products); - a draft revised [guideline](/en/glossary/guideline)on safety and [efficacy](/en/glossary/efficacy)follow up and risk management of ATMPs. For more information, see [Pharmacovigilance for advanced therapies](/en/human-regulatory/post-authorisation/advanced-therapies/pharmacovigilance-advanced-therapies). The action plan takes into account the ideas collected at an EMA-hosted [multi-stakeholder workshop](/en/events/multi-stakeholder-advanced-therapy-medicinal-products-atmps-expert-meeting-exploring-solutions) to explore solutions to challenges in the development of ATMPs. - List item Guide on advanced therapy medicinal products - Quality flowchart (PDF/144.33 KB) First published: 29/11/2021 Version 1.0 - List item Guide on advanced therapy medicinal products - Quality checklist (PDF/93.95 KB) First published: 29/11/2021 Version 1.0 - List item Guide on advanced therapy medicinal products - Non-clinical development checklist (PDF/92.83 KB) First published: 29/11/2021 Version 1.0 - List item Guide on advanced therapy medicinal products - Non-clinical development flowchart (PDF/145.37 KB) First published: 29/11/2021 Version 1.0 - List item Guide on advanced therapy medicinal products - Clinical development flowchart (PDF/147.32 KB) First published: 29/11/2021 Version 1.0 - List item Guide on advanced therapy medicinal products - Clinical development checklist (PDF/95.97 KB) First published: 29/11/2021 Version 1.0 Academic and non-profit organisations involved in developing promising advanced therapy medicines (ATMPs) can apply for EMA's increased support in meeting regulatory requirements. Up to five ATMP developers targeting unmet clinical needs will receive dedicated assistance that includes: - Guidance throughout the regulatory process, from manufacturing best practice to clinical development and follow-up planning on [efficacy](/en/glossary/efficacy)or safety issues - Fee reductions and waivers This EMA pilot aims to assess the level of regulatory support needed to boost the number of advanced therapy medicines that reach patients in the European Economic Area. It was launched in September 2022. Initial results are expected after three to four years. To apply for this EMA pilot, developers should fill in the application form below and send it to Guidance is also available to inform applicants on aspects such as: - List item Application form - ATMP academic development support pilot (DOCX/137.25 KB) First published: 26/01/2023 - List item Questions and answers on EMA pilot offering enhanced support to academic and non- profit developers of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs) (PDF/139.99 KB) First published: 26/01/2023 EMA/797476/2022 For more information about the pilot, those interested can also use the email address above to write to EMA, or they can contact their [national competent authorities](/en/glossary/national-competent-authority). EMA hosted a webinar on the pilot on 8 February 2023. It aimed to: Introduce the pilot, the supporting materials and how to apply Facilitate a questions and answers session A recording of the webinar is available below: Online training modules are available to help ATMP developers navigate the regulatory environment for these types of medicine. Developers can access these modules for free via the [TransMed Academy](https://eatris.eu/transmed-academy/) (login required). The modules cover the following subjects: - How to apply for ATMP classification - How to apply for an [environmental risk assessment](/en/glossary/environmental-risk-assessment)for ATMPs containing genetically modified organisms [Scientific advice](/en/glossary/scientific-advice)for ATMPs - ATMP certification - Quality as a critical step in clinical development of ATMPs Recorded webinars are also available on Youtube: [Navigating the regulatory requirements for ATMPs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-9l52XLWvc&list=PLt3sZpgW2qj7w0XT9UOvBwVdIJ8kEnr5I&index=10) [Scientific advice for advanced therapy medicinal products: What and when to ask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMX3Vt8WiV8) [Support for academic and non-profit ATMP developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tliKmJ_vtB8) EMA has produced these training materials together with [EATRIS](https://eatris.eu/) as part of the [ADVANCE EU training project](https://eatris.eu/projects/advance/) targeting developers. The Agency's [Committee for Advanced Therapies](/en/committees/committee-advanced-therapies-cat) ( [CAT](/en/glossary/cat)) plays a central role in the scientific assessment of advanced therapy medicines. It provides the expertise that is needed to evaluate advanced therapy medicines. During the assessment procedure, the [CAT](/en/glossary/cat) prepares a draft opinion on the quality, safety and [efficacy](/en/glossary/efficacy) of the advanced therapy medicine. It sends this to the [Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use](/en/committees/committee-medicinal-products-human-use-chmp) ( [CHMP](/en/glossary/chmp)). Based on the [CAT](/en/glossary/cat) opinion, the [CHMP](/en/glossary/chmp) adopts an opinion recommending or not the authorisation of the medicine by the European Commission. The European Commission makes its final decision on the basis of the [CHMP](/en/glossary/chmp) opinion. The [CAT](/en/glossary/cat) also: - gives recommendations on the [classification of advanced therapy medicines](/en/human-regulatory/marketing-authorisation/advanced-therapies/advanced-therapy-classification); - evaluates applications for [certification of quality and non-clinical data for SMEs](/en/human-regulatory/research-development/advanced-therapies/advanced-therapy-development/certification-procedures-micro-small-medium-sized-enterprises-smes), following which the Agency issues a certificate; - contributes towards giving [scientific advice](/en/human-regulatory/research-development/scientific-advice-protocol-assistance)on advanced therapy medicines; - is involved in any procedure regarding the provision of advice for undertakings on the conduct of [efficacy](/en/glossary/efficacy)follow-up, [pharmacovigilance](/en/glossary/pharmacovigilance)and [risk management systems](/en/glossary/risk-management-system)of ATMPs; - advises, at the request of the [CHMP](/en/glossary/chmp), on any [medicinal product](/en/glossary/medicinal-product)which may require, for the evaluation of its quality, safety or [efficacy](/en/glossary/efficacy), expertise in ATMPs; - assists scientifically in the elaboration of any documents related to the fulfilment of the objectives of Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007; - contributes towards an environment that encourages the development of advanced therapy medicines; - provides, at the request of the European Commission, scientific expertise and advice for any initiatives related to the development of [innovative medicines](/en/glossary/innovative-medicine)and therapies. Stem cells are naturally occurring cells in the body that have the ability to divide and produce a range of different cell types. Stem cells are important in the growth and development of the body, as well as in repair after injury. Stems cells are categorised as ATMPs when these cells undergo substantial manipulation or are used for a different essential function. They can be somatic-cell therapy products or [tissue-engineered products](/en/glossary/tissue-engineered-product), depending on how the medicine works in the body. EMA follows research into the use of stem cells in medicines very closely and is responsible for assessing [marketing authorisation applications](/en/glossary/marketing-authorisation-application) for medicines containing stem cells. The Agency has been advising developers of stem cell-based medicines for a number of years: - the [CAT](/en/committees/committee-advanced-therapies-cat)has classified a number of medicines containing stem cells as [ATMPs](/en/human-regulatory/marketing-authorisation/advanced-therapies/advanced-therapy-classification/summaries-scientific-recommendations-classification-advanced-therapy-medicinal-products); - the [Scientific Advice Working Party](/en/committes/working-parties-other-groups/chmp/scientific-advice-working-party)has given advice on the development of at least seven medicines containing stem cells; - the [Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products](/en/committees/committee-orphan-medicinal-products-comp)( [COMP](/en/glossary/comp)) has granted [orphan designation](/en/medicines/ema_group_types/ema_orphan)to a number of medicines containing stem cells for the treatment of rare diseases. - in December 2014, EMA recommended the [first ATMP containing stem cells](/en/news/first-stem-cell-therapy-recommended-approval-eu)for approval in the European Union. In February 2011, the Agency published a [reflection paper on stem cell-based medicinal products](https://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/scientific-guideline/reflection-paper-stem-cell-based-medicinal-products_en.pdf) . The paper stressed the fact that developers of stem-cell based medicines need to pay close attention to the way the medicines are manufactured, to ensure that the final medicine is as consistent and reproducible as possible. Pre-clinical and clinical testing also needs to take account of the cells' properties, ensuring that the possible risks of tumour development and rejection by the body are studied adequately and balanced against their benefits for patients. The [reflection paper](/en/glossary/reflection-paper) was adopted by the [CAT](/en/glossary/cat) on 14 January 2011. This followed a public consultation between March and June 2010 and discussion at a [public workshop in May 2010](/en/events/european-medicines-agencys-workshop-stem-cell-based-therapies) involving 230 participants from academia, industry and regulatory authorities.
