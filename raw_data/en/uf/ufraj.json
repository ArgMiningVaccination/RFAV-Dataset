Rooted in centuries-old principles, homeopathy is an alternative healing approach that goes against the usual methods of modern medicine. While many people believe in the curative powers of homeopathy, many scientists have difficulty aligning its concepts with well-established scientific understanding. Introduced in the late 18th century by German physician Samuel Hahnemann, homeopathy is a holistic approach to medicine that endures to this day. According to the 2012 National Health Interview Survey, about [5 million adults and 1 million children](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/homeopathy) Homeopathy draws upon age-old principles rooted in traditional healing practices and ancient beliefs about how the body and nature interact. The preparation of homeopathic remedies involves a process of dilution and shaking, with the notion that the more diluted a substance becomes, the more potent it is within the context of homeopathy. Homeopathic remedies are believed to work by triggering your body's innate healing responses. Homeopathy operates on the principle of \"like cures like.\" This means that a substance that can cause certain symptoms in a healthy person might be used to treat similar symptoms in someone who is sick. For instance, if you have a cold with a runny nose and watery, irritated eyes, a homeopath might suggest Allium cepa. This remedy is made from red [onion](/nutrition/foods/onions), which can cause similar symptoms. The idea is that the diluted remedy could help your body's natural defenses kick in to relieve your [cold symptoms](/health/common-cold-symptoms). The process involves highly diluting the original substance in water or alcohol. This diluted mixture is then vigorously shaken or \"potentiated.\" Homeopaths believe that through this process, the water or alcohol retains a memory or \"energetic imprint\" of the original substance, even when it's so diluted that there's often none of the original substance left. When a person takes a homeopathic remedy, it's thought to stimulate the body's vital force or healing energy, prompting the body to heal itself. This concept is somewhat like a gentle nudge to trigger the body's natural healing responses. Homeopathic remedies involve various substances derived from plants, minerals, and animals. These substances are diluted and potentiated through a series of dilution and shaking steps. Here are a couple of examples of how homeopathy might work for common conditions: - Headache: If you have a [headache](/health/headache)that feels throbbing and is worse on one side, a homeopath might recommend Belladonna as a remedy. [Belladonna](/health/belladonna-dark-past)is made from the deadly nightshade plant, which can cause similar symptoms. The diluted remedy is thought to trigger the body's natural responses to alleviate the headache. - Eye Infection: If you have red, watery, and irritated eyes from an [infection](/health/eye-health/home-remedies-for-eye-infection), a homeopath might consider the remedy Euphrasia, a flowering plant also known as [eyebright](/nutrition/eyebright). In its natural state, this plant can cause symptoms like redness, watering, and irritation of the eyes. - Fever and chills: If you have the [flu](/health/cold-flu/flu)with fever, chills, and muscle aches, a homeopath might consider the remedy Gelsemium. Gelsemium is made from the yellow jasmine plant, which can cause similar symptoms. The diluted remedy is thought to help the body's natural defenses kick in and alleviate these cold-related discomforts. Treatments in homeopathy are \"individualized,\" meaning they're customized for each person. It's not uncommon for individuals with the same condition to receive different treatment approaches. Homeopathy is often used to address a wide range of health conditions, both acute and chronic. Some common conditions that people seek homeopathic treatment for include: - allergies - cold and flu - respiratory issues - digestive disorders - skin conditions [anxiety and stress](/health/homeopathy-for-anxiety) - pain management - menstrual issues - muscle soreness and bruising - minor injuries - headaches - insomnia - arthritis [diabetes](/health/homeopathy-diabetes) When should homeopathy be avoided? Homeopathy should be avoided in certain situations: - serious conditions - emergency situations - chronic illness - severe infections - severe pain - pregnancy and nursing - potential for drug interactions While many people share positive experiences with homeopathy, especially when conventional medicine falls short, scientific trials yield mixed results. Some suggest positive effects, while others find no therapeutic benefit. [Critics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6399603/) [placebo effect](/health/placebo-effect). Many trials of homeopathy have had flaws in design, application, or sample size, and the evidence supporting its effectiveness is generally of lower quality compared to mainstream medicine. Homeopathic products aren't FDA-approved like conventional medications. They adhere to separate regulations in the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States. Still, its popularity endures among those seeking alternatives, even though its efficacy is debated. Homeopathy is generally considered safe by its practitioners, as the remedies are highly diluted and typically contain minimal or no active ingredients in the traditional sense. However, the safety of homeopathy is a subject of ongoing debate within the medical community due to several reasons: - Lack of regulation: Homeopathic products aren't subject to the same rigorous testing and regulation as conventional medications. - Delayed medical treatment: Relying solely on homeopathy to treat serious or chronic conditions may delay seeking necessary medical care, potentially allowing the condition to worsen. - Potential for allergic reactions: Some homeopathic remedies are made from substances that could trigger allergic reactions in sensitive individuals, even when highly diluted. - Interactions with conventional medications: Homeopathic products can potentially interact with prescription drugs or other supplements a person is taking, leading to unintended side effects or reduced effectiveness of treatment. It's crucial to note that if you're considering using homeopathic products, you should consult with a qualified healthcare professional, such as a medical doctor or a licensed [naturopathic doctor](https://naturopathic.org/search/custom.asp?id=5613). Homeopathy is similar to using a gentle nudge to encourage your body to heal on its own. It's based on the idea that if a substance can cause certain symptoms in a healthy person, using a highly diluted form of that substance might trigger your body to fight off similar symptoms when you're sick. The diluted substance is believed to gently prompt your body's natural healing responses. While these ideas might not align with mainstream science, many people still find value in homeopathy as an alternative approach to health. If you're considering using homeopathic medicine, it's a good idea to discuss it with your general practitioner to make sure it won't interfere with any conditions or medications you're taking. "}
