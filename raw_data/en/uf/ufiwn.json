The room was set up in such a way that each client received healing from at least 4 people throughout the day (we overlapped many clients, in order to make sure all had consistent access to the compassionate Helping Spirits). |The grid in its entirety| Our dear organizer, [Caroline Kenner](http://www.mythkenner.com/) , was instrumental in creating one of the most powerful and beautiful healing Crystal Grids I have ever witnessed. A large vortex of energy was centered around the large crystal in the middle of the grid. This assisted all of the healers in removing energetic blockages easily, and the vortex led to a world of [Helping Spirits](http://www.healingcoyote.com/2013/01/working-with-nagas-for-healing.html) that transmuted the blockages into neutral energy. |Central Vortex| There were also grids-within-grids. A [Past-Life](http://www.healingcoyote.com/2012/02/shamanic-healing-appointment-through.html) grid was set up at one end of the room: |Past Life Healing| While a powerful [Psychopomp](http://www.healingcoyote.com/2014/01/death-grief-and-psychopomp-work.html) grid was integrated at the other end of the room: |Psychopomp Healing| At the end of the Healing Ceremony (a few hours), we thanked all the Spirits who came and performed healing, and chowed down on some amazing pot-luck food! I placed an order with [Seoul Food](http://www.seoulfooddc.com/) earlier that morning, and INHALED the entire bowl of [Bibimbap](https://www.google.com/search?q=bibimbap&oq=bibimbap&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1867j0j4&sourceid=chrome&espv=210&es_sm=93&ie=UTF-8) like a Starving Coyote! I am very thankful to be able to do this work for the community that I love. We had such an amazing response, from both the Spirit World and the Physical World, that we hope to offer another one some time after the [Sacred Space Conference](http://www.sacredspacefoundation.org/) . Stay Tuned! |Hail the Spirts of Crystal, Stone, & Tree!| *All identifying images of clients have been removed, to protect anonymity. **Many thanks to ACD, AC, and "}
