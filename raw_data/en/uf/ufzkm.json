How We Ranked the Best THC Detox Products It is common for all THC detox supplement manufacturers to claim that their products completely cleanse all THC traces from your body. The extent to which this statement is correct depends on many factors. That is to say, not all THC detox supplements achieve their advertised claims. To differentiate between quality and counterfeit detox supplements, we employed the following metrics in our review: Test Passing Score The main objective of a THC and cannabis detox supplement is to remove any THC traces in the body. We tested each product where possible in the ranking and then conducted a drug test to ascertain their claims. After testing, we allocated a test passing rate for each THC detox product investigated. A higher ranking means that the product passed more tests. Honest Advertised Claims Deceptive marketing exaggeratedly presents THC detox supplements. Some companies claim that their products work instantaneously and can lead to a 100% successful drug test even if you took a \"spliff\" this morning. Unfortunately, there is no proof that THC detox supplements work, let alone on a short-term basis. With that in mind, our editorial team only ranked the THC companies that were straightforward and honest about the advertised benefits of their cannabis detox supplements. Testimonials, Customer Reviews, and Success Stories A key approach for determining the effectiveness of THC detox supplements requires a high reliance on testimonials and customer reviews. We considered THC detox products backed by thousands of online reviews claiming that the product had helped them ensure accurate rankings. Scientific Evidence There is no concrete evidence to prove that THC detox products significantly reduce THC traces in the body. However, we considered detox products with scientifically-backed ingredients such as Vitamin B2, zinc, vitamin B3, and antioxidant-rich fruits. Transparency & Manufacturer Reputation We acknowledge that the THC detox industry is a little shady by nature. That being the case, we preferred cannabis detox products created by upfront, honest, and reputable companies. Our list includes quality products by reputable manufacturers committed to helping customers pass drug tests. Easy, Fast, and Affordable Shipment Options If you are looking for a THC detox supplement, you most likely want it delivered as soon as possible. We ranked THC detox products with easy, fast, and affordable shipping costs. While most THC detox companies on our list offered free shipping, others included free overnight shipping, among other benefits. Ease of Use The surest way of passing a drug test is to exercise for six consecutive days while taking about 4 gallons of water daily. However, this is not achievable by everyone. That said, we preferred THC detox products that are easy to use and effective at the same time. Money-back Guarantee Some THC detox companies offer a money-back guarantee to instill customers' confidence. If the drug, for any reason, does not achieve its primary objective, then you can return it and claim for a refund. How Long Does Cannabis Stay in Your System? If you have used cannabis, THC traces remain in the body for 36 hours to three months. - Blood: 36 hours - Hair: 90 days - Urine: 3 days to a month, depending on consumption rate - Sweat: 1 to 2 weeks - Saliva: 24 hours The most common type of drug test uses your saliva or blood for work purposes. If you have ingested cannabis within the last 36 to 48 hours, THC traces could appear on the results sheet. The length of time THC remains on your body depends on usage. If you have been using cannabis for a prolonged period, it is most likely to stay in the system for longer. What Remains in the System After Using Cannabis? The consumption of marijuana introduces cannabinoids into the bloodstream. According to research, the cannabis plant contains dozens of cannabinoids introduced into the bloodstream whenever you ingest the plant. THC is one of the most popular cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant. It is well known for its psychoactive properties that induce a short-term high. Even though THC causes a short-term effect, its traces and those of the cannabinoids from the cannabis plant remain in the system long after the ingestion. The scientific reason is simple - THC and the other cannabinoids are absorbed in the body's fatty tissue since they are fat-soluble. As a result, THC traces are present in your fat deposits days after ingestion. Side Effects of Cannabis Detox and Withdrawal Several side effects are associated with cannabis detox, including headaches, insomnia, anxiety, stress, and sometimes, feelings of rage. These effects may range from one person to another, but the most common symptoms associated with THC and cannabis detox include: - Anxiety and depression - Stress - Irritability and anger - Shakiness and tremors - Nightmares and vivid dreams - Concentration loss - Mood swings and emotional instability are characterized by everything from euphoria to anger. - Loss of appetite Depending on the THC in your body, the withdrawal side effects may last anywhere from a few weeks to a month. People who have used cannabis for a long time are more likely to experience severer and prolonged side effects than light users. Natural Remedies for THC Withdrawal Here are a few tips to help you handle THC and cannabis withdrawal at home: - Exercise - Drink lots of water - Reduce caffeine intake - Take a warm shower - Reduce fat and cholesterol intake How Do Drug Tests Work? By understanding the work mechanisms of THC detox products, you also learn about how drug tests are done. Basically, the tests search for any traces of cannabinoids in your system. For example, a urine test investigates the traces of cannabinoids in your urine. Due to their effectiveness, simplicity, and affordability, urine tests are the most popular drug tests worldwide. Interestingly, urine tests can confirm the presence of cannabinoids up to 12 weeks after ingestion. Other standard drug tests procedures include blood, saliva, and hair drug tests. From the precedent, it is clear that drug tests are more innovative than it meets the eye. Drug tests are conducted to find traces of something known as THC-COOH. A metabolite, THC-COOH, is produced by the body as it processes the THC. THC in your fat cells makes it easy to trace THC-COOH a few days after ingestion. How Do THC Detox Products Work? THC detox manufacturers want their products to be recognized as the most effective. However, hardly half of the products in the market deliver the benefits they are advertised for. Another challenge is determining which form of products, whether capsule, shampoo, or powder, works best for you. The baseline remains that even the best products in the market work differently on different individuals depending on body composition. Some legitimate products may affect some individuals while showing some on others. Sometimes, misunderstanding how a product is designed to work can also fail a drug test. For instance, detox beverages are designed to flush out toxins such as creatine and THC through urine. Therefore, taking a drug test before the contaminated urine is released will test positive. These detoxification formulas use natural ingredients with proven antioxidant effects. Some of the most popular ingredients in the industry include: Dandelion Leaf Dandelions have high levels of beta carotene, which is an antioxidant. It also contains polyphenol antioxidants, primarily generated in the plant's flower but may also be extracted from the roots, leaves, and stems. The traditional remedy increases urination to aid the removal of toxins. Rhubarb Root contains high antioxidants such as proanthocyanidins and anthocyanins (responsible for its red color). Studies show that the plant has minimal anti-cancer, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. Rhubarb Root is highly effective in THC traces from the bloodstream. Burdock Root Burdock root is another powerhouse of antioxidants. It contains the likes of phenolic acids, quercetin, and luteolin. It was traditionally used against many illnesses, including the management of diabetes and some types of infections. The ingredient has also been used to restore skin youthfulness, reducing the damage caused by toxins. Goldenseal Root Also known as Orangeroot or Yellow Puccoon, this ingredient has treated different infections. It is mainly known for increasing the urination rate to remove toxins from the bloodstream. Different individuals prefer taking the detox in various forms depending on the situation, including powders, beverages, mouthwashes, and shampoos. Unlike most men, shampoos are primarily popular among females who strive to keep their hair long. THC detoxification shampoos perform like typical shampoos, only that they are designed around eliminating THC. They unclog your hair follicles and remove other toxins that may harm your hair health. You can also combine at least two forms to eliminate traces of THC, regardless of the type of drug test you are due to take. Saliva tests are cheap and unreliable to many organizations trying to get your test samples. However, we cannot oversee the likelihood of its implementation as an extra measure. According to studies, traces of THC can be detected in the mouth up to 72 hours after consumption. Mouthwash THC detoxification formulas are highly effective in cleaning THC from your mouth. Most of them take less than 30 minutes to clear THC. Nonetheless, these claims remain questionable until proven by more reliable studies. There is a slight possibility of passing a drug test after taking a detox treatment on the same day. The best way to remain safe is by refraining from consuming THC over a minimum of 7 days and complementing it with a detoxification formula. Scientific Evidence for THC Detox Products Avoiding THC is the best way to get rid of toxins from your body. However, it is sometimes not effective since passive smoking of marijuana can deposit some THC in your breathing system. In a 2015 study, researchers put non-smokers together with smokers for 60 in a sufficiently ventilated room. They observed that majority of the non-smokers tested positive for THC. You might also fail a drug test for eating poppy seed bagel, showing the presence of opioids. Studies show that exercise stimulates the body's natural detoxification process, eliminating THC. Reportedly, the fat-burning process during exercise leads to the release of THC. However, it is not assured that the THC released from fat cells will exit the body. In one 2013 study, researchers found that intensive exercise could reduce the concentration of THC in the blood plasma by up to 20%. Drinking a lot of water can also increase the elimination of THC from the body. Besides, some detox formula manufacturers use the water trick by recommending consumers to take dosages with a specific high amount of water. Research shows that the optimal amount of water per day is 2 liters. To experience more satisfying results, you should combine an increase in water consumption with vital nutrients such as Vitamin B2. There are multiple other tried and tested traditional remedies that come in handy for drug tests. Such include: Coffee Coffee is preferable in this category because it is categorized as a diuretic, which boosts the rate at which one passes urine. This means that a high intake of coffee improves the elimination of toxins from the body through urination. Coffee is also a potent antioxidant that enhances the natural detoxification process. Some studies suggest using water, electrolytes, and strong coffee. When anticipating a drug test in a few days, such a potent combination cleanses from multiple angles, helping attain excellent drug test results. Apple Cider Vinegar Multiple studies have verified Apple cider vinegar due to the presence of anecdotal elements which are effective at detoxifying the body. The solution also contains antimicrobial elements mostly present in vinegar. The drink also accelerates body metabolism hence faster breakdown of any THC present in the body. Despite the numerous advantages, do not overuse apple cider as it is acidic and could lead to hyper acidic symptoms such as damaging the mouth. Cranberry Juice Cranberry is most common for enhancing optimal urinary tract health, which explains why it is highly recommended for drug tests. Contrary to the elements present in apple cider vinegar, the cranberry drink is not acidic. The best way to consume the cleansing portion is by mixing the juice with water for better access to major organs, including the lymphatic system, kidneys, and the small and large intestines. Seven days of consistent use helps maximize detoxification leading to excellent drug test scores. Additional benefits of cranberry juice are that it is a natural diuretic, increasing the rate at which one passes urine. Lemon This is a common remedy for most people who mix it with water in their daily drinking portions. The combination accelerates the body's natural detoxification process, and with continued use, it boosts one's overall health. Lemon alone has not been proven to aid in passing drug tests. Some experts say it is not potent enough, but when used with other remedies. Additional Remedies Traditional or natural remedies are preferable when considering detoxification as they do not leave any residues in the body. Many remedies proposed by online sources feature the components described in this review, including honey, apple cider vinegar, cinnamon, lemon juice, cayenne pepper, ground ginger, and obviously, lots of water. Other professionals advise keeping on a stringent diet of grapefruit, broccoli, mung beans, and garlic to clear any traces of THC content in the body. Only a small body of scientific research provides conclusive evidence for the efficiency of some of these elements but considering that they have continually been used for many decades, they definitely impact the body's detoxification process. Better results are attained with long-term use of the described detox concoctions. Can You Use Fake Pee To Pass A Drug Test? Fake pee is a straightforward way to evade drug detection during tests. But the trick is common to the extent that the people who carry out drug tests have mastered working around such tactics. According to a 2019 study, researchers gave out fake and real urine to a group of military testers. According to the researchers, most testers could identify the fake urine by looking. However, all urine samples showed positive results when tested. Therefore, there are limited chances that you might pass a urine drug test by using artificial urine, as long as the tester does not identify it. It is believed that niacin, a form of Vitamin B3, can flush out toxins from your circulatory system. However, limited studies confirm this. According to some researchers, consuming too much niacin can lead to intoxication. FAQs about THC Detox Supplements Our experts occasionally receive questions about THC detox and how it works.
