Plasma coatings havebeenformed from awide variety ofmonomers. films could bedeposited after suitable substrate preparation andreactor operation parameters were established. Ithasbeen ourexperience that ageneral cleaning basic definitions were laiddown toguide research efforts inthebiomaterials area.The definition adopted was: \"Biomaterials asany intocontact withbody tissues orfluids. Biomaterials research isaimed toward providing the biomedical community with thebestpossible materials needed toaidintherestoration ofbodily function and/or appearance. This research isdirected towards obtaining knowledge which includes anyinformation Research intoplasma deposited polymers has grown recently tocover awide ofPure andApplied Chemistry recently released atabulation showing some 150 investigators, located inAustralia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, France, Ger- many, Italy, Japan, TheNetherlands, NewZealand, Switzerland, and theUnited Kingdom, who are actively working onsome phase ofplasma chemistry 1 orplasma physics. Also,some 100investigators in States arepursuin*;; similar endeavors. Theresearch topics range from veryfundamental mechanistic considerations toplasma technology, processing and applications. This work encom- passes almost every Held ofengineering three main areas of plasma deposited polymers: (1)synthesis and characterization, (2)polymerization mechanisms and (3)applications. When discussing biomedical applications, itis important tounderstand thedifferences between linear polymers andthose polymers thesame monomers. For instance, conventional linear polymers, such as those derived from styrene, methyl methacrylate, vinyl acetate, and vinyl chloride, areproduced by either free radical orionic mechanisms. The re- sulting polymers consist ofcoiled chains these polymers areplaced in canbemelted extruded andcan networks. Thepolymer resulting from formulation intheplasma isnolonger soluble ingoodthermodynamic organic solvents. Plasma deposited polymers arenoteven swollen. Infact, plasma polymers have been refluxed in solvents forupto7dayswithonly a weight polymers donotmelt, therefore cannot butonly decompose atcomparatively higher temperatures. Also, plasma deposited polymers have shown considerably higher chemical resistance toreducing oroxidizing environments than conventional polymers. This from aDCdischarge inanevacu- atedWood's tube.The silent discharge operated at much lower temperatures andwould prove tobe much more useful inchemical synthesis [1].' Shortly after plasmas were observed, funda- mental studies oftheir behavior were carried out primarily byphysicists with little regard chemical aspects orpossible applications ofthese plasmas.

They arenotuseful in organic chemical synthesis since they operate at several thousand degrees Kelvin. The other type ofplasma isthe silent plasma which operates inavacuum andover alarge temperature range which maybecontrolled bythe power input totheplasma generator. There are fiveimportant types ofthesilent ornondisruptive discharge. The first istheglow discharge which is established inlowpressure gases bylowfrequency rfapplied across electrodes sealed intothereaction tube. discharge which isformed bypassing radiofrequency current through acoilsurrounding the tube. Third, thepoint discharges are established between conductive points operating atahigh so asnottocause operate highpower levels andremain at essentially ambient temperatures. For thisreason they are usually chosen fororganic synthesis studies. Plasma Mechanisms. The initial discharge while represent reactions toform neutral species. Free radicals areanother type ofactive species radical thathasbeenobserved byspectroscopy techniques. radicals canpropagate formation ofasmall organic molecule todifferent molecules. Forexample. Coats [4]identified 25 different hydrocarbon compounds after passing 7i-hexane through amicrowave discharge plasma.

In ablation ofthepolymers was reported. With alkane polymers ahighly oxidized surface was created which had vastly improved wettability characteristics.

After the samples tobecoated have been cleaned, care is taken nottocontaminate thesurface through im- proper storage orhandling. 4 Figure 3.Research reactor. Figure 4.Applications reactor. The substrate isthen loaded into toobtain additional substrate through gas andthesubstrate. Similar treatments have alsobeen effective inremoving therftransmitter andload.

Several interesting systems have been developed through thisspecial synthesis technique. Other related work hasbeen completed recently which involves hnear polymer film interactions with plasmas. Both plasmas ofpolymerizable gases havebeenfound superior tothecapacitively coupled reactors intheapplications investigated.

Forexample, and Future Work The early work oftheauthors involving the coating ofbioelectrodes and various implantable substrates went wellandyielded promising results. Itappears that this early work stayed within the then undefined tolerance limits ofsubstrate prep- aration, reaction parameters andcoating techniques.

These findings only partially Itfinally became necessary tocurtail allroutine intothecause andeffect ofthevarious parameters upon the final properties ofthepolymer films.

These effects areinfluenced by both the specific metallic elements and their rate ofdischarge (corrosion rate) under invivo conditions. 2.Research Approach New,improved implant alloys together with rapid, sensitive methods forpredicting their invivo performances areurgently needed.

Itfollows thattheselection ofnewimplant alloys requires aninterdisciplinary research team, competent intheareas ofmetallurgy, corrosion, orthopaedic surgery, inflammatory response and systemic effects. 3.Corrosion Studies 3.1.Background There aretwo general features important in evaluating the corrosion characteristics ofa material. These aretherateandtype ofcorrosive attack. Forimplant applications, thecorrosion rate determines theamount offoreign compounds released intosurrounding tissues. Toavoid significant local reaction, animplant must corrode ataveryslow rate. Ingeneral, rates twoorthree orders ofmagnitude lower than those commonly employed inconventional industrial practice arenecessary [3].Themeasurement of such verylowrates introduces experimental lossmethods tive. Fortunately, electrochemical methods [3-8J, particularly hnear polarization techniques and charging curve analyses [3],areideally suited for themeasurements ofultra lowrates. Briefly, these methods involve themeasurement ofthepotential- current relationships ofacorroding specimen near itscorrosion potential. Over apotential range of 10mvorless, there isahnear techniques havebeen verified under invitro and invivo conditions. Corrosion rates, especially those ofalloys alsobeaccomplished that characteristic changes in thecorrosion potential alsoaccompany (hght and electron) tech-niques. Such methods are also very useful for examining specimens after invivoexposure. 3.2.Procedures Pretreatments ofimplants, such assterihzation procedures, cause marked under invitro and invivoenvironments possible implant alloys itisimportant that they betested with a representative surface finish after exposure to typical chnical sterilization techniques. Where possible, highly pohshed surfaces which havebeen exposed tohigh temperature steam ordryheat sterilization forlong periods have been employed since these conditions yield surfaces with the greatest corrosion resistance [10]. Thecorrosion rates ofvarious implant alloys are being measured asafunction oftime using linear andtransient linear polarization methods together with charging curve analyses [3].Also,when ap- phcable, passive current-time measurements [10] areused tomonitor measurements aresimpler thanhnear polarization techniques andtheyhave theadded advantage of permitting continuous monitoring ofcorrosion rate during the test period. Corrosion rates are monitored forperiods ranging between 100hours andseveral months depending onthebehavior of aparticular system. The corrosion rate ofmost metals decreases most promising materials willbesubjected tolong term tests inboth invitroandinvivoenvironments. Resistance tocrevice corrosion electrochemical measurements. Since thecorrosion potential must bemonitored during hnear polarization measurements, potential changes which accompany theinitiation rate ofimplant alloys [8].Although the absolute value ofthecorrosion rates measured under these conditions may notcorrespond toin vivoenvironments, they aresufficiently accurate to determine corrosion rate tobeconsidered forfurther testing.
