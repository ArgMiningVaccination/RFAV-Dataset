Yes, it's calculable: The mass of all life forms on Earth - humans, animals, bacteria, fungi, even viruses. Scien tists have developed sophisticated ways to do the math. They arrived at the figure of one teraton as the dry weight of the biomass; that's a 1 with 12 zeros. The researchers say the weight of life appears to remain constant, but the composition of the biomass is undergoing rapid change. Human intervention is knocking our world off balance. 264951 004Can Algorithms Make Us Healthy? Big Data is the motor of our age. Inevitably, it is also being applied to healthcare. After all, the human body harbors no end of data: in cells, in DNA, in pro teins. In fact, the sheer volum e of data is too large to be used for our health management. That's why scientists are working on algorithms aimed at helping us to better understand our bodies. The result could be a medical avatar for each and every person - an artificial-intelligence application that keeps a close eye on all our physical data and warns us when something's not right. 264951 005 Can We Dig Our Way Through the Earth? We have a pretty good understanding of the universe these days. But when it comes to the ground beneath our feet, the further down we try to look, the less we see. Ground exploration is expensive and technically challenging. But scientists have nevertheless managed to tease considerable insights from the stone and ice, the archive of our Earth. And now, researchers plan to go deeper than ever before: with the help of a powerful drilling vessel, they hope to penetrate the oceanic crust - and reach the Earth's mantle for the very first time. 264951 006What do Animals Talk About? Although we humans speak many different languages, we have always found ways to communicate with each other. In the old days with dictionaries, nowa- days with translation apps. What if there was an app to translate animal noises? Something to help us interpret the neighing of a horse, the trumpeting of an elephant and the mewing of a cat? Researchers say that the vocal language of animals is a window on their soul. If we can learn to decipher it, perhaps we might gain a deeper understanding of animals - and be better at protecting them too. 264951 007 Can Geoengineering Save the Climate?CO 2 emissions are heating up the planet and stoking climate change. It is so advanced that it cannot be halted through changes in individual behavior. What possible solutions are there? The science of geoengineering is developing and testing processes that could help us to slow and alleviate the impact of global warming. But they too come with their own set of consequences. How can geoengineering help us and, if it is to be effective, what are the prerequisites? 264951 008How is Migration Impacting Our World? There are many factors driving migration. Some of these are likely to be exacerbated in the future. For example, technological developments that oust people from the workplace, as well as demographic changes and economic crises that force people to seek employment elsewhere. And then, of course, there is climate change. Global interconnectedness also contributes to migration. It can rock political systems and has an economic impact. We look beyond the myths about migration and ask: Whom does it really benefit? 264951 009Could We Live on the Moon?\"That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind,\" said astronaut Neil Armstrong, who in 1969 became the first man to set foot on the Moon. Half a century later, plans are afoot, involving several nations, to launch new missions to the moon. The goal now is for people to spend longer periods of time there. The question is how to make use of resources found on the Moon. Scientists are exploring ideas about how life on the Moon might be made possible with the help of sunlight, ice water and lunar dust.264951 010A World Without Slime?Many children are told that slime is disgusting - and continue to think that as adults. But scientists say slime has amazing qualities and is essential for life. Slime can slide and stick, close and open. It can trap and confuse pathogens. Slime has a particular physical state: it's a non-Newtonian fluid. And therein lies its secret. Researchers are exploring the capabilities of the slippery substances that are found throughout the natural world. 264951 011Is Cryptocurrency the Better Money?Cryptocurrencies have been sending shockwaves through the financial sector since their introduction. They have made some people millionaires and bankrupted others. What's the technology behind cryptos? Do Bitcoin & Co. have any advantages over traditional money? Why do they worry many economists? Red flags include extreme price fluctuations and the voracious energy consumption involved in crypto mining. Crypto advocates believe the new kind of money is here to stay. Whoever might be right, cryptocurrencies have triggered an intense debate about the nature of money and central banks. 264951 012Are Computers Prejudiced?Who gets the job? Who gets the loan? And who has to go to jail? Decisions on such questions are made by people, who can be swayed by bias. If these decisions were entrusted to artificial intelligence, would that guarantee neutrality? AI systems are already used in sensitive areas of this kind. But can we be sure that these systems are working without discrimination? Or are we expecting too much from computers? Could one even teach them moral conduct? SCIENCESCIENCEMore Life Decoding the Secret of Ageing Most people want to live to an old age. But few want to be old. Because age means decay, limitations, disease. But does it have to be this way? Or can we grow very old and still retain good health? \"The first person who'll turn 150 years old has probably already been born,\" say some scientists - and they should know. Because they're tackling the root cause of the problem: not age-related illness, but the aging process itself. But what's the secret of long life without aging biologically to the same extent? In telomeres, the ends of chromosomes, which are longer in Costa Rica centenarians than in other people? Is it enough to zap what are known as \"zombie\" cells, present in all of us? At least scientists are now able to measure our biological age regardless of our actual age in years. An invention by one of the gurus of longevity research Steve Horvath has made that possible. Instead of: \"How old are you?\", will we soon be asking: \"What age does your biological clock show?\" It's not implausible. We've already got a first app, devel- oped in Hong Kong, promising to \"protect\" us from aging. And there are young biohackers such as Nina Khera from Boston, who want everyone to benefit from such research. If it's possible to delay human aging one day, how about reversing the process altogether? Greg Fahy is conducting research in California on the thymus gland. His initial study on humans showed that by taking certain medication, they shaved an average two-and-a-half years off their age. The race to crack the human longevity code currently resembles a scientific goldrush, with researchers competing for fame and investors' favor. It's quite possible that scientists may soon begin to realize humanity's age-old dream of eternal youth. They have already moved beyond the ongoing debate on the many social and economic implications of extending certain people's lifespans. 284941 Documentary, 01 x 60 min.,2021, 4K;Arabic, English, German, Spanish 284942 Documentary,01 x 45 min.,2021, 4K; Arabic, English, German, Spanish WW, VoD, M, IFE SCIENCE Reaching for the Stars Ourplanetand Portuguese, Russian, Spanish; VoD, M, IFE, LR 264898 002 The Centerpiece of the Apollo Missions - The Saturn V RocketThecenterpiece oftheApollomissionswas English, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish; VoD, M, IFE, LR264898 003 Is There Life Beyond Portuguese, Russian, Spanish; VoD, M, IFE, LR 264898 004 Our Link to Russian, Spanish; VoD, M, IFE, LR 264898 Documentary,21 x 30 min.,Arabic, English, Spanish 17 x 30 min., Russian 12 x 30 min., PortugueseSCIENCE 264898 005 Living in Space - Fantasy English, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish; VoD, M, LR Portuguese, Russian, Spanish; VoD, M, LR 264898 007 Space Junk - English, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish; VoD, M, LR264898 008 Rendezvous for Peace - Portuguese, Russian, Spanish; VoD, LR 264898 009 Portuguese, Russian, Spanish; VoD, M, IFE, LR 264898 010 Microorganisms Arabic, English, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish; VoD, M, IFE, LR SCIENCE 264898 012 Where Will We Live? - The Colonization of Space Overpopulation, catastrophic climate change or a basic urge to discover new places: There are many reasons why humans may one day seek to make their home far from Earth.

This comes with its own particular set of challenges. If the conditions are right, the missions will outlive their developers. These probes will need to function with complete autonomy, as out in interstellar space, remote-controlled maneu- vers are not possible. And new modes of propulsion will be needed, as conventional rocket boosters won't be enough to provide the necessary thrust. The technological requirements for future space travel are being developed in many laboratories around the world.

It's highly likely that in other solar systems there are planets with the conditions to sustain life. But what might organisms there look like? If they exist, how likely is it that they have developed in a similar way to life forms on Earth? Evidence suggests that a similar evolutionary process may well have taken place on distant celestial bodies under conditions comparable to those on Earth.

Sometimes, after someone has broken the law, he or she might say, \"I don't even know why I did it.\" We tend to think that is just an excuse because we humans are in fact always in charge of our actions. But neurologists see it differently. Not only have they discovered that this assessment is way off the mark, they have also found out why some people commit serious crimes. These findings are forcing society and the judiciary to rethink how to call criminals to account and punish them; but also how to help them find their way back to leading a normal life again.

Time pressure and too much work can make people ill. Studies show that multi-tasking is ineffective and inefficient: The more tasks someone takes on, the slower he or she becomes and the more prone to making mistakes. Have we reached the point where our brain can no longer process the information coming its way? The answer is yes, say some neurologists, sociologists and IT experts. They recommend: Rebuild your attention span, take breaks , and insist on the right to turn off digital devices. Some go a step further and say: Rather than us adapting to the devices, it's the devices that should be adapted to our needs.

But from a historical point of view, this is a frequently documented phenomenon with some well-known sufferers. Scientific research into the condition has yielded some surprising insights: brain scans show that those affected do actually perceive the internal voices as an auditory experience.

Moreover, our brain has a very close relationship with the objects that our hands touch or shape. Our ideas concerning our surroundings, separating the important from the unimportant, derive to a great extent from such hands-on experiences. Nowadays, however, many people spend a lot of time sitting in front of a computer. Are we demanding too little of our brains?

There is evidence that genetic factors may have a role to play in such behavior. Recent research, however, has shown that many people with this predisposition never become violent. In other cases, the propensity for violence seems to lessen in middle-age and the capacity for remorse sets in. Some scientists say the capacity for lethal violence derives from our evolutionary past.

He's an expert on a state of matter that was predicted by Albert Einstein - Bose-Einstein condensation. Immanuel Bloch has now taken things a step further. He has become the first to crack the Bose-Einstein condensation wave and regularly arrange several hundred of these special atoms into a glowing grid. In the future, grids like these could make up the basic elements of a new kind of supercomputer. 124665 007Cloned Atoms Through Teleportation For the first time ever, Rainer Blatt was able to transfer the state of one atom to another. Although the process is called 'teleportation', no matter is transported from one spot to another. Instead, information leaps the gap. To achieve his goal, Blatt made use of what Albert Einstein described as the 'spooky action-at-a-distance between particles'. The discovery is a scientific sensation, even though the teleporting distances crossed up until now have only been a few hundredths of a millimeter.124665 001Nuclear Medicine: A Formula and its Results When an atom in a radioactive element decays, then part of the matter that makes up its nucleus is transformed into energy. This is part of the proof that backs up Einstein's realization that mass and energy are two sides of the same coin. Without Einstein's discovery that is expressed in the formula E=mc\u00b2, some later medical developments would not have been possible. Artificially produced radioactive substances known as radiopharmaceuticals play a major role in modern medical diagnostics and research. 124665 002Satellite Navigation - Einstein's Contribution to Galileo Time is relative - in the field of satellite navigation, Einstein's theory has practical applications. In space, clocks tick differently than they do on Earth. But the accuracy of satellite navigation systems is depen- dent on how precisely the atomic clocks on board can measure time. 124665 003The Speed of Light - Part 1: Light Researchers At the root of Albert Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity is the assumption that the speed of light never changes.

European researchers now want to conduct an experiment in space to find out. 124665 004The Speed of Light - Part 2: Radar Satellite The speed of light also standardizes the exact length of a meter. That's important for large-scale surveys like those slated to be carried out by the radar satellite TerraSAR-X.

Albert Einstein received the Nobel Prize in 1921 for his explanation of this phenomenon. 124665 011The Search for a Theory of Everything For much of his life, Albert Einstein sought a formula that would describe and encompass all four funda- mental forces. He failed to find a unifying theory. The tunnel in Geneva is huge - and it runs in a circle that's 27 kilometers long. Thousands of scientists all over the world are waiting with bated breath for experiments to begin in the Large Hadron Collider. It's hoped that the gargantuan apparatus will be able to generate a kind of small scale Big Bang, lasting for just fractions of a second, that will recreate the conditions just after the birth of the universe. 124665 012Time Travel Through Wormholes - Nothing More than a Dream? As early as 1935, Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen recognized that relativity theory did not rule out 'bridges' through space-time. Today, we call these hypothetical pathways 'wormholes'. Physicists nowadays admit that time travel through wormholes is at least theoretically possible, although journeys into the past or future have remained firmly in the realm of science fiction. 124665 008 Cosmic Telescopes: Discovering Distant Galaxies According to a theory first put forward by Albert Einstein, a large body of mass curves space and the light that traverses it. Clusters of galaxies create what are known as gravitational lenses. Astrophysicist Joachim Wambsgan\u00df has spent years studying this phenomena in deep space. He searches and maps massive celestial objects such as galaxies that possess strong gravitational fields. These curve or bend the space around them, and force light from even more distant galaxies and objects into a curved rather than a straight trajec- tory. The process also 'bundles' the light, focusing and increasing its intensity. 124665 009Racing down Einstein's Paths Molecules in gas and fluids tend to behave in unor- dered and random ways. This phenomenon, first identified by the Scottish botanist Robert Brown and therefore named Brownian Motion, was also of great interest to Albert Einstein. In 1905, he published his studies on Brownian Motion. Today, his findings can help researchers solve many of the problems linked to the movement of particles.

Distribution is often so inefficient that large amounts of produce perish, while people in other places go hungry. One solution would be to grow food in or close to cities - vertically to limit land usage. The practice has already been tried and tested. Vertical farming technologies are eco-friendly, resilient to weather conditions and produce higher crop yields than conventional methods. If used in conjunction with other sustain- ability strategies, the approach could help to solve our food supply problems.

The area's biodiversity - and the livelihoods that depend on it - are under threat from urbanization, mass tourism, climate change and industrial farming. To counter this trend, a new generation of Alpine farmers are reverting to traditional techniques, planting ancient crops and breeding indigenous livestock.

But it's precisely this kind of knowhow concerning the rhythms of nature, passed down through gen- erations, that can safeguard sustainable food pro - duction methods and protect their fundamentals - fertile soil and species diversity. Against the backdrop of this realization, more and more farmers - in industrialized nations too - are finding new confi- dence and successfully practicing approaches such as allowing calves to remain with their mothers, agroforestry, breeding dual-purpose chickens and cultivating thousands of tomato varieties.

In order to enable the Sikhs from India to make a pilgrimage to one of their holiest shrines, a \"peace corridor\" has been opened between the two countries. Sikhs constitute the fourth largest religious community in India, but find themselves are caught between India and Pakistan, between Hindus and Muslims. The majority of Sikhs worldwide live on the Indian subcontinent. The hostile relations between India and Pakistan since partition in 1947 meant that for decades Sikhs were unable to visit their holiest shrine. Despite ongoing political tensions - especially concerning Kashmir - 73 years after their separation, India and Pakistan have fulfilled a promise that was made 20 years ago: on the occasion of the 550th birthday of the founder of their religion, Sikhs in India can now use a new border crossing to make a pilgrimage to the mausoleum of Guru Nanak in Kartarpur, Pakistan - four kilometers behind the border. The Kartarpur Corridor was opened on schedule by the prime ministers of the two countries - albeit not in a joint ceremony. Both spoke of a new \"Peace Corridor\". The opening of the corridor on 9 November 2019, the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, was no coincidence; Indian prime minister Narendra Modi directly compared the two historic events. This documentary accompanies an Indian Sikh who goes to Pakistan for the first time as part of a very special pilgrimage, while for outsiders also providing a better understanding of Sikhs as well as India and Pakistan. 864936 Documentary, 01 x 30 min., 2020, HD; Arabic, English VoD, M, IFEBetween India and Pakistan The Sikh Dilemma \u00a9 picture alliance/AP Photo/Ch.

So far, 23 objects have been returned to Namibia, although only on loan. The renowned Namibian fashion and costume designer Cynthia Schimming, who was also involved in the project, has called for the works to be returned unconditionally. Many have asked that the same be done with the Benin Bronzes, some of the most renowned and controversial pieces in the Berlin collection. These masterpieces, which once adorned the royal palace in the Kingdom of Benin (in present-day Nigeria), were plundered by British troops as part of a punitive expedition in 1897. They were then sold on the international art market; many ended up in various European museums. They have become a touchstone for whether the Humboldt Forum will really break new ground and dare to enter into a cultural exchange on a level playing field. It was recently decided that part of the collection would be restit uted, but some of the Benin Bronzes will be displayed at the Humboldt Forum. The question is how to do this appropriately. For Jonathan Fine, ethnological museums today need to make it clear that Europe's history is closely intertwined with colonialism: \"I think it would be a success if we take the idea of a forum at its word and think of the Humboldt Forum, not as a place that will give us answers to our questions, but will enable us to pose questions about the past and the present and to bring in more voices, wider voices and different perspectives on what those questions mean. Only in that way, I think, can we come to an understanding and find answers for ourselves about what 500 years of European colonization has meant for the world we live in.\" The Humboldt Forum in the capital Berlin is Germany's biggest cultural project. Intended as a place of dialogue, it houses exhibitions on the history of the German capital, as well as the Ethnological Museum and the Museum of Asian Art. And indeed, the ethnological collections have been the focus of many controversial debates. Many of the objects, acquired during the colonial period, are tainted with blood. What does this mean for the Humboldt Forum exhibitions? How should such works be dealt with generally? Amidst the contro- versy surrounding looted art, the discussion about provenance research and how to curate sensitive exhibitions, we joined the head of the Ethnological Museum, Jonathan Fine, at his workplace in Berlin and on an earlier trip to Cameroon. In 2017, Fine conducted research into one of the collection's most impressive objects, a royal throne from the Kingdom of Bamum. He was searching for answers: How did it come to be in Germany? Was it a diplomatic gift to the German Kaiser or a forced gesture of submission? Is it a case for restitution? If it were up to Cameroonian curator and art critic Bonaventure Ndikung, Germany would have to present Cameroon with an important artwork in return - as a true act of diplomacy. Another research project explores Germany's colonial past in Namibia. Official German acknowl- edgement of the Herero genocide didn't come until 2016. Many treasures looted during the colonial period are still in German museum collections. As part of the provenance project, researchers looked at the history, significance and artistic potential of 1,400 objects from Berlin's collections in cooperation with the Museums Association of Namibia. 364947 Documentary, 01 x 30 min.,2021, HD;Arabic, English, German, Spanish WW, VoD, M, IFE WORLD ISSUES Stolen Soul Africa's Looted Art European museums 01 x 45 min., 2020, HD; Arabic, English, Spanish WW, VoD, M, IFEWORLD ISSUES They Called Them \"The Children of Shame\" A Tale of Prejudice VoD, M, IFE, LR WORLD ISSUES 884903 Documentary, 01 x 45 min.,2018, HD;Arabic, English, German, d'etatin1973,andlivedinexilein WestGermany.A/f_ter the Escape Finding a Home in a Foreign Land WORLD ISSUES 864843 Documentary, 06 x 30 min.,2015, HD;English WW, VoD, Buthehasnochoicebuttokeepgoing.

Its active ingredient still makes headlines today, as an illegal drug with devastating side- effects: methamphetamine, or crystal meth. In the short-term, it improves performance and concen- tration and dulls anxiety, appetite and sensitivity to cold.

Renowned directors, some of them refugees from the Nazis, dedicated themselves to documentaries and filmed on the frontline. What motivated them, how did they tread the fine line between reality and propaganda?

It was incumbent upon the German commander of the city, Gener al Diet rich von Cholt itz, to carry out this order. He had already played a role in the extermination of the Jews in eastern Europe. Nevertheless, he defied the orders of the F\u00fchrer, and became known as the Nazi general who spared Paris. But what do the facts tell us? Did von Choltitz have the military resources to carry out destruction on such a massive scale?

The annihilation of those they deemed inferior was just as much part of the grand plan as the establishment of homes for the birth and post-natal care of \"racially valuable\" and \"genetically healthy\" children, some of them the product of extramarital relationships between women and members of the SS. These children would be taken away from their parents and raised by families who were adherents of Nazism. The long-term goal was the formation of a kind of Nazi elite. The homes were run by an association called \"Lebensborn\", or \"Fount of Life\". More than 20,000 \"Lebensborn\" children were born in Germany and other European nations between 1936 and the end of the war. Their fate bears tragic witness to the Nazis' inhumane ideology.

Thanks to a Russian interpreter and a German dental assistant, both of them women, the Soviets were able to iden- tify Hitler's remains. Nevertheless, Stalin publicly maintained that Hitler's body had not been found. He also blamed his allies for supporting the Nazi leader's apparent escape. What were his intentions? And what happened to the two women who thought they had helped to establish the truth?

The confrontation was de-escalated just in time to avoid war. But what few people know is that there was another contributing factor: the earlier stationing on the Murge plateau in southern Italy of American nuclear missiles - within striking distance of the Soviet Union.

Fearing the spread of communism, the United States initially joined the conflict in secret, later openly and with increasing ferocity in the fight against North Vietnam and its Chinese and Soviet sponsors. After US public opinion turned against the war in response to heavy losses and reports of frontline brutality, peace talks began in Paris in 1968. A breakthrough was achieved in separate, secret talks between US National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho, a member of North Vietnam's politburo, which resulted in the 1973 Paris Peace Accords and the withdrawal of US forces.

For many years, Arno Brandlhuber has been stirring up the European architectural scene with his innovative approaches. The two architects have a similar understanding of sustainability: the less that is newly produced and the more use that is made of existing materials, the better the eco-balance of a building. Both are vehement opponents of the current demolition mania. In many of his structures, such as the Xiangshan Campus in Hangzhou, Wang Shu utilizes bricks from demolished villages. Some of those bricks are centu- ries old. Traditional craft techniques are practiced on his building sites. Wang Shu designs attractive and comfortable homes for the rural population as a way of stemming mass migration to cities. Arno Brandlhuber sees potential where others only see ruins. The architect prefers to work with structures that already exist, transforming them into attractive spaces for living and working through ingenious and imaginative design.

On religious holidays and on the Sabbath Jews pronounce a blessing over cups of wine. For the ancient Greeks and Romans wine also had symbolic significance; it was poured out in libations to the gods. The Book of Genesis names Noah as the first winegrower. After rescuing humans and animals during the Great Flood he is said to have planted the first vines on Earth. The parables that Jesus of Nazareth told are full of references to vineyards, grapevines and wine. The Catholic Mass, a religious commemoration of Jesus' death and resurrection, is based on his actions during the Last Supper, when the savior is said to have taken wine, blessed it, and given the cup to his disciples saying, \"Take this all of you and drink from it. This is the cup of my blood, the blood of the new and everlasting covenant . . .\" In this report we take a look at the cultural and spiritual significance of wine in the Catholic tradition.

St Benedict's motto was \"Pray and Work.\" Between prayers, these Benedictine monks run a highly successful organic farm. 564675 138Open to Everybody The Catholic Church of St Theodor and St Elisabeth in the western German city Cologne is located in a district known as a social flashpoint. The parish priest, Father Franz Meurer, views building commu- nity as his top priority. Not just in the Church but in daily life. He has established a second-hand clothing store, a furniture and bicycle warehouse and a food bank - all open to everybody. 564675 139The Artist Who Saves Churches The artist Moritz G\u00f6tze grew up in East Germany, in an atheistic environment. However, shortly after the collapse of communism in 1989 he helped turn a church ruin into a cultural center and conserved what was left of the historic building. 564675 140New Life in Old Walls - Village Churches Bearing Witness to History Anyone driving through eastern Germany may be surprised by the number of old churches east of the River Elbe. Almost every small village has one. Many of them are fieldstone churches built more than 800 years ago. PEOPLE564675 141 New Light in old Walls - Windows for Tholey Abbey The small village of Tholey in southwestern Germany is home to the oldest monastery on German soil. Founded in the seventh century, the Abbey of St Mau- rice was plundered and badly damaged 1000 years later during the wars of the French Revolution, and only re-established in 1949. But local philanthropists have breathed new life into the old walls. The renova- tions carried out between 2008 and 2021 could make Tholey Abbey an international tourist destination. The highlight of the extensive works are the stained glass windows for the north and south aisles of the abbey church by Afghanistan-born artist Mahbuba Maqsoo- di, who lives and works in Munich, and the three choir windows designed by Germany's most famous living artist, Gerhard Richter. The art establishment are calling this the most significant project of its kind on the continent of Europe. 564675 142The Quest for Utopia - Grassroots Democracy in Venezuela The Cecosesola Cooperative Federation grew out of a practical necessity. Some fifty years ago, when a co-op member died, the other members foun- ded a funeral home. Cecosesola now comprises a federation of more than fifty cooperatives, mainly providing food and medical services to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans. All 1,300 staff draw the same salary, and they reach their decisions by consensus without any hierarchical structure. The federation has no fewer than 23,000 active members in western Venezuela. They produce fruit and vege- tables in their regions and run wholesale markets. In addition, they treat many hundreds of patients in their clinics and provide midwifery services. 564675 143 Church in the Living Room - Hoodie Ousts Cassock Max Bode and Chris Schlicht had envisioned Chris- tian ministry rather differently. These rookie pastors wanted to revamp the Lutheran liturgy: A sofa replacing the altar, a hoodie the cassock, and techno music the traditional organ-worship in the guise of a party. Corona put an end to their plans. But the two young ecclesiastical rebels from Bremerhaven rose to the challenge. With sensitivity and love they are transforming Church tradition in their town.PEOPLE564675 144 Heavenly Sounds - The Organ and its Fascinating Versatility No other country has as many organs as Germany. Of the organs in the country, 40,000 are church organs. The German Music Council declared the organ the \"Instrument of the Year\" for 2021. This film features the sounds of selected organs from all over Germany: from the oldest church organ in the world, located in Ost\u00f6nnen, Westphalia; to Berlin Cathedral's Late Romantic organ; to a flagship of contemporary organ construction, the organ of St. Martin's Church in Kassel. 564675 145The Neinstedt Foundation - Love at Devil's Wall The Neinstedt Foundation provides education and support, accommodation and life opportunities, work and counselling, as well as practical care for people with disabilities.

The new leader asked to be called Francis after the \"little poor man\" of Assisi. Almost immediately the new Pope set about reforming the Vatican, vowed to confront and root out child abuse in the Catholic Church, raised his voice in support of climate activists and sought dialogue with other religions. 564675 147Bach's Successor - The Thomaners' New Conductor The Swiss conductor Andreas Reize is the latest musician to join the Thomanerchor's prestigious list of choirmasters. He's the 18th musician to hold this post since Johann Sebastian Bach trained the famous Leipzig boys' choir between 1723 and 1750. The choir's main function is to sing at St Thomas' Church, Leipzig. However the greatest innovation is that for the first time since the Reformation a Catholic is conducting the choir in this famous German Lutheran church. In this report we sit in on the new conductor's first rehearsals and performances. We also take a look behind the scenes - at the life of the boy choristers. PEOPLE 564675 148 Church Bells - Chimes between Heaven and Earth Often hidden from view, but impossible to ignore, church bells ring out from towering belfries. For centuries they have given a rhythm to human activity. Even today their unmistakable tolling summons people to prayer and to worship. More than any other artefact the church bell has become associated with the voice of Christianity. Dr. Kurt Kramer is a world- renowned campanologist. Affectionately known as \"Monsieur Bimbam\" he has examined and restored countless bells in the Archdi ocese of Freibu rg and far beyond its boundaries for more than 40 years. 564675 149 Caring for Creation - Climate Protection in Rwanda Rwanda: A poor, landlocked country of 13 million people. In terms of climate protection this East African nation is a role model for the whole region, a powerful example of how a country that is only minimally responsible for polluting the atmosphere is doing an impressive amount to reduce its CO 2 emissions. One striking example is a pilot project promoting high efficiency kitchen stoves amongst Rwandan families. These eco-friendly stoves reduce wood consumption by 60 percent compared to traditional cooking fires. Rwanda's kitchen stove initiative is highly relevant, since 80 percent of all Rwandan families currently cook on an open fire. 564675 150Oberammergau - A Village and its Passion Two thousand residents of a village in the Bavarian Alps are currently performing almost every day a pageant depicting the suffering and death of Jesus Christ. Even the cancellation of the Oberammergau Passion Play due to the Covid pandemic could not stop the villagers from fulfilling the pledge their forefathers made in 1633 to perform the play every ten years if they were spared the plague. The well- known German theatre personality Christian St\u00fcckl has directed this year's production. Overcoming some resistance, St\u00fcckl has included Muslims and unbaptised people in the cast. Married women have also only been allowed to play the female roles since 1990. 564675 151Prayer and Action - The Church and the War Christians have a duty to welcome strangers. The gospels record Jesus as saying, \"I was a stranger and you invited me in.\" In response to the refugee crisis precipitated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Christians in Germany are helping in a number of ways. In our report we investigate the Church's response to the refugees' plight. Parish centres have been turned into shelters; in the Caf\u00e9 Ukraine in downtown Berlin the new arrivals are invited to discuss ways of making the best of their situation; concerts and prayer services offer them support and encouragement.

Images of ideal beauty surround us daily. But what does it actually mean to be \"beautiful\"? And who sets the standards? HER shows three very personal and very different approaches to what makes a woman beautiful. 544944 005 Out of the Void In many Asian countries, issues such as mental health and addiction are often swept under the carpet. For those in crisis, this can make it especially hard to address the problem. In this episode of HER, three women look back at difficult periods in their lives. They share their stories and reflect on how they made it out of the void that surrounded them. 544944 006 Body and Mind Often, they're looking after their families, running households and holding down jobs - all at the same time. That's why many women forget that they also need to take care of their own health and wellbeing. Asia is the home of traditions dating back thousands of years, such as yoga or traditional Chinese medi- cine. In this edition of HER, three women share their path to happiness through health and nutrition. 544944 007 Motherhood While the nuclear family of mother, father and children is still widespread in many Asian countries, it's changing. More and more children are growing up with single moms. Meet three mothers from different Asian countries and hear their stories. Farheen Ishtiaq Naqvi in Pakistan leads the life of a man in order to provide for her daughter. Young mother Queenie and her husband struggle with the work culture of Hong Kong, which is not very family-friendly. And Dewi Candraningrum from Indonesia fights hard to give her disabled son the help he deserves. 544944 008 The Art of Freedom Get to know three women from three different Asian countries who have found their own form of expression. How do themes such as femininity, gender roles, women's rights and violence feature in the works of these female artists? Malaysian artist Yante Ismail paints nude women, challenging the norms of patriarchal society. Uzma Ashraf is a Kathak dancer. Through dance, she learned to relate to her body, which is not easy for a woman in Pakistan.

Either as bosses and high-ranking managers of international corporations, or as self-employed owners and operators of small kiosks, and even founders of start-ups. This edition portrays three women from three different worlds, but they all have one thing in common: passion for their business. They include Louise Mabulo, founder of the Cacao Project in the Philippines, and entrepreneur Uma Hapsari from Indonesia, who created the community Mendaki Kembali, meaning 'climbing back', to speak openly about failures. And then there is Wandee, who manages a popular street food stall in Bangkok. 544944 010 Tech Power Digitization is changing the world dramatically. What does that mean for Women in Asia? What role do they play in that process? In this edition, HER portrays three women whose lives have been significantly shaped by technology. Take hip-hopper Niana Guerrero. Aged just 15, she is the most followed TikTokker in her country, the Philippines, and one of the biggest YouTube stars in Southeast Asia. Or Aulia Halimatussadiah, one of Indonesia's most influential serial start- up entrepr eneurs and founder of 'Girls in Tech'. And then there is Molly Hunag from Taiwan, whose startup Velodah has developed an app for cyclists. 544944 011 Talking Money More and more women are becoming financially independent. What does money mean to them? How do they earn their cash? And how do they spend it? What setbacks have they experienced? Three women from three Asian countries tell us about their relationship to money - such as Filipina actress and philanthropist Angel Locsin. Tutiana Jusat from Malaysia works in the male-dominated banking world with Islamic bonds. And Shikha Mittal from India helps educate women in savings, insurance and investment methods. 544944 012 My Roots What role do traditions play in women's lives? Is it important to move away from one's roots to lead an independent, self-determined life? Or is it more that the roots themselves provide a secure basis to move ahead? Three women from different Asian countries share their stories on what roots and tradition mean to them. HER sheds a light on how traditions and roots can have such different meanings. For example, for Lauren Sevilla Faustino who decided to leave her modern life in Manila. And from Thailand there's the story of Andrew's journey, leaving his roots and transitioning to Anne.

But that popularity didn't last, and his work faded into obscurity during his lifetime. Ignaz Joseph Pleyel was a student of Haydn and revered his teacher, just as Mozart had done. The latter, in turn, had high praise for Pleyel's string quartets. But Pleyel wasn't just a successful composer, he also made a name for himself as a piano builder. In the 19th century, grand pianos made by Pleyel were regarded as the best in the world. Documentary, 60 min., 2018, HD; English, Spanish; VoD, IFE, LR Minimalism British composer Michael Nyman is best known for his film music. His biggest success was with the soundtrack to the movie The Piano. Because he rejected contemporary atonal music, he gave up composing in the 1960s and turned to music criticism. An encounter with Steve Reich led him back to composition. US composer Reich is a pioneer of a musical style that Nyman was the first to call \"minimalism\". Music written in this style consists of just a few melodies, rhythms and harmonies that are then perpetually repeated. Michael Nyman is undoubtedly the most important British exponent of minimal music. Documentary, 60 min., 2018, HD; English, Spanish; VoD, IFE, LR684875 005Richard Strauss and His Heroines Richard Strauss was one of the leading exponents of the program music of the late 19th century and wrote some of the great operas of the 20th century. He expanded the scope and timbre palette of the orchestra. Women played a key role in his life and work, first and foremost his wife Pauline de Ahna, to whom he was married for more than 55 years. She gave up her career as an opera singer for him, and supported him throughout his life. She inspired Strauss to write some of his most beautiful and ethereal songs. Documentary, 60 min., 2016, HD; English, Spanish; VoD, IFE, LR 684875 006Joseph Haydn - Music for Prince and People Joseph Haydn is one of three key composers - alongside Mozart and Beethoven - who made up the First Viennese School of wester n classi cal music. He's considered the father of the classical symphony and string quartet and an innovator in the composition of piano sonatas and piano trios. Althou gh he was an employee of the wealthy Hungarian Esterh\u00e1zy family for most of his life, he was a master at pursuing his own interests. As a composer, he aimed to write music to please everyone - from his aristocratic patrons to \"regular people\". Documentary, 60 684875 007Heinrich Sch\u00fctz - Giant of the 17th Century Heinrich Sch\u00fctz is regarded as the most important German composer of the Early Baroque. He wrote a huge volume of sacred music, some to Latin but most to German texts. This music was destined for church services at the court of the Elector of Saxony, whom Sch\u00fctz served as court conductor. But as a sideline, he also composed music to entertain his employer and the royal household. Even during his lifetime, Sch\u00fctz was revered as the \"father of our modern music\". Documentary, 60 Spanish; VoD, LR 684875 008Krzysztof Penderecki - Concessions The Polish composer and conductor Krzysztof Penderecki is one of the most-performed composers of the modern age. He was always a thorn in the side of the authorities, someone who always refused to toe the line and wrote music that ruffled the feathers of those who happened to be in charge at the time. Penderecki grants no freedom at all to interpreters of his compositions. He has very precise ideas about how he wants his music to be played and makes no concessions on this point.
