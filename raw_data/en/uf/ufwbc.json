Most of them are vaccinated, but a minority are not (yet). Their reasons for hesitation are varied: UZH virologist Alexandra Trkola understands and respects all these positions. But, she says, students need to weigh up for themselves whether the reasons in favor of vaccination are stronger than the above doubts. Namely, the more people are vaccinated, the quicker we can do away with the tedious restrictions in everyday life. The more UZH members who are vaccinated, the better the teaching and learning experience will be, because meeting others and having face-to-face interactions are a vital part of university life. In addition, vaccination has been shown to protect against severe symptoms of Covid and against Long Covid - a consequence of coronavirus infection that can also affect younger people and can have a huge impact on wellbeing for months. Alexandra Trkola has been on the front lines of the pandemic since the very beginning. The director of the Institute of Medical Virology knows what she is talking about when she recommends - as the Executive Board of the University does - that young and healthy students should get vaccinated against Covid-19. She explicitly includes young women in her recommendation, because the rumors that the vaccination makes women infertile are simply not true, says Trkola. If you still haven't decided whether to get jabbed or not, why not take five minutes out of your day to watch Alexandra Trkola's video and set your mind at rest. "}
