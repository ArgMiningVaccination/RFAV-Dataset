SARS -CoV-2 is the cause of coronavi rus disease 19 (COVID -19). Studies from other animal models are used as surrogates for humans. Identifying the infectious dose for humans by the various routes through which we become infected is critical to the effective development of computational models to predict risk, develop diagnostics and countermeasures, and effective decontamination strategies. Anima l studies are a plausible surrogate. Transmissibility - How does it spread from one host to another? How easily is it spread? ...................................................... 4 SARS- CoV-2 is passed easily between humans, likely through close contact with relatively large droplets and possibly through smaller aerosolized particles. Individuals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to others before they have symptoms. Undetected cases play a major role in transmission, a nd most cases are not reported.543 Individuals who have recovered clinically, but test positive, appear unable to transmit COVID -19. The relative contribution of different routes of transmission, such as close contact and droplet transmission versus aerosol transmission and contaminated objects and surfaces (fomites), is unknown and requires additional research. Host Range - How many species does it infect? Can it transfer from species to species? ......................................................... 5 SARS- CoV-2 is closely related to other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Previous c oronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mammal host before infecting humans, but the identity of the SARS -CoV-2 intermediate host is unknown. SARS- CoV-2 uses the same receptor for cell entry as the SARS -CoV-1 corona virus that circulated in 2002/2003. To date, ferrets, mink, hamsters, cats, and primates have been shown to be susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 infection. It is unknown whether these animals can transmit infection to humans. Several animal models have been developed to recreate human- like illness, though to date they have been infected with high dose exposures. Lower dose studies may better replicate human disease acquisition. Incubation Period - How long after infection do symptoms appear? Are people infectious during this time? .......................... 6 The majority of individuals develop symptoms within 14 days of exposure. For mos t people, it takes at least 2 days to develop symptoms, and on average symptoms develop 5 days after exposure. Incubating individuals can transmit disease for several days befo re symptom onset. Some individuals never develop symptoms but can still transmit disease. The incubation period is well -characterized. Patients may be infectious, however, for days before symptoms develop. Clinical Presentation - What are the signs and symptoms of an infected person? ................................................................... 7 Many COVID -19 cases are asymptomatic. Most symptomatic cases are mild, but severe disease can be found in any age group.3 Older individuals and those with underlying medical condit ions are at higher risk of serious illness and death. The case fat ality rate varies substantially by patient age and underlying comorbidities. Additional studies on vulnerable subpopulations a re required. Children are susceptible to COVID -19,132 though gener ally show milder85, 303 or no symptoms. The true case fatality rate is unknown, as the exact number of cases is uncertain. Tes ting priorities and case definitions vary by location. The proportion of asymptomatic infections i s not known. Protective Immunity - How long does the immune response provide protection from reinfection? ........................................ 8 Infected patients show productive immune responses, but the duration of any protection is unknown. Currently, there is no evidence that recovered patients can be reinfected with SAR S-CoV-2. As the pandemic continues, long -term monitoring of immune activity and reinfection status is needed. Clinical Diagnosis - Are there tools to diagnose infected individuals? When during infection are they effective? .................... 9 Diagnosis relies on identifying the genetic signature of the virus in patient nose, throat, or sputum samples, or by identifying SARS- CoV-2 antibodies in individuals exposed to the virus. Confirmed cases are still underreported. Validated serological (antibody) assays are being developed to help determine who has been exposed to SAR S-CoV-2. Serological evidence of exposure does not i ndicate immunity. REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 7/7/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEA SE 2 In general, PCR tests appear to be sensitive and specific, though confirmation of symptoms via chest CT is recommended. The sensitivity and specificity of serological testing methods is variable, and additi onal work needs to be done to determine factors that affect test accuracy. Medical Treatments - Are there effective treatments? ...........................................................................................................10 Treatment for COVID -19 is primar ily supportive care,185, 320 and no single standard of care exists. Drug trials are ongoing. Remdesivir shows promise for reducing symptom duration in humans.33 Hydroxychloroquine is associate d with risk of cardiac arrhythmias and provides limited to no clinical benefit at this time. Dexamethasone may significantly reduce mortality in severely ill and ventilated patients. Other pha rmaceutical interventions are being investigated. Additional in formation on treatment efficacy is required, particularly from large randomized clinical trials. Vaccines - Are there effective v accines? ................................................................................................................................. 11 Work is ongoing to develop a SARS -CoV-2 vaccine in human trials (e.g., Operation Warp Speed). Early results are being released, but evidence should be considered preliminary until lar ger trials are completed. Published results from randomized clinical trials (Phase I - III) are needed. Non- pharmaceutical Interventions - Are public health control measures effective at reducing spread? ................................. 12 Broad -scale control measures such as stay -at-home orders are effective at reducing movement and contact rates, and modeling shows evidence that they reduce transmission. Research is needed to help plan for easing of restrictions. As different US states have implemented differing control measures at various times, a comprehensive analysis of social distancing efficacy has not yet been conducted. Environmental Stability - How long does the agent live in the environment? .........................................................................13 SARS- CoV-2 can persist on surfaces for at least 3 days and on the surface of a surgical mask for up to 7 days depending on conditions. If aerosolized intentiona lly, SARS -CoV-2 is stable for at least several hours. The seasonality of COVID -19 transmission is unknown. SARS -CoV-2 on surfaces is inactivated rapidly with sunlight. Additional testing on SARS -CoV-2, as opposed to surrogat e viruses, is needed to support initial estimates of stability. Tests quantifying infectivity, rather than the presence of viral RNA, are needed. Decontamination - What are effective methods to kill the agent in the environm ent? ..........................................................14 Soap and water, as well as common alcohol and chlorine -based cleaners, hand sanitizers , and disinfectants are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2 on hands and surfaces. Additional decontamination studies, particularly with regard to PPE and other items in short supply, are needed. PPE - What PPE is effective, and who should be using it? .......................................................................................................15 The effectiveness of PPE for SARS -CoV-2 is currently unknown, and data from other related coronaviruses are used for guidance. Hea lthcare workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID -19, even with recommended PPE. Most PPE recommendations have not been made on SARS -CoV-2 data, and comparative efficacy of different PPE for different tasks (e.g., intubati on) is unknown. Identification of efficacious PPE for healthcare workers is critical due to their high rates of infection. Forensics - Natural vs intentional use? Tests to be used for attribution. ................................................................................16 All current evidence supports the natural emergence of SARS -CoV-2 via a bat and possible intermediate mammal species . Identifying the intermediate species between bats and humans would aid in reducing potential spillover from a natural source. Wide sampling of bats, other wild animals, and humans is needed to address the origin of SARS -CoV-2. Genomics - How does the disease agent compare to previous strains? ..................................................................................17 Current evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 accumulates substitutions and mutations at a similar rate as other coronaviruses. Mutations and deletions in specific portions of the SARS -CoV-2 geno me have not been linked to any changes in transmission or disease severity, though modeling work is attempting to identify possible changes. Research linking genetic changes to differences in phenotype (e.g., transmissibilit y, virulence, progression in patients) is needed. Forecasti ng - What forecasting models and methods exist? ...................................................................................................18 Forecasts differ in how they handle public health interventions such as shelter -in-place orders and tracking how methods change in the near future will be important for understanding limitations going forward.

What do we know? The human infectious dose of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) is unknown by all exposure routes. SARS -CoV-2 is the cause of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID -19). Studies from other animal models are used as surrogates for humans. Non-human primates A total dose of approximately 700,000 plaque -forming units (PFU) of the novel coronavirus SARS -CoV-2 infected macaques via combination exposure (106 TCID 50 total dose).409 Macaques did not exhibit clinical symptoms, but shed virus from the nose and throat.409 Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques showed mild to moderate clinical infections at doses of 4.75x106 PFU (SAR S-CoV-2 delivered through several routes), while common marmosets developed mild infections when exposed to 1.0x106 PFU intranasally.301 Rhesus macaques are via the ocular conjunctival and intratracheal route at a of approximately 700,000 PFU (106 TCID 50).125 Rhesus macaques infected with -CoV-2 by the intranasal, intratracheal, oral and ocular routes combined recapitulate moderate human disease .348 African green monkeys replicate aspects of human disease, including severe pathological symptoms (exposed to 500,000 PFU via intranasal and intratracheal r outes),511 mild clinical symptoms (aerosol exposur es between 5,000 and 16,000 PFU),194 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS ), with small particle aerosol exposure doses as low as 2,000 PFU.43 Aerosol exposure of three primate species (African green monkey s, cynomolgus macaques, and rhesus macaques) via a Collison nebulizer resulted in mild clinical disease in all animals with doses between 28,700 and 48,600 PFU.230 Rodents Golden Syrian hamsters exposed to 80,000 TCID 50 (~56,000 PFU) via the intranasal route developed clinical symptoms reminiscent of mild human infections (a ll hamsters infected).440 In a sep arate study, immunosuppressed Golden Syrian hamsters showed severe clinical symptoms (including death) after exposure to 100 -10,000 PFU via intranasa l challenge .51 Golden Syrian hamsters infected with 100,000 PFU intranasally exhibited mild clinical symptoms and developed neutralizing antibodies,82 and were also capable of infecting individuals in separate cages. In another study, older hamsters had more sever e symptoms and developed fewer neutralizing antibodies than younger hamsters.365 Mice genetically modified to express the human ACE2 receptor (transgenic hACE2 mice) were inoculated intranasa lly with 100,000 TCID 50 (~70,000 PFU), and all mice developed pathological symptoms consistent with COVID -19.28 Transgenic (hACE2) mice became infected after timed aerosol exposure (36 TCID 50/minute) to between 900 and 1080 TCID 50 (~630 -756 PFU). All mice (4/4) exposed for 25 -30 minutes became infected, while no mice (0/8) bec ame infected after exposure for 0 -20 minutes (up to 720 TCID 50, ~504 PFU).29 Key methodologic al details (e.g., particle size, quantification of actual aerosol dose) are missing fr om the study's report. Transgenic (hACE2) mice exposed intranasally to 400,000 PFU of SARS -CoV-2 develop clinical and pathological symptoms seen in humans.455 Other animal models Ferrets infected with 316,000 TCID 50238 600,000 TCID 50400 SARS -CoV-2 by the intranasal route show similar sympt oms to human disease.238, 400 Uninfected ferrets in direct contact with infected ferrets test positive and show disease as early as 2 days post -contact .238 In one study, direct contact was required to transfer infection between ferrets,238 however, transmission without direct contact was found in another study.400 In a ferret study, 1 in 6 individuals exposed to 102 PFU via the intranasal route became infected, while 12 out of 12 individuals exposed to >104 PFU became infected.417 Domestic cats exposed to 100,000 PFU of SARS -CoV-2 via the intranasal route developed severe pathological symptoms including lesions in the nose, throat, and lung s.438 In a separate study, infected cats showed no clinical signs, but were able to shed virus and transmit to other cats.46 Related Coronaviruses The infectious dose for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS -CoV-1) in mice is estimated to be between 67-540 PFU (average 240 PFU, intranasal route).120, 122 Genetically modified mice expressing DPP4 exposed intranasally to doses of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS -CoV) between 100 and 500,000 PFU show signs of infection. In fection with higher doses result in severe syndrome s.10, 103, 271, 551 What do we need to know? Identifying the infectious dose for humans by the various routes through which we become infected is critical to th e effective development of computational models to predict risk, develop diagnostics and countermeasures, and effective decontamination strategies.

How easily is it spread? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 is passed easily between humans, likely through close contact with relatively large droplets and possibly through smaller aerosolized particles. As of 7/7/2020, p andemic COVI D-19 has caused 11,645,109 infections and 538,780 deaths223 in 188 countries and territories .71, 431, 504 There are 2,938,624 confirmed COVID -19 cases across all 50 US states, with 130,306 deaths.223 Initial high -quality estimates of human transmissibility (R 0) range from 2.2 to 3.1 ,315, 374, 404, 518, 550 though recent estimates suggest that early transmission rates were higher.421 Based on contact tracing of 1,058 cases in Hong Kong, the number of cases linked to superspreading events (1 person infects >6 -8 people) for COVID -19 is estimated to be s imilar to other pathogens .8 The majority of new infections come from relatively few infectious individuals.8 SARS- CoV-2 is beli eved to spread transmission,76 fomite transmission likely226 and 52, 344 SARS- CoV-2 replicates in the upper respiratory tract,202 and infectious virus is detectable in throat and lung tissue for at least 8 days.507 Respiratory fluids f rom severely ill patients contained higher viral RNA loads than respiratory fluids from mildly ill patients,554 but similar viral RNA loads have been found in asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals.262 Contamination of patient ro oms with aerosolized SARS -CoV-2 in the human respirable range (0.25 -2.5 m) indicates the potential for airborne transmission.294 Viral RNA was detected up to 4 meters from ICU patient beds.186 To date infectious virus has not been isolated from aerosol samples.423 SARS- CoV-2 may be spread by conversation and exhalation.5, 269, 423, 448 A preliminary study in China detailing a restaurant - associated outbreak supports transmission via aerosol.279 Contact tracing in Japan has identified clusters associated with large gatherings in bars, restaurants, music festivals, and other social activities involvi ng close contact.538 Experimentally infected ferrets were able to transmit SARS -CoV-2 to other ferrets through the air (ferrets in an adjacent enclosure, separated by 10 cm).400 Similar results have been documented in transgenic mice.29 Evidence suggests that SAR S-CoV-2 is not transmitted to infants during birth ,87, 92, 95, 429, 462, 531, 535 though some instances of vertical transmission have been reported.173, 175 SARS- CoV-2 RNA has been found in semen from both clinically symptomatic and recovered cases,270 however, the infectiousness and the possibility of sexual transmission is unknown. Infectious SARS -CoV-2 has been cultured from patient feces523 and urine.453 Individuals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to others before they have symptoms. Individuals may be infectious for 1 -3 days prior to symptom onset,491 and culturable virus has been found up to 6 days prior to symptom onset.20 Pre-symptomatic44, 243, 447, 452, 527, 553 or asymptomatic27, 207, 306 patients can transmit SARS -CoV-2, and asymptomatic individuals shed virus for as long as mildly symptomatic individuals.297 At least 12% of all cases are estimated to be due to asymptomatic transmission.135 It has been estimated that 23 -56% of infections may be caused by pre-symptomatic transmission.67, 197, 291 Individuals are most infectious before symptoms beg in and within 5 days of symptom onse t,94 and pre -symptomatic individuals contribute to environmental contamination.224 Attack rates of the virus are higher among household members than casual contacts.56, 435 The attack rate ranges from 11%,39 16%,275 and 38%410 of ho usehold members, with rates increasing with age.410 Individuals transmit infection to household me mbers before they exhibit symptoms at least as often as they do after symptoms develop .227 Undetected cases play a major role in transmission, and most cases are not reported.542 Models suggest up to 86% of early COVID -19 cases in China were undetected, and these infections were the source for 79% of reported cases.274 Models estimate that the true number of cases may be approximately 11 times greater than the reported number of cases in the UK,533 and 5 to 10 times greater than the reported number of cases in the US.228, 416 Using excess influenza -like illness incidence provides a method for estimating COVID -19 underreporting.441 Individuals who have recovered clinically, but test positive, appear unable to transmit COVID -19. Epidemiological investigations by the Korean CDC suggest that individuals who have clinically recovered from COVID -19, but later show PCR positive tests, are not infectious.236 What do we need to know? The relative contribution of different routes of transmission, such as close contact and droplet transmission versus aerosol transmission and contaminated objects and surfaces (fomites), is unknown and requires additional research .

Can it transfer from species to species? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 is closely related to other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Previous coronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mammal host before infecting humans, but the identity of the SARS -CoV-2 intermediate host is unknown. Early genomic analysis indicates similarity to SARS -CoV-1,558 with a suggested bat origin.104, 558 Positive samples from the South China Seafood Market strongly suggests a wildlife source,78 though it is possible that the virus was circulating in humans before the disease was associated with the seafood market.32, 105, 525, 536 Analysis of SARS -CoV-2 genomes suggests that a non -bat intermediate species is responsible for the beginning of the outbreak.408 The identity of the intermediate host remai ns unknown.278, 285, 287 Viruses similar to SARS -CoV-2 were present in pangolin samples collected several years ago ,255 and pangolins positive for coronaviruses re lated to SARS -CoV-2 exhibited clinical symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath.277 Additionally, there is evidence of vertical transmission in pangolins, suggesting circulatio n in natural populations .277 However, a survey of 334 pangolins did not identify coronavirus nucleic acid in 'upstream' m arket chain samples, suggesting that positive samples from pangolins may be the result of exposure to infected humans, wildlife or other animals within the wildlife trade network. These data suggest that pangolins are incidental hosts of coronaviruses.263 Additional research is needed to identify whether pangolins are a natural host of SARS -COV -2-related coronaviruses. SARS -CoV-2 uses the same receptor for cell entry as the SARS -CoV-1 coronavirus that circulated in 2002/2003. Experiments show tha t SARS -CoV-2 Spike (S) receptor- binding domain binds the human cell receptor (ACE2) stronger than SARS-CoV-1,513 potentially explaining its high transmissibility. The same work suggests that differen ces between SARS - CoV-2 and SARS -CoV-1 Spike proteins may limit the therapeutic ability of SARS antibody treatments.513 Modeling of SARS -CoV-2 Spike and ACE2 proteins suggests that SARS -CoV-2 can bind and infect hum an, bat, civet, monkey and swine cells.481 Host range predictions based on structural modeling, however, are difficult,160 and additio nal animal studies are needed to better define the host range. In vitro experiments suggest a broad host range for SARS -CoV-2, with more tha n 44 potential animal hosts, based on viral binding to species -specific ACE2 orthologs.292 The host range is predicted to be limited primarily to mammals. Geneti c and protein analysis of primates suggests that African and Asian primates are likely more susceptible to SARS - CoV-2, while South and Centra l American primates are likely less susceptible.330 Identifying the SARS -CoV-2 host range is important for identifying animal reservoirs. Changes in proteolytic cleavage of the Spike protein can also affect cell entry an d animal host range, in addition to receptor binding.331 To date, ferrets, mink, hamsters, cats, and primates have been shown to be susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 infection. It is unknown whether these animals can transmit infection to humans. Animal model studies suggest that Golden Syrian hamsters, primates, and ferrets may be susceptible to infection.82, 238 In the Netherla nds, farmed mink developed breathing and gastrointestinal issues, which was diagnosed as SARS -CoV-2 infection.1 It is thought that an infected mink has transmitted SARS -CoV-2 to a human.248 Golden Syrian hamsters are able to infect other hamsters via direct contact and close quarters aerosol transmission.440 Domestic cats are susceptible to infection with SARS -CoV-2 (100,000- 520,000 PFU via the intranasal route438 or a combination of rou tes188), and can transmit the virus to other cats via droplet or short -distance aerosol.438 Dogs exposed to SARS -CoV-2 produced anti -SARS -CoV-2 antibodies46 but exhibited no clinical symptoms.438, 444 Wild cats (tigers)490 can be infected with SARS -CoV-2, although their ability to spread to humans is unknown.316, 547 Two cases have been confirmed of pet domestic cats infected with SARS -CoV-2.70 Ducks, chickens, and pigs remained uninfected after experimental SARS -CoV-2 exposure (30,000 CFU for ducks and chicken s, 100,000 PFU for pigs, all via intranasal route).438 There is currently no evidence that SARS -CoV-2 infects livestock,214 though modeling suggests sheep, cows, pigs, and goats may be susceptible to infection by SARS -CoV-2.254 Pigs and chickens were not susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 infection when exposed to an intranasal dose of 105 TCID 50 (~70,000 PFU), confirmed by lack of positive swab and tissue sa mples.161 Fruit bats and ferrets were susceptible to this same exposure.161 Chicken, turkey, duck, quail, and geese were not susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 after experimental exposures.451 What do we need to know? Several a nimal models have been developed to recreate human -like illness, though to date they have been infected with high dose exposures. Lower dose studies may better replicate human disease acquisition. What is the intermediate host(s)? Can infected animals transmit to humans (e.g., pet cats to humans)? Can SARS -CoV-2 circulate in ani mal reservoir populations, potentially leading to future spillover events?

Are people infectious during this time? What do we know? The majority of individuals develop symptoms within 14 days of exposure. For most people, it takes at least 2 days to develop symptoms, and on average symptoms develop 5 days after exposure. Incubating individuals can transmit disease for several days before symptom onse t. Some individuals never develop symptoms but can still transmit disease. The best current estimate of the COVID -19 incubation period is 5.1 days, with 99% of individuals exhibiting symptoms within 14 days of exposure.261 Fewer than 2.5% of infected individuals show symptoms sooner than 2 days after exposure.261 A large meta -analysis estimates the median incubation period for COVID -19 as 5.8 days (mean = 6.9 days) ,492 and an analysis of cases in China 's Hubei province finds a median incubation period of 5.4 days.532 Individuals can test positive for COVID -19 even if they lack clinical symptoms.27, 81, 184, 461, 553 Individuals can be infectious while asymptomatic,76, 412, 461, 553 and asymptomat ic and pre -symptomatic individuals have similar amounts of virus in the nose and throat compared to symptomatic patients.20, 237, 561 Peak infectiousness may be during the incubation period, one day before symptoms develop.197 Infectious virus has been cultured in patients up to 6 days before the development of symptoms.20 Infectious period is unknow n, but possibly up to 10 -14 days .4, 274, 431 Asymptom atic individuals are estimated to be infectious for a median of 9.5 days.205 On average, there are approximately 4135 to 7.5273 days between symptom onse t in successive cases of a single transmission chain (i.e ., the serial interval). Based on data from 339 transmission chains in China, the mean serial interval is between 4.6532 and 5.29 days.134 Children are estimated to shed virus for 15 days o n average, with asymptomatic individuals shedding virus for less time (11 days) than symptomatic individuals (17 days).303 Most hospitalized individuals are admitted within 8 -14 days of symptom onset.556 Asymptomatic and mildly ill patients who test positive for SA RS-CoV-2 presence take less time to test negative than severely ill patients.265 Patients infected by asymptomatic or young (<20 years old) individuals may take longer to develop symptoms than those infected by other groups of individuals.492 Viral RNA loads in the upper respiratory tract tend to peak within a few days of symptom onset and become undetectable approximately two w eeks after symptoms begin.479 The duration of the infectious period is unknown,479 though patients can test positive for SARS -CoV-2 viral RN A for extended periods of time, particularly in stool samples. What do we need to know? The incubation period is well -characterized. Patients may be infectious, however, for days before symptoms develop. What is the average infectious period during which individuals can transmit the di sease?

What do we know? Many COVID -19 cases are asy mptomatic. Most symptomatic cases are mild, but severe disease can be found in any age group.3 Older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death. Between 16% and 58% of patients are asymptomatic throughout the course of their infection.58, 262, 265, 340, 355, 457, 466 Many clinically asymptomatic COVID -19 cases show evidence of lung abnormalities by co mputed tomography .249 Most symptomatic COVID -19 cases are mild (81%, n=44,000 cases).461 Initial COVID -19 symptoms include fever (87.9% overall, but only 44 -52% present with fever initially),18, 18 4 cough (67.7%),184 fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, and reduced lymphocyte count.77, 84, 206 Chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and loss of taste or smell378, 529 are also possible COVID -19 symptoms.77 The prevalence of GI symptoms varies.163 Neurological symptoms such as agitation ,198 loss of coordi nation,317 and stroke474 may present with COVID -19, may be more common in seve re cases,112 and neurological involvement (e.g., encephalitis) can be seen in brain tissue on autopsy.478 Ocular issues520 and skin lesions may also be symptoms of COVID -19.47 There are concerns that COVID -19 can lead to new -onset diabetes.414 Complications include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, 17 -29% of hospitalized pat ients, leading to death in 4 - 15% of cases) ,91, 206, 483 pneumonia,370 cardiac injury (20%),439 secondary infection, kidney damage,19, 449 arrhythmia, sepsis, stroke (1.6% of hospitalized patients),334 and shock.184, 206, 483, 556 Most deaths are caused by respiratory failure or respiratory failure combined with heart damage.413 Clinically, COVID -19 appears to present as three different phenotypes, reflecting distinct patterns of lung involvement observable via chest computed tomography.407 One of these phenotypes is consistent with ARDS.407 Approximately 15% of hospitalized patients are classified as severe,184, 461 and approximately 5% of patients are admitted to the ICU.184, 461 Patient deterioratio n can be rapid.179 The survival rate of patient s requiring mechanical ventilation varies widely (e.g., 35%,213 70%,22 75.5%401). Higher SARS -CoV-2 viral RNA load on admission (measured by RT -PCR cycle threshold values) have been associated with gr eater risk of intubation and death.310 Recent evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 may attack blood vessels in the lung, leading to clotting complications and ARDS.7, 475 Clotting issues may be associated with severely ill COVID -19 patients240 and those with ARDS.112 COVID -19 patients should be monitored for possible thrombosis.268 In autopsies of several COVID -19 patients, there was evidence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD)425 and increased blood clotting.426 COVID -19 patients undergoing unrelated surgical procedures have high levels of postoperative complications and death .352 The case fatality rate varies substantially by patient age and underlying c omorbidities. Cardiovascular disease, hypertension,545 diabetes, and respiratory conditions all increase the CFR.461, 556 Hypertension and obesi ty are common in the US163 and contribute to mortality.19, 372 Individuals >60 are at higher risk of death, and the CFR for individuals >85 is between 10 and 27%.461, 556 In a small study, men exhibited more severe symptoms and died at higher rates than women.225 The effect of comorbidities on the likelihood of severe symptoms is higher for men.332 Additional studies on vulnerable subpopulations are required. Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) populations acquire SARS -CoV-2 infection at higher rates than other groups369 and are disproportionately represented in hospitalized populations.163, 386 African American communities contribute disproportionately to the number of deaths in the US.200, 338 Hospitalization rates in Native American, Hispanic, and Black populations are 4- 5 times higher than those in non -Hispanic white populations.73 Pregnant women appear to develop severe symptoms at the same rate as the general population90, 233, 540 or at a slightly elevated r ate.139 Current reports suggest no increase in risk of pre -term birth.530 Severe symptoms in pregnant women may be associated with underlying conditions such as obesity.295 Additional research is needed to assess risks to pregnant women and their unborn children. Children are susceptible to COVID -19,132 though genera lly show milder85, 302 or no symptoms. Between 21 -28% of children may be asymptomatic.302, 375, 388 Most symptomatic children present with mild or moderate symptoms,178, 375 with few exhibiting severe or clinical illness.517 S evere symptoms in children are possible290 and more likely in those with complex medical histories433 or underlying conditions such as obes ity.539 Infant deaths have been recorded.54, 302 Early reports indicate the possibility of rare hyperinflammatory syndromes or shock in children (termed Pediatric Multi- Syste m Inflammatory Syndrome)172 linked to COVID -19 infection.405 The WHO503 and US CDC222 have issued case definitions for this condition. What do we need to know? The true case fatality rate is unknown, as the exact number of cases is uncertain. Testing priorities and case definitions vary by location. The proportion of asymptomatic infections is not known. How long do es it take for infected individuals to recover outside of a healthcare setting? What proportion of infected individuals are asymptomatic? Does this vary by age , location, or comorbidities?

What do we know? Infected patients show productive immune responses, but the duration of any protection is unknown . In a limited study (n=9), hospitalized patients shed high levels of infectious virus for 7 days via the nasal -pharyngeal route, 50% of patients produced antibodies within 7 days, and all patients produced antibodies by 14 days. Antibody production did not corr elate with lower viral load.507 In a larg er study (n=175), most patients developed neutralizing antibodies within 10 -15 days after disease onset. E lderly patients had significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers than younger patients.515 In a separate study, elderly patients also showed higher viral loads than younger patients.465 Approximately half of infected individuals on an aircraft carrier developed detectable neutralizing antibody responses to SARS -CoV-2.378 In a study of 285 COVID -19 patients, 100% developed antiviral immunoglobulin -G within 19 days of symptom onset.296 The neutralizing ability of these antibodies was not tested.296 In a sma ller in vitro study (n=23 patients), levels of antibodies (immunoglobulins M and G) were positively correlated with SARS -CoV-2 neutralizing ability.465 In a smaller study of 44 patients, plasma from 91% demonstrate d SARS -CoV-2 neutralizing ability, appearing ~ 8 days after symptom onset.456 In a small comparison series (n=74), both asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic individuals showed reductions in IgG antibody levels 8 week s after infection.297 The correlation to long -term immunity is unknown. In a small study (n=26 mild cases), researchers found prolonged persistence of SARS -CoV-2 antibodies and SARS -CoV-2 RNA for up to 50 days.482 A small subset of COVID -19 patients in China (8%) did not develop a serological r esponse to infection, though the potential for reinfection in these patients is unknown.515 Similarly, between 16.7% (for IgG) and 51.7% (for IgM) of patients in a separate study did not exhibit any immune r esponse, in terms of production of those two types of antibodies.458 In a study of 221 COVID -19 patients, levels of two types of antibodies (IgM and IgG) were not associated with the severity of symptoms.204 However, in a smaller study, patients with severe disease showed stronger antibody responses than those with non -severe symptoms.465 Severely ill individuals develop higher levels of neutralizing antibodies284 and greater T -cell response frequencies432 than mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic individua ls. The early recovery phase of COVID -19 patients is characterized by inflammatory immune response,494 suggesting the potential for adverse reactions after clinical improvement. Two studies identified key components of the adaptive immune system (CD4+ T cells) in the majority of recovered COVID - 19 patients, and these cells reacted to SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein.49, 181 These studies also identified Spike protein responses in CD 4+ T cells of ~30 -40% of unexposed patients,181 suggesting some cross -reactivity between other circulating human coronaviruses and SARS -CoV-2.49, 181 The d egree of protection provided by cross -reactivity is currently unknown. Currently, there is no evidence that recovered patients can be reinfected with SARS -CoV-2. Two studies suggest limited reinfection potential in macaques. In the first, two experimentall y infected macaques were not capable of being reinfected 28 days after their primary infection resolved.126 In the second, rhesus macaques exposed to different doses of SARS -CoV-2 via the intranasal and intratracheal routes (104 - 106 PFU) developed pathological infection and were protected upon secondary challenge 35 days after initial exposure (little to no c linical symptoms, large reductio n in viral titer compared to initial infection).83 Longer -term research and work in humans needs to be done .83 Ferrets infected with 102-104 PFU were protected from acute l ung injury following secondary challenge with SARS -CoV-2 28 days after initial exposure, but they did exhibit clinical symptoms such as lethargy and ruffled fur.417 Cats exposed to SARS- CoV-2 after initial recovery did not shed virus, suggesting some protective effect of primary infection.46 According to the WHO, there is no evidence of re -infection with SARS -CoV-2 after recovery.260 Patients can test positive via PCR for up to 37 days after symptoms appear,556 and after recovery and hospital discharge.256 The ability of these individuals to infect others is unknow n. The strength and duration of any immunity after initial COVID -19 infecti on is unknown.13, 500 In a 35 -year study of 10 men, immunity to seasonal coronaviruses tended to wane after one year, with reductions in circulating antibodies detectable within 6 months.137 Reinfection was observed between one and three years after initial infection.137 Previous studies on coronavirus immunity suggest that neutral izing antibodies may wane after several years.61, 519 What do we need to know? As the pandemic continues, long -term monitoring of immune activity and reinfection status is needed. How long does the immune response last? Is there evidence of waning immunity? Can humans become reinfected? How does the patient immune response vary by age or disease severity? How do different components of the immune response contribute to long -term protection?

When during infection are they effective? What do we know? Diagnosis relies on identifying the genetic signature of the virus in patient nose, throat, or sputum samples , or by identifying SARS -CoV-2 antibodies in individuals exposed to the virus . Confirmed cases are still underreported. The US CDC has expanded tes ting criteria to include symptomatic patients at clinician discretion.30 PCR protocols and primers have been widely shared internationally.68, 107, 273, 437, 499, 505 PCR-based diagnostic assays are unable t o differentiate between active and inactive virus. A combination of pharyngeal (throat) RT -PCR and chest tomography is the most effective diagnostic crite ria (correctly diagnoses 91.9% of infections).398 A sin gle throat swab detects 78.2% of infections, and duplicate tests identify 86.2% of infections.398 PCR tests using saliva are at least as effective as those using nasopharyngeal swabs .88, 522 Nasal and pharyngeal swabs may be less effective as diagno specimens than sputum and bronchoalveolar is mixed.507 Combination RT -PCR and s erology (antibody) testing may increase the ability to diagnose patients with mild symptoms, or identify patients at higher risk of seve re disease.552 Assays targeting antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein (N) instead of the Spike prote in (S) of SARS -CoV-2 may improve detection.55 The timing of diagnostic PCR tes ts impacts results. The false -negative rate for RT PCR tests is lowest between 7 and 9 days after exposure, and PCR tests are more likely to give fals e-negative results before symptoms begin (within 4 days of exposure) and more than 14 days after exposure.252 The FDA is sued an Emergency Use Authorization for an antigen- based diagnostic assay, limited to use in certified laboratories (clinical laboratory improvement amendments, CLIA).143 The FDA released an Emergency Use Authorization enabling laboratories to develop and use tests in -house for patient diagnosis.148 Tests from the US CDC are available to states.68, 76 Multiple rapi d or real -time test kits have been produced by universities and industry, including the Wuhan Institute of Virology,115 BGI,37 Cepheid,477 Abbot,146 and Mesa Biotech.41 Home tests are being developed; however, none are FDA approved, nor are they useable as a diagnosti c.349-350, 373 The US CDC is developing serological tests to determine prevalence of SARS -CoV-2 exposure .231 Artificial intelligence algorithms were able to improve the ability of radiologists to distinguish COVID -19 pneumonia from non-COVID -19 pneumonia on chest CT scans.26 The CRISPR -Cas12a system is being used to develop fluorescence -based COVID -19 diagnostic tests.209 Deaths due to COV ID-19 are underreported. In New York City, up to 5, 293 (22%) of period -specific excess deaths are unexplained and could be related to the pandemic.362 More work is needed. COVID -19 related deaths in the US were likely underestimated by up to 35% in March through late April.510 Immunological indicators may help differentiate between severe and non- severe cases ,24, 140, 196, 208, 384, 454 and decision - support tools for diagnosing severe infections have been developed.516 Validated serological (antibody) assays are being developed to help determine who has been exp osed to SARS -CoV-2. Serological evidence of exposure does not indicate immunity. Repeated serological testing is necessary to identify asymptomatic385 and other undetected patients at locations like skilled nursing facilities.422 Researchers found high specificity in a number of enzyme -linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), though sample sizes for SARS- CoV-2 patients were small.361 Additional research has shown high variability in the ability of tests (ELISA and lateral flow assays) by different manufacturers to accurately detect positive and negative cases ( sensitivity and specificity, respectively).259, 495 The FDA has recommended against the use of several dozen serological diagnostic assays based on failure to conform to u pdated regulatory requirements.145 Researchers have designed a standardized ELISA procedure for SARS- CoV-2 serology samples aimed at minimizing false positives and false negatives.241 Meta -analysis suggests that lateral flow assays (LFIA) are less accurate than ELISA or chemiluminescent methods (CLIA), but that the target of serological studies (e.g., IgG or IgM) does not affect accuracy.281 Additionally, most reported serological studies suffer from bias related to selected patients, limiting their applicability to general populations.281 The fal se positive rate of serological assay s may account for a substantial portion of reported exposures ,34 particularly if the true proportion of positive patients is low. What do we need to know? In general, PCR tests appear to be sensitive and specific, though confirmation of symptoms via chest CT is recommended. The sensitivity and specificity of serological testing methods is variable, and additional work needs to be done to determine factors that affect test accuracy. How accurate are clin ical diagnoses compared to genetic tests? How many serological tests need to be done to obtain an accurate picture of underlying exposure? What fraction of exposed individuals fail to develop antibody responses that are the target of serological assays?

What do we know? Treatment for COVID -19 is primarily supportive care,184, 319 and no single standard of care exists. Drug trials are ongoing. Remdesivir shows promise for reducing symptom duration in humans.33 Remdesivir can reduce the duration of symptoms in infected individuals, from 15 days to 11 days on average (compared to controls).33 Remdesivir received an Emergency Use Authorization from FDA354 and is recommended for use in the EU.506 In a separate clinical trial of severe COVID -19 patients, the effects of remdesivir were inconclusive due to a limitation in the study sample size.488 This trial ended early, reducing its statistical power.488 Hydroxychloroquine is associated with risk of cardiac arrhythmias and provides limited to no clinical benefit at this time. Several large clinical trials have stopped administering hydroxychloroquine due to lack of efficacy, including the RECOVERY trial (UK),201 the ORCHID trial (NIH),351 and the SOLIDARITY trial (WHO).193 Other e xisting studies have found no benefit of hydroxychloroquine (with or without azithromycin)89, 166, 309, 311, 459 as well as cardiac side effects36, 100, 169, 220, 312, 333 and elevated risk of mortality.309 Individuals taking hydroxychloroquine for autoimmune disorders were not protecte d from COVID -19,167 though sample sizes were limited. Patients given hydroxychloroqui ne after exposure to COVID -19 developed illness at the same rate as untreated patients, indicating no protective benefit.48 A large observational study showing elevated mortality in patients taking hydroxychloroquine was retracted due to lack of access to primary data.329 The FDA revoked its EUA for hydroxychloroquine on 6/15/20 .142 Initial results purporting benefits of hydroxychloroquine and azithromy cin165 have been ca lled into question by other researchers211 and the journal's publishing society.218 One small clinical trial (n=62) suggests that hydroxychloroquine can reduce recovery time compared to control group ,93 but lacks key methodological details .93 A small retrospective st udy (n=48) found benefits to hydroxychloroquine, though details on patient study population selection w ere limited.534 A larger retrospective study (n=2,541) found that hydroxychloroquine reduced mortality, and pro pensity matching (n=190) suggests the benefit is not solely due to differences in patient characteristics.21 However, concerns still exist over the patient selection protocol and the time -course of the study ,264 and 9% of individuals were excluded from analysis because they had not clinically resolved by the time of publication. Results from clinical trials would clarify observational findings. Dexamethasone may significantly reduce mortality in severely ill and ventilated patients. A press release from the RECOVERY trial (n=2,104) indic ates substantial reductions in mortality for ventilated patients given the steroid dexamethasone , and smaller reductions in mortality for patients receiving supplemental oxygen.395 Dexamethasone did not reduce mortality in patients who did not need oxygen or mechanical ventilation.395 Other pharmaceutical interventions are being investigated. Several studies of methylprednisolone suggest clinical benefits in severely ill patients (e.g., reduction in ventilator use, mortality), but have not been tested separately from other standard -of-care treatment s.108, 314, 420, 424 Providing anti - inflammatory treatments in the first few days of hospital admission may be beneficial.337 There is evidence for efficacy of several in terferon -based treatments, including interferon beta -1b,212 interferon beta -1a,119 and interferon alpha -2b.380 In these studies, interfer ons were generally administered with other treatments . Small, observational studies have found benefits of tocilizumab195, 411, 446, 526 and sarilumab35 in severe COVID -19 patients, and Phase II trial results show limited reductions in mortality.382 Tocili zumab efficacy may depend on C -reactive protein levels158, 318 and may be more beneficial when administered early.177 Tocilizumab has been associated with reduced risk of severe illness, but also an increased risk of secondary (non -COVID -19) infection.185 Limited, preliminary evidence from clinical trials supports the efficacy of favipiravir ,86 intravenous immunoglobulin,64 baricitinib,62 and ivermectin.391 Lenzilumab, a monoclonal antibody, showed benefits to oxygenation levels in severely ill patients (n=12).460 There is no clinical benefit from combination ritonavir /lopinavir .63, 180, 280 Phase II clinical trial results for the kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib showed few sever e side effects and suggested b enefits in terms of symptom duration and mortality.65 High doses of chloroquine diphosphate were associated with lethality in severely ill patients.45 The anticoagulant heparin is being used to mitigate risks of pulmonary embolism.140 Systemic anticoagulant use was associated with reduced mortality rates in severely ill patients.371 Passive antibody the rapy (convalescent serum)66 is being given to patients,147 appears safe,232 and several small trials (<50 patients) suggest benefits from con valescent patient plasma for infected patients.141, 289, 419, 434, 436 In a small study (n=10), 80% of patients given plasma showed an increase in antibody levels following transfusion.308 Results f rom a clinical trial (n=103) showed no significant benefits of plasma therapy, though the sample size was low .272 Another randomized trial with con valescent plasma was halted due to similar neutralizing antibody levels in enrolled recipients and donors.170 What do we need to know? Additional information on treatment efficacy is required, particularly from large randomized clinical trials. Do monoclonal antibodies exhibit any efficacy in human trials?

What do we know? Broad- scale control measures such as stay -at-home orders are effective at reducing movement an d contact rates, and modeling shows evidence that they reduce transmission. Social distancing and other policies are estimated to have reduced COVID -19 spread by 44% in Hong Kong111 and reduced spread throughout China ,246, 251, 253, 299, 313, 485 Italy ,164 and the US.245 Restrictive lockdowns in China are estimated to have reduced disease transmission within only a few days,560 in part, through reductions in an individual's average number of contacts.543 In China, modeling suggests that a one -day delay in implementing control measures increased the time needed to curtail an outbreak by 2.4 days.133 Modeling demonstrates that multifaceted restrictions and quarantines in China r educed the R 0 of SARS -CoV-2 from greater than 3 to less than 1 between January 23 and February 5.368 Additionally, movement restrictions and other control measures helped limit the amount of time where comm unity transmission was possible (i.e., R 0 > 1).544 A US county -level model found that shelter in place orders (SIPOs) and restaurant and bar c losures were associated with large reductions in exponential growth rate of cases.109 School closures and ca ncellation of large gatherings had smaller effects.109 Similarly, researchers found that a larger number of public health interventions in place was strongly associated with lower COVID -19 growth rates in the next week.234 On the USS Theodore Roosevelt, individual behaviors such as wearing face coverings and practicing social distancing were associated with reduced risk of COVID -19 infection.378 Mobility155, 258 and physical contact rates221 decline after public health control measures are implemented. Mobility reductions in the US have been associated with significant reductions in COVID -19 case growth, demonstrating the effectiveness of broad -scale public health interventions.25 Modeling suggests that on their own, travel restrictions delay peak prevalence by only a few days b ut do not limit epidemic size.12 Models indicate that a combination of school closures, work restrictions, and other measures are required to effectively limit transmission.152 School closures alone appear insufficient.219, 253 Non-pharmaceutical interventions in China did not reduce transmission equally across all groups; transmission rates in younger individuals and hospital workers continued to increase even while overall transmission rates declined.368 Two modeling studies identified large reductions in transmission due to country lockdowns157 and other social distancing measures,203 with substantial variation in the efficacy of particular policies in different countries.157, 203 Contact tracing to identify infected individuals reduces the amount of time infectious individuals can transmit disease in a population and i ncreases the time between successive cases. 39 Robust contact tracing and case finding may be needed to control COVID -19 in the US, but would require additional staff and resources to conduct effectively.489 In South Korea, early implementation of rapid contact tracing, testing , and quarantine of confirmed and suspected cases was able to reduce the transmission rate of COVID -19.452 Modeling studies suggest that contact tracing combined with high levels of testing may limit COVID -19 resurgence once initial social distancing policies are relaxed.11, 153 Contact tracing is likely to be more effective when conducted in combination with other control measures such as expanded testing and physical distancing, otherwise the number of contacts necessary for tracing becomes prohibitive. 250 Research is needed to help plan for easing of restrictions. Relaxation of public health interve ntions is projected to increase cases and deaths .116, 469 As of 7/7/2020, 37 US states are experiencing increases in the average daily rate of new confirmed cases (for the prior 14 days ).358 Modeling suggests that optimal control poli cies involve quickly quarantining infected individuals, and that periods of social distancing or lock -down may be effective in reducing overall exposure from asym ptomatic or unconfirmed cases.467 Testing is critical to balancing public health and economic costs.467 Rolling interventions, whereby social distancing measures are put into place every few weeks, may keep healthcare demand below a critical point.533 Modeling indicates that COVID -19 is likely to become endemic in the US population, with regular, periodic outbreaks, and that additional social or physical distancing measures may be required for several years to keep cases below critical care capacity in absence of a vaccine or effective therapeu tic. 239 Results depend on the duration of immunity after exposure.239 A modeling study using Chinese data suggests that carefully balanc ing control measures to maintain R 0 below 1 would be more efficient than allowing R 0 to increase above 1 at any point.266 The WHO has released guidelines on public health strategy,498 and Johns Hopkins released a report outlining how to re - open certain categories of activities (e.g., schools, restaurants, even ts) while reducing COVID -19 risk.406 Surveys indicate that the majority of Americans were complying with non -pharmaceutical interventions .114 What do we need to know? As different US states have implemented differing control measures at various times, a comprehensive analysis of social distancing efficacy has not yet been conducted.

SARS -CoV-2 Data In simulated saliva on stainless steel surface, SARS -CoV-2 exhibits negligible d ecay over 60 minutes in darkness, but loses 90% of infectivity every 6.8 -12.8 minutes, depending on the intensity of simulated UVB radiation levels.394 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) developed a data -based model for SARS -CoV-2 decay on inert surfaces (stainless steel, ABS plastic and nitrile rubber) at varying temperature and relative humidity. This model estimates virus decay in the absence of exposure to direct sunlight.130 SARS- CoV-2 can persist on plasti c and metal surfaces between 3 days (21 -23\u00b0C, 40% RH)471 and 7 days (22 \u00b0C, 65% RH). Infectious virus can be recovered from a surgical mask a fter 7 days (22 \u00b0C, 65% RH).99 SARS- CoV-2 persists for less than 3 days within the pages of library books, and for less than 1 day on the exterior of book and DVD covers.2 Both temperature and humidity contribute to SARS -CoV-2 survival on nonporous surfaces, with cooler, less humid environments facilitating survival (stainless steel, ABS plastic, and nitrile rubber; indoors only; simulated saliva matrix).42 Experimental studies using SARS -CoV-2 aerosols (1.78 -1.96 m mass median aerodynamic diameter in artificial saliva matrix) found that simulated sunlight rapidly inactivates the virus, with 90% reductions in infectious concentration after 6 minutes in high -intensity sunlight (similar to mid-June ) and 19 minut es in l ow-intensity sunlight (similar to early March or October ).428 In dark conditions, the half -life of aerosolized SARS -CoV-2 is approximately 86 minutes in simulated saliva matrix.428 Humidity had no significant impact on aerosolized virus survival.428 DHS developed a tool for estimating the decay of aerosolized SARS -CoV-2 in different environmental conditions.129 SARS- CoV-2 has an aerosol half -life of 2.7 hours (particles <5 m, tested at 21 -23\u00b0C and 65% RH).471 Research suggest s SARS -CoV-2 retains infectivity as an aerosol for up to 16 hours in appropriate conditions (23 \u00b0C, 53% RH, no sunlight).150 SARS- CoV-2 is susceptible to heat treatment (70 \u00b0C) but can persist for at least two weeks at refrigerated tem peratures (4\u00b0C).99, 393 SARS- CoV-2 genetic material (RNA) was detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic cruise ship passenger rooms up to 17 days after cabins were vacated. The infectiousness of this material is not known.345 In a p reliminary study, SARS -CoV-2 stability was enhanced when present with bovine serum albumin, which is commonly used to represent sources of protein found in human sputum.376 No strong evidence exists showing a reduction in transmission with seasonal increase in temperature and humidity.305 Modeling suggests that even accounting for potential reductions in transmission due to weather and behavioral changes, public health in terventions will still need to be in effect to limit COVID -19 transmission.335 A rece nt study determined that approximately 0.1 -1% of initial SARS -CoV-2 inoculated on plastic, stainless steel, glass, ceramics, wood, latex gloves, cotton, paper, and surgical masks remained after 48 hours.293 Approximately 0.1% of SARS - CoV-2 remains in fecal matter after 6 hours.293 Approximately 0.1% of SARS -CoV-2 in human urine persists after 4 -5 days.293 RNA in clinical samples collected in viral transport medium is stable at 18 -25\u00b0C or 2-8\u00b0C for up to 2 1 days without impacting real -time RT -PCR results.445 RNA in clinical samples is also stable at 4 \u00b0C for up for 4 weeks with regard to quantitative RT -PCR testing (given that the sample contains 5,000 copies/mL). Separately, storage of RNA in PBS at room - temperature (18 -25\u00b0C) resulted in unstable sample concentrations.379 SARS- CoV-2 was detectable on wooden chopsticks used by symptomatic and asympt omatic COVID -19 patients, though sample sizes were small and no efforts were made to isolate infectious virus.304 What do we need to k now? Additional testing on SARS -CoV-2, as opposed to surrogate viruses, is needed to support initial estimate s of stability. Tests quantifying infectivity, rather than the presence of viral RNA, are needed.

What do we know? Soap and water, as well as common alcohol and chlorine -based cleaners, hand sanitizers, and disinfectants are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2 on hands and surfaces. SARS -CoV-2 Alcohol -based hand rubs are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2.247 Chlorine bleach (1%, 2%), 70% ethanol and 0.05% chlorhexidine are effect ive aga inst live virus in lab tests.98 Twice -daily cleaning with sodium dichloroisocyanurate decontaminated surfaces in COVID -19 patient hospital ro oms.363 EPA has released a list of SARS -CoV-2 disinfectants, but solutions were not tested on SARS -CoV-2.9 Oral antiseptic rinses used in pre- procedural rinses for dentistry containing povidone -iodine (PVP -I) are effective decontaminants of SARS -CoV-2, with 15 -sec and 30 -sec c ontact times completely inactivating SARS -CoV-2 at concentrations above 0.5% in lab tests .40 Other Coronaviruses Chlorine -based502 and ethanol -based106 solutions a re recommended. Heat treatment (56 \u00b0C) is sufficient to kill coronaviruses,390, 555 though effectiveness depends partly on protein in the sample.390 70% ethanol, 50% isoprop anol, sodium hypochlorite and CCV).418 Ethanol -based biocides effectively disinfect coronaviruses dried on surfaces, including ethanol containing gels similar to hand s anitizer.210, 508 Surface spray disinfectants such as Mikrobac, D ismozon, and Korsolex are effective at reducing infectivity of the closely related SARS -CoV-1 after 30 minutes of c ontact.389 Coronavi ruses may be resistant to heat inactivation for up to 7 days when stabilized in stool.463-464 Coronaviruses are more stable in matrixes such as respiratory sputum.136 Researchers have identified four methods capable of decontaminating N95 respirators while maintaining physical integrity (fit factor): UV radiation, heating to 70 \u00b0C, and vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP).154 Ethanol (70%) was associated with loss of physical integrity.154 Hydrogen peroxide vapor (VHP) can repeatedly decontaminate N95 respirators.402 Devices capable of decontaminating 80,000 masks per day have b een grant ed Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA.143 The FDA has issued an Emergency U se Author ization for a system capable of decontaminating ten N95 masks at a time using devices already present in many US hospitals.50 What do we need to know?

Does contamination with human fluids/waste alter disinfectant efficacy profiles? How effective is air filtration at reducing transmission in healthca re, airpl anes, and public spaces?

What do we know? The effectiveness of PPE for SARS -CoV-2 is currently unknown, and data from other related coronaviruses are used for guidance. Healthcare workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID -19, even with recommended PPE. Healthcare worker illnesses461 demonstrates human -to-human transmission despite isolatio n, PPE, and infection control.427 Risk of transmission to healthcare workers is high, with up to 20% of healthcare workers in Lombardy, Italy becoming infected.397 Over 50% of US healthcare workers infected with COVID -19 report work in a healthcare setting as their single source of expos ure.57 Hospital -acquired infection rates fell after introduction of comprehensive inf ection control measures, including expanded testing and use of PPE for all patient contacts.403 \"Healthcare personnel entering the room [of SARS -CoV-2 patients] should use standard precautions, contact precautions, airborne precauti ons, and use eye protection (e.g., goggles or a face shield).\"74 WHO indicates healthcare workers should wear clean long -sleeve gowns as well as gloves.501 Clothing and PPE that covers all skin may reduc e exposure to pathogens.151, 493 Respirators (NIOSH -certified N95, EUFFP2 or equivalent) are recommended for those dealing with possible aerosols.502 Additional protection, such as a Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) with a full hood, should be considered for high- risk procedures (i.e., intubation, ventilation).53 KN95 respirators are, under certain conditions, approved for use under FDA Emergency Use Authorization.144 On May 7, the FDA rescinded a number of KN95 models that no longer meet the EUA criteria and are no longer authorized.149 A study suggests that P1 00 respirators with removable filter cartridges have similar filtration efficiency compared to N95 respirators and could plausibly be used if N95 respirators were in short supply. The study used an experiment al setup with aerosolized simulant, not human te sting.377 Particular care sh ould be taken with \"duckbill\" N95 respirators, which may fail fit tests after repeated doffing.123 Dome - shaped N95 respirators also failed fit tests after extended use.123 Masks may be effective at slowing transmission. On 4/3/2020, the US CDC recommended wearing cloth face masks in public where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. 75 The WHO recommends that the general population wear non- medical masks when in public settings and when physical distancing is difficult, and that vulnerable populations (e .g., elderly) wear medical masks when close contact is likely .497 Infected individuals wearing facemasks in the home before the onset of symptoms was associated with a reduction in household transmission.487 Modeling suggests that widespread use of facemasks is effective at reducing transmission.353 A meta -analysis of SARS, MERS, and COVID -19 transmission events found evidence that wearing face masks and eye protection were each associated with lower risk of tr ansmission.101 N95 resp irators were associated with a larger reduction in transmission risk compared to surgical face masks.101 Physical distance (>1 or 2 meters) was also associated with lower transmission risk.101 In a separate me ta-analysis, N95 respirators were found to be beneficial for reducing the occurrence of respiratory illness in health care professionals including influenza, though surgical masks were similarly effective for influe nza.360 N95 respirators were associated with large reductions (up to 80%) in SARS -CoV-1 infections.360 Surgical face masks, respirators and homemade face masks may prevent transmission of coronaviruses from infectious individuals (with or without symptoms) to other individuals.118, 267, 470 Surgical masks were associated with a significan t reduction in the amount of seasonal coronav irus (not SARS -CoV-2) expressed as aerosol particles (<5 m) compared to not wearing a mask.267 The efficacy of homemade PPE, made with T -shirts, bandanas, or similar materials, is less than standard PPE, but may offer some protection if no other options are available.102, 117, 399 The filtering efficiency of homemade mask materials is variable. Some non -standard materials (e.g., cotton, cotto n hybrids) may be able to filter out >90% of simulant particles >0.3 m,242 while other materials (e.g., T -shirt, vacuum cleaner bag, towels) appear to have lower filtration efficacy (~35 -62%).484 Of 42 homemade materials tested, the three with the greatest filtration efficiencies were layered cotton with raised visible fibers,541 though homemade materials were not as effective as surgical or N95 masks. What do we need to know? Most PPE recommendations have not been made on SARS -CoV-2 data, and comparative efficacy of different PPE for different tasks (e.g., intubation) is unknown. Identification of efficacious PPE for healthcare workers is critical due to their high rates of infection. What is the importance of aerosol transmission (particles <5 m)? What is the effective distance of spread via droplet or aerosol? How effective are barriers such as N95 respirators or surgical masks for SARS -CoV-2?

Tests to be used for attribution. What do we know? All current evidence supports the natural emergence of SARS -CoV-2 via a bat and possible intermediate mammal species. Genomic analysis places SARS -CoV-2 into the beta -coronavirus clade, with close relationship to bat coronaviruses. The SARS- CoV-2 virus is distinct from SARS -CoV-1 and MERS viruses.131 Genomic analysis suggests that SARS -CoV-2 is a natural variant and is unlikely to be human -derived or otherwise cr eated by \"recombination\" with other circulating strains of coronavirus.14, 558 Comparing genomes of multiple coronaviruses using machine -learning has ident ified key genomic signatures shared among high case fatality rate coronaviruses (SARS -CoV-1, SARS -CoV-2, MERS) and animal counterparts.187 These data further suggest that SAR S-CoV-2 emergence is the result of natural emergence and that there is a potential for future zoonotic transmission of additional pathogenic strains to humans.187 Genomic data support at least two plausible origins of SARS -CoV-2: \"(i) natural selection in a non -human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.\"14 Both scenarios are consistent with the observed genetic changes found in all known SARS -CoV-2 isolate s. Some SARS- CoV-2 genomic evidence in dicates a close relationship with pangolin coronavir uses,509 and data suggest that pangolins may be a natural host for beta -coronaviruses.285, 287 Genomic evidence suggests a plausible recombination event between a circulating coronavirus in pangol ins and bats could be the source of SARS -CoV-2.524 Emerging studies are showing that bats are not the only reservoir of SARS -like coronaviruses.548 Additional research is needed. There are multiple studies showing that the SARS -CoV-2 S protein receptor binding domain, the portion of the protein responsible for binding the human receptor ACE2, was acquired through recombination between coronaviruses from pangolins and bats.15, 276, 286, 548 These studies suggest that pangolins may have played an intermediate role in the adaptation of SARS -CoV-2 to be able to bind to the human ACE2 receptor. Additional research is needed. A novel bat coronavirus (RmYN02) has bee n identified in China with an insertion in the viral furin cleavage site. While distinct from the insertion in SARS -CoV-2, this evidence shows that such insertions can occur naturally.557 Additionally, \"[...] SARS -CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone,\" reducing the likelihood of laboratory origination,14 and \"[...] genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS -CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, [though] it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin.\"14 Work with other coronaviruses has indicated that heparan sulfate dependence can be an i ndicator of prior cell passage, due to a mutation in the previous furin enzyme recognition motif.121 What do we need to know? Identifying the intermediate species between bats and humans would aid in reducing potential spillover from a natural source. Wide sampling of bats, other wild animals, and humans is needed to address the origin of SARS -CoV-2. What tests for attribution exist for coronavirus emergence? What is the identity of the intermediate s pecies? Are there closely related circulating coronaviruses in bats or other animals with the novel PRRA cleavage site found in SARS -CoV-2? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 7/7/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEA SE 17 Genomics - How does the disease agent compare to previous strains? What do we know? Current evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 accumulates substitutions and mutations at a similar rate as other coronaviruses. Mutations and deletions in specific portions of the SARS -CoV-2 genome have not been linked to any changes in transmission or disease severit y, though modeling work is attempting to identify possible changes. There have been no documented cases of SARS -CoV-2 prior to December 2019. Preliminary genomic analyses, however, suggest that the first human cases of SARS -CoV-2 emerged between 10/19/2019 - 12/17/2019.17, 32, 392 Analysis of more than 7,000 SARS -CoV-2 genome samples provides an estimated mutation rate of 6x10-4 nucleotides per genome per year.473 The same analysis estimates the emergence of SARS -CoV-2 in humans bet ween October and December 2019.473 This aligns with the first known human cases in China in early December 2019, in Europe in late December 2019,128 and circulation in the US (Washington State) in February 2020.512 In both California127 and New York City,174 phylogenetic evidence supports multiple introductions of SARS -CoV-2 from both inside and outside the US. Despite evidence of variation in the genome80 and areas under positive selection,59 there are no known associations between particular mutatio ns and changes in transmission or virulence.60 Thus, there is currently no evidence of distinct SARS- CoV-2 phenotypes at this time.307, 473 Research attempting to define clades or subgroups of SARS -CoV-2 based solely on genomic features has suffered from limited data537 and sampling bias.159 In 94 COVID -19 patients where both symptoms and genetic sequences of SARS -CoV-2 were known, there was no asso ciation between viral genotype and clinical severity.549 Phylogenetic and clinical analysis suggests the D614G mutation in the Spike protein is associated with higher rates of SARS - CoV-2 transmissio n, but no change in clinical severity in infected patients.244 However, it is difficult to determine whether this mutation is overrepresented due to founder effects, or whether it truly spreads more rapidly than other isolates. Preliminary experimental evidence suggests that this mutation increases infectivity in cell lines, but additional animal model work is needed to confirm the effect of this mutation on transmission.546 Recent analysis of >16,000 genomes of SARS -CoV-2 suggests two maj or introductions in the US, one associated with the West coast and one with the Eastern portion of the US .346 A genome -wide association study i n humans identified two loci corresponding to higher risk of severe COVID -19 (3p.21.31 and 9q34.2), including one associated with blood type.138 Individuals with type -O blood showed reduced risk of severe disease, while individuals with type -A blood showed an increased risk.138 SARS- CoV-2 is acquiring nucleotide changes at a rate that suggests the virus is undergoing pur ifying selection (that the genome is stabilizing toward a common genome).514 Low genetic divers ity early in the epidemic suggests that SARS -CoV-2 was capable of jumping to human and other mammalian hosts,514 and that additional jumps into humans from reservoir species may occur. Phylogenetic s suggest that SARS -CoV-2 is of bat origin, but is closely related to coronaviruses found in pangolin s.285, 287 The SARS -CoV-2 Spike pro tein, which mediates entry into host cells and is the major determinant of host range, is very similar to the SARS -CoV-1 Spike p rotein.300 The rest of the genome is more closely related to two separate bat300 and coronaviruses found in pangolin s.287 An analysis of SARS -CoV-2 sequences from Singapore has identified a large nucleotide (382 bp) deletion in ORF -8.450 In Arizona, researchers identified an 81 -base pair deletion (removing 27 amino acids) in the ORF -7a protein, indicating that mutations can be detected by routine sentinel surveillance. The function of these deletions are unknown at this time.199 A recent report of virus mutations within patients needs more research.235 Additi onal analysi s of data suggests the results may be due to experimental methods.171, 528 Structural modeling suggests that observed changes in the genetic sequence of the SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein may enhance binding of the virus to human ACE2 receptors.364 More specifically, changes to two residues (Q493 and N501) are linked with improving the stability of the virus -receptor binding complex.364 Additionally, structural modeling identified several existing mutations that may enhance the stability of the receptor binding domain, potentially incr easing binding efficacy.366 Infectivity assays are needed to validate the genotypic changes and possible phenotypic results identified in these studies. A key difference between SARS -CoV-2 and other beta -coronaviruses is the p resence of a polybasic furin cleavage site in the Spike protein (insertion of a PRRA amino acid sequence between S1 and S2).110 The US CDC is launching a national genomics consortium to assess SARS -CoV-2 genomic changes over time.69 What do we need to know? Rese arch linking genetic changes to differences in phenotype (e.g., transmissibility, virulence, progression in patients) is needed. Are there similar genomic differences in the progression of coronavirus strains from bat to intermediate species to human? Are there different strains or clades of circulating virus? If so, do they differ in virulence? What are the mutations in SARS -CoV-2 that allowed human infection and transmission?

Relies in part on IHME forecasts.217 COVID Act Now: State and county -level dashboard focused on re -opening strategies, showing trends in four metrics related to COVID -19 risk (change in cases, total testing capacity, fraction of positive tests, and availability of ICU beds). Fundamentally uses an SEIR model fit to observed data.357 Researchers use a rolling window analysis incorporating uncertainty in the generation time distribution to estimate time - varying transmission rates in US states (the effective reproduction number, R eff or Rt).6 What do we need to know? Forecasts differ in how they handle public health interventions such as shelter -in-place orders and tracking how methods change in the near future will be important for understanding limitations going forward.
