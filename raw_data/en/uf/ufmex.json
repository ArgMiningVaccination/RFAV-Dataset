Traditional Chiropractic care has the following goals: Decrease muscle spasm Increase range of motion Reduce pain. Most chiropractors have been doing this for a long time, and I believe most of them are great at what they do. However, we believe the more traditional methods fall under the umbrella of symptom management. Ok, so what is NeuroSTRUCTURAL CHIROPRACTIC? NeuroStructural Chiropractors look at the spine from an engineering standpoint. After working with patients, not only do we want them to feel better and experience and increased quality of life, but we want them to actually be able to see the changes we've made. We measure everything objectively, not relying on touch and feel, to locate and correct structural abnormalities in the spine. This means we perform a comprehensive evaluation of the spine using state-of-the-art diagnostics. By using these objective measures, we can locate the primary cause of a patient's symptoms and deliver lasting corrections. Breaking the Cycle We understand our services may not be right for everyone, however, for those tired of searching for relief and finding only short term solutions, NeuroStructural Chiropractic might be right for you. After correcting any structural abnormalities we find, we will provide you with the support to properly maintain your correction so the problem doesn't return. "}
