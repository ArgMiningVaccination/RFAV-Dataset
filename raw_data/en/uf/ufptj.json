Services are designed to offer an alternative to secular options for individuals who seek a pathway or link to Jewish tradition, Jewish roots, and Jewish spirituality. The Jewish Spiritual Healing center was created to promote the spiritual, intellectual, and physical and mental health of Westchester County's Jewish community by infusing a collection of programs and services with the intrinsic power of Judaism's history and tradition. Whether faced with a particular need or concern, or engaged in a journey to find Jewish connections and spiritual fulfillment, people will discover opportunities that foster health and healing for the mind, body, and spirit within a Jewish context. Individual counseling, spiritual healing services, and workshops are offered throughout the year. The Jewish Spiritual Healing Center is funded with support from UJA-Federation of New York.
