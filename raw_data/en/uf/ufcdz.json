Moreover, in a trial to study the effect of EOs on vNDv genotype VII in vivo as a preven- tive or therapeutic measure, 2 additional ND-vaccinatedgroups were used (PRV: medicated 1 D before vNDvchallenge for 5 D; and TTT: medicated 2 D after vNDvchallenge for 5 D). In addition, the immune-modulatoryeffect of EOs on the avian in fluenza ( AI), bronchitis ( IB), ( IBD)v a c - cines was assessed through the serological response. The use of EOs along with administration of ND vaccines (VTC ) revealed a lower mortality rate (42.86%), clinical signs, lesion score (11) than ND vaccinesalone ( inhibition ( P,0.05) (6.5 60.46) log 2.28 60.24) titres 1 wk after c h a l l e n g ei nc o m p a r i s o nw i t hV C( 8 . 6 3 60.65 and 10 log 3.2960.72, respectively). Nevertheless, the EOs mixture (VTC) (1952 628.82) did not signi cantly ( P.0.05) improve growth performance compared with the non-treated birds (NC and VC) (1970 619.56 and 1904638.66). EOs showed an antiviral effect on vNDv in vivo (in chickens) as a preventive measure ( PRV )a s well as some therapeutic effect ( TTT) through decreasing the viral shedding titres (loNC 0), mortality rate, and severity of clinical signs and postmortem lesions, in addi-tion to serum malondialdhyde level. Regarding the otherviruses, the EOs mixture did not improve the immuneresponse to the AI and IB vaccines but signi cantly ( P, 0.05) increased the ELISA antibody titre for IBD virus atthe 28th D of age (2,108 6341.05). The studied EOs mixture showed an immune-stimulating response to ND and IBD vaccines, antiviral effect against ND virus,especially if administered before the challenge; however, itdid not have a growth-promoting effect.

Furthermore, theyhave the capability of inducing diseases independentlyor in concurrent infection with each other ( Roussan et al., 2008 ). AI viruses are classi ed in the genus Influ- enza virus of Orthomyxoviridae family ( Cox et al., 2000 ), while the etiology of IBD or Gumboro disease is the IBDvirus that is a member of genus Avibirnavirus of the Bir- naviridae family ( Delmas et al., 2019 ). IB virus is belonging to Coronavirus genus of family Coronaviridae/C2112020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of Poultry Science Association Inc.

Received December nahed.abdelgawad@alexu.edu.eg (NAE-S); dr.mohamed.e.abdalhaq@gmail.com (MEAE-H) the cause of ND is ND virus, belonging to genus Avulavirus ofParamyxoviridae family ( Hines and Miller, 2012 ). All these viruses have RNA genome enclosed within either enveloped (AI, IB,and ND viruses) or nonenveloped (IBD virus) capsid.Their outbreaks still occur in the eld, although several live, inactivated, or recombinant vaccines are commer-cially available, and different vaccination programs areapplied for each disease ( Swayne and King, 2003 ). Many factors are related to this problem, and one of them is the immune suppression or an immature immune system ( Skowronski et al., 2008 ). Moreover, if a virus is endemic in a region, its elimination is dif cult, so addi- tional methods are required to combat these virusesalong with vaccination. Recently, there has beenincreased interest in the use of natural antimicrobialagents, and the use of EOs in combination as a strategyto control many pathogens ( Gutierrez et al., 2008 ). Over 3,000 EOs are known, of which approximately 300 are commercially important and used in the flavour and fragrance industries ( Van de Braak and Leijten, 1999; Baghban-Kanani et al., 2019 ). Essential oils are produced by medicinal plants, and their effects varybased on the component, which may have antibacterial(Sokovic et al., 2010; Qorbanpour et al., 2018 ), antiviral ( Koch 2018 ). Nevertheless, Reichlinga et al. (2009) concluded in their review that the most tested essential oils exhibited a clear antiviral activityon enveloped DNA and RNA viruses, while they didnot affect the nonenveloped viruses. In addition, there are recent studies proving that EOs can improve the cellular and humoral immune responses of chickens(Lee et al., 2011; Roofchaee et al., 2011 ). We hypothesized that EOs mixture stimulates immuneresponse to different viral vaccines used in broilerflocks, promotes weight gaining, and can be used to the face the viral outbreaks such as ND virus. The objectives of this study included 1) evaluation of EOs 'efcacy on stimulating the immune response to ND vaccines through the challenge with virulent NDv(vNDv) genotype VII; 2) assessment of the antiviraleffect of EOs in vivo as a preventive measure and as atherapy for vNDv infection in broiler chickens; 3) evalu-ation of the effect of commercially prepared EOs on thehumoral immune response to the AI, IB, and IBD vac-cines in broiler chickens. MATERIAL AND METHODS Essential Oils A mixture of EOs produced commercially under the trade name \"Broclear \"(Nutrex nv-Achterstenhoek Co., Belgium-aBE2165) was supplemented through the drinking water at a dose of 0.5 mL/L. This mixture con-tained oregano oil (50 g), carvacrol (10 g), thyme oil(33.33 g), eucalyptus oil (50 g), thymol (5 g), eucalyptol (10 g), and acacia (Arabic gum) surfactant (27 g) in wa- ter up to 1 L. The Challenge With Virulent ND Virus (vNDv) A previously isolated and characterized virulent geno- type VII ND virus ( Sedeik et al., 2019 ) was used for chal- lenging experimental groups. The challenge was performed at the 28th D of age (d) with 106.3EID 50/ 100mL/bird ( Reed and Muench, 1938 ) via (50mL) and the intranasal (50 mL) route ( Sedeik et al., 2019). The negative control group was sham challenged with similar volumes and routes using phosphate-buffered saline. Experimental Chickens and Design A total of 126 one-day-old unsexed Ross 308 broiler chicks were obtained from a local hatchery and divided,by the ranking method to uniform initial body weight,into 6 groups (n 521 with 3 replicates in each, n 57), as follows: NC: nonvaccinated, untreated, and nonchallenged (negative control) PC: nonvaccinated, untreated, and vNDv challenged (positive control) VC: vaccinated, untreated, and vNDv challenged (vaccinated, challenged) VTC: vaccinated, treated (EOs treatment was started after each vaccine and continued for 3 D), and vNDvchallenged (vaccinated, treated, and challenged) PRV: vaccinated and treated (EOs treatment was started 1 D before vNDv challenge and continued for5 D) (preventive group) TTT: vaccinated and treated (EOs treatment was started 2 D after vNDv challenge and continued for5 D) (therapeutic group) All birds in the experimental groups except NC (nega- tive control) were challenged with vNDv genotype VII at the 28th D. Vaccinated groups (VC, VTC, PRV, and TTT) received the vaccination program shown in(Table 1 ) against ND, IB, IBD, and AI. The feeding pro- gram consisted of starter feed (crumbles) for the rst 12 D with 23% crude protein and metabolizable energy(ME) of 3,008 kcal/kg diet, grower feed (pellets) (21% crude protein and 3,080 kcal/kg diet ME) up to the26th D, followed by nisher (pellets) feed till the end of the experiment (35 D) with 19% crude protein and 3,190 kcal/kg diet ME. Feed and water were providedto all birds with free access. The chicks were receivedat 32 /C14C on day 1, and then the temperature was decreased linearly by 2/C14C per week. All experimental procedures in this study were performed according tothe Local Experimental Animal Care Committee andapproved by the ethics of the institutional committee of the Department of Poultry and Fish Diseases, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Alexandria University, Egypt.All efforts were made to minimize suffering.ESSENTIAL OILS AFFECT RESPONSE TO VIRAL VACCINES 2945Blood Sampling Ten blood samples without anticoagulant were gath- ered from additional ten one-day-old chicks by slaugh-tering for measuring maternally derived antibodies speci c for NDv. At weekly interval, blood samples were collected from the wing vein of randomly selected12 birds per group (four birds/replicate) at the 14th,21th, and 28th D, while at the 35th D, blood sampleswere collected from the surviving birds. Sera werecollected by centrifugation for 10 min at 1,500 !g and were stored into eppindorff tubes at 220 /C14C until the use for serological tests. For hematological and phagocytic activity (PA) as- says, blood samples were collected at the 28th D usingan anticoagulant (sodium citrate 3.8%) from 6 birds in each group (NC, VC, and VTC) (2 birds/replicate) and were sent to the laboratory at the same day. Immunological and Hematological Assays Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and classical ELISA tests were performed to measure antibody titres ( IgG) against ND, AI, test was performedin U-based microtiter plates using 4 HA units of LaSotaantigen B.V. Boxmeer-Holland) and Co., Egypt) ( OIE, 2012 ). ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer 's protocol (Synbiotics Co.). Haema- tological parameters were determined according to studybyCampbell (1991) as follows: total red and white blood cell counts were determined manually using a hemocy-tometer. The packed cell volume was measured by acapillary tube technique using microhematocrit capillary tubes centrifuged at 2,500 rpm for 5 min. The hemoglo- bin concentration was measured by the cyanomethemo-globin method. The differential leukocyte count wascarried out using blood smears stained with Wrights-Giemsa stain according to their identi cationcharacteristics, and the percentage and absolute value for each cell type were calculated. Phagocytic Assay and Organs Index Phagocytic assay was determined according to the study by Kawahara et al. (1991) : Fifty micrograms of Candida albicans culture was added to 1 mL of citrated blood collected from 6 birds (individually) in each group(NC, VC, and VTC) (2/replicate) and shaken in a waterbath at 25 /C14C for 5 h. Blood smears were then stained with Wrights-Giemsa stain. Phagocytosis was estimated by determining the proportion of macrophages that con-tained intracellular yeast cells in a random count of 300macrophages and was expressed as the percentage of PA. The bursa of Fabricius, thymus, spleen, and liver were collected from 6 birds per group for NC, VC, andVTC (2 birds/replicate) at the 28th D and were weighedindividually to calculate the relative organ weights andrepresented as organ index. Organ index 5(organ weight [gram]/body weight [gram])!1000 ( Hedayati et al., 2005 ). Clinical and Postmortem Investigations, Mortality Rate, and Growth Performance The mortality rate was recorded, and all birds in the experimental groups were daily observed for 7 D afterchallenge (PC).

The birds were individu- ally weighed to determine the body weight at the rst, 28th, and 35th D, and weight gain was calculated foreach bird at 1- to 28-, 28- to 35-, and 1- to 35-D intervals.Table 1.

The feed conversion ratio (FCR) was calculated as FCR per bird 5(total feed consumption in a pen O[weight gain of surviving birds 1weight gain of dead birds in the same pen]) ( Conway and McKenzie, 2007 ). Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain re- action (rRT-PCR) for viral shedding titres on oropha-ryngeal swabs Oropharyngeal swabs were taken from all surviving birds in each group at the second, fourth, and seventh day PC in 1.5 mL of phosphate-buffered saline - containing gentamicin (200 mg/mL) and penicillin G (1,000 units/mL). The collected swabs were centrifugedat 3,000 rpm for 10 min; the supernatants werecollected and stored at 280 /C14C until use. RNA was extracted from 200 mL of the collected oropharyngeal swab fluid using Thermo Scienti c Gene JET Viral DNA and RNA Extraction Kits following the manufac- turer 's recommended procedures. The ND virus fusion protein gene was ampli ed using the primers and probe according to the study by AlHabeeb et al. (2013) with the Stratagene Real-Time PCR system. The reactionwas composed of 5 mL of template RNA, 12.5 mLo f rRT-PCR Master Mix, 1.25 mL of RT-enhancer, 0.25 mL of enzyme mix, 1 mL of forward primer (50 pmol), 1 mL of reverse primer (50 pmol), 0.25 mL of probe, and 3.75 mL of RNAse free water. The PCR cycling conditions were 50 cycles at 94 /C14C for 10 s, 58/C14C for 5 s, and 72/C14C for 10 s preceded by an initial denaturation for 15 min at 95/C14C. Measurement according to the studies bySatoh (1978) andNishikimi et al. (1972) , respectively, using commercial kits produced by Biodiagnostic Co.(diagnostic and research reagents) at the 28th and 35th D.Statistics The data of growth performance, haematology, serology, antioxidant enzymes, and organ index wereanalysed using Statistical Analysis System softwareversion 9.2 ( SAS, 2004 ) by one-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc Duncan 's test. The data are pre- sented as the average 6standard error. All statements of differences were based on a signi cance level of P, 0.05. Coef cient of variation percentage of all groups were calculated according to the following equation:(y/x)*100, where y is standard deviation of the treat-ment and x is mean value of the same treatment. RESULTS Immune Response to NDv and Results of Subsequent vNDv Challenge Serology The average level of maternally derived anti- bodies speci c for NDv (HI) was 2 log 5.63 60.18, which decreased over time in the nonvaccinated control groups(NC and PC) to reach values of (2 log 3.13 60.40 and 3.3860.46, respectively) at the 28th D (challenge day). In addition, ND -vaccinated birds ( VC) titres ( P/C210.05) (2 log 460.87) at the challenge day than NC or PC birds (nonvaccinated). However, the use of EOs in combina- tion with vaccine application against ND in VTCincreased HI titre (2 log 4.5 60.27) ( P/C210.05) than VC (vaccinated only). Positive control birds PC) showed a signi cant in- crease ( HI titre (2 log 10.57 60.43) for NDv at the 35th D (7 D While, sero-conversionafter vNDv challenge was signi cantly ( P,0.05) lower as a result of using EOs together with ND vaccines in VTC (2 log 6.5 60.46) than the vaccine alone in VC (2 log 8.63 60.65).

Mortality Percentage and Clinical Protection The vNDv challenge in the experimental groups resulted in the death of 17 of 21 birds (80.95%) in PC (non-vaccinated and nontreated), which was reduced against ND in VC to 52.28% (11/21). Moreover,the use of EOs with vaccination as an immune modulatorin VTC reduced the mortality rate to 42.86% (9/21), whereas preventive and therapeutic groups (PRV and TTT) showed mortality rate of 38.09% (8/21) and47.62% (10/21), respectively ( Table 2 ). All birds in the negative control group (NC) appeared clinically normal,while vNDv challenge resulted in depression, swollenhead, conjunctivitis, rales, sneezing, and nasal dischargebeginning at the second day post challenge (PC) in allexperimentally challenged groups (PC, VC, VTC, PRV, and TTT). Greenish diarrhoea was also recorded in PC, VTC, and TTT ( Figure 2 ;Table 2 ). Upon examination of dead birds, congestion of the pec- toral muscles and trachea, proventricular haemorrhage,button-like ulcers on the small intestine, and a mottledenlarged spleen were observed ( Figure 2 ,Table 2 ). Oropharyngeal Shedding of vNDv Using rRT-PCR Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from all birds in each group separately at the second, fourth, and seventhday PC and were pooled. No oropharyngeal viral shed-ding was observed in the negative control birds (NC)throughout the experimental period. The peak of viralshedding (loNC 0) was recorded at the fourth day PC in all challenged experimental groups, and the highest titre was produced by the positive control group (PC)at all 3 intervals, whereas the lowest titre (loNC 0) wasrecorded in birds from PRV, followed by VTC and nally TTT as viral shedding titre (loNC 0) was 6.59, 4.76, 3.73, 3.11, and 4.1 at second day PC; 6.99, 4.98,3.94, 2.78, and 4.52 at fourth day PC; and 5.44, 3.29,2.28, 1.88, and 3.5 at seventh day PC in PC, VC,VTC, PRV and TTT, respectively ( Figure 3 ). Body Weight Gain and FCR There was no signi cant difference ( P/C210.05) in average body weight gain (g) among the experimentalgroups during the period from 1 D until the day of chal-lenge ( rst-28th D). However, the average body weight gain during 7 D after challenge was signi cantly reduced (P,0.05) in nonvaccinated challenged birds (PC) (387618.6) compared with negative control ones (NC) (458 625.92), as well as vaccinated challenged groups either treated with EOs (VTC, PRV, andTTT) or nontreated (VC). Moreover, body weightgain groups (VC-TTT) had no sig-nicant difference ( P/C210.05) in comparison with nega- tive control birds (NC). Regarding overall body weight gain (interval rst- 35th D), the signi cantly ( P,0.05) high body weight gain was observed in PRV (vaccinated and treatedwith EOs that started 1 D before challenge andcontinued for 5 D) (2001 6108.79) and NC (negative control) (1970 619.26) when compared with that pro- duced by the challenge with vNDv in PC (1807628.7) as shown in Table 3 . The FCR, at the in- terval of rst to 28th D of age (before challenge), was signicantly worse ( P,0.05) in the vaccinated group (VC) (1.89 60.04) when compared with that of negative control birds (NC) (1.66 60.04). Whereas, the use of EOs in VTC along with vaccination resulted in anFCR of 1.77 60.04, with no signi cant ( P/C210.05) differ- ence in comparison with either NC or VC. The FCR during 7 D PC was signi cantly ( P,0.05) higher in birds from PC (positive control) (2.83 60.18) than that of all other experimental groups. The bestTable 2.

DISCUSSION The results of the present study revealed that EOs mixture supplementation in drinking water at 0.5 mL/Lbeginning at 2 D after each vaccine application for 3 suc-cessive days (VTC) did not cause signi cant increase in ND HI antibody titre (log 2) until the age of challenge (28th D). Consistent with the reports of Sadeghi et al. (2012) andRahimi et al. (2011) . In contrast, Barbour et al. (2014) andThaje and Ulaiwi (2017) showed that the addition of eucalyptus and mint oils improved the hu-moral immune responses to ND virus in broilers. In addi-tion, Wati et al. (2015) reported an improvement in the humoral response (HI titre) to ND virus at the 21th Din broilers after using a phytogenic product, but this effectdid not last to the 39th D. Although the obtained result for VTC (vaccinated, EOs treated [after each vaccine] and challenged), animprovement of clinical protection (mortality, clinical signs, PM lesions, and viral shedding titre) was observed. This could be due to stimulating effect on cell-mediated and local immunity ( Cserep, 2008 ) and therefore elimi- nating some of the viruses from tissues ( Awaad et al., 2009). The penetration mechanism of the virus into the cells determines whether the virus is affected by theEOs or not and where ND virus penetrates cells througha fusion protein ( Cermelli et al., 2008 ), which in turn can be resistant to EOs ( Barbour et al., 2010 ), so not all ND viruses are affected by EOs. However, AI virus pene- trates the cells through a receptor-mediated endocytosismechanism ( Swayne and King, 2003 ). As many studies have discussed the in vitro antiviral activity of EOs against avian viruses after contact be-tween viruses and EOs for certain periods of time atroom temperature ( Barbour et al., 2010 ), here we designed PRV and TTT to study the antiviral effect of EOs in vivo (in chickens) at chicken 's body temperature (41.5 /C14C) either before (PRV) or after vNDv challenge (TTT). The improvement of the clinical and patholog-ical picture of vNDv was observed in PRV (receivedthe EOs supplement that was started from 1 D beforethe challenge and was continued for 5 D); in addition,this group had the lowest oropharyngeal shedding titre(log 10), which could be due to eucalyptus, and it has been used in traditional medicine to treat respiratory tract infections ( Cermelli et al., 2008 ) and may exhibit antiviral activity ( Barbour et al., 2010 ) and thus affects the virulence of the challenge virus. Moreover, EOsshowed more protective level against vNDv challengein PRV (preventive group) than TTT (therapeuticgroup) that may be attributed to the effect of EOsmixture on ND virus adsorption to cell surface and may block cell receptors resulting in interference with vi- rus binding; its accurate mode of action should be stud-ied through tissue culture. EOs supplementation, during the period of rst to 28th D, in VTC did not signi cantly improve body weight gain compared to the other nontreated groups(NC and VC). Although, VTC showed an improvedFCR (1.77 60.03), it did not signi cantly differ from negative control birds (NC) (1.66 60.04). (HI) titre (log 2) of avian influenza H5 antibodies.

The same was observed during 7 D PC for body weight gain and FCR. Nevertheless, theuse of ND vaccines, regardless EOs supplementation,has improved ( P,0.05) overall body weight gain in all challenged groups compared with the positive controlgroup. Similar results were obtained by Sedeik et al. (2019) . Supplementation of EOs as a preventive drug in PRV (that was started from 1 D before the challengeand continued for 5 D) along with vaccines applicationhas signi cantly improved the body weight gain compared with positive control birds (PC). The worst FCR was recorded in PC, followed by VC and TTT. In contrast, El-Ghousein and Al-Beitawi (2009), Awaad et al. (2016) , and Thaje and Ulaiwi (2017) reported that essential oils of eucalyptus, mint, and/or thyme oils resulted in signi cant increase in the body weight and weight gain, in addition to improvingthe FCR.The EOs enhance digestibility, balance thegastrointestinal tract micro flora, and stimulate the secretion of endogenous digestive enzymes, thus improvegrowth performance in poultry ( Williams and Losa, 2001; Cross et al., 2007 ). As well, thymol plus carvacrol has reported to signi cantly improve body weight gain FCR in broilers Hashemipour et al., 2013; Saki et al., 2014 ). The obtained results of body weight gain and FCR in this study were similar to thendings of Rehman et al. (2013), Toghyani et al. (2010) andLee et al. (2003) . The various results of the effect of different types of EOs on bird performance inseveral studies could be related to variations of dose, active components of the EOs mixture, the period of administration, and the environmental and nutritionalfactors. Lipid peroxidation is an autocatalytic process that leads to oxidative damage of cellular membranes ( Rheeet al., 1996 ) and cell death, producing toxic free radicals including MDA which is used as an indicator of lipid per-oxidation ( Jensen et al., 1997 ), while the antioxidative enzyme, SOD, protects cells from the damage causedby these free radicals ( Yesilbag et al., 2011 ). In this study, EOs had no signi cant effect on MDA or SOD in the serum at the 28th D (challenge day), but it causedsignicant decrease of MDA in PRV and TTT at the 35th D although vNDv challenge did not increase MDA level in PC (positive control). These resultsmake us ask about the role of ND infection on lipid per-oxidation and therefore the need for further studies. Thedecreased level of MDA at the seventh day PC in VTCmay be attributed to the antioxidant effect of thymethat is rich in flavonoids ( Cook Samman, 1996 ). Furthermore, Youdim (2000), Botsoglou et al. (2002) , and Hashemipour et al. (2013) that thymol, carvacrol, thyme oil, and/or oregano havestrong antioxidant activity and can inhibit lipidperoxidation. Regarding the immune-stimulating effect of the EOs mixture for other vaccines, AI and IB antibody titreswere not affected by EOs supplementation but that ofIBD virus signi cantly increased only at the 28th D. Similar results were obtained by Saki et al. (2014) for AI and IB but are not consistent for IBD, which couldbe due to the use of thyme essence in the drinking waterat different doses (0, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20 mL/L) from 8to 42 D or the inclusion of different components. The he-matological and PA assays were conducted only at the28th D of age to detect the effect of EOs on the immuneresponse to vaccines (regardless of ND challenge). So, the groups were representing by NC, negative control; VC, vaccinated and nontreated with EOs; and VTC,vaccinated and treated with EOs. One of the rst lines of defence in the body is leucocytes, which signi cantly increase in its number when the infection occursTable 4.

In addition to the lower H:L ratio in VTC (vaccinated and EOs treated), which may be due to the positive in fluence of this mixture on reducing stress in broilers. It is known that the H:L ratiois considered as an indicator of stress in poultry(Bedanova et al., 2007 ). Similar results were reported byHashemipour et al. (2013) . In addition, essential oils were able to increase the PA and index in VTCcompared to VC. On the other hand, eucalyptus oil stim- ulates the immune response by enhancing PA of El-Ghousein and Al-Beitawi, 2009 that the polyphenol thymol have astimulating effect on mononuclear phagocyte systemand cellular immunity. As reported in Table 4 , lymphoid organ and liver in- dex, red blood cell counts, hemoglobin percentage, and hematocrit value were not affected by EOs supplementa- tion. Similar ndings were reported by Hashemipour et al. (2013) . However, Al-Kassie (2009) showed that the supplementation of the oil extract of thyme and cin-namon resulted in increasing red blood cell count, he-matocrit, and hemoglobin values compared to those ofthe control birds. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, the EOs mixture used in the present study has a positive preventive effect and some thera-peutic effect on ND virus infection in chickens (in vivo)through the decreased viral shedding titre, increasedclinical protection, and decreased pathological picture.EOs did not promote the bird 's performance or the im- mune responses to the AI and IB vaccines; nevertheless,it has an immune-stimulating effect for the IBD virus. Further studies are required for determining their anti- viral mode of action to help control different eld out- breaks and to decrease viral shedding in addition tovaccination programs.
