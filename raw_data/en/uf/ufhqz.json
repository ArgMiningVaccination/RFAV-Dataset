The research could open the door for vaccines that can be more easily produced and distributed to communities around the world. The study is [published in the Journal of Controlled Release](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168365920307537), a biweekly peer-reviewed medical journal. The membrane under the tongue\u2014called the sublingual site\u2014has proven to be very effective at absorbing drugs. Several drugs are delivered this way, such as nitroglycerin tablets to treat chest pain that precedes heart attacks. But large molecules, such as the proteins and nucleic acids that make up many vaccines, have historically been too big to enter the body sublingually and have to be injected with needles. These large molecules are also very fragile and must be preserved, which can be a roadblock for vaccine distribution\u2014for example, Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine, which is made up of nucleic acids and requires ultra-cold storage. With the polymer wafers, the researchers have found a solution to both of those problems\u2014and proven that their technology works with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) proteins. While there is not a working vaccine for HIV yet, the researchers have demonstrated a delivery method that could work once one is developed. \"People have been struggling with creating an HIV vaccine for many years, and one of the problems is how to deliver it,\" said Chun Wang, corresponding author of the study and a biomedical engineering associate professor in the University of Minnesota's College of Science and Engineering. \"So the challenge becomes, can we take a large molecule like a protein, store it at room temperature, give it through the sublingual site, avoid the pain and hassle with needles, have it be absorbed, and actually generate an immune response? And it turns out that we have demonstrated it actually can work with a rather simple but elegant material platform.\" The wafer is mainly made up of two ingredients: alginate and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). The alginate preserves the proteins while the CMC helps the wafer stick to the sublingual membrane long enough to deliver a high concentration of the proteins. The key to making the wafer work, Wang said, was finding the right balance of the two polymers. With further testing, the polymer wafers could also provide avenues for other vaccines\u2014perhaps one day, for COVID-19. \"This is just a small step in this long journey,\" Wang said. \"If we continue this line of work, it can bring us to a point where we will have vaccines\u2014they could be based on DNA, RNA, proteins\u2014that can be stored without refrigeration and easily delivered under the tongue at the sublingual site. They will be quickly disseminated throughout the world because they don't rely on certain equipment and preservation and all of that stuff. This will be particularly good for low-resource regions of the world, even in America\u2014rural areas that are lacking certain essential facilities and infrastructure.\" In addition to Wang, the research team included University of Minnesota College of Science and Engineering alumni Sam Hanson and Anthony Tabet; Michael Barry, a professor at the Mayo Clinic; Jagannadha Sastry, a professor at the University of Texas' MD Anderson Cancer Center; and Shailbala Singh, a researcher at the MD Anderson Cancer Center.
