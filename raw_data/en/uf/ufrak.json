Axis is administering is Moderna, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson. The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are mRNA-based and was approved for use on 12/18/20. The technology for mRNA vaccine (messenger RNA) has existed for many years and been used in different medical treatments. Johnson & Johnson was approved for use on 2/17/21. The vaccine uses an inactivated cold virus to deliver instructions to cells on how to fight the spike protein on the COVID-19 virus. Does the vaccine work? Yes, they work. They are more than twice as effective as seasonal flu shots (~40% effective). The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are over 90% effective at preventing COVID disease. The J&J vaccine is 77% effective at preventing severe COVID disease. Are the vaccines safe? Side effects are similar to what you'd expect for a flu shot: aching in the shoulder, fatigue, and rarely, whole body aches and low grade fever. There are no significant safety concerns with the available vaccines. Some side effects are more common after the second dose and include pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. Cases of an anaphylaxis response are rare, and all patients are monitored for at least 15 minutes following the injection for any side effects. How is the vaccine given? The vaccine is given like a flu shot, primarily in the shoulder (deltoid) or any large muscle group. The Moderna vaccine is given in two doses, 28 days (one month) apart. The Pfizer vaccine is given in two doses, 21 days (three weeks) apart. The J&J vaccine is given in one dose. With all 3 COVID vaccines people are considered \"fully vaccinated\" two weeks after completing 2 doses of the mRNA vaccine or a single dose of Johnson & Johnson. If someone has had COVID-19, should they receive a vaccine? Based on available guidance from the CDC people with prior infection should not be excluded from getting a vaccine. Testing for past infection by detecting antibodies before getting vaccinated is not recommended. If someone gets vaccinated, will they test positive on any of the tests? The diagnostic tests (i.e., nucleic-acid based tests such as PCR and antigen-based tests) detect different parts of the virus than what is in the vaccine. It is very unlikely the vaccine will cause a false positive on a COVID nasal swab tests. Do the vaccines prevent the spread of infection? It's not clear. The first vaccine studies were not designed to look at their prevention efficacy but rather how well they prevent an individual from becoming infected and getting sick. The trial data show a reduction in getting the virus among recipients, but it's not 100%. There are recipients who became infected and had less severe symptoms, but the fact they became infected means they can transmit to others. A national trial is currently underway to study whether the Moderna vaccine can prevent transmission of COVID-19 from vaccinated people. Where can I get more information about the vaccines? Here is a link to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) website about the vaccines [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines.html) Source: Alameda County Health Consortium/Community Health Center Network You can also learn more about Covid-19 Myths vs. Facts [HERE](https://axishealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/COVID-VACCINE-MYTH-VS-FACTS.pdf). If you or a family member has traveled recently to an area of risk for the virus ( [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html)) or if you think you may have been exposed to the virus and have symptoms of respiratory illness, you should call the Axis call center at 925-462-1755. It's important to call us ahead of time rather than coming directly into one of our facilities. Calling ahead helps us direct you to the most appropriate care, and take precautions to protect other patients and staff. Some people are at higher risk of experiencing severe illness from COVID-19. This includes people who are: People at higher risk should stay away from large groups of people as much as possible, including public places with lots of people and large gatherings where there will be close contact with others. This includes concerts, sporting events, large meetings, and crowded social gatherings. There is no evidence that children are more susceptible to COVID-19. In fact, most confirmed cases have occurred in adults. Caregivers of children with underlying health conditions should consult their doctors about whether their children should stay home. Anyone who has questions about whether their condition puts them at risk for COVID-19 should call the Axis call center at 925-462-1755. Please remember to continue refilling any prescriptions you have. Refills can be requested by calling us at 925-462-1755 or through the MyChart Patient Portal. Axis is committed to the health and safety of our patients and employees. We are trained in CDC protocols for COVID-19 and are prepared to safely treat patients. Please know your care and safety are our top priorities. *updates are being made to this section The novel coronavirus causes a disease known as COVID-19, which has widespread community transmission in many parts of the United States. The most up-to-date information can be found at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ( [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)). Patients with COVID-19 have mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms that can include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. There is no specific treatment for COVID-19. Most infected people will recover on their own. These symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus: If you or someone you care for has severe shortness of breath or trouble breathing, call 911.
