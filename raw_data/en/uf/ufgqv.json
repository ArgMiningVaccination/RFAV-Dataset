Have you been feeling some discomfort in your joints lately? Joint pain is a common complaint and has many possible causes. One of its most common causes, though, is arthritis. But what is arthritis, anyway? What is arthritis? Arthritis is an inflammation of the joints. It can either affect just one joint or multiple joints. There are almost 200 types of arthritis out there, but the two most common ones are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis, also known as degenerative joint disease or \"wear and tear\" arthritis, mainly comes about when the wear and tear of cartilage causes bones to rub together, leading to friction, damage, and inflammation. This develops slowly, but gets much worse over time. It occurs most frequently in the hands, hips, and knees. Signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis: - Pain - Stiffness - Decreased range of motion or flexibility - Swelling Rheumatoid arthritis, on the other hand, is an autoimmune and inflammatory disease that attacks healthy cells in the body by mistake, causing inflammation in the affected parts of the body. This commonly affects joints in the hands, wrists, and knees. In rheumatoid arthritis, the lining of the joint becomes inflamed, causing tissue damage, chronic pain, a lack of balance, and deformity. While the specific causes of RA are unknown, there are some factors that may increase the risk of developing the disease. Signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis: - Pain in more than one joint - Stiffness in more than one joint - Tenderness and swelling in more than one joint - The same symptoms on both sides of the body (such as in both hands or both knees) - Weight loss - Fever - Fatigue - Weakness Joint pain and stiffness from arthritis can definitely be an everyday challenge. While conventional treatments work to control inflammation and slow down the progression of the disease, these 9 natural methods can ease your pain without having to leave your home. A Healthy Diet Boost your immune system with fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole foods. Studies show that dietary choices can affect people with arthritis. By following a plant-based diet, you can benefit from antioxidants that can help reduce inflammation by eliminating free radicals in the body. Pair your diet meals with [Diet Hack 356](https://t.newsweek.com/a540da8d-a1d6-46a6-a222-92843e396cff?article_title=amplify/arthritis-pain-relief-8-natural-methods-you-should-try&writer_id=ES038), the perfect drink for anyone doing intermittent fasting and who wants to lose weight. Its combination of ingredients combats insulin resistance, battles water retention, and helps with muscle pain to promote a fat-burning environment. Plus, it has zero calories! Acupuncture Acupuncture is one of the oldest natural pain remedies around. This traditional form of Chinese medicine uses super-fine needles to stimulate energy along pathways in your body. It aims to correct any energy imbalances in your body, also known as qi. Studies show that acupuncture can lower the levels of chemicals in the body that are linked to inflammation. It can also help ease chronic pain, especially back pain, and work as a remedy for osteoarthritis. Massage Therapy This method is a safe and relaxing therapeutic approach to arthritis pain management. During a massage, your body releases feel-good hormones to boost your mood and decrease anxiety. It also boosts the circulation through your tissues, muscles, and joints. With increased blood flow, your joints will be able to receive some much-needed nutrients and oxygen to reduce inflammation and help you achieve deep relaxation at home. Hot and Cold Therapy One of the most common self-management tools for arthritis pain is recommended by massage and physical therapists, as well as chiropractors. Hot and cold therapy is a simple, effective, and affordable way to address arthritis pain and inflammation as it arises and to keep symptoms at bay. Hot therapy basically uses warmth to soothe sore muscles and joints. Applying a hot water bottle or a heating pad onto the affected areas, for example, can warm up and loosen stiff joints. On the other hand, cold therapy addresses swelling and inflammation. Apply a gel ice pack to inflamed joints (but not directly on bare skin) to numb the area and reduce the sensation of pain. Try both hot and cold therapies to find which one works best for you. Exercise Physical activity is a highly recommended method for arthritis pain management since being overweight can strain the joints. By exercising, your body's natural supply of anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving substances will increase and in turn reduce your chances of developing other health complications that people with arthritis tend to be at risk of, like heart disease and diabetes. You can start by building muscle strength around your joints to protect them from further damage. Start with low-impact activities like swimming, yoga, and walking, and avoid high-impact activities like running and tennis, which can hurt the joints. Take your workouts to the next level by using a [HigherDOSE Infrared Sauna Blanket](https://t.newsweek.com/7748d6f9-e332-4318-8eb4-8d12652e2566?article_title=amplify/arthritis-pain-relief-8-natural-methods-you-should-try&writer_id=ES038). This blanket increases the body's thermal energy and promotes a temporary increase in blood flow so you can sweat like you're working out without actually working out. Relax at your own convenience and enjoy the soothing yet stimulating heat and infrared that provides an uplifting sensation. Turmeric Several studies show that turmeric specifically reduces pain and swelling in arthritis patients. For centuries, this yellow spice from India and Indonesia has been a staple in traditional medicine. Containing a powerful compound called curcumin, turmeric inhibits enzymes and proteins that bring about inflammation. Vitamin C Vitamin C can help free your body from destructive free radicals, which are harmful to joints. Studies show that affected people whose diets include high amounts of vitamin C have significantly less risk of their arthritis progressing. Try adding more citrus drinks to your diet or eat C-rich fruits and vegetables such as strawberries or melon, broccoli, or sweet peppers. We recommend [Micelle Liposomal Vitamin C](https://t.newsweek.com/3cb23814-f78b-46bf-a13f-017163e1f6cb?article_title=amplify/arthritis-pain-relief-8-natural-methods-you-should-try&writer_id=ES038) derived from fermented vitamin C with bamboo silica. It provides the essentials for growth, development, and body tissue repair in both children and adults. Ginger Poultice You can relieve arthritis pain by applying crushed ginger to a painful joint. Doing this will deplete substance P from your body, a brain chemical that carries pain messages to your central nervous system. Results show that ginger effectively eases symptoms in 55 percent of people with osteoarthritis and 74 percent of those with rheumatoid arthritis. To make it, peel a 3-inch piece of fresh ginger and mince it finely. Then, mix it with just enough olive oil to form a paste before applying it to any painful joints. Depending on where the pain is, you may need to wrap the ginger in place with a gauze or ace bandage. Leave it in place for 10-15 minutes.
