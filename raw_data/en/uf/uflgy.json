To develop novel 99m Tc-labelled hypoxia imaging radiotracers, in this study, were suggested the of these 99m Tc-complexes would be a monovalent cation with a technetium (I) core surrounded by six ligands. [99m Tc]Tc-L1 are close. In vitro cell experiments showed that all five novel 99m Tc-complexes had higher uptake in hypoxic cells compared with aerobic cells, which indicates the complexes have good hypoxia selectivity. The biodistribution of the five 99m Tc-complexes in S180 tumour-bearing mice showed that they all had certain uptake in the tumours. Among them, [99m Tc]Tc-L1 of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains effectively reduced the lipophilicity and decreased uptake by the liver, intestine and blood but also increased clearance from the tumours. In vivo metabolic studies showed [99m Tc]Tc-L1 kept intact and remained stable in tumour, blood and urine at 2 h post-injection. The results of SPECT imaging showed that [99m Tc]Tc-L1 had significant tumour uptake at 2 h post-injection, but there was still high uptake in abdominal organs such as the liver and kidney, suggesting that this complex needs to be further optimised before being used "}
