Derived from Qi Gong, yoga and Vipassana based techniques, the bi-monthly group sessions are led by Director of Spa and Wellness Faraaz Tanveer. \"Life in a modern city like Tokyo is exhilarating, but it can also chip away at your focus and energy,\" he explains. \"It's important to take the time to slow down, relax deeply and rejuvenate through stillness.\" Faraaz guides guests through a sequence of soft, flowing movements to calm the mind, followed by seated stillness to re-ground the energies. With each session, cultivate mindfulness skills to help restore balance and develop techniques for self-practice. With a long-standing interest in how we can become our best selves, Faraaz has studied yogic disciplines in Rishikesh, the birthplace of yoga, along with training in alternative knowledge systems such as Qi Gong, Reiki and Vipassana. For several years now, he has facilitated workshops around yogic healing, meditation and breathwork across diverse destinations including Bali, Dubai and Rajasthan. Moving Into Stillness workshops are available for in-house guests, members of the Hotel's [Spa & Fitness Program](https://www.fourseasons.com/otemachi/services-and-amenities/spa-fitness-membership/), and other wellbeing seekers. With a maximum of 15 participants, sessions are held on the 2nd and 4th Thursday of each month, from 7:00 to 8:00 pm, at JPY 8,250 per person. Guests who wish to deepen their practice can also reserve private meditation sessions with Faraaz, available upon request. Inquire at THE SPA for more details. Summer Revitalization at THE SPA For an evening dedicated entirely to self-renewal, pair the wellness workshop with a signature treatment at [THE SPA](https://www.fourseasons.com/otemachi/spa/).
