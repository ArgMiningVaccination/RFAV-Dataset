The College fosters the growth of the osteopathic profession by training physicians through programs of study guided by osteopathic medical tradition, concept and practice. PCOM is committed to the advancement of knowledge and intellectual growth through teaching and research, and to the well-being of the community through leadership and service. EDUCATIONAL GOALS The College's educational goals focus on presenting high-quality, comprehensive programs of study that embrace the following expectations of student learning: - Students will demonstrate a central core of biomedical or behavioral science knowledge in their field of study, including theory, foundations, clinical skills and applied clinical/practical application as appropriate to the specific academic program. - Students will demonstrate communication skills through clinical assessments, group discussion and/or written or oral presentation in their respective fields. - Students will demonstrate an understanding of scientific inquiry by designing, conducting, presenting or interpreting research in their field of study and appropriate to their academic program. - Students will identify, retrieve, understand, analyze, synthesize and apply information collected from various sources and in varied formats, including those sources requiring skills in the use of information technology. - Students will develop recognition of their legal and ethical obligations as professionals and will be able to apply an understanding of public policy and the social, cultural and economic factors that impact their field of study. GEORGIA BRANCH CAMPUS FOCUS The primary focus of Georgia Campus - PCOM is to recruit and educate students from Georgia and the surrounding states. The Georgia Campus seeks to retain graduate osteopathic physicians, pharmacists, biomedical scientists and other health care professionals in the southeast, to serve the health needs of the region and advance the professions of osteopathic medicine and pharmacy. INSTITUTIONAL DIVERSITY STATEMENT As active citizens in a multicultural world, the PCOM community cultivates an environment of inquiry, inquisitiveness and respect, promotes discovery and celebration of our differences and fosters appreciation of the rich social fabric that binds us together. THE COLLEGE When osteopathic schools were forming throughout the country in the 1890s, two students at the Northern Institute of Osteopathy in Minneapolis, Mason W. Pressly and Oscar John Snyder, targeted Philadelphia as a future home for an osteopathic medical college. Although the City of Brotherly Love had a rich history of medicine, it had but one \"osteopathist\" by the time Pressly and Snyder graduated in 1898 and 1899, respectively. PCOM's founders were outspoken, pioneering physicians who explored and taught the use of manipulative therapy in the prevention of disease long before the use 4 of penicillin and modern drugs. The two young osteopathic physicians followed through with their vision, incorporating the Philadelphia College and Infirmary of Osteopathy on January 24, 1899. The first PCIO degree was awarded to a transfer student; the first PCIO class, composed of two students, graduated in February 1900 from the fledgling College then located at 21 South 12th Street. The College prospered and moved through a number of sites in its first century, including 1715 North Broad Street, 832 Pine Street, 19th and Spring Garden, 48th and Spruce, and finally, City Avenue. During this growth period, the medical curriculum intensified, osteopathic research was initiated, and clinic and hospital services grew rapidly as the medical school's student body and faculty expanded dramatically. After nearly a century of training physicians, PCOM opened its first graduate degree program, the Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences, in 1993. The first five graduates in June 1995 marked the beginning of yet another period of growth for the College - the development of a graduate school. Today, more than 800 graduate students are enrolled in PCOM's masters and doctoral degree programs. PCOM's graduate students pursue studies at the master's level in biomedical sciences, mental health counseling, school psychology, organizational development, forensic medicine and physician assistant studies. Doctoral-level study is offered in clinical psychology and school psychology with certificate programs for professionals seeking respecialization in clinical psychology or certification as school psychologists. In August 2005, the first entering osteopathic medical class began its studies at Georgia Campus - Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine (GA-PCOM), the College's branch campus located in Suwanee, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. GA-PCOM's mission is to help fill the need for more physicians and other health professionals in Georgia and the surrounding states, areas that have been affected by population increases and subsequent shortages. The Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences program was established at the Georgia Campus in the 2006-2007 academic years, the PCOM School of Pharmacy opened at the Georgia Campus in Fall 2010 and the Physician Assistant program opened at the Georgia Campus In Summer 2016. The osteopathic medical programs train students who will become skilled, caring and successful physicians guided by the strengths of osteopathic principles refined during a century of medical practice, teaching and research. More than 60,000 osteopathic physicians practicing today are an integral part of America's health care delivery system. Today, all treatment modalities are available to osteopathic physicians, who may prescribe drugs, perform surgery and specialize in any area of medicine. DOs, whose primary care training prepares them to be highly skilled diagnosticians, are represented throughout the United States and in all branches of military service. Nearly 70 percent of main campus students are Pennsylvanians, and 75 percent of Georgia Campus students are from the southeastern states. More than 200 colleges and 21 states are represented in the student body. Supported by the best modern technology, PCOM emphasizes a practitioner-scholar approach and community orientation in all of its degree programs to prepare students for the new challenges facing the behavioral and the medical sciences in the 21st century. 5 DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES AWARDED DOCTORAL DEGREES Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) - Philadelphia and Georgia Campuses Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) - Georgia Campus Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) - Georgia Campus Doctor of Psychology (PsyD) - Clinical Psychology - Philadelphia Campus Doctor of Psychology (PsyD) - School Psychology - Philadelphia Campus Master of Science and Doctor of Psychology - School Psychology (MS) (PsyD) Five Year Combined Program - Philadelphia Campus Doctor of Philosophy in Educational Psychology (PhD) - Philadelphia Campus RESPECIALIZATION Respecialization in School Psychology - Philadelphia Campus Respecialization in Clinical Psychology - Philadelphia Campus EDUCATIONAL SPECIALIST DEGREES Educational Specialist in School Psychology (EdS) - Philadelphia Campus Master of Science and Educational Specialist (MS) (EdS) Three Year Combined Program - Philadelphia Campus MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREES Master of Science in Aging and Long Term Care (MS) - Philadelphia Campus Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences (MS) - Philadelphia and Georgia Campuses Master of Science in Counseling and Clinical Health Psychology (MS) - Philadelphia Campus 6 Master of Science in Counseling and Psychology Studies (MS) - Philadelphia Campus Master of Science in Forensic Medicine (MS) - Philadelphia Campus Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies (MS) - Philadelphia Campus Master of Science in Mental Health Counseling (MS) - Philadelphia Campus Master of Science in Non Profit Leadership and Population Health Management (MS) - Philadelphia Campus Master of Science in Organizational Development and Leadership (MS) - Philadelphia Campus Master of Science in Public Health Management and Administration (MS) - Philadelphia Campus Master of Science in School Psychology (MS) - Philadelphia Campus Clinical Master of Science (MSc) - Philadelphia Campus POSTDOCTORAL CERTIFICATES Post-Doctoral Certificate in Clinical Health Psychology - Philadelphia Campus Post-Doctoral Certificate in Clinical Neuropsychology - Philadelphia Campus CERTIFICATES Certificate of Graduate Studies (CGS) and Certificate of Advanced Graduate Studies (CAGS) Aging and Long Term Care Administration - Philadelphia Campus Applied Behavior Analysis - Online Program Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - Philadelphia Campus Organizational Development and Leadership - Philadelphia and Georgia Campuses Professional Counseling - Philadelphia Campus 7 Public Health Management and Administration - Philadelphia Campus Non Profit Leadership and Population Health Management - Philadelphia Campus POSTDOCTORAL MEDICAL EDUCATION TRAINING PROGRAMS Internship Program Traditional Rotating General Surgery Internal Medicine Neurosurgery Ophthalmology Orthopedic Surgery Otolaryngology Residency and Fellowship Programs Family Medicine General Surgery Geriatrics Hospice and Palliative Medicine and Surgery Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility Surgical Critical Care Vascular Surgery Continuing Education Matriculation and Degree Conferral Matriculation and attendance at the College are privileges granted to the student in consideration of performance of specified assignments and the maintenance of established standards of personal and professional conduct.

The remaining letter can be from any other faculty member. A letter of recommendation from an osteopathic physician is strongly suggested but not required. The supplemental application and all required materials (including the application fee(s)) must be received by March 1, 2019. However, early submission is strongly recommended as interviewees are selected and decisions are rendered on a rolling basis. Interviews Each campus has a PCOM Faculty Committee on Admissions that will review all completed applications, select those applicants to be interviewed and inform them in writing, via e-mail, of the interview date, time and location. Although all applicants who are accepted must be interviewed, the granting of an interview should not be construed as evidence of final acceptance. Interviews generally begin in mid-September and continue until the end of March. A candidate can be selected for an interview at any time throughout the review process as deemed competitive by the Faculty Committee on Admissions. Interview sessions are on-campus events that include an opportunity to meet with student ambassadors and tour the campus. PCOM conducts a panel interview that generally includes the applicant and at least two members of the admissions committee, and lasts about one half hour. Admissions Decisions Interviewed candidates are usually notified within five weeks from the date of interview. Accepted applicants are asked to remit a $250 non-refundable tuition prepayment according to the following schedule as noted by the AACOM Admissions Guidelines: - Those accepted prior to November 15 will have until December 14. - Those accepted between November 15 and January 14 will have 30 days. - Those accepted between January 14 and May 14 will have 14 days. - Those accepted on or after May 15 may be asked for an immediate deposit. An additional deposit of $1,500 is required by April 15 from all confirmed students. This fee is non- refundable and, along with the initial $250 deposit, will be credited to the student's tuition account. PCOM does not have an Early Decision Program. 15 To ensure that students accepted to PCOM will be permitted to perform clerkships during their third and fourth clinical years, and thus ensure them the opportunity to successfully complete their DO degree requirements, PCOM requires all first year students to complete a criminal background check prior to matriculation. All students must have their criminal background checks processed through a PCOM vendor of choice. The Admissions Office must have this information on file prior to orientation; students will not be permitted to start classes without this information. Transfer Students and Advanced Standing PCOM does not routinely accept transfer students; however, a transfer application may be considered under extenuating circumstances and depending on seats available in the class. Consideration will be given only to a student who is in good standing at an AOA- accredited college of osteopathic medicine and has completed two years of study, or who is eligible for re-admission to the previously attended college of osteopathic medicine. COMLEX 1 must have a passing grade prior to matriculation at PCOM if the student is accepted by the Faculty Committee on Admissions. The initial request for transfer must originate from the dean of the college or university from which the student wishes to transfer and must be directed to the dean of the PCOM campus to which he or she is applying. Application materials must be submitted, and a formal interview with the Faculty Committee on Admissions will be required. If accepted, a transfer student will be given credit for courses successfully passed at the previous college that meet PCOM's curriculum requirements. A minimum of two years must be completed at PCOM for a student to be eligible to receive the DO degree.

A score is considered too old, and will not be accepted, if it is more than two years old from the start of the applicant's admissions term. Country of citizenship does not exempt applicants from this requirement. Language of instruction at the college or university level, and how recent it has been, are the determining factors in meeting this requirement. The minimum required score for the IBT (Internet Based Testing) is 79 and a minimum score of 26 is required for the speaking component. General writing assistance is available for theses and dissertations; however, as an institution offering only graduate and professional programs, PCOM does not offer remedial ESL coursework. Applicants are exempt if: English is the exclusive language of instruction at the undergraduate level The student has earned a degree from a regionally accredited U.S. college or university not more than five years prior to the anticipated semester of enrollment The student has completed at least two full-time semesters of graded coursework, exclusive of ESL courses, in a U.S. college or university, or at an institution outside the U.S. where English is the exclusive language of instruction, not more than five years prior to the anticipated semester of enrollment 38 STUDENT LIFE In addition to the dedication to their professional development, PCOM students are actively engaged members of the life of the campus. Developing leadership skills and human understanding are integral to becoming a well-rounded and compassionate professional. PCOM has a very active student government program, which includes more than 50 professional student organizations. Students gain leadership experience within their class as well as by participating in community outreach programs, athletics and the arts. Student Government Association The Student Government Association (SGA) is composed of Program Council officers, who are elected representatives from each class and graduate/professional degree program and the SGA Senate. The Philadelphia Campus Senate and the Georgia Campus Senate collaborate on issues of importance to the entire PCOM student body. In addition to the SGA, students are involved in College governance, serving on every major College committee and working with faculty to evaluate courses. Students also participate in accreditation evaluations conducted by national and professional accreditation agencies. Professional and Social Societies Professional interests at PCOM are expressed through a variety of clubs and organizations, including the Student Osteopathic Medical Association and the Science in Medicine Club, as well as chapters of the American Academy of Osteopathy, the American College of Family Practitioners, the American Osteopathic Academy of Sports Medicine and the Sigma Xi National Research Society. Physician Assistant, Biomedical Sciences and Psychology students also have sponsored groups within their areas of professional interest and publish their own newsletters. Multicultural Affairs PCOM is committed to maintaining an environment that promotes the well- being of all students, and to providing opportunities to celebrate the commonalities and differences among cultures. Full-time PCOM student affairs staff members serve as advisors to the various organizations and clubs on multicultural issues. There are a variety of student organizations on both campuses with culture-focused missions. These include the Student National Medical Association (SNMA), CAPS (Culturally Aware Psychology Students), the Asian-Pacific-American Medical Student Association and the Student Initiative for Cultural Competency. PCOM's commitment to multicultural sensitivity goes beyond the classroom and the campus. The many initiatives undertaken annually include conferences for minority undergraduate students, hosting of regional meetings of professional societies, and an awards banquet honoring the contributions of minority physicians, hosted by the SNMA. Career Services The Office of Student Affairs coordinates career planning support for all PCOM students. This includes career planning seminars, assistance with cv/resume resources and interview preparation strategies. Guidance specific to the residency application and match processes are provided to DO students. Information about career planning resources and support is posted on mypcom.edu, PCOM's intranet site for students. Athletic Programs PCOM provides facilities for students to maintain their physical fitness, as well as their involvement in social and competitive athletics. The activity centers on both campuses feature well-equipped fitness centers, weight training rooms, stationary bikes, aerobics studios and game rooms. 39 Health Insurance All PCOM students are required to have health insurance coverage. The PCOM Student Wellness Center maintains student health records, including the forms for the mandatory physical. Students are advised that routine and preventive health care would be best addressed by having a local personal primary care physician. If a student elects to utilize a PCOM medical practice, fees for consultations, lab work or diagnostic testing are submitted to the student's health insurance for consideration for payment. Charges that exceed the payment made by the insurance, or denied payment, are left to the discretion of the individual provider for collection. Student Housing The College does not provide student housing on or off campus at either of its campuses. However, the Office of Student Affairs serves as an informal resource by providing a channel on the student Website (Nucleus) that enables students to post for roommates and available housing. Links to popular housing Websites and area newspapers are also posted on the Nucleus housing channel. Apartment complexes in the Philadelphia and Atlanta areas update their rental fees each spring, and lists are mailed to accepted students. Apartment complexes are also listed on the PCOM Website (under \"Student Affairs,\" then \"Housing\"). The College does not involve itself in student lease arrangements or student-landlord disputes and does not screen housing listings for accuracy. It is specified in listings that landlords are expected to comply with the Federal Fair Housing Act.

Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) places certain limitations on the disclosure of personally identifiable student information maintained by PCOM with respect to students; limits access to academic records; and gives students certain rights with respect to educational records, including the right to access, the right to obtain copies, the right to seek correction of such records through informal and formal internal procedures, and the right to place a statement in such educational records explaining any information that they believe to be inaccurate or misleading. Directory Information PCOM considers certain information to be \"directory information\" under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and, therefore, subject to disclosure without prior consent of the student. Unless written objection is received by the Registrar, the College will treat the following as directory information to be released at the discretion of the Registrar's Office: student name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, date and place of birth, dates of attendance, major field of study, Dean's list, degrees and awards received and names of undergraduate and/or graduate schools attended, internships and residencies. Right to Withhold Disclosure Under the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, currently enrolled students may withhold disclosure of directory information. The Registrar's Office must receive written notification from a student indicating the information to be withheld. Should a student decide to inform the institution not to release certain information, any future requests for such information from non-institutional persons or organizations will be refused. Decisions about withholding any information should be made very carefully. PCOM will honor each request to withhold any of the categories of information indicated by a student. However, the College cannot assume responsibility to contact a student for subsequent permission to release them should requests be received. PCOM assumes that failure to request the withholding of directory information indicates approval for disclosure. Right to Consent to the Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information All personally identifiable information related to a particular student other than directory information is considered confidential information and may not be released without the written consent of the student. However, FE RPA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions: 41 Other schools to which a student is transferring Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school Accrediting organizations To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena, PCOM's Registrar will make reasonable attempt to notify the student Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specific state law.

The College disciplinary policy provides actions including permanent dismissal of students who engage in alcohol abuse, and the use, sale or distribution of illegal substances. The provost requires psychological assessment or toxicological (urine) testing of any student suspected of substance abuse. Details of the legal sanctions under applicable federal, state and local alcohol and drug laws, and the Pennsylvania and Georgia vehicle codes and Pharmacy Acts are provided in the PCOM General Student Handbook. Professional Codes of Ethics The codes of ethics of various professional associations have been adopted, as appropriate, as guidelines for PCOM professional degree and graduate students. The American Osteopathic Association, the American Academy of Physician Assistants, the American Psychological Association, the National Association of School Psychologists, the American Pharmaceutical Association, and the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy have formulated their codes of ethics to guide 43 members in their professional lives, and the standards are designed to address the health professional's ethical and professional responsibilities to patients, society, others involved in health care and self. In addition, some academic programs have developed their own codes of ethics and student conduct. The codes of ethics are reproduced in the student handbooks and/or orientation materials of the respective academic programs at both Philadelphia and Georgia campuses. 44 ACADEMIC INFORMATION AND POLICIES PCOM has three academic terms that consist of 13 weeks in each term, followed by a summer session. All courses are defined on the basis of credit hours for which one credit hour is equal to 14 hours of classroom or classroom equivalent instruction, exclusive of final examinations. Grading Policy Course coordinators determine the means by which the final grade will be computed which may include exam scores, written assignments, laboratory exercises, practical examinations, class participation and other means of evaluation. Courses are graded in accordance with the following system: Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine program grading structure was on a numeric scale from 100 for the first two years with 70 being a passing grade. There are a few courses in the first and second year that are Pass/Fail courses. In the clinical years the grading structure is Honors Pass, High Pass and Pass. In Fall of 2018 the grading scale will change for the Class of 2022 for the first two years to the following scale: Grade Quality Points Percentage A 4.0 90 - 100 B 3.0 80 - less than 90 C 2.0 70 - less than 80 F 0.0 less than 70 P Pass (does not affect the GPA) NP 0.00 No Pass (does not affect the GPA) The Pass-No Pass grading policy is only applicable to those courses that are graded on the pass or fail basis. It does not apply to those courses that are graded on the letter grading scale. Cumulative GPA will be based upon the grades earned during the first, and second professional years only. Doctor of Pharmacy Program Doctor of Pharmacy program grade point average is based on a 4.0 scale. Doctor of Pharmacy grading structure is as follows: Grade Quality Points Percentage A 4.0 90 - 100 B 3.0 80 - less than 90 C 2.0 70 - less than 80 D 1.0 65 - less than 70 F 0.0 less than 65 P Pass (does not affect the GPA) The Pass-Fail grading policy is only applicable to those courses that are graded on the pass or fail basis. It does not apply to those courses that are graded on the letter grading scale. For letter grade determination, the final percentage earned in the class will be rounded to the nearest whole number. Graduate, PsyD and Doctor of Physical Therapy Programs Graduate and PsyD programs grade point average is based on a 4.0 scale. Graduate and doctoral programs grading structure is as follows: 45 Grade Quality Points Percentage A 4.00 95 - 100 Superior level of competency A- 3.67 90 - 94 B+ 3.33 85 - 89 B 3.00 80 - 84 Satisfactory level of competency B- 2.67 77 - 79 C+ 2.33 74 - 76 Marginal level of competency C 2.00 70 - 73 Marginal level of competency F 0.00 0 - 69 Failure to demonstrate a marginal level of competency F does not count towards the total number of credits required for the program. IP Incomplete pending is a grade granted only in Psychology Research courses when the instructor and program director deem additional time needed to complete the course. IP must be completed within the next term in the time period designated by the instructor and program director. HP Superior level of competency in practicum seminar P Satisfactory or marginal level of competency in practicum seminar S Satisfactory level of progress in dissertation seminar or biomedical research U Unsatisfactory level of progress in dissertation seminar or biomedical research Grades Common to All Programs I Incomplete: An incomplete grade must be requested by the student in writing, in advance of the end of the course. If the instructor approves the request, a written agreement is made regarding the work required and the due date. The new grade must be sent to the Registrar within six weeks of the last class. Failure to complete the assignment within six weeks will result in the Incomplete being changed to a grade of F The only exception is in Psychology where it is required that Independent Study courses and Assessment I or II must be completed by the end of late registration in order to be eligible for enrollment in the next term's course sequence. W Withdrawal before midpoint of the term of a course; once the midpoint of a term has been reached, a student is not eligible to withdraw unless there are extenuating circumstances and the student is granted permission WP Withdrawal after the midpoint of a course while passing WF Withdrawal after the midpoint of a course while failing or unauthorized withdrawal (This grade does not apply to DO, Doctor of Pharmacy programs) AU Audited (no course credit) 46 Grade Point Average The grade point average is calculated by dividing the total credits attempted (excluding grades of HP, S, P, WP, WF, I, AU, W) into the sum of the products of points and credits for all courses taken. Only courses taken at PCOM are included in this calculation. Grade Reports Grades are available to all students at the end of each term via the Banner Web services in myPCOM. PCOM does not distribute paper mailers. Dropping of Courses The deadline to drop a course is the last day of the first week of the term. Students who drop a course by this deadline will receive a 100% tuition refund. Students enrolled in the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine, the Doctor of Pharmacy the Physician Assistant, and the Doctor of Physical Therapy programs are not permitted to drop one course, but are required to drop all coursework in that term. Because of the sequential nature of these programs, students requesting to be dropped from one term may be required to take a leave of absence until the following year. In these programs, consultation and approval from the program dean or program director is required. Withdrawal From Courses After Drop-Add Period Withdrawals occur after the first week of the term. While students in other graduate programs may be permitted to withdraw from a course, it should be done with the consultation of their program director or dean. Withdrawals may change the sequence of courses to be taken. Students approved to take a withdrawal from a course up to the midpoint of a course will earn a grade notation of Withdraw. After the midpoint of the course, students will not be eligible to withdraw from a course unless there are extenuating circumstances and they are given permission from their program director or dean. The latter option will be reserved for extreme circumstances only. Course withdrawals approved after the midpoint of the course will carry a grade notation of WP if withdrawing when passing, or a grade notation of WF if withdrawing when failing. Students may not be permitted to continue in the program with more than one WF grade notation. These students will be reviewed by the Student Progress Evaluation Committee and will recommend action to the Student Academic Progress Committee for academic action. Withdrawal grades or credits are not calculated in the grade point average. Auditing Courses A course audit does not provide the student with any course credit nor can it be used toward degree requirements. A course audit is noted on the transcript with a grade of AU and does not calculate into the GPA. When auditing a course the student is required to actively participate in labs, group assignments and to take examinations. For a student to audit a course, permission must be received from the dean or the program director at the beginning of the term and submitted to the Registrar's Office. Course audits must be declared by the first day of the academic term. Requests to audit courses after that time will not be permitted. 47 Audited coursework will not be eligible for federal financial aid. Veteran Information Contact with the Veterans Administration and negotiation of problems related to veterans benefits are handled by the Registrar's Office for the Philadelphia Campus and Financial Aid Office for the Georgia Campus. Application for benefits at PCOM is generally initiated by filing a \"Change of Place of Training\" form upon leaving the prior upon separation from the Armed Forces. International Students Information International students' paperwork is processed through the Registrar's Office. PCOM has been approved to process F-1 visas. Prior to the start of their first term, international students must submit tuition for the duration of the program. These funds will be placed in a PCOM escrow account. International students must be enrolled full time each term and continue to make academic progress. Transfer Credit Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine The Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine program does not routinely accept transfer students; however, transfer application may be considered under extenuating circumstances and depending on placement available in the class. Consideration will be given only to a student who is in good standing at an AOA-accredited college of osteopathic medicine. If accepted, a transfer student will be given credit for courses successfully passed at the previous college that meet PCOM's curriculum requirements. A minimum of two years must be completed at PCOM for a student to be eligible to receive the DO degree. Intra-campus transfer requests must be discussed with the Dean at the PCOM campus of enrollment For all other students entering the DO program, PCOM does not grant advanced standing or credit for prior learning or for courses completed at other institutions. Doctor of Pharmacy PCOM School of Pharmacy does not routinely accept transfer students; however, a transfer application may be considered under extenuating circumstances and depending on places available in the class. Consideration will be given only to a student who is in good standing at an ACPE-accredited college or school of pharmacy who is eligible for re-admission to the previously attended college or school. The initial request for transfer must originate from the dean of the college or school of pharmacy from which the student wishes to transfer and must be directed to the dean of the PCOM School of Pharmacy -Georgia Campus. Application materials must be submitted and a formal interview with the Admissions Committee will be required. If accepted, a transfer student will be given credit for courses successfully passed at the previous college that meet PCOM's curriculum requirements. A minimum of two years must be completed at PCOM for a student to be eligible to receive the PharmD degree. Graduate Programs Graduate programs may permit transfer credits provided the student meets PCOM's curriculum requirements and upon approval of the academic department. A graduate student will be given permission to transfer to PCOM no more than six graduate-level credits for coursework successfully completed at a previous college. 48 Doctoral Programs Doctoral-level students are not permitted to transfer any prior coursework to PCOM ATTENDANCE POLICY Students are strongly recommended to attend all classes to maximize their educational experience by participating in and following their discussions first- hand. Individual course directors may set attendance standards for their course, including the designation of mandatory lectures, and may implement in-class quizzes or record attendance. Thus, attendance may be a factor in determining the final grade in a course, at the discretion of the course director. One-hundred percent attendance is required in clinical clerkships, remedial assignments, laboratory sessions, small-group sessions, clinical correlations and standardized patient exercises, and all introductory and advanced pharmacy practical experiences. Serious excuses for missed attendance must be documented and reported to the Interim Chief Student Affairs officer in Georgia for first and second year DO students or to clinical education for third and fourth year DO students, who in turn will advise the course or clerkship director for his or her consideration. Students in other degree programs should report and document their absence to the head of their program. Final determination to accept an excuse remains with the course or clerkship director. Extended absences for illness, family emergencies, etc., must always be documented by the Interim Chief Student Affairs officer in Georgia, Clinical education, or the office of the specific academic program. Academic Progress Evaluation Student scholastic achievement is reviewed on an ongoing basis by each program's Student Progress Evaluation Committee (SPEC). The SPEC Committees make recommendations on student academic standing to the Student Academic Progress and Policy Committee (SAPPC). Categories of Academic Standing The categories of academic standing are as follows: Good Standing: Status of a student who has met course requirements in a satisfactory manner and has demonstrated professional behavior. Warning: A departmental written warning may be issued to any student who has incurred a course, clerkship or preceptorship failure(s) subject to a validation or remediation. Issuance of a letter of academic warning does not necessarily result in loss of good academic standing but is intended to alert the student that academic deficiencies have been recorded and must be remediated to meet promotion requirements. Probation: Status of a student who has demonstrated a marginal level of performance to the degree that any additional course deficiencies will make the student liable for dismissal according to College policy. Dismissal: Action, after review of the academic deficiency or deficiencies of a student by the Student Academic Progress and Policy Committee, whereby a student may be dismissed from the academic program of the College. 49 PROGRESSION POLICIES BY PROGRAM Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine In the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine program the extent of a student's academic deficiency considers the accumulation of academic standing units. Assignment of academic standing units to courses or clerkships not successfully completed is based on course credits or number of clerkship weeks using the following formula: Courses worth less than 1 credit hour to 3 credit hours = .25 Academic Units Courses worth more than 3 credit hours to 8 credit hours = .50 Academic Units Courses worth more than 8 credit hours = 1.00 Academic Units Clerkships 2 weeks in length = .50 Academic Units Clerkships 4 weeks in length = 1.00 Academic Units Students' performance is reviewed at the end of each term. Students with unsatisfactory academic achievement will be counseled regarding their performance. A student with a failure in one academic standing unit will be recommended by the Student Academic Progress and Policy Committee to the Dean for promotion from one class to the next when the student has removed the deficiency. Students who have accumulated one or more academic standing units of course failures may not be eligible for validation examination and may not be eligible for advancement to the next year of study. Students with one or more academic standing units of course failures may be dismissed from the academic program of the College or required to repeat a year of study, at the discretion of the Student Academic Progress and Policy Committee. If a student is afforded the opportunity to repeat the year of study, they do so on probation and will not be allowed to appeal should another failure occur. A review of a student's complete academic performance may be considered in determination of dismissal. Students who fail a clerkship and have had prior academic failures in their didactic years may be liable for dismissal. Students who have not had prior failures in their didactic years and receive more than one failure in a clerkship may be liable for dismissal. When considering a student for dismissal from the DO program all performances can be reviewed. Doctor of Pharmacy In the Doctor of Pharmacy program, a student must receive a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0 to graduate. The minimum grade required to pass pharmacy coursework is a D. The School of Pharmacy Academic Performance and Standards Committee reviews all student academic progression. When a student violates the progression guidelines, the Academic Performance and Standards Committee evaluates the case and submits a recommendation letter to the Student Policy and Progress Committee. This Committee reviews the case and reports its decision to the School of Pharmacy Dean, who generates the appropriate decision letter. The committee determines the extent of academic deficiency by considering specific academic guidelines. Numerous parameters exist that help to maintain proper alignment of academic expectations while describing consequences of failure to achieve these requirements. The progression guidelines also define academic probation, dismissal criteria and steps that must be undertaken to graduate from the pharmacy program. 50 A student in the Doctor of Pharmacy program who has failed (grade of \"F\" or \"NP\") a course must remediate the class during the following summer. The grade earned through remediation will be averaged with the original F for calculation of the final GPA. Only one course may be remediated. Students may not progress to the next academic year until remediated coursework is successfully completed. For purposes of this policy, an F in a pass-fail course is treated as an F with regard to overall academic progression and thus must be repeated. Dismissal The Academic Performance and Standards Committee may recommend dismissal from the PCOM School of Pharmacy following review of any student that comes before the committee and will automatically recommend student dismissal from the School of Pharmacy under any one of the following conditions: Failure to maintain a current, valid State of Georgia Pharmacy Intern License Receiving three grades less than C for all courses taken at PCOM School of Pharmacy A grade of D, F, NP or WF is considered to be a grade less than C Failure to successfully remediate a course on the first attempt Failure to attain a cumulative GPA greater than or equal to 2.0 at the end of a repeated professional year. A student dismissed from the PCOM School of Pharmacy may appeal this decision according to the policies set forth in the PCOM General Student Handbook under the section Appealing an Academic Dismissal Decision. Academic Probation Probation is an action taken in the interest of the student. A student who is placed on probation should carefully evaluate his/her chance of success in earning a degree in Pharmacy from PCOM School of Pharmacy if his/her current strategy continues. At a minimum, a student should arrange to substantially increase the amount of time and effort devoted to academic preparedness. Students are immediately placed on academic probation under any one of the following conditions: Term or cumulative GPA less than 2.0 at the end of any term Receive a course grade of F, NP or WF Upon recommendation by the Academic Progression and Standards Committee The probationary period is the academic term immediately following, unless the Academic Performance and Standards Committee specifies a longer probationary period. Removal from probation only occurs if the student has, at the end of the probationary period, attained a term and cumulative GPA greater than 2.0, received a grade of P in all P/NP courses during the probation period, and successfully remediated all courses with a grade of F or NP and met any other conditions imposed by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee. All students on probation are required to make an appointment with the Associate Dean for Academics during the first week of each probationary term to develop a plan to help Failure to maintain a current, valid State of Georgia Pharmacy Intern License Placed on academic probation Remain on academic probation for two or more consecutive terms Receive a course grade of D while on probation Receive a course grade of F, NP or WF Receive two course grades of D Cumulative GPA less than 2.0 at the end of the third professional year 51 The Academic Performance and Standards Committee will afford the student an opportunity to speak to the committee during its deliberations. The committee forwards its recommendation, along with a rationale for its decision, to the PCOM Academic Policy and Promotion Committee for review. The PCOM Academic Policy and Promotion Committee then forwards the recommendation to the Dean of the PCOM School of Pharmacy, who may impose sanctions including academic probation, repeat of a single course, courses or an entire professional year or dismissal from the PCOM School of Pharmacy. Graduate Programs (Master of Science) In the graduate programs, a grade of F (failure), U (unsatisfactory) or WF (withdrawal while failing) in any graduate course will make the student liable for dismissal from the program. A minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0 is required for continuation to unconditional degree candidacy status, and conferral of the master of science degree. Doctor of Psychology In the doctoral programs, a grade of F (failure) or WF (withdrawal while failing), or 3 grades of C or U (unsatisfactory) will make the student liable for dismissal from the program. Doctoral students must achieve a B average (3.0) or higher to take comprehensive exams and to graduate from the program. PsyD students may earn no more than two grades below a B- or more than one F in any course, required or elective. In addition, students must record a B- or better in all required courses. There are several courses that require the student to achieve a grade of B. The student may be required to retake the course. This information regarding which course(s) require(s) a grade of B is annotated under the course description in the Program and Course Description section of the catalog. Each degree program also has specific requirements regarding comprehensive examinations, licensure exam passage, practicum, internship and thesis and dissertation completion. These policies are explained in detail in the student handbook for the respective program. ACADEMIC APPEAL A student who is dismissed for academic deficiency may appeal the decision. Such a request or appeal must be made to the Office of Student Affairs within fifteen business days after the student has been notified of the decision to dismiss. Students may not bring before the Academic Appeal Committee requests other than an appeal of a permanent dismissal action. Any student appealing a dismissal will be entitled to a hearing before the Academic Appeal Committee. The scope of the review shall not include a review of the components of a specific grade or grades. A student will be permitted only one appeal. CONTINUED CONDITIONAL ENROLLMENT IN LIEU OF DISMISSAL Students who are liable for academic dismissal may be offered the privilege of continued enrollment at the discretion of their program's SPEC and the SAPPC, subject to conditions such as restart of the academic year, repeat of courses, return following leave of absence, or other provisions. Students who accept an offer of continued conditional enrollment in lieu of dismissal continue or resume their enrollment under a status of probation. Students who fail to satisfy the conditions of the probation will be subject to dismissal. Such cases will be reviewed by the respective Dean of the student's school to determine if an appal of dismissal be considered. THE APPEALS HEARING Any student appealing a dismissal will be entitled to a hearing before the Faculty Committee on 52 Academic Appeals. The scope of the review shall not include a review of the components of a specific grade or grades. 1. Students may not bring before the Faculty Committee on Academic Appeals any requests other than an appeal of a permanent dismissal action. 2. Students appealing a dismissal must notify the Office of Student Affairs of any individuals who will attend the appeals hearing in support of the student's appeal at least 10 days prior to the hearing CHANGE OF ENROLLMENT STATUS LEAVE OF ABSENCE A leave of absence is defined as a pre-approved leave from the institution that suspends a student's course of academic and/or clinical study or off-site training for a definite period of time, not to exceed 12 months. When considering a leave of absence a student should consult with the Chief Student Affairs Officer at the Philadelphia Campus or the Director of the Center for Student Affairs at the Georgia Campus, and where applicable the student's Program Director to consider how a leave would affect his or her overall progress in the academic program of the College. Additional consultation with the Financial Aid Office is suggested for those students with financial aid to determine any financial ramifications. A leave of absence may be granted for one of the following reasons: (1) a medical or family emergency; (2) a financial emergency; (3) pursuit of an academic endeavor other than the regular classroom work or training assignment, either on campus or at another recognized teaching facility; (4) active military service. To receive consideration for a leave of absence, a student must submit to the appropriate Dean of their school a written request explaining the time requested and the basis for the leave of absence. Upon final consultation with the appropriate Dean regarding the circumstances, a decision will be rendered. All applications for leave of absence are considered on their individual merits and approved only for extraordinary reasons. Final approval of leaves of absences is given by the Dean of their school. When an approved leave or formal withdrawal is granted before the midpoint of a course, the course(s) in progress at that time will be recorded on the transcript with the grade W; if an approved leave is granted after the midpoint of a course, the grade recorded on the transcript will reflect the grade status at that part of the term (WP if passing; WF if failing). Students who permanently withdraw from the academic program of the College without following the withdrawal procedure will receive the grade F for courses in progress. In the case of courses repeated in their entirety, the new grade earned will be recorded in the term the repeated course is completed. This new grade will be calculated in the grade point average replacing the failure; however, this will not remove the previous W, WP or F for that course from the transcript. There are circumstances wherein the leave of absence is initiated by PCOM. These are financial leave of absence and academic leave of absence. A financial leave of absence is initiated by the Bursar's Office when a student does not meet his/her financial obligations to PCOM in a term. The Bursar's Office will advise the Registrar's Office to remove the student from subsequent term enrollments. The student is notified by the Registrar's Office when this action has occurred. The student will not be permitted to return until his/her 53 financial obligations are met. If a financial leave is implemented, the student still must adhere to completion of his/her program in the timeframe designated. An academic leave of absence is initiated by the Registrar's Office in one of two ways: Student has been advised of dismissal and is granted the privilege of returning the following year. In certain graduate programs there may be situations wherein a student is unable to register due to the fact that there are no courses offered in that term for which to register, but the student is still actively pursuing the degree. In this rare situation, the Registrar can approve a one term only leave. Implications of a Leave of Absence A student on leave of absence is not considered enrolled during the term of the leave and does not qualify for loan deferment, special monetary loans, grants or other special considerations that presuppose the status of a regular student. Therefore, students are advised to consult with the Financial Aid Office regarding their loan payback and other financial matters throughout their decision process. If a student purchased their health insurance through PCOM, they will continue on that coverage until expiration of that years policy. No refund of health insurance premium will be given. Return from Leave Before the conclusion of the leave of absence, the student must notify the Provost and the Registrar in writing of his or her intent to register and resume his or her degree program. If a leave of absence is due to personal illness, the student's attending physician or other health care provider as specified by the Provost must supply a letter attesting to the student's ability to continue in the academic or clinical program, or other training activity. The student's course of study will then be resumed at the point in the curriculum deemed most appropriate by the Provost. Prior to the return, all financial obligations must be satisfied with the Bursar as stipulated in the Tuition and Fees section of this catalog before petitioning for re-admission. Notwithstanding time off for leave(s), all requirements for graduation from PCOM must be completed within seven years from the first date of matriculation in the medical and doctoral programs, or within three years for the master's programs. A student on a leave of absence who fails to return within the time period specified in the approved leave of absence will be dropped as a student from the College. Any student who is dropped must reapply for admission. Transferring from PCOM If a student in the DO program or in any other degree program desires to transfer to any other institution, the initial contact should be made with the program director or the Dean in order to obtain a letter of good standing, if required. Transcripts may be requested from the Registrar and will be released only if the financial account is in good order. College Disciplinary Policy and Procedure It is not possible to enumerate all forms of behavior both within and outside the College premises and property that would raise serious questions concerning an individual student's continuing in study at the College and/or in such student's ability to practice as a professional after graduation, and 54 which would constitute a violation of professional behavior. The following, however, are some examples of behavior that would be unacceptable: violation of any law of the land; dishonesty, such as cheating, or knowingly furnishing false information to the College; breaches of confidentiality in the course of patient care; drug or alcohol abuse; forgery, alteration or misuse of College or training site documents, records or identification; abuse, malicious misuse, damage or destruction of College or training site property; assault or battery, threat of force or violence or any other action or omission that would jeopardize the health or welfare of any member of the College or personnel at a training site, including, without limitation, members of the faculty, administrative or professional staff, students, employees, patients or visitors; abusive or disrespectful conduct toward members of the faculty, administration or professional staff, employees, students, patients or visitors to PCOM; theft of or damage to any property temporarily or permanently located on the College or training premises; obstruction or disruption of teaching, research, patient care or any other College or training activities; unauthorized entry into, occupation of or obstruction of any building or part thereof on the College premises; violation of any other duly established rules and regulations of the College, affiliated hospitals or any affiliated institution. As used in the above examples, the College premises and College property shall include the premises and property of any affiliated institutions or training sites where PCOM students pursue activities for academic credit. Also included is conduct related to participation in any activities under the auspices of the College or its student organizations. Forms of Discipline Breaches of appropriate professional behavior and violations of College policy will be subject to discipline. Discipline includes, but is not limited to, warning, probation, suspension and dismissal. Warning: A warning is written admonition to a student for inappropriate behavior that is found to have constituted a relatively minor offense. It may be issued by an administrator or by any member of the faculty of the College. Warnings are reported to the Provost, Dean and the Assistant Dean for Student Affairs for informational purposes. Probation: A student may be placed on disciplinary probation for not longer than one academic year. The provisions of this probation will be decided by the Committee on Professional Conduct. Such provisions may include a requirement that the student obtain medical and/or psychiatric consultation and treatment or other terms designed to remedy the behavior being reviewed and to prevent its recurrence. Suspension: Suspension represents temporary separation from the College. The duration of a suspension shall be determined by the Faculty Committee on Discipline, but shall not exceed one academic year. The Committee may also place conditions on the student's return to the College. Such conditions may include the student's need to obtain medical and/or psychiatric consultation and treatment, or other appropriate conditions. Dismissal: Dismissal represents permanent separation from the College. Dismissal may be invoked by the Student Professional Conduct Committee and may be imposed with or without the right to reapply for admission to the College at a later date. Where medical or psychiatric consultation and treatment are recommended or required, the confidentiality of the physician/patient relationship shall be preserved and no report shall be made by the consulting physician to the Student Professional Conduct Committee without the consent of the affected student. However, the Committee on Professional Conduct may condition a student's ability to continue as a PCOM student upon a satisfactory evaluation by a physician, psychiatrist or psychologist appointed by the committee. The process and proceedings are described in the General Student Handbook. 55 TUITION AND FEES The Board of Trustees established the following tuition for the 2018-2019 academic year.

All prior year balances must be satisfied before a student is permitted to start a new academic year. Balances remaining unpaid at the end of the fourth year or end of degree program will prevent a student from receiving his or her diploma. In the event that a student receives and accepts a late admission to the first year of study, an exception to the above policy will be considered if the appropriate loan applications are filed immediately with the expectation of making full tuition payment by the end of the first term. This exception is for the first term of the first year only. Any other exceptions to this policy must be discussed with the Director of Financial Operations. 58 FINANCIAL AID The Office of Financial Aid strives to assist students with financial aid options and promote financial literacy while maintaining compliance with all federal, state and institutional policies. Determining Financial Need With the exception of Federal Stafford unsubsidized loans and Federal Graduate PLUS loans, federal financial aid is awarded on the basis of financial need. When the student's Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is processed, a formula is applied to the information that the student provided to calculate the student's Expected Family Contribution (EFC). EFC is the amount that the federal government has determined that the student can contribute towards the cost of his/her education. The formula is established by law and is used to measure the student's financial strength based on his/her income and assets. The student's EFC is used in the following equation to determine the student's financial need: Financial Need = Cost of Attendance - Expected Family Contribution Cost of Attendance A student's Cost of Attendance, or financial aid budget, is the sum of the following: Tuition Comprehensive School Fee Class dues (not applicable to all programs) Books and supplies Instruments and equipment (not applicable to all programs) Medical exam costs (not applicable to all programs) Health insurance Room/rent Utilities Food/groceries Transportation Personal Loan fees THE APPLICATION PROCESS FAFSA To apply for financial assistance at PCOM for each academic year, students must first complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) at www.fafsa.ed.gov. This online form is the backbone of the financial aid process and is needed to be awarded federal student loans, federal work study, and certain PCOM and external scholarships. Social Security numbers are required for all financial aid processing. Eligibility In order to be considered for the majority of PCOM's financial aid resources and federal student loans, the student must complete the FAFSA. The basic eligibility criteria for completing the FAFSA are: The student must be a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen. The student must be enrolled or accepted for enrollment as a regular student in an eligible degree or certificate program. The student must be enrolled as at least a half-time student (usually at least 3 credits) each term. The student must maintain satisfactory academic progress. 59 PCOM Scholarship Application Students must complete the PCOM Scholarship Application as part of their Nucleus Financial Aid Checklist in order to be considered for all PCOM scholarship funds that have unique criteria. Many endowed scholarships are selected by the PCOM Scholarship Committee. Also, by the student's completing the PCOM Scholarship Application, the PCOM Financial Aid Office will specifically notify students of certain external agency scholarships for which they may apply. Financial Aid Checklist Students will find their PCOM Financial Aid Checklist within MyPCOM. Students must use the Financial Aid Checklist to complete outstanding requirements, accept financial aid awards, and view their exact Cost of Attendance. New students will be given access to MyPCOM from the PCOM Student Affairs Office after they submit their first tuition prepayment or deposit.

RESOURCES - FEDERAL WORK STUDY (FWS) The Federal Work Study (FWS) program provides funds for part-time employment to help students to finance the costs of postsecondary education. FWS - Eligibility To be eligible for FWS, a student must meet the following criteria: Completed the FAFSA for the appropriate academic year. Submitted all financial aid requirements. Demonstrated financial need. Be enrolled at least halftime (usually at least three credits, but there are exceptions). Be matriculated in a degree seeking program. Award Amount, Pay Rate and Hours Depending on a student's eligibility, the usual FWS award is $5,400 for the academic year. Students do not need to reapply for FWS each term. Most positions pay $15 per hour. This works out to be about 10 hours per week over 3 terms. Students should not work more than 20 hours per week with the exception of summer work where a student can potentially work over the 20 hours. Students are responsible for managing their FWS hours and may not work in excess of their FWS award as part of their financial aid package. Jobs Jobs range from typical library and office work, to assisting in labs and participating in research. Visit the Job Listing Webpage available on the PCOM Financial Aid website to view potential FWS job positions on both the PCOM Pennsylvania and GA-PCOM Georgia campuses. Applying for a FWS Position It is the student's responsibility to seek out and apply for a FWS job by contacting supervisors/departments listed on the FWS Job Listing Webpage. After a student has been hired for a work study position, the student or supervisor will notify the Financial Aid Office so that the office can add Federal Work Study to the student's financial aid award. The Financial Aid Office will then send a Federal Work Study Award Form to the student via e-mail. The student and job supervisor will complete the FWS Award Form and return it to their appropriate Financial Aid Office. If a student is new to the FWS program, the student may also need to complete additional forms. Once all the forms are received and reviewed by the Financial Aid Office, the student and the job supervisor will receive a Federal Work Study Authorization e-mail. This e-mail will describe the amount of the work study award, the number of hours that the student may work, and the name of the supervisor and timekeeper. A student may not begin to work until this authorization e-mail has been received. To view additional details on eligibility, terms and applying for Federal Work Study, please go to the Federal Work Study website at www.pcom.edu/fws 62 RESOURCES - SCHOLARSHIPS PCOM Scholarships for Incoming Students PCOM offers full- and partial-tuition scholarships to newly admitted students on both campuses.

Eligible students should submit their certification of eligibility to the PCOM Office of the Registrar for Philadelphia Campus and to the Financial Aid Office for PCOM-Georgia. As there are a limited number of Yellow Ribbon scholarships, the awarding will be based on when the certification of eligibility is received. A maximum of 10 awards will be made to graduate students, and a maximum of 10 awards will be made to medical students. Tuition and fees paid under the Post-9/11 is capped at $17,500 or the appropriately reduced amount based on the student's eligibility percentage for the academic year. 63 For further information regarding Post-9/11 or other chapters, contact the PCOM Registrar's Office. National Health Service Corps This is a competitive federal program that awards service-obligated scholarships to students pursuing primary health care training. The scholarship provides payment of tuition, fees, other reasonable costs and a monthly stipend. In return, for each year or partial year of scholarship support, the student must serve one year in a health professional shortage area. The minimum service commitment is two years. Health Professions Scholarship Program The United States Army, Navy and Air Force offer prospective military physicians, physician assistants, clinical psychologists and pharmacists a paid medical education in exchange for service as a commissioned medical department officer. U.S. citizens are eligible based on academic performance, recommendations and physical requirements. The Health Professions Scholarship Program (HPSP) provides funding for tuition and fees, books and instruments, and a monthly stipend. In return for the scholarship, recipients are obligated to give one year of service for each year of support (minimum two years of service). Recipients will be required to spend 45 days on active duty each year while in school (usually on weekends). Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) for Financial Aid The United States Department of Education requires every postsecondary institution receiving Title IV federal funds to have an academic progress policy that is used to determine eligibility for and continued receipt of federal funds. Although this policy must apply to all students whether or not they are receiving financial aid, the receipt of financial aid is a privilege that creates both rights and obligations for the student. The Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) policy has three components: The student must maintain a certain grade point average or a comparative qualitative measurement against a norm. The student must complete a certain percentage of all coursework attempted. The student has a maximum timeframe to complete the program. Title IV federal funds affected by this policy at PCOM include the Federal Direct Stafford Loan, Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan, Federal Perkins Loan, and Federal Work Study program. Although not required by the federal government, all institutional funds are also governed by the SAP policy. A review of SAP will be conducted at the end of every spring term regardless of when a student enrolls. Failure to meet any component of SAP at the end of the spring term will result in the loss of eligibility for Federal and PCOM financial aid for the next academic year. The Financial Aid Office will notify the student if the student has failed to meet the standards of SAP and has lost eligibility for financial aid. If financial aid has already been awarded for the subsequent academic year, the offer of aid will be rescinded. A student may appeal the loss of eligibility of financial aid and seek to be placed on Financial Aid Academic Progress Probation for one term. This appeal must be based upon on either the death of a relative, a serious personal illness/injury, or other extenuating circumstance. The student must be able to demonstrate that the illness/injury or extenuating circumstance had a direct impact on the student's academic performance. To do this, the student must work with the appropriate academic program advisor and/or Student Progress Evaluation Committee to: Develop an Academic Action Plan 64 Complete an appeal form for Financial Aid Academic Progress Probation. After the student's appeal form for Financial Aid Academic Progress Probation has been approved by the appropriate academic advisor, it should be submitted to the Office of the Registrar and the Office of Financial Aid for review. The Financial Aid Office will then notify the student of the approval of the Financial Aid Progress Academic Probation. If the student is granted Financial Aid Academic Progress Probation, the student will regain eligibility for financial aid for one term. At the end of the term, the student's academic record will be reviewed. If the student is now meeting the terms of the SAP, the student will regain eligibility for financial aid for subsequent terms. If the student has still not met the terms of the SAP, but has fulfilled the terms of the Financial Aid Academic Progress Probation, then the student's Financial Aid Academic Progress Probation will be renewed for an additional term and the student will be awarded aid for that term. If the student has not fulfilled the terms of the Financial Aid Academic Progress Probation, then the student will lose eligibility for federal & institutional financial aid. Students who are dismissed or withdrawn from the school are not deemed to be making SAP and are not eligible to receive financial aid. The SAP policy will be disseminated to all newly matriculated students. All students will be notified yearly of the SAP policy which will be published in this document and available on PCOM's website at www.pcom.edu/sap Doctoral students must achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0. Graduate students must achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0. Graduate Certificate students must achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0. Pharmacy students must achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0. Doctor of Osteopathic students must: Achieve a passing grade on all coursework, validations, exams, clinical clerkships. Have passed COMLEX I by the end of year 3. Passed COMLEX II (both parts) by the end of year 4. Students must complete the appropriate percent of all courses attempted to maintain a good academic standing. The completion percentage is calculated by dividing total hours earned by total hours attempted. If a student changes degree programs, then the SAP status will be based on the academic record of the new program. It is also important to understand how specific grades and/or course types count toward the completion ratio. The following grades count as attempted but not completed courses: Incomplete No Grade Reported Withdraw Failure Unsatisfactory All students at PCOM are required to maintain a 67% completion of coursework. Transfer credits will count towards a student's attempted and completed credit hours. Students in the Doctor of Osteopathic have 6 years to complete the program from initial matriculation. 65 Students in the Doctor of Psychology programs have 7 years to complete the program from initial matriculation. Students in the Pharmacy program have 6 years complete the program from initial matriculation. Students in Graduate programs students have 5 years complete the program from initial matriculation. Any term in which a student is enrolled counts towards the maximum timeframe regardless of whether or not the student receives federal financial aid. Living Expense Refund Policy You are charged for tuition and fees each term. Therefore your student loans and other aid will be divided into equal disbursements equal to the number of terms you are enrolled for the academic year. Your loans will electronically pay toward your PCOM charges on the first date of enrollment at the beginning of each term. If you borrow more funds than tuition/fees, the PCOM Bursar's Office will then release the remaining \"living expense refund\" funds to you 7-10 days after your first date of enrollment for the term. After PCOM processes your refund, allow 1-3 additional business days for your bank to deposit the funds into your bank account. If you are not signed up for direct deposit through the PCOM Bursar's Office, please allow 3-5 business days for your refund check to arrive via postal mail. Vacation months do not count as a class or rotation for financial aid refund purposes. For example, if a third- or fourth-year DO student takes a vacation period at the beginning of a term, this will likely result in their disbursement and refund dates being pushed back to later in the term. Individual students' disbursement and refund dates can vary by programs, years, and individual student enrollment. Direct Deposit for Living Expense Refunds Our office highly recommends signing up for direct deposit through the PCOM Bursar's Office so your refund funds are paid directly to your bank account each term. Direct deposit is generally faster and more secure than receiving a paper check via postal mail. The Direct Deposit form can be found in the PCOM Bursar Office (Rowland Hall, Suite 203) or online on the Disbursements and Refunds webpage on the PCOM Financial Aid website. Pending Loan Advance (PLA) Requests The Pending Loan Advance (PLA) allows a student to receive a portion (up to $2,000) of their financial aid refund money earlier than the scheduled disbursement date. The PCOM Financial Aid Office will submit a completed PLA to the PCOM Bursar Office up to 15 days before the student's actual disbursement date. There are no additional charges for completing a Pending Loan Advance, but they are to be used for emergency situations and we only allow students one Pending Loan Advance per year. The student is limited to one PLA per academic year. If a student has an emergency situation that is unavoidable, the student can meet with the Debt Management Counselor to discuss a possible second PLA for the academic year. The student needs to have completed all requirements to accept their financial aid. The amount of 66 the approved PLA may be less than the amount requested by the student. The counselor will speak with the student in person or over the phone to inform the student about any possible future deficit of funds for the upcoming term and, if necessary, recommend that the student make spending adjustments to eliminate the deficit. Under discretion of the financial aid counselor, students may need to have a counseling session with the Debt Management Counselor before the PLA is approved. Students must contact their respective PCOM Financial Aid Office to request a PLA. The student will be asked to complete a PLA request form in the financial aid office or via email in a PDF document. Tuition Refund Policy Refunds are determined based on the proration of tuition and percentage of program completed at withdrawal, up to 50% of the program. If a student withdraws from classes within seven weeks from the start of the term, a pro-rata refund or tuition credit may be authorized. In the case of full withdrawals, the effective date of withdrawal is the date on which the student filed with the dean a written notification of withdrawal or a request for a leave of absence. For courses not conducted on a weekly schedule, summer sessions, and for clinical clerkships/preceptorships in the medical and physician assistant programs, the refund is prorated according to the percent of the clerkship, preceptorship or course completed as indicated in parentheses below: Withdrawal Date Term Charge % of Credit During first week of class (up to 5% of instructional time) 0% term charge 100% credit During second week of class 10% term charge 90% credit (more than 5% but no more than 10% of instructional time) During third and fourth weeks of class 25% term charge 75% credit (more than 10% but no more than 25% of instructional time) During fifth through seventh weeks of class 50% term charge 50% credit (more than 25% but no more than 50% of instructional time) Withdrawal after seventh week of class 100% term charge 0% credit (more than 50% of instructional time) No fee or portion of a fee is refundable. The refund policy is subject to change at the discretion of the Board of Trustees, but in no instance will such a change become retroactive. All federal financial aid funds are credited or returned in compliance with the Federal Return Policy Schedule. A student's total Cost of Attendance is based on certain enrollment. When a student drops courses, the PCOM Financial Aid Office will likely reduce the student's total Cost of Attendance. Often this results in no additional allocation of refund money to the student. For additional information contact the PCOM Bursar's Office Return of Title IV Funds When Withdrawing From All Courses The PCOM Financial Aid Office is responsible for calculating federal financial aid eligibility for students who discontinue enrollment during the term. Upon notification from the PCOM Registrar's 67 Office that a student has withdrawn from or dropped all classes, was dismissed, or is approved for a leave of absence, the PCOM Financial Aid Office is required to calculate the percentage of the term completed if the student received or was eligible for Title IV federal student aid (Stafford, PLUS, and Perkins loans). If the withdrawal date indicates that the student left the institution prior to completing at least 60% of the enrollment period, the PCOM Financial Aid Office must recalculate the eligibility for Title IV funds based on the following formula required by the federal government: The percentage of payment period is the number of days completed to the withdrawal date. The percentage of earned aid is the percentage of the payment period completed, divided by the total number of days in the payment period or term. Breaks of five or more days are not counted as days that are part of the term. Funds paid by federal student aid programs are returned to the appropriate program based on the percentage of unearned aid as required by the federal government: The aid to be returned is the result of the total amount of aid that could be disbursed minus the percentage of aid earned, multiplied by the total amount of aid that could have been disbursed for the payment period or term. If a student earned less aid than the amount disbursed, the institution is required to return the unearned portion of funds to the federal program(s). As a result, the student may owe a debit balance to the institution. The institution must return the amount of Title IV funds for which it is responsible within thirty days of the date of the determination of the student's withdrawal date. Funds are repaid in the following order in accordance with federal regulation: Federal Direct Stafford Unsubsidized Loans Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loans If a student earned more aid than was disbursed to the student account, the institution would request a post-withdrawal disbursement, which must be paid within 120 days of the student's withdrawal. The PCOM Financial Aid Office is responsible for calculating federal financial aid eligibility for students who discontinue enrollment during the term. Upon notification from the PCOM Registrar's Office that a student has withdrawn from or dropped all classes, was dismissed, or is approved for a leave of absence, the PCOM Financial Aid Office is required to calculate the percentage of the term completed if the student received or was eligible for Title IV federal student aid (Stafford, PLUS, and Perkins loans). If the withdrawal date indicates that the student left the institution prior to completing at least 60% of the enrollment period, the PCOM Financial Aid Office must recalculate the eligibility for Title IV funds based on the following formula required by the federal government: The percentage of payment period is the number of days completed to the withdrawal date. The percentage of earned aid is the percentage of the payment period completed, divided by the total number of days in the payment period or term. Breaks of five or more days are not counted as days that are part of the term. Funds paid by federal student aid programs are returned to the appropriate program based on the percentage of unearned aid as required by the federal government: The aid to be returned is the result 68 of the total amount of aid that could be disbursed minus the percentage of aid earned, multiplied by the total amount of aid that could have been disbursed for the payment period or term. If a student earned less aid than the amount disbursed, the institution is required to return the unearned portion of funds to the federal program(s). As a result, the student may owe a debit balance to the institution. The institution must return the amount of Title IV funds for which it is responsible within thirty days of the date of the determination of the student's withdrawal date. Funds are repaid in the following order in accordance with federal regulation: Federal Direct Stafford Unsubsidized Loans Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loans If a student earned more aid than was disbursed to the student account, the institution would request a post-withdrawal disbursement, which must be paid within 120 days of the student's withdrawal. 69 EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES AND RESOURCES PCOM maintains its main campus in Philadelphia and a branch campus in the Atlanta, Georgia area.

Hall Psychiatric Institute Wilmington Health Wolfson Children's Hospital Womack Army Medical Center Woman's Hospital 80 PROGRAMS OF STUDY Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine Introduction to Osteopathic Medicine As a philosophy, science and art, osteopathic medicine is a total approach to health and disease. It recognizes that the neuromusculoskeletal system is of major importance to human life. The interrelationship between this and other body-systems is a basic part of osteopathic philosophy. An emphasis on primary care, health maintenance, prevention of disease and attention to the neuromusculoskeletal system is key to osteopathic medical education and practice. Universally accepted today, these attributes were considered unorthodox when Dr. Andrew Taylor Still (1828-1917) objected to the crude medications of his time and sought to enhance the body's inherent healing through manipulation. The osteopathic physician incorporates evaluation and treatment of the musculoskeletal system as a basis for an approach to health and disease, combining it with the diagnostic and therapeutic modalities used by general scientific approaches to the healing arts. Like their MD counterparts, DOs must be licensed in the states where they practice, and additional board certification in specialties further underscores their professional credentials. All 50 states and the District of Columbia provide for the unlimited practice of medicine and surgery by osteopathic physicians. Licensing boards are usually composed of senior members of the osteopathic profession. In some states, MDs and Dos participate in combined licensing boards Osteopathic Philosophy The basic premises accepted by this profession provide the osteopathic physician with a unique way of looking at health and disease. These premises include the following: The human body is a unit in which structure and function are reciprocally interdependent. The body, through a complex system, tends to be self-regulating and self- healing. The adequate function of body-systems depends on the unimpeded flow of blood and nerve impulses. The musculoskeletal system is a major body-system and its importance exceeds that of mere framework and support. There are musculoskeletal components to disease that are not only manifestations of the disease, but also important contributing and maintaining factors. The adoption of these basic premises led to the development of the osteopathic total-body concept. The patient is considered ecologically rather than as an isolated unit. Instead of emphasizing the momentary disease state, the osteopathic approach studies and treats the person's well-being, lifestyle and behavior as a whole. Through the American Osteopathic Association (AOA), the profession maintains its independence and its own medical schools while cooperating with other branches of medical science. Primary care is emphasized in the educational programs, and a majority of graduates enter primary care fields. However, DOs participate in all specialty and subspecialty areas of current medical practice. Educational Goals A fundamental educational goal of the College is to prepare students for excellence in the practice of osteopathic medicine. The course of medical study is a practitioner's program with a strong emphasis on primary care, prevention and osteopathic concepts. Each osteopathic medical student progresses through a uniform and comprehensive curriculum designed to achieve this goal. Elective clinical clerkships expose students to specialty or subspecialty fields during training, and later they may specialize. At PCOM, students are trained first as family 81 practitioners and thus build solid foundations for their careers. Throughout the curriculum, osteopathic concepts and methods are stressed. Efficiency is also an educational goal, maximizing each student's learning by utilizing the most effective educational methodologies available. Innovations such as computerized tutorials, classroom videos and simulated patient encounters will sharpen skills as a physician. The curriculum bridges departmental divisions and joins related disciplines, such as basic sciences to surgery and internal medicine, so that students relate different perspectives to a variety of conditions taught in a common time frame. Instruction is attuned to the changing demands in American health care. A majority of PCOM's graduates enter primary care practice, where the large majority of health problems are treated today. The general objectives of the educational program are expressed as \"core competencies,\" the domains of knowledge and skills in which all students must demonstrate competency to earn the degree, Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine: Osteopathic principles and practice, which are established and incorporated in the development of skills. Patient care that is compassionate, appropriate and effective for the treatment of health problems and the promotion of health. Medical knowledge about established and evolving biomedical, clinical and cognate (e.g., epidemiological and social-behavioral) sciences and the application of this knowledge to patient care. Practice-based learning and improvement that involves investigation and self- evaluation of patient care, appraisal and assimilation of scientific evidence, and improvements in patient care. Interpersonal and communications skills that result in effective information exchange and teaming with patients, their families and other health professionals. Professionalism, as manifested through a commitment to carrying out professional responsibilities, adherence to ethical principles, and sensitivity to a diverse patient population. Systems-based practice, as manifested by actions that demonstrate an awareness of the larger context and system of health care and the ability to effectively call on system resources to provide optimal care. Information literacy, as manifested by the capability to access, understand and apply biomedical information, and actions that demonstrate the skills necessary to utilize information technology tools to effectively access information from various resources and formats. The Basic Sciences and Preclinical Years PCOM students begin preparation for the world of clinical medicine from their first day as medical students. The curriculum combines basic science and clinical course content with integrated courses such as Cellular and Molecular Basis of Medicine, as well as integrated approaches to the pharmacology, pathology, medicine and surgery related to respiratory, genitourinary, cardiovascular, reproductive, endocrine, nervous and gastrointestinal systems. The first two years lay the foundation with intense concentration on the basic sciences, anatomy, biochemistry, molecular biology, neuroscience, physiology, microbiology, pathology and pharmacology, taught in integrated course units that emphasize clinical applications. PCOM also 82 recognizes that medical practice is more than science. Coursework in ethics and patient communication helps the student relate well to patients, while content in evidence-based medicine and public health prepares the student for the complex world of private practice. The basic sciences are complemented by instruction in clinical subjects such as internal medicine, surgery, neurology, psychiatry, pediatrics, epidemiology, OB/GYN, family medicine, rehabilitation medicine, geriatrics, radiology, oncology and physical diagnosis. The principles and practice of osteopathic medicine are taught throughout the medical curriculum. All students attend small-group sessions during the first and second year to develop communication and diagnostic skills. These special instructional activities include patient observation, case conferences and basic clinical skills workshops. In addition, an active standardized patient and robotic simulation program introduces students to patient care through examinations of patient actors in a simulated practice setting, augmented by clinical exercises on high-tech human patient simulator manikins. The last two years emphasize clinical training experiences. Philadelphia Campus students are assigned to clinical clerkships throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and neighboring states. This unique training network comprises affiliated hospitals, five Healthcare Centers, numerous outpatient units and scores of physicians' offices. These clinical settings become teaching arms of the College; in effect, the Commonwealth is our campus. Students at the Georgia Campus are assigned to clinical clerkships throughout Georgia and the Southeast. The program is designed to afford progressive student responsibility for all phases of patient care under the direction of experienced physicians. This includes history taking, physical examinations, daily patient rounds, lectures, conferences and case presentations. Students rotate through services in medicine, family practice, manipulative medicine, surgery, cardiology, OB/GYN, pediatrics, psychiatry, otorhinolaryngology and office-based preceptorships. On elective clerkships, students may choose to pursue special interests at other medical institutions anywhere across the nation. All students receive additional training in osteopathic manipulative medicine during the third year. One objective of the College is to encourage graduates to practice in communities where health care services are most needed. Therefore, each student entering PCOM must be willing to accept clinical education assignments throughout the region. Each senior student serves at least eight weeks in an underserved community clerkship. An alternative rural elective is offered to a limited number of students, whereby the student may select an area of alternative health care delivery or a rural area of high medical need. Students can opt for a fifth year of the program to complete a year of research, or additional work in a specialty. Requirements for Graduation Each candidate for the degree of Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) must be age 2l or older, be of good moral character and have passed Parts I and II of the COMLEX (National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners), including the Level II Physical Examination component. Each candidate must have completed satisfactorily the program of study PCOM requires for the degree within six years from the date of initial matriculation. Attendance at the Commencement ceremonies conferring the degree is required of each candidate. 83 Requirements for Practice Each recipient of the DO degree must fulfill the requirements of the state licensing board of the state in which the physician chooses to practice. These requirements are regulated by the laws of each state. Pre-Doctoral Research Opportunities exist for extracurricular research experience for all of PCOM's students. Research laboratories and equipment, as well as electron microscopic, computer and animal facilities, are available for this purpose. Students have the opportunity to work with faculty members on a variety of biomedical topics. Most research is performed between the first and second academic years. Students may be partially funded for their research efforts, based on eligibility, through College Work-Study or external granting agencies. A compilation of faculty research projects/interests may be obtained from the Chief Science Officer. Dual Degree Programs DO/PhD in Cellular and Molecular Biology (Philadelphia Campus) The Joint DO/PhD Program is a collaborative initiative between the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine and the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia (USci). The purpose of the program is to provide a joint degree offering for students who wish to pursue physician-scientist careers, and the program is designed for students with specialized career plans. The research-intensive program provides three full years of research fellowship training in addition to the four year osteopathic medical program. The three year research component culminates in a research project and dissertation defense. A stipend and support for supplies/equipment are awarded in the research years. The DO/PhD Program is designed to train physician-scientists who will contribute to the fund of knowledge by conducting original, high-quality scientific research with the perspective of a clinical practitioner. The program represents a critical link between bench and bedside by combining medical training with research training and will produce clinical scholar-practitioners who can make ongoing contributions to the osteopathic clinical, scientific and academic community. Students are accepted into the program as part of their original application to osteopathic medical school through a special admissions process; hence acceptance to the DO and PhD components occurs simultaneously, with USci approving the acceptance into the PhD program. Non-acceptance to the joint DO/PhD Program does not preclude a student from being accepted to the DO program only, through the normal PCOM admissions process. PCOM awards the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree after successful completion of the DO Program. USci awards the Doctor of Philosophy degree upon successful completion of all requirements for the PhD in Cell and Molecular Biology, including dissertation defense and submission of a final manuscript for publication. For information regarding admission: http://www.pcom.edu/Admissions/admissions.html DO/MBA Program (Philadelphia Campus) In conjunction with Saint Joseph's University, a master of business administration degree in health and medical services may be earned by DO program students who concurrently complete a five year 84 course of study for the DO and MBA degrees.

Click on \"Continuing Medical Education 111 PROGRAM OF STUDY School of Pharmacy - Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) Philosophy The PCOM School of Pharmacy - Georgia Campus curriculum emphasizes patient centered care, a model consistent with the applied emphasis of PCOM's graduate and medical programs. The mission of the GA-PCOM PharmD program is to educate caring, proactive generalist pharmacists according to a practice model in which the practitioner assumes responsibility for a patient's medication-related needs and is held accountable for this commitment. The program also responds to the need for pharmacists in the nation, the state of Georgia and the southeastern region. The program educates pharmacists who prepare and provide drug products and assume responsibility for the rational use of drugs by contributing to the design, implementation, monitoring and modification of therapeutic plans that will achieve defined goals and improve therapeutic outcomes. Educational Goals The PCOM- GA School of Pharmacy prepares generalist, entry-level pharmacists who are able to deliver high-quality pharmaceutical care. To achieve this mission, students must develop the knowledge, skills and attitudes that enable them to competently: (a) provide population-based and patient-specific pharmaceutical care, (b) manage and use resources of the health care system and (c) promote health improvement, wellness, and disease prevention. While preparing pharmacy practitioners is the primary mission of the Doctor of Pharmacy program, the program also provides an avenue by which students may explore a broad range of career opportunities. The program therefore aspires to foster interest in the creation of new knowledge to enhance patient health outcomes and quality of life and also to prepare students for further education. Curriculum The program is configured in a curricular format in which students complete: the pre-professional phase (three or four years) of general education, biomedical and sciences instruction at undergraduate colleges the last four professional years of pharmaceutical sciences and pharmacy practice instruction at the GA-PCOM facility, as well as clinical experiences at clinical sites throughout Georgia and the southeast. Each term is a 13 week period, corresponding to the calendar used by PCOM academic programs in both Philadelphia and Georgia. The extension of coursework over the three terms of each academic year provides the opportunity for the across-the-curriculum development of skills. The curriculum is composed of courses in biomedical, pharmaceutical, social/behavioral/administrative, and clinical sciences. A number of elective courses are available to allow students to enhance their knowledge of pharmacy related topics in specific areas. There are five Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences (IPPEs) in which students are given exposure to pharmacy practice in a variety of different specialty areas and begin their hands-on experiences. The final year of the program consists of the Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences (APPEs) in which students are required to complete eight different rotations. These rotations consist of five weeks in a particular pharmacy practice site. Required rotations are: General Medicine Ambulatory Care Hospital Practice Community Practice 112 Community Management Elective rotations will include rotations such as (but not limited to): Cardiology Infectious Diseases Pediatrics Compounding Pharmacy Pharmaceutical Industry Management A comprehensive examination will be given at the end of the second, third and fourth professional years. These examinations assess knowledge and skills acquired during the curriculum. Students that do not pass the comprehensive exam will be allowed to take a remediation exam. Failure to pass the remediation examination will prevent a student from progressing to the next professional year or graduating late and may result in dismissal from the program. . This curriculum, including active learning skills development time, is designed to develop the knowledge, professional skills, professional attitudes and values that are required for an entry-level pharmacist. Requirements for Graduation Each candidate for the degree of Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) must be of good moral character and have completed satisfactorily all academic requirements in the program of study. All requirements for the degree must be completed within six years from the date of initial matriculation. PharmD graduates must demonstrate that they have acquired competency in six basic areas of knowledge, skills, abilities, behaviors and attitudes: pharmacy knowledge and practice skills, patient care skills, communication/interpersonal skills, professionalism, understanding and skills in the use of information and empirical evidence, and skills in systems-based practice. Licensure In general, in order for candidates to take the pharmacist licensure examination, state boards of pharmacy will require successful completion of the requirements for the Doctor of Pharmacy degree from an accredited institution and completion of a certain number of hours as a pharmacy intern. In Georgia, applicants for pharmacist licensure must be at least 18 years of age, have graduated from an ACPE-accredited school/college of pharmacy and completed 1,500 hours of internship under the supervision of a registered pharmacist. Schools of pharmacy in Georgia allow students to claim credit for 1,500 internship hours obtained during experiential rotations, An applicant may register with the Georgia Board of Pharmacy as a pharmacy intern if he or she is registered in an accredited school/college of pharmacy. All students at the PCOM School of Pharmacy - Georgia Campus are required to obtain their Georgia intern license during the first term, and the School will assist with the application process. Any student found to be ineligible to be licensed as a pharmacy intern in the state of Georgia, at any time during his or her tenure at the PCOM School of Pharmacy - Georgia Campus, will be dismissed from the program. PCOM students must maintain their intern license in order to legally participate in the experiential pharmacy rotations. The licensure requirements for pharmacists and pharmacy interns vary by state, and it is recommended that applicants inquire with the board of pharmacy in the state where they intend to practice if they have any questions. 113 COURSE SEQUENCE School of Pharmacy - Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) Curriculum for Pharmacy Class starting Class of 2022 First Year TERM 1 (FALL) Course No Course PHAR 109G . 115G 132G . be randomly assigned IPPE (Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experience) for two out of the three terms (no fall) during the first year.

The PCOM Department of Physical Therapy will be recognized for its: - Commitment to cultivating an inclusive learning environment that is diverse, inquisitive, dignified, and respectful and that will inspire caring graduates who advocate for all individuals in our changing healthcare environment. - State-of-the-art learning environment that offers the opportunity for \"whole person\" management through inter-professional collaboration, development and intellectual growth, as well as hands-on experiences. - Educational advancement for faculty, students and clinicians to promote development of exceptional healthcare professionals who are committed to life- long learning and engagement in the profession of physical therapy. Physical Therapy Philosophy The International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) provides the basic framework for organizing the curriculum. This framework was chosen because of its emphasis on the individual client as the focus of health care and its consistency with osteopathic philosophy, which emphasizes management of the \"whole person\" and recognizes the unity of body systems. This is consistent with the program's belief that physical therapists are experts in movement and use their skills to restore, maintain, and promote optimal movement and function. As such, physical therapists function interdependently in a variety of settings and use theory and established scientific evidence as the foundation upon which they address the needs of the \"whole person\" (physical, psychological, spiritual, and socio-economic). The curriculum is also founded on the belief that optimal physical therapy is provided in a client-focused environment in which the therapist assumes various roles, including educator, consultant, and advocate. The organization of the curriculum is based on the assumption that understanding and responding to the effects of health conditions begins with knowledge of good health. The implication is that practitioners need a firm foundation in \"normal\" in order to recognize and assist clients in managing impairments and deficits in activities and participation. The model is \"wrapped\" in an envelope made up of four themes that will be emphasized throughout the curriculum: Critical Thinking, Evidence-Based Practice, Professional Engagement, and Lifespan Development. The curriculum model is best described as hybrid, incorporating elements of traditional and systems- based curricula. In the early stages, the instruction focuses on normal body structure and function and includes content from both the Basic/Foundational sciences and the Clinical/Physical Therapy sciences. As the student develops an understanding of \"normal\" and how to assess it, the emphasis begins to shift to health conditions commonly seen in physical therapy, focusing on addressing impairments and activity and participation limitations/restrictions. All components of the patient/client management model are addressed in courses that are systems-based. Throughout the curriculum students will encounter each of the four themes noted above; sometimes in one of the systems-based courses or in courses whose primary function is to address those themes. Each course is assigned to one of five content areas: Basic/Foundational Sciences, 242 Clinical/Physical Therapy Sciences, Evidence-Based Practice, Professional Engagement, and Clinical Experiences. The following provides course information on the sequencing of courses and course descriptions as related to assigned content areas. Educational Goals 1. Provide a professional education that will prepare individuals for entry into the practice of physical therapy. 2. Promote the development of professional core values and behaviors. 3. Promote participation in and appreciation for scholarship that will contribute to the evidence supporting physical therapy practice. 4. Promote participation in activities designed to advocate for the profession, community, and individuals. 5. Engage in service to the college, community, and profession. 6. Provide opportunities for post-professional education and professional development. 243 COURSE SEQUENCE Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) - Georgia Campus First Year TERM 1 (SUMMER) Course No Course Title Credits Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) - Georgia Campus Second Year TERM 1 (SUMMER) Course No Course Title Credits Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) - Georgia Campus Third Year TERM 1 (SUMMER) Course No Course Title Credits required for degree completion 140 credits *All courses are subject to change as revised by the PCOM DPT curriculum committee 246 COURSE DESCRIPTIONS Basic/Foundational Sciences The eight courses in this area provide the foundation for an understanding of \"normal\" structure and function.
