Itgrew out of a major regional needs assessment in 1980, which drew attention to twoclusters of concerns: (1) interactive issues regarding how to improve the ways thatschools and families relate to one another, and (2) a focus on ways that schools mightassist particular groups of families whose children are, on the average, \"at risk\"academically. In a special sense, the School-Family Relations Program also grew out ofprior AEL work performed under the Childhood and Parenting Research Program (FY80-82). This previous work provided a network of field contacts, two tate bases thatcould be further any. /zed, and relevant methodology and research experience.From the beginning, the School-Family Relations Program has engaged in actionresearch as its main strategy for studying and effecting changes in school practices.The Program's purpose is to identify, develop, and encourage implementation of effec-tive home-school relations practices in schools within the Appalachian Region. During1983 and 1984 this work is being carried out through three project foci:(11 finding effective ways that schools can relate to \"special needs- families (e.g.,isolated rural, minority, single parent, two-job families, etc.);(2) improving communications between schools and homes regarding studentbehavior, attendance, and academic progress, particularly at the secondary level;and(31 preparing school personnel for working with families.This workshop constitutes a major dissemination activity for the School-Family Rela-tions Program, which concludes its National institute of Education sponsored researcheffort in 1984.

SectionAbout This Resource Notebook When convenience foods such as cake and muffin mixes were first market; many contained everything except water, which the cook was to add. Some of these box mixes did not sell too well until one astute student of human naturesensed that too much hid been done for the cook--it seemed that creativity, a sense of pride, and varying things to suit the occasion could not be achieved by simply adding water and stirring. It all seemed too simple end made the cook feel unneeded.So now we are invited to add \"two fresh or \"extra oil for extra richness,\" \"grated orange peel,\" or some other personal touch thilt makes the product suit our tastes, the situation--and allows as to exercise our own considerable creativity. The result:albost no one bakes \"from scratch\"! So it is with this Resource Notebook for Staff Development in School-Family Relations. We have put together in one notebook some of the basic ingredients of school-family relations, particularly for the states of the Appalachian Region; current research and best thinking on scef development and inservice training; examples of techniques '4:o foster be::te home-school relations through better commu3icatiou; and ways to tram. ac' ool personnel iu using those techniques. We have also iwovided ways fo: vaers to add their ova \"fresh egg,\" walnutt,\" '1.11tr3 local, state, or other 1.1eas and suggestioaa. We did it this wLy for several reasons: 1.We are convinced that school people at the local level,including the building level, do not need a pre-packagedprescriptive approach to staff development. Rather,they need resources, ideas, and organizational help todevelop inservice experiences in ways that meet theirown identified needs. I-1 2.There are too many good ideas for encouraging betterschool-home relations for any one notebook, *ad moreare coming out all the time.We've left space for youto add those that Look promising. 3.As more research andjnformation on school-familyrelations and communications, and on effective staffdevelopment becomes availableand it willyou canadd it to the appropriate sections. 4.The information we have compiled is limited to oneaspect of school-family relations: improvingcommunications from the school to che home . Thereare other aspects equally compelling:improvingcommunication from the home to the school, as well ascompletely different forms 'f parent involvement.Youmay wish to add sections pertaining to other techniquesof working with parents and the community. ow to Use This Notebook We are assuming that a person or committee responsible for staff development in school district or school building would take the lead in using this material. The following approach will probably be most productive. Study the background and informalon sections:Section IISchool Essential Research and Section IXEvaluit ionQuickly scan the resource sections, so that you have a generalidea of what they contain (Sections V-VIII). Conduct a need and interest assessment using thecsuggestionsnet are given in Section III. With this information as aguide, you can develop objectives, then select activities fromthe appropriate sections or other resources to help achievethose objectives. Flan and carry out the inservice activitiesaccording to the guidelines, modifying and supplementing ouractivities and suggestions as appropriaLe. Rememberto evaluate and followup! Make notes about the wayyou used thevarious activities and the results, soyou'll have that information to guide you another time. I-2 *is a teacher, or administrator, or other schoOl staff member who is to improve your own skills in communicating with families, you'll want to read the background and information section, then examine your situation and 'yourself to see what aspects of school-family relations you would like to improve.Perhaps you are uncomfortable talking with parents about problems;maybe you tend to overwhelm thlm with \"educator talk\" without really listening to what they have to aay.e If so, turn to the activities on \"Listen With Your Mind and Heart\" and \"Plain Words\" for some ideas and practice activities. Perhaps you'd like to start a class calendar, so that parents will know what their children are studying and can do things to help at home. You can find suggestions for gettiug that forth of communication going in \"The Written Word.\"Whether yoU are using the Notebook for group work in staff development or for yourself as an individual, you will find many additional resources in the last section.If activities to meet your needs are not in the Notebook, try some of the other resources that are suggested.Many of the national organizations will send catalogs and sample,copies of their material on request.Your state education agency or nearby college are other good resources.Schools alone cannot educate children. School personnel will find in this Resource Notebook ways to achieve better school-family communications at the nlassroom, school building, and district levels. 1- 3 Section 11School anA Faany: The Essential Connection Hone-School RelationsWhen school-age children are involved, schools and families are inevitably linked. Sometimes they blame each other for any problems; sometimes they support each other; sometimes they uneasily co-exist.But whatever their relationship, the youngster who links them is probably influenced by it. Whatever their relationship, both schools and families arc influenced. Whatever their relationship, the larger society, which has a stake in the success of both schools And families, is influenced and co -cAled.For many years, the Appalachia Educational Laboratory has been studying the unique needs of Appalachian schools and families in maintaining and improving school-family relationships. From our own work, and from other studies throughout the United States, consistent findings emerge. Parent involvement in schools is significantly related to:improved student academic achieveient,improved student attendance in school,improved student behavior in school, andincreased community support for schools, includinghuman, financial, and materials also knew that parents think their children's education is important. They want to be kept informed of their child's progress in school and to be 1 3 involved in their child's education (Etheridge, Collins is a catch-all term that is used to describe a wide variety of activities that range from occasional attendance at school `functions to intensive efforts to help parents become better teachers of their own children.We don't yet know all about what type of \"involvement\" works best with different kinds of schools, communities, teachers, families, and children.For example, information on appropriate activities for families and schools with upper elementary and secondary school pupils is just beginning to become available (Gotta 6 Purnell, 1984). However, quality communication between the school and home is present in successful parent involvement. Of value in and of itself, it is also A basic precondition supporting other types of parent involvement, such as teaching children at home, volunteering in the school,, or supporting the school's educational efforts.Let's look at some of the reasons school-family communication, as an essential element in productive school - family relations, needs to be given special attention: the changing relationship between the school and the family; the change in structure of many families; social and demographic change; anthe increase in educational expectations for all pupils.Cl.:hol.dthefmiI.y. There was a time when schools, families, the community, and other community inetitutions all worked together more, each fairly sure of what its own and the others' roles and responsibilities were, and each generally supportive of the other. Probably the best example was a rule that many families had: \"If you get alickin' at school, you get another at homeno questions asked.\" School \"lickin's\" are long gone, and so is the unquestioning relationship between school and home. Many parents and most of society feel free to question,challenge, and make their views known to schools as well ae abler institutions (Naisbitt, 1982). At the same time, they are expecting more of schools, not less (Goodlad, 1984). Many are better educated and more sophisticated thaneducators perceive them to be (Williams, 1984). They are looking forinteractions with schools; not for the expectation that they will give unquestioning deference.As part of this changed and changing relationship, schools all over the United States have established parent advisory councils, state legislatures have established \"accountability\" laws, grassroots and national citizen action committees have organized to influence school policy and practices, and individual parents have challenged school actions (Naisbitt, 1982). Change in structure of many families. As expectations of schoo!s by families are influenced by larger trends, so are the abilities of families to respond to the school's expectations of them. Today's families have changed and continue to change. Both parents may work out of the home; singleparents--of either t4x--are rearing children; many fathers want a more active role in child-rearing; remarriage often creates a new and different family structure; and cultural and social diversity is no longer \"strange.\" Many parents are having their first child between 30 and 35; others are having children quite young.These two groups may have very diffent abilities and desires in relation to schools and their children's school work.Families are having fewer children, and those children are more likely to have been in preschool or child-care away from home before they started to school and before- and after-school care. Although evidence isstrong that the predicted adverse effects of such family changes onchildren's development have not cone true, these changes call for arethinking of traditional means of school-home communications. Forexample, afternoon parent-teacher conferences may be unattended because ofthe parent(s) employment. Reaching parents by telephone during the day maybe almost impossible except for an emergency. geeing a parent as be or shebrings the youngster to school may not be possible, as the child may arrivefrom a child care center. Other forms of communication may be needed.\u00a7ocill and demoaranhic change .Perhaps the most obvious social changeimpacting a need for good school-family-community relations is the \"graying\"of America.The proportion of people with children in school continues toshrink.It is projected to be less than 20 percent by 1985. Schools andfamilies must work together with the larger community to provide the tax baseessential for good schools for children, parents, teachers, aid our entiresociety.Schools and communities can work together to create an \"educativecommunity\" using school and non-school resources for education. Older people,businesses, the artsand yes, even television and technology are some of theelements of, an \"ecology of educating institutions\" (Goodlad, 1984).Other less obvious changes require school-family cooperation to make surechildren's progress in school is not negatively affected: the pervasiveinfluence of television, the power of the peer group c 1 children's behavior,and the large number of secondary school students who have paying jobs (Goodlad, 1984). Assigning homework does little good if television or a jobtakes up the time that might have been spent in homework. Telling parents tohave their teenager study does little good if the parent is ignored. Schools 11-416 do not function apart from the larger society; they are a part of societalchanges, both influencing and being influenced by them.Educational changes, both influencing and being influenced by them.Increases in educational expectations for all pupils. Educationalexpectations for all pupils are increasing. Many states have instituted orare considering competency tests for students. Some colleges are increasingtheir entrance requirements in an effort to influence high schoolrequirements.Schools and children alone cannot meet those expectations;families must help. A few examples will make the point clear.Families can help children attend school regularly and on time. They canassure that children have the adequate rest, exercise, and nutrition soessential to learning. They can show children they value studying andlearning by making reading, study material, and a place and time to study. available.Families can help and encourage youngsters who are faltering;stimulate and challenge those who need more than the school can provide.Some families provide this support naturally. It is in the child's bestinterest for schools to do what they can to help and encourage all families todo likewise.When expectations are either too high or too low for a givenchild, families must be involved in setting realistic expectations. At thesecondary level, more stringent college entrance requirements indicate thatfamilies must be involved in course and career choices.In many communities, school-hone relations and the communications thatenhance those relations are satisfying to both school and parent (Goodind, 1984; Gotta, 1983). In many others, they could be improved. In all schools,the relationships between home and school should be Iconitored and evaluated asan important part of the basic task of operating schools and educatingchildren.II-517 Preri d Ot er SPe s nne Fami lie, Few teachers, administrators, and other school personnel receive formal training in school-family relations or any type of parent involvement. In a survey conducted in both rural and urban areas in the Appalachian Region by AEL (Spriggs, 1983), only 37 percent of the professional personnel had received such training in their undergraduate work, and only 24 percent had received training in graduate work.Service and support personnel (school secretaries, custodians, clerical and classroom aides, and food service workers) interact frequently with parents about discipline, school work, school activities, and lunches. They, too, have received little formal training in interacting with parents. %service training, when provided to $5upport staff, usually deals closely with their work-related activities, not with how they interact with parents. Lack of formal training does not, of course, indicate that teachers, administrators, specialists, or support staff are without any of the necessary skills. Teachers do not feel reluctant to deal with parents. They report they have learned to work with families through experiences other than formal. training: through being a member of a family, church work, volunteer work, and other informal situations. Good human relation skills, however learned, are basic to communication with parents or anyone else.Less than 20 percent of the teachers said they were unprepared for working with parents, but also less than 50 percent said they were adequately. prepared.In addition, 40 percent of the certified personnel and 35 percent of service and support personnel said they would like assistance in interacting with families. Training in school-family relations and working with parents is something many school people need and are interested in. More II-6 .y-18 specifically, they asked for help in dealing with parents on discipline issues, grades, attendance, and working with parents in general. This need for more training of administrators, teachers, and other school personnel in working effectively with parents has been confirmed by other studies (Williams, 1984). ARISLELOALIZEIRLYarintion and NeedEducation in the United States is made up of individual classrooms buildings, and districts, each with their own unique strengths and needs. This is as true in school-family relations and communication as it is in the provision of science facilities, amount of time and resources allotted to the arts, or any other aspect of schooling. Although there are many attitudes and skills in working with parents and the home that all school personnel share, there will be differences, too. In-depth analyses of some of these differences are available in AEL's technical reports, and will only be summarized here.Elementary schools inulynaglimeitjyanukcaefilesiIi secondary schools.This is an appropriate reaction to age and developmental differences in children and families, and to the differences in curriculum and school organization at these levels. Little guidance about school family relations has been available to secondary school personnel, since most research and development work has been in preschool and primary schools. However, parents of secondary school children still want to be involved and informed about school activities in general and about any problems relating to their own children (Purnell & Gotts, 1983). Practices that are effective in elementary schools may not work well in secondary schools as thenature,of parents' involvement with their children changes. Th's does not meal that they are any II-713 less involved or interested. The attendance at any high school sports or drama performance is evidence of that!Urban schoo)i ang_f 'liesrelatemlmytyin. thin do rural schools and families. Schools in small towns may have slightly different interactions than either rural or urban comgunities. Although research evidence on these differences is sparse and based on parent and teacher perceptions, what there is suggests that rural and small town schools are more central to the lives of families than urban schools; teachers in small towns were more likely to interact with parents around school activities than teachers in either rural or urban areas.There appears to be more informal communication between hose and school in rural communities and more formal communication in urban communities; rural parents have more confidence than urban parents that when children have problems in school, collaborative efforts will produce the desired results (Gotta & Purnell, 1984). Teachers report some interesting differences in the way rural and urban families relate to schools. Rural teachers report that parents seem uneasy about coming to the school and are likely to come only when there is a problem.Teachers in small towns and urban areas reported this much leas often.In urban areas, teachers report more interaction abc,ut discipline, grades, and attendance than do teachers in rural areas. Teachers in arban areas also requested help in working with families on discipline (Setts & Purnell, 1984).Although urban, small town, and rural school-family relations are similar in oany respects, school personnel should be sensitive to the variations. School personnel who are working in the same type of community in which they lived and went to school, may intuitively respond to these differences. If they work in schools in a different type of community than where they grew 11-820 up, they may need help in understanding and responding appropriately to the different communication patterns and needs.Likewise, if families move from one setting to another--an increasing possibility in our mobile society - 'schools ma7 need to explain the differences before real misunderstandings occur. i lesd Illme-sch11 el* fereyeh are distant and strained. Maintenance of trust and communication requiresconstant attention, but rebuilding is infinitely more difficult.Little is known about these differences in \"climate\" and their influence on school-family relations, but no one connected with schools or familiar with current thinking about effective schools can doubt that such differences exist (Goodlad, 1984). 11-9 Alden, J.

Section IIIStaff Development: Research and Recommendations Whether you call it staff development, professional development,professional renewal, or just inservice education, continulng education ofschool personnel is essential. This is as true in school-family relations asin curriculum content or instlictional methods. Maybe more so. Most teachersand ainistrators in the Appalachian Region received no specific training forworking with parents and the home in their preservice training, yet theyrealised that school-family interaction is either desirable (24%) or essential(742) in order to do the best job of helping pupils learn (Spriggs, 1984).From a different perspective, parents welcome teachers= ideas and guidance,and consider teachers who communicate frequently with parents to be the betterteachers, higher in interpersonal skills and overall quality (Becker &'Epstein, 1981).In this section, we will look at what ue know about staff development andadult education as it pertains to school-family relations, then suggest anapproach to planning, developing, and evaluating staff development.TO keep the information concise enough to be of use to busy schoolpersonnel, we have distilled research and recommendations from a wide varietyof sources, and have not elaborated on any of them. Use the listing ofreferences at the end of this section and resources in the appendix forfurther study of the concepts and ideas. at We EnimLocal and state education agencies, colleges and universities, teachers'associations, professional organizations, and businesses that deal with schools have made staff development and inservice education one of the few growthareas in education in the last decade. The reasons for this developmentinclude demographic trends among teacher. and a inistrators; a decrease in traditional sources of new ideas and professional development; social, economic, and organizational changes; decentralization of responsibility for staff development; increased information on adults as learners; expectations that people will keep up to date; and recognition of the importance of employee morale and commitment.DemoRraphic trends amorist teachers and administrators. \"Fewer new teachers are entering the profession; turnover among teachers has been reduced.There is less mobility. The average age of teachers and their level of experience is increasing\" (Ohio Department of Education, 1983, p. lb). Continuing education for current staff is essential if they are to keep current, enthusiastic, and effective.D d* ides development.Beginning teachers often brought fresh ideas into a school, but their numbers are diminishing. Many teachers and administrators have already completed their graduate degrees or enough education to be at the 4top of the scale,\" and don't want more formal education. Local affiliate groups of professional. organizations, who often provided workshops and conferences directly related to teachers' needs and interests, are often struggling for existence rather than providing dynamic leadership. Schools and school districts are providing inservice education to replace these former sources.69446..U21112411SUEZIEtinlaLt. As a result ofosocisl, economic, and school organizational changes, schools are being expected to do Uthings that teachers sod administrators had little or no preparation for. 111-2 Inservice education has been essential to help achoole in \"mainstrecming\" ofhandicapped children; bilingual education and English as 4second language;multicultural eduction; differentiated staffing, especially team teaching, andworking with paraprofessionals; the introduction of microcomputers and otherinstructional t'chnnlogy; instructional concepts such as \"mastery learning\"and \"time-on-task\"; the for \"effective schools\"; and of course, parent involvement.e.basis onthe building unit, rather than the central office as the most effective unitfor improvement and change, and on having building teachers and principalsdesign staff development programs to meet their own needs is changing the wayinservice education is conceived of and delivered.Increased ieformntit5i 9n adults as learners. As more adults, includingschool personnel, have become involved in continuing education, adults aslearners have been studied in-depth, with many provocative ideas forconsideration in staff development. These findings are discussed in the next part of this section.. 4Avectations that Imple in an oraarization will \"keep up to date,\" The\"information explosion\" in ell professional and technical areas has madecontinuing education in all organizations essential. Schools and schoolpersonnel ere no exception. ,tManagement and oreanization theory that recognizes the importance ofemployee morale and commitment. Staff development and professional renewal,properly done, are recognized as important sources of motivation and highmorale--even inspiration. By honing skills and broadening professional ideas,inservice helps teachers feel secure, confident, and more satisfied on the job.In addition, inservice activities supported by board policy and 111-39 administrative commitment demonstrate that these groups care about and support what teachers do (Brodinsky, 1983). Adults fa Learners: Guidipa PrincivleoResearch on how people learn, develop, and change has given us many insights on adult learning. Some of the more significant findings, particularly as they relate to school settings, inservice education, and school-family relations are:Adults --even teachers with the sane number of years ofcollege and teaching - -have a *ride range of previousexperience, knowledge, skills, interest, self-direction,learning styles and cognitive levels. A few will be able tothink abstractly, deal easily with theories, and see therelationship of broad generalizations to their specificsituation.Many will be much more concrete in their thinkingand conceptual style. They will need many examples,demonstrations, practice, and careful development Gfgeneralizations before they can understand and apply them toother situations. In addition, individual differences amongpeople increase with age. As s result, adult education muttprovide for differences of all kinds (Knowles, 1978)-: Adults who can deal easily with abstract ideas in theif ownareas of expertise will not necessarily be able to do so asthey begin to learn something new. For example, a top-notchteacher of a difficult, abstract subject may have to start ata very basicskill level in dealing productively andpositively with parents.Many adult\u00b0 prefer informal learning strategies withopportunity for interaction with other learners. Examples ofsuch informal strategies might be sharing information on\"what works best for me,\" or methods that call for team orgroup learningrather than an individualized competitiveapproach.Even lectures, films, or demonstrations maybemore effective when followed by group discussion, practice,or critiquingeach other's trial applications.Adult learning is enhanced by educational approaches thatdemonstrate respect, trust, and concern for the learner.Both personals and professional growth and competence must beconsidered (Molly, 1983). Adults will resist learningsituations which they believe are an attack on theircompetence. Knowles (1978) suggests that the teacher ofadults should engage in mutual inquiry and learning with thelearners, rather than simply transmitting knowledge ormonitoring skill acquisition. I7T-427 Adults need to be self-directing (Knowles, 1978). They wantto learn things that are important and useful to them.Theseneeds and interests should be the starting point for panningand organizing learning activities.\"Life situations, both personal and professional, shouldprovide the organizing ideas for adult learningnot subjectmatter (Knowles, 1978). Likewise, analysis of their own lifeexperiences can be a powerful teaching/learning technique foradults.Acquiring a new skill, technique, or attitude can be quitethreatening to adults who already have something that\"works.\" They may need much assurance and support as they get\"wo7se\" (try out new skills) in an effort to get better(Joyce & Showers, 1983). They need to see the results oftheir efforts and have accurate, yet supportive, informationabout their progress.Adults who are learning a new skill in a context other thanthe one in which-they will apply it should be taught theproblems of \"transfer,\" and that the greater the ambiguity ofapplication situation (as with teaching) the greater theproblem of transfer (Joyce & Showers, 1983). Staff Development: 4uidina P, incip esAlmost anyone connected with a school can tell you what's wrong with inservice training as it has usually been conducted. They'll mention such things as \"too theoretical,\" \"no follow -up,\" \"at 4:00 in the afternoon, whocares?\" or \"Well, that's all very nice, but what does it have to do with whatI do on Monday?\" Researchers have identified broader concerns, such as the lack of time and money most schools have :or staff development; the need for coherent and comprehensive need-based programs, rather than \"one-shot\" workshops; lack of coordination and leadership, especially at the individual school level; limited diversity in how, when, and where inse-vice is provided; inadequate definition of goals and objectives; and lack of evaluation. From the viewpoint of our current concernschool-family relations - -we could also add that most inservice appears to be focused on classroom instruction or the latest idea making the rounds (stress management, time management, or a III-523 particular discipline technique). Very little appears to be done in helping teachers communicate and work with parents.In spite of its problems, inservice education and professional development are supported by school personnel, especially if staff development is the right kind (Brodinsky, 1983; Hovey & Carrigan, 1980). So what is the \"right kind?\" Are there magic ingredients that will make staff development effective, interesting, and above all, result in better learning for children? Well, no, of course not. What is available are some basic principles and guidelines, some based on research, some based on recommendations and experience of respected practitioners and theorists, and some based on theories of planning and change. Some pertain to the institution- -the school and school district; some pertain to how to motivate participants; some pertain to content And instructional methods; and some to time and facilities. The planning process that seems to be most promising is covered in the next portion.Principles Relatinz t9 Institutional Policies' and Commitmept:$aff development activities should be based on school boardpolicies which all segments of the educational community cansupport.A financial commitment in the form of money, time, space, andpersonnel should be made for staff development. Even a smallallocation of money and designation of responsibility isbetter than ,one. If possible, this should includeincentives for teachers, although those in2ntives do nothave to be money. Intrinsic and extrinsic rewards cancomplement each other.Although the trend in staff development is toward thebuilding unit as the base, districtvide needs should also beconsidered.School personnel will accept and support 11)th. Planning and implementing effective staff development shouldbe a shared responsibility. Administrators, central officepersonnel, or staff development specialists can't do it all.Teachers and other school personnel wait their say. Butinvolving and listening to teachers doesn't mean dumping the 111-6 job in their laps. Successful programs are jointly plannedand delivered.Plannina and Ortanization:Staff development should have an overall plan, both for theschool and the individual. Fragmentation and duplicationwaste time, effort, and energy. Better to focus on a fewagreed upon goals than to have a smattering of offeringswhich don't add up to any clear and complete program.Activities that are on-going, cumulative, and part of aschool's total program are more effective than those whichoccur sporadically. Shall sessions held once a week, eachone, complementing and building upon the previous ones, wouldusually be more effective than a day-lung session twice ayear.Follow-up is essential to help teachers transfer the learningto their own classroom and situations. Delivery:School -based programs are often preferred to those delivered\"out-of- context,\" although visiting other schools andattending professional conferences can also be effectivelearning experiences.Forming teachers into groups who can support, critique, andenergize each other will help create a social climate that isessential to the effective delivery of iaserviceA place for teachers to study, learn, and work together helpscreate a \"learning\" climate. With many schools less crowdedthan they once were, such a place for professionaldevelopment might be housed in each school.Content and Methods:Content should be as close as possible to school personnel'severyday needs and concerns. Thus, a general presentation onthe need for better school-home communication is less likelyto have an impact than more specific content that providesteachers the skills and resources to achieve suchcommunication.lloweve-4:, theory and practice are two sides to the same coin,and one can frequently illuminate the other. Knowing why youdo something, and how it relates to other things you do givesthem all meaning and significance. For example, teachers whoregard efforts to increase school -home communications assimply \"one more thing I'm expected to do,\" may have adifferent attitude when they understand the benefits to allconcerned. 111-7 Content and methods should work together to help learnersattain what some researchers call \"executive control\" (Joyce& Showers, 1983). All school personnel work in relativelyambiguous situations, where the unexpected is expected andmuch judgment is required. School personnel need tounderstand the purposes of what they are doing, how to adaptand modify, when to use one approach and when to use another,and bow to think conceptually about what they are doing.Content and methods must work together toward achievement ofobjectives that are clearly stated and known by theparticipants.A wide variety of methods are available and should be usedto maintain interest and increase effectiveness.Combinations of methods are frequently more effective thanany one alone, as shown in the following chart.onmenow:sTin ONIPIPTIECRNWATINCINIATTAINED IN KNOWLEDGEIIIIM111rnr.

Difficulties inherent in putting any new learning intopractice should be dealt with \"up front.\" Teach everyoueinvolved about the problem of transferring what they havelearned into real life settings and the discomfort they mayexperience (Joyce & Showers, 1983). If possible, peopleshould develop a high degree of skill prior to trying out theidea in their work. If the new procedures are likely torequire more teacher time than the ones they are replacing,teachers and administrators should be told. For example, itis immediately obvious that increasing the number, variety,and quality of communications from school to home willrequire more time of someone. Better be honest about it fromthe beginning. Pes #0, essIlsyelgpmentPrograms.Planners of many kinds of programs in many situations have successfullyused the planning process that we and others recommend for developing effective inservice training. Teachers use this model, with variations, whenthey preassess children's knowledge, then develop objectives, plan andimplement activities, then evaluate children's learning and the activities.States and counties sometimes use this cpproach when they are contemplating anew service or a change in service. It dpes, take more time and thought thansimply securing a good speaker on parent involvement or communication skills, but the results are likely to be better.The process is shown in the figure below: Report ResultsAnmmNeedsand l nterests Evaluate Program Materials,Time, Space, Money DesignActivities Altliough the process looks like it proceeds in an orderly, step-by-step fashion, in actual practice it does not. For example, when a planning committee begins to identify available resources, such as time and money available for inservice, they may have to go back to the drawing boards andi, revise or select only one or two out of several equally important goals and objectives.They cannot do all the things that need to be done. Or for instance, as a group begins a year-long inservice plan that calls for teachers to observe and coach other teachers, informal evaluation may call for a mid-year correction. The plan was taking far more time than anyone anticipated, and teachers simply could not do it on top of their other responsibilities. So the process is more flexible than it looks, and in actual practice there will be a lot of thinking ahead, backing up, revising, and redoing.Nonetheless, it is a very workable planning process. Weeny, school board policy would stand behind and give direction to the entire process, but the process can be carried out even in the absence of a stated board policy, provided there is administrative support and approval. Carried out by whom? Ideally, by a planning committee representative of all affected groups, including pa t .For example, parents should certainly be included in any school-hone relations staff development process. However, if all groups cannot be represented, work with the people you have.We will briefly discuss each of the steps, using examples from school-home relations and communication.Assess needs cad interests. A comprehensive needs and interests assessment gets information From all affected groups, uses several ways of getting information, and tries to determine actual needs, as well as perceived needs and interests. :3 3III-10 For example, parents of children of all ages should be given an opportunity to share their ideas on what aspects of school -home relations are satsifactory and which could be improved. School support and service personnel such as secretaries and custodians lend another perspective, and administrators and teachers still others.Typically, a survey questionnaire, plus informal observation, is the information gathering tool. However, that approach should be supplemented (or even supplanted) by others. A short telephone interview that secretaries or volunteers can carry out will obtain reliable and usable information from parents (Gotta S Sattes, 1983).A copy of this interview is in Appendix C and may be reproduced and used.Informal conversations with teachers can be systematically analyzed to determine perceived needs ants interests. Techniques to help a group determine priorities, such as the Delphi or Nominal Group Technique, can quickly help a group set priorities, while making sure each member of the group has an equal voice (Delbecq, Van de Yen, 5 Gustafson, 1975).Select those approaches that fit the group of people you are working with. There are others. The important thing is to use more than one approach.Perceived needs and interests, especially of those people participating in the inservice training, are important to know and should be the starting point.What should be, or what is prefer, should also be determined. What is the ideal state of affairs? How often and in what ways should schools and families communicate? Once that is known, the discrepancy can be determined by observation and by objective data gathering (e.g., How many parent-teacher conferences are held? How many academic progress reports go home beforeAreporting period? Is there a regular calendar or newsletter? A parents' bulletin board?). Perceived needs--that is, what administrators and other school personnel think they needare probably not enough information. III -11 The Appalachia Educational Laboratory has developed material to helplocal groups identify sucb educational needs from a variety of perspectives,then work through a proceee that results in a plan for action (Shively, 1980). A summary of this process is in Appendix D. Additional material is available from AEL.In planning a needs and interest assessment, don't ask about anythingthat it is unrealistic to provide training for. For example, a regular homevisitor who works part-time in the classroom and visits each home part-timeprovides wonderful home-school communication and teaches parents how to help their children at home. However, such programs are exceedingly expensive and few districts can afford them. Be realistic, but not pessimistic! There are many things schools can do for very lox cost.Needs assessment can also determine useful information about when, where,and for how long participants would prefer the inservice, as well assuggestions for resources.Share results with the school personnel, parents, and others involved tomake sure the outcomes accurately reflect their concerns. This validation process can correct any miscommunications early.Devs112120.1.,_amlpkissthtn. After information from the needsassessment has been gathered, tabulated, analyzed and validated, the next stepis to develop goals and objectives to meet the identified needs. For example, if a high priority need is better communication with parents about children'sgrades (and such a need was identified by teachers in the Appalachian Region), an appropriate goal might be:Teachers can,pnlaim,aradinkstcpdards and procedures inc1tark wg-St_echgc30. 'rummage.35TII-12 There might be several objectives to help reach that goal.' A couple ofsamples are shown below:Working together, .perchers will write non-technical explanationsof standards and criteria used for each grading mark.Specialists, teachers, and administrators will orally explain toanother person in non-technical language the meaning of certaincommonly used grading and assessment terms (grade level, pecentile,mean, norm, and so forth.Goals and objectives are seldom immediately obvious from the results ofa needs assessment. Much study, some artistry aud intuition, and a goodknowledge of the area being considered are essential. It is a good idea totry cut the goals and objectives on some of the people involved in theneeds assessment because everything else, includieg evaluation, flows fromthe goals and objectives. Goals and objectives should be shared withparticipants in the staff development activities.Identify resources: people. miterif1,1 amp. end money. If thebudget i- tight, no need trying to locate the highest-priced outsideconsultant.Determine what you can do with what you have. If released timefor staff development is a major problem, perhaps some. faculty meeting timecould be used, or self-instructional materials be made available, or a groupof teachers work together periodically during their planning period or during\"specials.\"Spreading out activities over a period of time usually givesbetter results from an all-day or half-day session anyway. Perhaps you canlocate two hours for a \"kick-off,\" and follow up with mini-sessions,individualized learning, or even a learning center in the library or work room.What have other districts and other groups done that you could use? Whatexpertise is available in your own school or district? Films?Videotapes? Booklets?Audiotapes that teachers can check out to listen to while driving?Can arrangements be made for teachers to visit an exemplary program? 111-13 In planning meetings, don't neglect physical comfort and conditions that allow for the kind of methods you may wish to use.Trying to do small group activities in a crowded room with no tables is a sure setup for failure. Design fctivities. In the two sections on adult learning and staff development, we outlined principles that research and practice have show to be effective.Activities should incorporate those principles as far as possible.If you are using consultants from a nearby college or another district, work with them to make sure they know what is expected. However, be aware that certain kinds of 'earnings lend themselves to interesting and effective activities easier than others.For example, it is easier to practice certain skills that teachers need to have, such as actively listening to a parent, than it is to influence attitudes that may subtly discourage parents from coming in to talk at all. In designing activities, make sure they are yaried, interestinz, and appropriate, to the type of learning and the goals being sought. They should also model good instruction. That is, there should be effective and efficient use of time, clear directions, provision for individual differences in completion time, task orientation, and other basic instructional techniques. You can find examples of learning activities that meet those criteria in Section VI.Unless everyone knows everyone else, plan a \"group-building\" opening activity to help people get acquainted and prepare them mentally and psychologically for the activities to follow.Time spent in this way is not wasted.Examples are given in Section VI. Implement activities. Do whatever has been planned, with a last-minute check on all details. Audiovisual materials ready? Refreshments?Needed III-1437 supplies?. Room arrangement? Staff development activities should be a model of organization and time utilization.Remember that followup to see if additional help is needed to transferlearning to the job, to \"coach,\" or simply to reassure and reinforce as peopletry out new ideas is part of implementation.Evalu#te.Evaluate the success of the activities in terms of the statedgoals and objectives. How well did the participants actually learn and dowhatever was stated as the objective? Will they put the ideas into practice?Did they perceive, the information and activities as being useful and relevant?What improvements could be made?Formative evaluatin provides information about the effectiveness of anon-going program or activity so that revisions can be made as needed.Summative eyOutilop gives information about the effectiveness of the overallprogram and provides information for making decisions about future programs.The question should not be \"Was this program a success or failure?\" but \"Whatdid this program accomplish?\" and \"What have we learned to guide future staffdevelopment programs?\"More than one type of measure should be used. The short \"reaction sheet\"filled out at the end of a workshop or meeting that typically serves asevaluation seldom gives enough information. Sometimes it is inappropriate, aswhen a group has been working hard to develop a group feeling of support,cooperation, and understanding. Observations during the activity can tellmuch about skill level, interest, improvement, and the general effectiveness of the activity. Informal diecussions with a small group or with individualswill often reveal the need for easily made corrections. 111-15 Follow-up evaluations can determine if the knowledge or sk iIi was actually put into practice, and if people's perceptions of usefulness changed or stayed the same. Good evaluation is difficult, and we would recommend that someone with special skills be asked to help. Many school districts have evaluation experts who can make this step easier and better. Further information on evaluation in in Section IX. Resort.Report the process that was used, what was done, and the results and reactions to those people who should know and who are interested. Immediate feedback to staff developers may help them in their preparations for future training. Certainly a written report should be prepared for the administration, but teachers and other school personnel, parents, and the community at large are also interested and have a right to know. There is no need to wait until a staff development program is over to report on it. Parents often have no idea what teachers do on minimal days Caen their children are sent home early, or when school closes for a \"teacher's meeting.\" Build understanding and support by letting them know. Staff development activities often make good newspaper, newsletter, or TV stories or spots. Use them as an opportunity to improve school-family relations, especially if the inservice topic is \"Improving School-Family Relations Through Better Communication.\"A final word of caution. Even though these sections on adult learning, staff development, and planning may seem lengthy, we have tried to summarize and explain as briefly as possible current best thinking and practices.Much more information and more detailed directions can be found in the resource . listings.We would encourage anyone responsible for staff development to study those and other resources.39111-16 REFERENCES Becker, H.

Section IVGuides for Bffective Same-School relations and Communications Even though most of us are a little unsure about exactly, whatschool-family relations and communications mean, we have a general concept.Both parents and educators placed it high on the list of things theyconsidered most likely to have a go-d effect on the education students receive(Gallup, 1980).As AEL has approached its work in school-family relations, we have lookedat \"relations\" in terms of the copnections between schools and families, whenpeople or groups are mutually or reciprocally interested in a common matter.In the same wag, we have looked at the term \"communications\" as implying amutual effort to understand and share.Some parents will, on their own, initiate and maintain a high level ofcommunication and involvement with the school. Indeed, a few will keep thatlevel so high that it becomes counter-productive for all concerned--too much of a good thing! But in most instances, parents depend on teachers andschools to initiate communication, and that is what this Resource Notebook focuses on.Do ramember, though, that the communication we are after involvesboth parties communicating about their common concernthe child. Wheneverpossible, communications to the home should invite response.\"For further information call\"If,you have any questions, .\"I will be available between 3 and 4 in the afternoon.If you want to talk with we, cant\"If you have any suggestions or questions, write in thespace below and send them back to school with your childor drop them in the mail. We want your ideas.\" Put the school's name, telephone number, street address, and mailing address on formal communications, especially those that ask for a respon*e. At the beginning of each year, send home a card with that information ow it,' plus names parents should know--the principal, school secretary, and others as appropriate to the grade level. Suggest that the information be posted with their \"most frequently called\" numbers, or on the refrigerator. Consider \"stick-on\" labels to be attached to the telephone right under emergency numbers, especially if you have an absentee policy that encourages parents to call in.If that is done, someone should be there early in the day to answer the phone, or an answering and recording device should be hooked up, or both. Nothing is more frustrating to parents than trying to do what they are supposed to (in this case, call in), only to be stymied because of a busy signal or unanswered phone. Many parents leave home early and are unable to call from work.As you communicate with parents and the home, these guides will help. Recognize that schools and homes have shared goals. Respect all parents and communicate that respect. Acknowledge the changes that are taking place in thefamily.Understand the different types of school-family communicationand the advantages and limitations of each. Tailor communications to your listeners and readers. Get expert help if you need it.Recognize that schools and homes have shared goals.Schools and homes share many goals; the most important one is the nuture, development, and education of children. Schools and homes have different, but complementary roles to play in this process. Schools provide educational opportunities for children that most parents cannot; families provide education and development opportunities 'at school cannot. IV-242 Sometimes schools and families get caught up in their own concerns andforget that the child's education is their mutual interest. A teacher maygive up and say \"These parents aren't interested; they just don't care.\"Parents may remember their own less than happy experiences in School andapproach a teacher or principal with leftover--and probably inappropriate --fear or hostility. Before any real progress can be made, teachers mustbelieve that parents have a crucial role in their children's education, andparents and teachers must trust each other. Schoolsadministrators,teachers, specialists, and support personnelmust take the lead in helpingto establish that trust, if it is missing, and must convey to parents in apositive way the school's belief in parents' importance in education.Respect all parents and communicate that respec .Respect is notsomething that parents have to earn from a teacher, principal, or other schoolpersonnel.It is something that is their right as human beings. We do nbthave to agree with their ideas or actions, but we must respect them as people.Respector lack of respect--is communicated in many ways: Tone of voice,word choice,lacial expression, time (How long do we make people wait? Are wetoo busy to bear their concerns?), body language, expectations, recognition asa person, and in many .,ther subtle and not so subtle ways.Schools must deal equally with all families, regardless of race, ethnicbackground, size of family, number of parents in the hove, family income,educational level, rural or urban residence, or their skill in dealing withthe school.Let me share n personal exerience that taught me that lesson well.I once taught in a school where the educational level, income, andsophistication of the parents were as low as the size of families and numberof problems were high. Concerned about one of the children in my class, I IV -34.3 visited the home--to find an unemployed father attempting to care for the six children in a tiny house. His wife--the mother of the childrenhad abandoned them the week before. I left with a better understanding of my pupiland a deeply-felt mixture of respect, admiration,' and humility. Many of our parents have personal, family, work, health, or other problems that we may know nothing about. That some are able to keep going at all is amazing. In smaller, closer communities, we often learned those things through the \"grapevine.\" In a larger, more impersonal society we may have to make a special effort to understand and extend to parents the benefit of any doubts--and encourage them to let us know any special circumstances for the sake of the child.Ackneyledgs ttmetanges that ars tang niece in the family.\"Forget the idealized, romanticized picture of the American family and learn to accept parents as they are\" (Nedler & McAfee, 1979). No need to lament that both parents work away from home--most school people do the same thing! Whether they are single parents, parents in custody battles, out-of-work, with overwhelming personal problems, addicted to television or other things, too wrapped up in their own lives or career to spend much time with anybody else, or the\"ideal family,\" most are genuinely concerned about their children. They may not know how or be able to show that concern in a way that helps the youngster in school, yet the concern is there. As school people, we must seek more effective ways to communicate with this changed--and still changing--American family. d'essch un c advantages and limitations gf each. School-home communications take two major forms: those about the individual child and those of concern to all children. gnd_families school-wide (Gotta & Purnell, 1984).Communications about the TV-4 individual child include reports about the child's academic progress andbehavior, individual attendance and tardiness notices, get-acquainted calls ormessages, formal and informal parent-teacher conferences, work samples,telepho6 calls, and individualized suggestions of what parents can do to help.Scbool-wide communications include handbooks, newsletters, recorded .; messages, lunch menus, discipline codes, field trip permission forms, bulletinboards, and announcements and flyers of all kinds.Parents and schools need both kinds of communication. Individualized messages areusually quite personal, confidential, and can be emotion-laden,dealing as they do with one child. These communications.call for tact,consideration, empathy, and an understanding of the parent-child relationship. For example, in a bbme where relations between child and parent are already strained, asking the parent to \"be sure she does her homework\" may make a bad situation worse.All too often individual messages from school to home or home to school are about problems. Parents and schools need to hear more about the good things that happen!Parents read and like school-wide communications such as newsletters and handbooks (Gotta, 1984). More effective use of these group communications and experimentation with new forms--\"teletips\" (recorded messages for whichpeople call in), radio and television messagesmay increase their value in school-family communications. Telling parents jg sdvapce about any novel school or class activity, reporting successes and concerns, \"profiling\" significant people (including parents and students), alerting parents to deadlines and upcoming events, lunch menus, PTAiPTO events, and many other information and trust building subjects atz appropriate for school-wide communications. Use these communications as honest public relations and TV -5 \"marketing\" techniques. Enthusiasm and a positive outlook are very much in order.Much information that parents receive about school comes from their children and is on the order of \"What did you do today?\" \"Nothing; same old thing.\" School-family communications'can help parents put these reports in better perspective (Rutherford & Edgar, 1979).,LeilarsgsagxlcissA. In all cases, communications should be in clear and understandable language, short, and to the point.Check and double-check written material for spelling, punctuation, sentence structure, and etber mechanics, as well as organization and clarity. In today's climate, you can be sure that your school will be judged by the written material you send out.Avoid technical jargon--\"staffing,\" \"auditory memory,\" \"visual-motor integration\"--and the endless acronyms school people use as shorthand among themselves.Learn to put,those words into plain English, Spanish, or whatever language the parent understands. Be specific enough that the parent knows what you mean. On the other hand, remember that parents are more knowledgeable, sophisticated, and wise than we sometimes give them credit for. The days when the doctor, lawyer, minister, and teacher were the only educated people around are long gone. A parent may not have adegree in education but may work withstatistics, computers, and complex problems in mathematics, psychology, human nature, organization, and management everyday.Don't \"talk down\" to people.Know who you are communicating with and meet them at a language level that establishes communication. Most of us do this automatically unless we are uneasy anddefensive.If it's difficult, practice will help. If you miscommunicate, back up and start overt46IV-6 Find out what types of communications work best with the families andschool you are in and use them. How do you find out? Ask, collect data, useyour judgment and sensitivity. If what you are doing isn't working, dosomething else.Get expert help if vou_need it. Today's families are bombarded withhighly sophisticated, carefully prepared \"media campaigns.\" Many large schooldistricts have experts in public relations, communication, graphics,photography, and other aspects of communicating with the public. If yourdistrict is so blessed, use them! If not, make sure that what you send out isthe best you can \"do; because you're competing with the best.Sometimes school psychologists or social workers have special trainingin human relations and can observe, demonstrate, or coach in needed areas.Since many of the skills needed to communicate with parents are the same asthose needed in other organizations and institutions, see if they have someresident experts they would share. For example, many organizations areteaching their employees bow to listen attentively - -a skill we all need. \"Gallup poll of the public's attitudes toward the public schools.\" (1980)4i Delp Kappkw, 62, 33-48.Gotts, B., & Purnell, R. dilemma of school-homecommunications.\" Charleston, Virginia: childhood anil elementary teachers.

The previous original decerrnt Section Vlopecialy for Administrators and Policy-Makers School board members, superintendents, and principals have always knownthat \"the central office plays a critical role\" in any school changes. \"The coordipation,'leadership, and ciQut it brings to the effort can make thedifferenze between success and failure\" (Mande, 1984). This is as true in staff development to achieve better school-family communications as it is in any other aspect of education.Now, we're not suggesting that superintendents and board members have to attend a series of inservice workshops on school-family communications- - although we hope that you would find them interesting and valuable--and we know that your presence at elms one would make them more important to everyone who does attend!Rather, this section is a salute to administrators and policy-makers to whom school personnel and parents look for \"coordination, leadership, and clout.\"Your support will do much to help teachers, specialists, and supportstaft.achieve better school-family relations for better education. Building priucipais, who help set the tone and climate for school operations including relations with'parents, will find many suggestions that apply to them as well as to teachers.The vagueness and highly political nature of some \" parent involvement\" in the last two decades has made many school board and administrators uneasy, even as they know that lack of parent involvement and support is a warning sign that a school may be in trouble (Diande, 1984).But parents don't want to take over policy-me:ing and admivistration. John Goodlad (1984) summarized the current state of affairs:Polls and surveys show that [parents] would like a greater say inthe affairs of their schools. But this does not mean that parentswant to take over the schools. Some do, but most don't. Rather,they want to be kept informed in as clear a fashion as possible,especially about their children's progress and welfare. Further,they want the decisions and those who make them to be visible. Theywould prefer to leave the running of the school to the Erincipal,and the classrooms to the teachers and, if possible, tobold them accountable (p. 273).So what can and should district policy-makers and administrators do? The Southwest Educational Development Laboratory (SEDL), based on extensive surveys of administrators, policy-makers, parents, and teache s in the southwest region of the United States, has these recommendatio s:First, in addition to providing preservice and inservice trainingfor teachers, principals and other school administrators should beincluded in parent involvement training activities as they often setthe rules and norms in schools. If they are not aware of thebenefits of parent involvement and/or are not skilled in workingwith parents, school administrators may set norms which discourageteachers from using the parent involvement skills and knowledge theyhave acquired.Second, in order to encourage school district staff at all levels todevelop better relations with parents, district policies should bewritten so that they clearly specify this as a desired goal.Responses from the superintendents' and school board presidents'surveys indicate that the existence of written policies encouragingparent involvement is related to increased levels of a variety ofparent activities in the schools.Third, if districts are designing a parent involvement program, theyshould again view the various types of parent involvement as adevelopmental sequence, both from the teachers' and the parents'point of view. Increasing parent involvement in the role ofaudience [attending school events, receiving and acting on messages]requires comparatively less effort and skill on the part of bothteachers and parents than would parent involvement as home tutors,decision makers, advocates or co-learners. Therefore, the skilllevels and estimates of available time for each should be the focusof program efforts (Stallworth & Williams, 1983, pp. 17-18). Further information on the various roles parents can play in relation to schools and on the research results is available from SEDL. V-250 Although imprqving school-family relations and communications does not have the glamour of \"training for high-tech,\" or \"excellence,\" it is nevertheless basic to establishing and maintaining good schools.\"Children whose parents encourage and support schooling have an added advantage in school\" (Epstein, 1984). Parents who encourage and support schooling give teachers, administrators, and school-board members an added advantage in educating those children. And that is what this Resource Notebook is about. Many schools and districts periodically survey parenti and the community to determine their perceptions of what the4chool is doing and if improvement is needed in any area. Typically, a questionnaire is sent home or mailed. AEL has developed a short, personalized telephone interview that has been highly successful in getting detailed information and reactions that often don't show up on a questionnaire answer--if, indeed, the questionnaire is returned.People are responsive (over 95 percent of those called agreed to participate), the sample is thus accurate, and the entire procedure is effective and efficient. The interview questions are in Appendix C. Complete directions for sampling, administering, and coding are available from AEL (Gotta fi Sattes, 1982). If a more extensive needs assessment is desired, a systeMatic process is described in Appendix 1), with a complete manual available from AEL.The school-family relations and communications we focus on should fit into and complement almost any school program, because they are based upon AEL's long experience with schools, families, and children in the Appalachian Region, and upon recent research in school-family relations.We have designed this Resource Notebook around what schoole and parents actually do and what they say works, plus what school personnel said they would like to have more training in. V- 3 In addition, we have focused on:I.. School-home communications that busy teachers and principals cando; many are things people already do, but unsystematically andperhaps uncertainly. 2.Low-cost but effective techniques. 3.Techniques that complement other proven approaches, or at leastdon't conflict with them. For example, parents should feel welcometo call or come to the school to -elk with the teacher, but theyshould not expect to interrupt class or even class preparation. Wesuggest that'parents be given a specific procedure for getting intouch with the teacher by telephone or in person. 4.A wide variety of communication strategies, so that schoolpersonnel can choose those that best fit their situation.Making sure that the form and tone of the communications inviterand encourages a mutual concern for the welfare of childrenand schools.Many of these forms of communication require board and administrative approval and support; some do not. Some require money; some do not. Some are more effective in elementary schools, some in secondary.Based on research done at ANL (Gotta, 1983), we make a case for a different model of parent communication and involvement at the secondary level than at elementary. Such a distinction may prove useful to local districts as they study and perhaps modify policies and practices in local schools. The differences are shown is the chart on the following page.

Stiearlywarning/communication system should be kept in place at both elementary andsecondary levels to notify parents at the earliest possible time of their needto step in to help regarding academic, social, or behavioral problems. Promptnotification of student absence from school, for example, is valued by parentsat both levels (Gotta, 1983). v-55 3 In addition,wanted and needed Therewe have identified topics that parents and schools said they to know about regardless of age or grade.

Communicating Tbrougb S he Eome-Scbool Handbook:Guidelines for PrincipalsEdward E. Gotts Many elementary principals rely on handbooks as a means of communicatingabout their schools to parents, school perscnnel, and the broader community.The individual principal typically assembles and writes the handbook for usein a particular school and neighborhood setting. The handbook may includepersonal statements reflecting the principal's own views on childrearing andschooling and on ways that home and school can work together to accomplishtheir shared educational mission.-AEL's study of the handbook as a communication device supports thepreceding picture. Further, the study underscores the thoroughly personal andinformal process by which the principal prepares or \"borrows\" a handbook andthen periodically modifies it in response to changing local circumstances.Analogously to the formation of pearls, moreover, our findings make us suspectthatocertein parts of any given handbook are added layer upon layer as aprotective shield whose purpose is to smoothe over some underlying source ofirritation or to guard against potential conflict.In view of the informal process just identified, we were not whollysurprised to find no source of guidelines or standards to assist the principalwho desires to prepare or revise a handbook. Yet our study revealed thehandbook is such an important technique that its development should not beshaped solely by chance circumstances or the personal inclinations of thewriter.Rather, the principal can best prepare a handbook that meets itsintended communication objectives by combining local and personal perspectiveswith a more comprehensive and systematic appioach. The remainder of thisbrief presentation summarizes useful guidelines that we have uncovered in ourwork.These guidelines cover three issues confronting the handbook's would-beauthor:(1) presenting contents within the context of the handbook'sorganization, (2) the process of preparation, and (3) using the handbookeffectively.Ortanisation and ContentsContents should be presented clearly and concisely, using an informativeconversational tone. This can be achieved by imagining, while reading Aloud,that an individual parent or anew staff member is listening to thepresentation.Educational jargon should be used sparingly. The principalshould be guided'by imagination into a natural and comfortable style ofexpression that reflects his or her personal approach to school administrationand to school-community relations. Fidelity to both this inner vision and itsoutward expression are essential, since the handbook will set the tune for allthat is to follow. That is to say, the \"correct\" style is one which createsin the reader an accurate expectation of how the principal and the school willcome across during subsequent contacts throughout the year. Accordingly,idealism must be tempered with realism.Organization should commence with the more general and perenniallyused content.noes of the following should contribuie to the handbook'susefulness: tal=le of contents; numberedpage In\\i he original document W2&blank their assignments; named parents who serve in leadership roles; the year'scalendar, including PTA/PTO meetings; a sample daily/weekly schedule, statement the school's philosophy, curricular approach, anddistinctive characteristics; a concif: reference list of school policies, withmention ofwhere more complete discussion can be located; and special programs,axes, andactivities of the local school system.INext, more specialized and limited topics should be presented.Brieftreatments of the following areas are known to be helpful: attendance policyand notification of absence or tardiness; the grading and reporting system,with particular mention of \"interii\" reports, promotion/retention policy, andclassification or streaming or tracking of students; transfer procedures; freetextbooks and supply fees; homework expectations; student health andimmunization student dress and appearance; standards of conduct anddiscipline code; supplemental pr optional instruction; school lunch andnutrition program; transportation, transit to and from school, excuse notes,and early departures; birthday parties, open house, and other specialoccasions; - safety, including dangerous or disruptive materials found instudents' possession; administering prescribed medications; exceptionalchildren in regular classrooms; use of the school telephone; emergencies;communications procedures regarding student difficulties or problems; andsafety patrol and other activities involving designated groups of students,including annual trips and outings for selected grade levels. Finally, operation of the,home-school partnership should be considered interms of: therespective responsibilities of school and h-ne; bowcommunications are to be initiated, conducted, and encouraged; availability ofstaff for conferences; classroom visitation, including restrictions onvisitation for designated persons--e.g., restrictions resulting from childcustody decisions; desired parental role in homework; special guidance theschool is prepared to offer parents;suggestions for helping the child do wellin school; assurance that potentially conflicting interests of Nome and schoolwill be handled constructively and for the child's benefit; parent-teacherorganizations and activities; parents as volunteers; and other opportunitiesopen to parents who are willing to be involved more extensively. The foregoing comments on contents and style will enable the principal toachieve a morecomprehensive and systematic approach, without losing local andpersonal perspecti;ms. Yet to assuregreater pre'ision of local perspective,the process can be enhanced by first bolding discussions with faculty onseveral of the, content areas. Using an in-service workshop format, facultycan sharpenthe effort's focus by indicating where they stand on the issues;suggesting training they desire to prepare them for implementation; andexploring problems which will requiresensitive treatment. Once the principal's- and faculty's views and concerns are expressed, asmall, randomly selected sample of parents can be interviewed by PTA/PTOleaders or other volunteers to determine their personal experiences anddesires relative to home-school communications. The interviewquestions canparticularly probe into areas that will be most conducive to making sounddecisions about the handbook's design and emphasis. V-10+.51 AEL has conducted a small -scale study of handbook preparation using thissuggested process. The process was effective in the sense of delivering tothe principal, before a handbook's revision was commenced, (a) clarificationof the communication challenges posed by the parents' and faculty's needs andreadiness and (b) guidance regarding priority areal for inclusion. The latterof these results allowed the principal to use priorities also to excludecertain contents which seemed less vital at the time within that neighborhoodschool's immediate community--thereby making the size of the handbook and itsrevision more manageable. Through this process of study we have also learnedabout some particularly helpful contents to include on \"operation of thehome-school partnership.\" We are prepared in 1984 to share these results withKanawha County principals.The simple-to-use school \"self-study\" techniques that AEL has developedrender the task well within reach for the average principal who is unaccustomedto conducting formal research. Rigaly understood, the purpose of the studyprocess is to provide quality information in support of the principal's decisionmaking about (a) what to write and (b) how to focus the effort in order to meetidentified needs. The principal who is already intimately acquainted withfaculty and parent views on these matters can bypass the data gathering stageand turn at once to summarizing on paper what is known. These summaries willthen guide the handbook preparation process. Usimst The Handbook EffectivelyTime is the essence of effective handbook usage. The most opportune timefor distribution is at the very beginning of the school year. To accomplishthis result, all data gathering and summarization should be completed thepreceding spring. Armed with this preparation, the principal can completewriting and/or revision as a part of the administrative post-school yearwrap-up in June. That leaves the summer for rereading and minor touch up.Typing and duplication can be completed by the school office as a part of thefall pre-term start up.If this planned timeline looks firm by the end of the present schoolyear, parents can be alerted in advance to anticipate the new handbook'savailability the following fall. Making such a public commitment will helpinsure that the necessary priority and effort will be assigned to get the jobdone on schedule.There are options for selecting the occasion and means of distribution.The handbook may be passed out at the year's first PTA//PTO meeting, withfollow-up for all parents who could not attend. The PTA/PTO might insteadperform a deliberate person-to-person distribution. Room mothers might, withthe help of enlisted volunteers, do the same thing, or the fall term mightfeature a \"know your school\" open house. This last option is not as workable,because an open house in early fall requires more effort and momentum than cannormally be mustered so soon after school's opening. Alternatively, childrenmight carry home an attention-catching notice announcing that the handbook caneither (a) be picked up at school by the parent, or (b) upon presentation atschool of a signed tear-off request, to be carried home by the child.Thepoint is to make sure that parents receive it in a state of heightenedexpectancy. v-11 If the next scheduled PTA/PTO meeting features an interesting discussionof the handbook (with announced emphasis on selected topics), familiarization,study, and use will be encouraged. Thereafter, throughout the school year, ifstaff will respond to parent inquiries by turning to the handbook andreviewing with parents the relevant sections--even when they perfectly wellknow the answers --they will by example encourage parents to seek answers thereto their questions.Toward the end of the school year, the principal may wish to discuss witha small sample of parents and teachers what the handbook has meant that yearto their partnership with one another in supporting the child's progress inschool.The questions'for this can be borrowed directly from among thosealready used during the handbook planning phase a year earlier. Typicalresponses, with personal identifying information omitted, can then besummarized on a single sheet to be bound into the front of the handbook whenit is next duplicated. Thebeet can be titled in some appealing manner. Forexample: \"What Parents and Teachers are Saying about this Handbook!\" AELlitn4y_kagliaThe preceding suggestion also provides a fitting way to close this briefset of handbook guidelines. Here are some of the things being said about ahandbook that was prepared in the manner described above:Including the schedule \"supports informed participation.\"It \"helps parents who can't come to school.\"Parents used it to \"explain more about school to my child.\"It \"makes parents feel more comfortabl,- 'bout visitingthe school.\"It \"encourages school visitation and conferences.\"It contained \"all the information we needed to know.\"It \"strengthens my relationship with the school.\"It helped me \"deal my child's academic problems.\" COMMUNICATING TNIOUGH NIMSLITTUS IN =GNAW SCHOOLS Edward S. Cotts FIn an AEL study of school -hone communications, perhaps the mostinteresting finding is that newsletters may well be the most effectivegeneral method for informing .parents at the secondary level. Of the commoncommunications practices, available to secondary schools, newslettersaccounted for more contacts than did any other method. When assessed bymeans of parents' own free recall or experiences, slightly over eightypercent of all parents interviewed mentioned them as communications theyhad received.Attitudes toward the newsletters were not requested directly;instead they were inferred from parents' spontaneous remarks. In suchremarks, parents favorably mentioned newsletters sixty-five percent of thetime, neutrally thirty-three percent, and negatively only two percent.Compared with their spontaneous comments about other types ofcommunications, no other types received so large a proportion of favorableand so small a proportion of unfavorable reactions.Finally, we assessed from the content of their spontaneous remarkswhether parents actually read the newsletters they received. This methodof inquiry was used to avoid biasing parents in the direction ofexaggerating their use of the newsletter. Over seventy percent of allparents, who recalled receiving newsletters, appeared to have read them.If more casual reading is counted, the number rises to nearly ninetypercent.Thus, of those who discussed their use of the newsletters, onlyten percent appeared not to have read them. Moreover parents commentedreadily on ways that they had acted on the information provided.In summary, a large majority of parents mentioned newletters astheir most frequent means for receiving information about secondaryschools.They appreciated being informed in this way. More importantly,by a wide margin parents read and acted on information provided. Thiscommunications success, further, was achieved through the use ofnewsletters that often were prepared hurriedly and whose quality might, ifrated objectively. be graded as average to good. Thus, even better resultsmight reasonably be expected as school personnel were to stress thefollowing guidelines for making newsletters communicate more effectively. Guidelines for NewslettersMany of the guidelines presented here nay seem to be based on commonsense and certainly would be supported by sound journalistic thinking. Theguidelines resulted, however, neither from a common sense approach nor froma handbook of journalism. Rather, these have been extracted largely fromthe spontaneous remarks of the several hundred parents who participated inthe AEL interviews about school-home communications. V- 130.0 To be effective, newsletters should be:informative of what is happening at theschoolatimely, to let parents anticipate,schedule, provide transportation, attend,etc.*brief and to the point, with the main ideasbeing presented at the beginning of eacharticle or sectionclean and uncluttered, with headings tomake it easy to find particular topicssomewhat informal and personal rather thanstilted and formallivened up with simple graphics thatcapture attention, summarize ideas, remind,redirect, convey attitudes, etc.Newsletter content should emphasize: recent accomplishments(academic, athletic, artistic, school appearance, service, attendance);upcoming events, schedule changes, conference times; scholarshipapplication information; trips or travel opportunities; human interestitems (but not gossip) featuring students, parent volunteers or leaders,staff; program emphases and strengths of the curriculum; transportationarrangements; activities scheduled for parents, students, and communities.A brief but comprehensive calendar on the cover page should becrossreferenced to fuller treatments on the particular numbered pages ofthe newsletters,At the start of the school yesr or the new term, when classes andstaff assignments change, parents wish to learn the names of teachers,counselors, and office staff; to receive advance schedules of all athleticand other extracurricular events; and to be informed about the school'sgoals, special projects, discipline and dress codes, etc.Other guidelines for style suggest that humor should be usedsparingly.If it is to be used, it should be reviewed in advance to assurethat it is indeed humorous to most readers and offensive to none. Thewriter must be sensitive about the tone. It should be forthright ratherthan subtle; objective and positive at the same time; stimulating andtending toward mild enthusiasm; and revealing of a sincere desire tocommunicate and inform. Within this frame of references, there is room forpersonal messages and viewpoints. The tone of the newsletters will oftenbe more apparent to the ear than to the eye, so copy should be,evaluatedfor tone by reading it aloud.Newsletters, we find, are read by students as well as parents. Thusthe writer and editor will do well to consider this dual audience. For thesame reason, it may be desirable to have both student and parent *Most negative remarks about newsletters were from parents whoclaimed they had received information too late! V-I4 representatives involved in the planning and review of the newslettercontents.We have witnessed schools where both parents and students wereactive not only in this way but also as active contributors of writtenmaterial for the newsletter. These kinds of arrangements, while far lesscommon, were found to add much to the quality of the newsletters. Nomatter who contributes, the newsletters must have an editor who makes finaldecisions about content and style. Usually this will be one of the school'sadministrators or a mature faculty member. A journalism advisor maysometimes be a natural for this cssignment. Interestingly, one of the mostambitious and successful newsletter editors we have encountered was thehead of a science department.Finally, the newsletter should set the scene for all other school-homecommunications. In this sense, it must be reliable and predictable. Itshould invite neither more nor less parent and community involvement thanthe school is ready to handle. Staff, parents, and students, thus, willreceive a unified message about the school's intended practices ofcommunication.

L., Jr. (1983)Executive summary of thefinal report:A.survev of school administrators and and Specialists It is one thing to know that school personnel need more training in school-family relations, and that changes in staff development are being recommended.It is quite another to pull all the ideas together and implement them in actual inservice training. In this section we have chosen a few high priority goals and topics related to school-family communications to show different ways sound staff development principles can be used to help develop an on-going, flexible inservice program.Our intent is to provide a non-prescriptive model that those responsible for staff development can use \"as is,\" learn from, and then go on to use the principles and techniques in developing their own staff training. To accomplish this goal, we have developed six inservice training sessions, some of which could be divided into twv shorter sessions. They are: 1.School-Family Relations: What We Know 2.School-Family Communications: In Plain Words 3.Listen With Your Mind and Heart 4.School-Family Communications: The Spoken Word 5.School-Family Communications: The Written Word and Other Symbols 6.School-Family Communications: Academic Guidance Sheets 7.Parent-Teacher ConferencesThe first five are designed to be used in sequence. In addition, we have compiled sources and made suggestions for staff developers on how to plan an inservice training session on parent-teacher conferences, so they have an opportunity to practice the principles they have learned.We have made no attempt to include all possible areas related to VI-I6b school-family communications. For example, we have included little or nothingon recruiting and using parent volunteers in schools, teaching parents how tobe more effective teachers of their own children, recruiting parents tosupport general school activities, to be community representatives, or advocates.Ail these efforts are quite appropriate.However, we have chosen to focus on things that busy teachers and principals can do. Indeed, many school people are already doing them, but sometimes unsystematically. We also looked for techniques that art low in cost.They complement, or at least don't conflict with current best thinkingabout good instructional practices for children. For example, we encourageteachers to tell parents the time and place they will be available for personal discussions or telephone calls. This helps avoid the Lime-consumingpractice of parents expecting to drop by to see the teacher.We have suggested a wide variety of teaching methods, ranging frominterdependent group learning to self-instruction, but we have avoided special audio-visual materials which may or may not be available. We haveincorporated several well-researched instructional practices, such as:building upon information and experience learners alreadyhave,actively involving learners, demonstrating,providing for practice, coaching,using a variety of instructional techniques, andplanning for transfer and follow-up.Each of the training sessions is set up in similar fashion. There are: instructions to the leader, objectives for the participants, materials needed VI-2 to carry out the activity, procedures to follow, and follow-up/evaluation.In the procedures, there are:Materials the leader can read or paraphrase to give information,directions, and guidance to' participants. These \"directinstructions\" or information appear in regular typeface. .Tips and guidance for the leader. These are indicated by bold-face type.Handouts to use during the training, with a copy which can beused for duplication purposes in Appendix E.Throughout, we encourage staff development specialists to adapt to theparticipants' special needs and situations. For example, there is muchvariation in how well participants in inservice training know each other. Ifparticipants don't know each other, a \"get-acquainted\" activity should be usedat the beginning of each session. If participants already know each other,they might become a more cohesive working group by spending a few minutessharing something related to the topic. For example, they might share theirmost heart-warming encounter with a parent, or the funniest, or the mosttroublesome.Before attempting to use any of these activities, take time to study themthoroughly so you understand the procedures and the reasons those procedureswere used.Good Luck! V1-36 Sehool-Family What We Know To the Leader:In working with-a group of people, leaders are often faced with the taskof having people learn some basic background information. In many cases, theyneed this basic information at the first meeting so they have a common basisfor proceeding., Often, there is not lead time to distribute reading materialto people prior to the meeting. Just as often, they won't have read itanyway!The usual way to solve this problem is to have a lecture, perhapswith some audiovisual aids to make points clear and liven up the presentation. .In this introductory session, we are going to use another method of helping agroup learn essential facts and concepts. Called \"Jigsaw,\" it has been .adapted from methods designed to encourage interdependence, cooperation, andresponsibility in schnol students. We are using it to introduce some keyideas about parent involvement, and school-home relations, to set the stagefor the \"what and how\" staff development sessions that follow. However, youcan use the technique for any factual, narrative material that you wish topresent.For adult learners, it may be that the best thing about it is thatit requires them to be active and lets them put their own good teaching skillsinto practice. Also, since the technique is not widely used, the :noveltyshould spark people's interest. Who knows, perhaps they may even try it intheir ow classrooms). Because people will finish reading and studying atdifferent times, have additional related materials available for them to goto.We have prepared four reeding\u00b0 on school-home relations, four \"expertsheets,\" and a quiz, so that you may use them \"as is\" if you wish. They arelabeled Handouts VI-1 through VI-5, but because of their length do not appearsepartely in the Appendix. However, you may also prepare your own material,add locally pertinent materials, or a topic that local assessment shows isneeded.The four subjects we have prepared are:Reading One:Why Parent Involvement? (Handout VI-I) Reading Two: Perceptions of Modern Dilemma of School-Home Communications(Handout VI-3) Four:Single Parents and the Schools (Handout V1-4) \"Expert Sheets\"--part of the Jigsaw method--have also been prepared for andattached to each reading. The concluding \"quiz\" is Handout VI-5. How to Use Jigsaw IIThe directious for Jigsaw II have been adapted for adult'learners intypical staff development sessions from an article by Robert Slavin of theJohns Hopkins Team Learning Project (1978). Jigsaw IIJigsaw is a technique developed by Elliot Aronson (1978) and hisassociates at the University of Texas and the University of California atSanta Cruz.It is a relatively simple technique, designed to increaseparticipants' sense of responsibility for their learning by making each one an\"expert\" on one part of an instructional unit, and then having each studentteach the part on which he is an \"expert\" to the others on his team. JigsawII is based on Aronson's original Jigsaw concept, but has many differentfeatures.For more information on Original Jigsaw, see The Jigsaw Classroom byElliot Aronson, 1978. Beverly Hills, California: Sage Publications. OVERVIEWJigsaw II can be used whenever the material to be studied is in narrative-.It is more appropriate in areal; in which concepts rather then rotea.amory is the goal. The basic \"raw material\" for Jigsaw II should be achapter, report, or similar narrative or descriptive material.In Jigsaw II, participants work in heterogeneous teams. They areassigned chapters or other units to read, and are given \"expert sheets\" whichcontain different topics for each team member to focus on as he or she reads.When everyone has finished reading, participants from different teams who hadthe same topics meet to discuss their topics in an \"expert group.\" The\"experts\" then return to their teams and take turns teaching their teammatesabout their topics. Finally, all of the participants take a quiz that coversall of the topics. The key to Jigsaw is interdependence - -every participantdepends on his or her teammates to provide the information they need to know. PREPARING TO USE JIGSAW IITo make your materials, follow these steps: 1.Find several-short chapters, reports, or other short unitsthat each cover a similar amount of material. If you planto have participants read in the training session, thesections should not require more than a half hour to read;if you plan tr, assign the reading for outside work, theycan be longer 2.Make an \"expert sheet\" for each unit. An expert sheet tellsparticipants what they should concentrate on while theyread, and tells them which expert group they will work with.It consists of topics that are central to the chapter. Asmuch as possible, the topics should cover issues that appearthroughout tilt readings, so that recurrent themes andsignificant ideas are reinforced. Exarlpin of \"expert sheets\"are attached to the back of each reading in the set we haveprepared. VI-6 3.Make a quiz for each unit. The quiz should consist ofapproximately eight questions, two for each topic. Thequestions should require considerable understanding, becausethe participants will have had plenty of time.to discusstheir topics in-depth, and easy questions would fail tochallenge those who had done a good job in preparation.However, the questions should not 'tie obscure.All participants must answer all questions. The quiz should take no motethan ten minutes. Time AllocationTime allowed for Jigsaw II depends on how long it takes participants toread the material and how much time you wish to, set aside for the Jigsawunits.The sequence of activities and approximate times required arepresented below; you may shorten or lengthen the suggested times to fit yourschedule and the time needed for your particular materials.Sequence of Jigsaw activities (Times vary with length of material): 1.Pass out expert sheets and readings or assign topicsif everyone is reading the same material (about 5 minutes).2.Learners read material (about 20 to 30 minutes).3.Learners meet in expert groups (about 15 minutes).4.Learners return to report to their teams (about 20 minutes).5.Quiz (about 10 minutes).Total time: .70-80 minutes INTRODUCING JIGSAW II TO YOUR CLASSBefore you begin to dse Jigsaw II you will need to have ready thefollowing materials: 1.Participant copies of the reading units you plan to use(chapter, report, etc.).2.An \"expert pheet\" for each student. Step 1:Introduce Jigsaw II You will need:Copies of the reading material for each participant.An \"expert sheet\" for each participant. .Introduce the Idea of Jigsaw IITo explain Jigsaw II to the participants, you might say the following:\"We are going to be using a new way of learning calledJigsaw.In Jigsaw, you will work in learning teams tostudy reading material. Each of you will have a specialtopic to learn about. After you have read the material,you will discuss your topic with members of other teams,and then you will return to your team as an expert toteach your teammates about your topic.Finally, every-one will be quizzed on all of the topics. The topicsare like the pieces of a puzzle--each expert will beworking to fit his or her piece in so that the wholeteam can do well on the quiz.\" 2.Inform Students of Their Team Assignments\"Now I will tell you which team you will be on.When I read your name, find your teammates and sitnext to them.\" (Can name group, if you wish.)Read the names of the members of each team and designate a place for themto assemble.Participants can move chairs together to face each other or move to tables. 3.Pass out Reading.MIterial and Expert SheeteDistribute the reading material and expert sheets to each student. Then continue as follows: \"As I mentioned before, the idea behind Jigsaw isthat each person becomes an expert on a particulartopic and then teaches it to his or her teammates.The first step in this process is to read thematerial, look in particular for information mentioned on the expert sheets.\" Step 2:Introducing Expert Groups You will need: Your reading materials 1.Finish ReadingLet the students finish their reading. Ask those who finish early to goback over the material to be sure they understand it. 2.Introduce Expert GroupsAs soon as almost all students have finished reading, introduce expertgroups as follows: VI -87 \"Now you will all have a chance to'discuss your topics withothers who have the same topic. In a moment, I will askeveryone who has Reading 1 to get together, everyone wino has tReading 2 to get together, and so on. In these expert groupsyou will be able to talk about your topic to decide what themost important things are about it. You should share yourinformation so that others will share theirs. I will appointa leader for each expert group. The leader's job is to makesure that the expert group does its job well by trying to getevery student in the expert group to help add ideas. Foldyour arms across your chest if you understand. Check for understanding. Zxpiain further if needed.Point out a place for each expert group to assemble. If there are morethan seven participants in one group, break the group into two. Appoint aleader for each group or let each group select a leader. When participantsace in their expert groups, have them start discussing their topics.Entourage them to try to anticipate what may be on the quiz, and recommendthat they make lists of what they think are important answers to the questionsasked in the topics. Work with each expert group, one at a time, to help themstructure their teak and use the time effectively. You may wish to give theexpert groups special hints, so that they will have truly unique informationto bring back to their teams. Step 3:Tess Reports and Quiz You will need:Your reading materials.A copy of the quiz for each student. 1.Team ReportsHave participants return to their teams and report on what they learnedin their expert groups. Again, participants should emphasize the main pointsand anticipate what might be on the quiz in preparing their teammates. If youwish, you may have a discussion of the material following the team reports.If you do, try to draw on the \"experts\" in the discussion to emphasise theirspecial ikills and knowledge. 2.QuizFifteen minutes before the end of the period, have participants take thequiz.

Handout VI -1 Reading One:Why Parent Involvement? Note:The \"expert sheet\" for this reading is at the end.The references are in Appendix A, Selected Resourceson Parent Involvement. The Appalachia Educational Laboratory recently compiled and synthesizedresearch about parent involvement and schools. This summary makes a strongcase for systematic parent involvement. I.Parent involvement in schools can make a major difference to childrenand schools.Research has shown parent involvement 1979.)Additional benefits to schools include: D.Increased community support for schools E.Increased resources: human, financial, and material II.Parents want to be involved; they feel education is important andthey want to stay informed of their child's progress in school(Etheridge, Collins, fa Coats, 1979; 1983;Hubbell, 1979; Valentin b Alston, 1978). III.Schools need to be flexible in defining participation. There aremany ways that parents can be involved; not everything is appropriatefor every parent. Most parents are interested in things whichaffect their own child. Consequently, school governance - -oradvisory board participation--would probably attract a small numberof parents (Alden, 1979; Lightfoot, 1978). Involvement may mean little direct participation, such as receivingcommunication from school or teacher, coming to the school build-ing only when necessary, or being in the audience at schoolprograms.Parents may also be very active, involved as tutors,volunteer typists, lunchroom monitors, etc. Membership in thePTA, Boosters, or special fund-raising group for facility im-provement is yet another type of participation. \"Parents-as-teachers\"is a popular concept, especially in preschool and early elementaryyears, meaning direct involvement in the teaching-learning process,usually in the home environment. IV.Schools need to take the initiative in establishing vehicles ofcommunication, and in inviting participation and involvement.When teachers make more frequent contact with parents, parentstend to make more frequent contact with teachers. Implementation VI-1275 of communication between the scl,col and family is associated withincreases in the number of 1978; Mager, 1980;Parker & McCoy, 1977). Schools have access to the information parents are most interestedin (academic progress, behavioral difficulty, etc.) and should bethe ones to routinely keep parents informed.Personal contact is the most effective method of reaching people(Ingram, 1972). V.Because the percentage of voters who are parents of school-agestudents is declining (projected to be less than 20 percent by1985),involvement needs to extend to the community at large. A.Voters who receive some form of communication fromschools are more likely to vote and to vote favorablyon school-related issues (Carter reported in Ingram,1978). B.Hubbell (1979) found that two of three adults have pacontact with public schools but want to be informed ofthings like curriculum, budget, etc.Given the two Statements A and B above, it is not surprisingthat public schools have been faced with decreasing communitysupport and public confidence. There are many ways to involvethe non-parent sector, such as:increased use of community experts and resources,senior citizen involvement (Note: By 1990, there will bemore people 55 years and older than there are students ingrades K-12.),use of mass media,newsletter to community members, andcommunity education/recreation (Satter, 1984). What are some of the reasons that working with families and the homemakesuch a difference in children's achievement in school? Ira Gordon(1978) analyzed some of the home and family factors that influence children'slearning.His analysis follows. VI -13P-1e o The first assumption that people hold is that the behavior of parents andother family members within the family influences child learning. Theevidence for this is fairly widespread. It rests on longitudinal studies inEngland, international surveys of educational achievement, and a variety ofsociological 4nd psychological studies within the United States. Inparticular, there seem to be three sets of family factors which have beenfound to be associated with intellectual behavior and personality development(Gordon, 1969). All of these, today, may seem somewhat obvious, but they werenot necessarily obvious in the early and mid-1960's when those of usattempting to institute new programs of parent involvement ran into the cynicsand sceptics.The first set are itemArApLeiessfrs. These are the clearest indicatorsfrom sociology, but in terms of educational program development, are the leastsusceptible to change. These are such variables as crowded homes, familyorganization, family income, ethnic background, quality of housing and socialclass membership.If we turn to process variablesthat is, the behavior of members towardeach other--then we have two additional sets, one cognitive, and the otheremotional.The cognitive set consists of such items as the amount of academicguidance families provide for their children; the thought level and style inthe home; the language level and style in the home; the use of theneighborhood and community as an educational resource, and the planning forsuch use; the perception of the parents that they are indeed teachers of theirchildren, and their actual modes of direct instruction of their children; theeducational aspirations they hold for them; the existence and use of externalresources, such as day-care centers, nurseries, kindergartens; theintellectuality and reading press within the home, that is, not only theexistence of books and magazines and newspapers, but the modeling of their usefor the child; and the amount of and type of verbal interaction, not onlyamong family members, but more particularly between adults, and infants, andyoung children. All homes are obviously verbal. The key element seems to bethe interaction of adult and child in the language domain.The emotional factors are represented by such items as whether or not asingle adult is consistent in the management procedures used with the child,as well as the expectations held and the communication of these expectations;if there are several adults and older children in the family. whether there isconsistency across these people in the way the young child is handled; theemotional security and self-esteem of the parents; their own belief in howmuch influence they have over their own environment and their own fate;whether or not they are protective of the infant; whether or not they arewilling to devote time to the child. Here I would stress that even in singleparent homes. or where both parents may be working, the ability of the familyto set time aside for the child--a children's hour if you will, rather thanthe cocktail hour--seems to be an important factor. Other variablessuch asthe orderliness and routine of the family, the existence of a pattern of workhabits, and a trusting attitude toward other social agencies - -all seem toinfluence a child's intellectual development (Gordon, 1978). VI-147 7tio More recent research (Williams, 1984) done by the Parent Involvement inEducation Project at the Southwest Educational Development Laboratory hassuggested ways in which schools might help families create home environmentsthat enable their children to succeed in school. Recommendations For Buildim Family StreuRths:School district, building, and/or classroom parent involve-ment efforts need to establish program activities based onthe premise that parents are [just as] important tochildren's academic success as educators. This willnecessitate providing parents with more of a voice in alleducational matters.Parents need to be more fully involved at all levels of theeducational system so that they can: (a) strengthen thecapacity of their families to establish appropriate learningenvironments, (b) provide meaningful home learning experiences,and (c) support/reinforce school learning activities.Parents should be provided with more educational information,more opportunities to share their insights/concerns, and moretraining, as needed, for the roles they can or wish to beinvolved with as a means of strengthening their ability andstatus as partners in the education of their children.Parents must be provided opportunities, through parent involve-ment, to interact with, be informed about, referred to, andlearn how to deal with those agencies, organizations,resources or networks available in their communities. Thisshould enhance their abilities to arrange for and/or care forfamily needs in a more self-sufficient and efficient manner.(Williams, 1984, p. 13) Alden, J.

VI-21 Perceptions of Parents and Educators Note:The \"expert sheet\" for this reading is at the end. Summary of Implications and Recommendations from the results of a surveyof 6,154 parents and educators of elementary school children in Arkansas,Mississippi, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahouia, and Texas. The parent samplewas drawn from parents who were active in parent-teacher associations, sotheir particular viewpoint is represented. Excerpted from a study done by theSouthwest Educa,.ional Development Laboratory, 1984. SUMMARY OF IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM PARENT INVOLVEMENT INEDUCATION STUDYParent involvement overall appears to be an acceptable kind ofparticipation in the educational process according to most parents andeducators.The results show that parents have a high degree of interest forbeing involved and that educators generally consider it useful to have parentsinvolved in education. However, a closer examination of the findings revealsthat educators and parents have distinctly different views about certainaspects of parent involvement. These differences represent barriers which canbe deterrents to the effective involvement of parents and educators aspartners in dealing with educational matters.Educators appear to be more supportive of the traditional ways thatparents have participated in children's education both at home and at school.This includes parents mainly receiving information sent home by the school,supporting or taking part in school activities prepared by school staff, andattempting to help children with their homework. On the other hand, whileparents indicate a strong interest for being involved in these ways, they alsoare interested in participation with school goverance matters, learning moreabout education jointly with educators, and strving as advocates for currenteducational needs, issues,or concerns.The involvement interests of parents appears to extend beyond theboundaries that educators indicate such participation would be most useful.It seems that parents and educators have dissimilar views about the meaning ofparent involvement in education. Although there are some comuonunderstandings or agreements concerning certain aspects of parent involvementacceptable to both groups, parents' involvement interests appear much broaderthan the more narrowly defined areas of involvement which educators consideruseful.In order for parent involvement to become more acceptable, viahle,and,effective, a clearer definition is necessary--one which all can agree upon.Otherwise, fundamental barriers will stand in the way of successful parentinvolvement.Thus, it appears that there needs to be a consensus of opinionsconcerning the definition and scope of parent involvement efforts betweenparents and educators before these can become more integral to the educationalsystem and its processes. Such concordance is a key to developing more of a VI-23 E '3Trevlous numbered page inhe orlginal document was blank. partnership between homes and schools in dealing with the difficult issueseducation faces today and tomorrow.The lack of more agreement between parents and educators regardingparent involvement's meaning appears to stem from the fact that, neithergroup has had much formal training in the area of parent involvement. Bothof the groups indicated that there is a definite need for teachers to betrained for parent involVement. It also seems that parents, other schoolstaff, administrators, and even teacher educators would need such trainingfor parent involvement to become most effective. Additional knowledge,understandings, skills, and experiences should enhance not only broaderacceptance, but also smoother implementation of parent involvement ineducation.Some of-the differences in opinions about parent involvement in schoolgovernance matters may reflect a fear and/or reluctance on the part ofeducators (especially teachers, principals, and administrators) to share withparents these roles or activities which, historically, have been considered asthe sole domain of educators. Many teachers appear to desire more of a say ineducational matters or *decisions. Most administrators appear unwilling toshare governance because it may lessen their effectiveness and/or power. As aresult, the possibilities of-joint decision-making with parents will meet withresistance,because educators still appear to be neither unwilling to sharecontrol nor can they envision how this can, in practice, increase theeffectiveness and relevance of education.Based upon the more preferred ways educators want parents involved andthe ways parents are most interested in being involved, there appears to be aneed for change in how parent involvement is perceived. Educators shouldcapitalize on the wider involvement interests of parents and expand the waysto increase their participation in education. Much of this will require ,educators to realize that many parents are far more sophisticated in theirknowledge and skills than educators perceive them to be. As such, manyparents can take part in more of a variety of roles. This broader and morecollegial participation will necessitate attitudinal and perceptual changes onthe part of educators,as well as changes in the educational system.Parent involvement cannot be effective if educators continue to see it asan attachment or a supplement to mainstream educational activities. Rather,such involvement must be incorporated into the mainstream of education. Theresults suggest at last three steps to accomplish this. First, a clear,definitive statement about parent involvement must be developed and issued toall in a school system. Second, viable, written policies to help frame andimplement parent involvement efforts must be established. Third, both staffand financial resources to carry out parent involvement activities need to beidentified, then earmarked for such usage. In doing so, the importance ofparent involvement in education will be more evident from the perspectives ofeducators and parents alike.The extent to which parent involvement can be improved appears to bedirectly related also to how \"open\" educators are to this concept. Inaddition, developing a broader range of parent involvement activities that areamenable to parents' needs is a mosc important aspect of revitalizing theirparticipation.Although parents will participate in -lightly different ways, VI-24 --\"'\"\"r`A',7\"\"'\"Ifil\"'\" this should not deter educators from working with them to jointly develop theframework and components of an effective involvement program. Ultimately,educators will have to realize that the most effective parent involvementprogram, similar to the most viable educational program, must be extended tothe entire school community rather than being limited to the school building.Parent involvement should be perceived by educators and parents as a moreencompassing concept. To do this, it appears that parent involvement may needto be framed within the concept of at least four broad domain areas. Thesewould include: (a) public relations; (b) school support/learning; (c) homesupport/learning; and (d) shared governance. In 'doing so, parent involvementcan become a catalyst, not only for parents to influence as well as fullyparticipate in the educational system, but also to help them effectively usecommunity resources to aid in making family life, as well as educationalachievement, more satisfying and successful. The results from this study led the Southwest Educational DevelopmentLaboratory to make the following recommendations: 1.For Teacher Training:Parent involvement should be taught in a developmentalsequence that progresses from the more traditional typesof parent involvement where parents are asked to cooperatewith school staff, to the types of parent involvement inwhich school staff provide services to pare' ;, and thentoward the types where parents and school st \u00a3f worktogether essentially as partners in education.Inservice training also should begin with a developmentalframework for teachers to look at the various models ofparent involvement. Our results indicate that mostteachers, administrators, and parents support the role ofparents as audience, but there are also significantnumbers in each group favoring the model', in which parentsand school staff function as partners in the educationalprocess.Therefore, involving parents as audience is agood first step, but in a given district the relationshipbetween parents and the school may already be much moredeveloped.Inservice training also should focus on enhancing teachers'attitudes and their motivations for working more collegiallywith parents.Once this is established, training shouldmove on to knowledge, and then to actual development ofrequisite skills. This sequence of training suggests thatinservice training for parent involvement should consistof a series of workshops rather than a one-day, one-timeworkshop. 2. nt in Schools:Principals and other administrators must be included inparent involvement training as they often set the rules VI -25 and norms in the schools. If they are not aware of thebenefits of parent involvement, or not skilled in workingwith parents, they may set norms for teachers that discouragethem from using the skills or knowledge they have acquiredregarding parent, involvement.To encourage all school staff in school districts to developbetter relations with parents, formal district policies needto be written that clearly spell out the commitment toparent involvement. Responses from our superintendents'and school board presidents' surveys indicate thatexistence of formal written policies encouraging parentinvolvement activities in schools is directly related toincreased levels of a variety of parent involvementactivities in schools.In designing school district parent involvement programs,the various types of parent involvement must be viewed asa developmental sequence, from the teachers' and theparents' point of view. Increasing parent involvement inthe role of audience requires comparatively less effortand skill on the part of both teachers and parents thanwould parent involvement as home tutors. Therefore,interests, skill levels, and estimates of availabletime, especially on the part of parents, must be consideredwhen deciding which types of parent involvement are to bethe focus of program efforts.

Handout VI-3 Reading Modern Dilemma of School-Rome Communications: Note:The \"expert sheet\" for this reading is at the end.Part I -- An Introduction and OverviewEdward E. Gotta and Richard F. Purnell Two general slams are frequently encountered today in both the popularand professional media. These concern: (1) the need to improve variousAmerican educational practices and (2) the wrenchingly changing Americanfamily.However, seldom do we see or bear about the typical day-to-dayinteractions of these two significantly changing institutions. Nevertheless,the truth is that in our society the family and the school are intimatelybound to one another. Consequently, there is a widespread consensus amongclose observers that the individual shiftings and shake-outs of home andschool are sending disturbing shock waves through their respective cores,through each other, and through the society at large. Thus, if educationalarchitects are to have a say in bringing about more than just an \"exasperatingtolerance\" between the school and the home, attention must be given to thedynamic and changing interplay between these two significant influences in thedevelopment of our children. Ideally, ways must be found to make theiremerging relationship a collaborative one that strengthens both.As it happens, one of the few places in the country that has been givingconcentrated attention to practice in this important area is the AppalachiaEducational Laboratory (AEL) in Charleston, West Virginia. In fact, since1980, staff at AEL, together with collaborators from local schools, WestVirginia University, and the University of Rhode Island have been doing workin the area of school-home communications as part of a larger school-familyrelations project. More specifically, we have carefully examined the natureof this problem, developed ways of studying and dealing with it, and appliedthose ways to school systems in West Virginia. This report is about the workthat the first author has done in this area; it will appear in twoinstallments.This first installment introduces and Oyes an overview of theschool-homecommunications dilemma.Thtnextinstallmentoutlinesourproposed way out of the dilemma and briefly presents some of the results thathave been obtained through applying that approach in Kanawht County and otherWest Virginia high schools.To begin with communication takes place when a message is received asintended by its sender. School-home communications is, a label that weselected to include both messages sent by the school to the home and viceversa.Distinguishing the latter from the former when desirable may beachieved by rearrangine the order of words to: histazislesicsmunigatigna.Moreover, although other forms of interactive communications occur and arepossible,school-home communications take twomajor forms:(1) Individual(Type I) and (2) School-wide (Type S). Examples of Type I are messages aboutthe child's academic progress, attendance, and interest, whereas examples ofType S arePTA/PTO announcements, newsletters, notices of confirenee times,and discipline codes. VI-29 The previous numbered page inthe original document was blank, Numerous observers--both futurists and contemporary commentators--have strongly suggested that schools need to reexamine their style of communicatingwith the hone regarding Type I and S matters.The language of these observers describes schools and homes as being %orlds apart\"; schools using obsoleteparent-excluding techniques; and schools depending on \"one-way,\" \"top-down,\"authoritarian communicating styles; these expressions typify the landscape of their writings. Answers that these commentators offer on the topic dwell on \"two-way,\" ' mutually-exchsnging,\"\"partnership\" styles of communicating by schools.The aame of the game, one of them says, \"is people interacting withother people.\"The prize to be realized by moving from a model of communicating \"to\" to one of \"with\" the home will be greater and more constructive parental involvement.In this connection we must note that the parent involvementliterature of the past 20 years yields two consistent findings: I) student achievement goes up and 2) support for schools grows with increased parent involvement at all grade levels.The dilemma is that the present dominant model of school-homecommunication alienates many parents.Sugar coated or disguised efforts to continue more of the same, no matter how well intentioned, are likely to make matters worse in thepresent climate with itscross-currents of change. A freshapproach that is consistent with the demands of the new wave for more partnership-types of relationships appears to be what is called for.A description of and rationale for the approach developed by ALL, along with a report of some of their findings in Kanawha County high schools, will be presented in the next installment of this article.

This one outlines our proposed way out of the dilemma and briefly presents some of the results that have beenobtained through applying that approach in Kanawha County and other West Virginia high schools.The dilemma is that we know that a greater-than-present level of parent involvement is a highly desirable quest for educators to puruse but that the present dominant model of school-home cormunication alienates many parents. Tie way out of this is to begin by using the partnership style of communicating that is more consistent with the demands of the emerginginformation society. Our vIew is that schools can and should find out how toprovide for these more effective communications by asking the parentsthemselves--that is, through home-to-school communications' V1-30 More specifically, we advocate the use of telephone interviews withparents (by volunteers) to find out what they are thinking about thefrequency, contents, methods, and effectiveness of school-to-homecommunications. These would yield far greater returns than paper-and-pencilquestionnaires--in fact,polling has shown that 95 percent or more of allparents contacted agreed to a brief interview.Working through ALL with school principals, Gotta collaboratively appliedthe idea of using telephone interviews to learn from parents about school-homecommunications in one larger and three small (more rural) West Virginia countyschool systems during 1982. Although this technique was also applied inelementary schools, only secondary school results are reported here because:(1) more information is generally available on early childhood practices, and(2) communication-linked bottlenecks are more pressing than with the age groupin the secondary schools of our society.The interview required 15-20 minutes to administer and was given to arandom sample of families of about equal numbers of 10th, Ilth, and 12th gradeboys and girls. It sought to document: (1) actual school-home communicationpractices as experienced by parents, (2) their reactions to these, (3)suggestions for improved practices, and (4) parents' views of what might workat the secondary level.*Final sampling figures for the three smaller counties' (S) schoolscombined and the four larger city (L) schools combined were 184 and 198,respectively. .The bulk of the parent respondents were mothers in both samples(S = 97.83%; L 0 87.371). Nether child's sex or grade level was found to beassociated with parent orientation toward school-hose communications in two ofthe largest schools sampled. 'Thus, all subsequent analyses were conductedwithout regard to these variables.To begin with. majorities of the two groups of parents attend some schoolfunction (S = 76.0VC; L . 69.191). Athletic events (S and L = 60%) attractfar more parents than do other events, e.g., Band/Music (next highest at 18%),Drama, F-T functions, community education, etc. In contrast, although bothgroups have parent meetings and councils, overwhelmingly parents do not attendthese (S = 86.96%; L = 80.812).In response to a series of questions about communications received fromthe school, more L-school (95.41%) parents mention receiving them (S =69.40%).Of those who receive them, newsletters are most often mentioned byL-school parents (L= 81.51%; S = 2.72%), while special notices are mentionedmore frequently by S-school parents (S= 38.04%; L = 18.18%).The frequency of receiving communications from one to four times every6-8 weeks is reported to be significantly greater at communications as being equated with problems (S37.93%) and more often have negative attitudes toward such contacts (L =13.64%; S = 4.491). They also more often feel rc ,nsible for making schoolcontacts (L = 73.40%; S = 36.88%).*A technical report containing sample interviews and coding procedures isavailable from AEL. WVIR,,,, '\"VI-31 When notified by the school that their child is performing \"belowexpectations\" some parents say they do not take any action (S = 7.14%; L =19.85%) and 39.25 percent L-parents but 61.54 percent S-parents say they talkto their child's teacher about the matter. On the other hand, virtually noparent said he or she would not want to hear about a problem the child washaving in school, although some wanted to know about only certain things andothers (a majority in L and S schG_'.$) wanted to know everything.Many parents (S = 71.202; L s 53.54%) mention a need to receive promptnotice about problems, but few mention encouraging responsibility for behaviorin their ild (S = 2.722; L = 14.142). S-school parents more often feel theschool needs more discipline (S = 36.96%; L = 19.192) but infrequently feelthat parents can do more than the school (S = 6.52%; L = 19.19%). Finally,majorities of both groups of parents say that School and hone should worktogether on problems (S = 82.072; L = 66.67%).These findings reflect the responses to questions about school -homecommunication issues identified jointly by the principals and AEL staff. Whenpresented with these and responses to mere open-ended questions, principalswere inclined spontaneously to generate plars for using them to improve theirschool's effectiveness in practicing school-home communications. NOME-SCNOOL CCIMMUNICATIONSEdward E.AID PARENT INVOLVEMENTGotta Parent involvement of almost every imaginable type has been tried outover the past 20 years. There are two consistent findings from studies ofthese involvement efforts. When parent involvement increases, (1) studentachievement goes up and (2) support grows for schools. These findings appearin studies of all grade levels.Some parents create their own involvement, without receiving any specialhelp from schools. For the average parent, however, schools can succeed ingreatly increasing involvement. The first step toward this result is to haveeffective home-school communications.Our research has identified a number of areas for home-schoolcommunications regarding individual students: academic progress, attendance,homework assignments, classroom conduct, special needs that are identified,progress toward graduation, career and other post-secondary planning,interest, and motivation. Communications are also needed about the overallschool program: PTA/PTO, scheduled parent-teacher conference times,curriculum emphasis, expectations and standards for conduct, discipline code,grading and attendance policies, extracurricular programs and events,opportunities for volunteer service, special circumstances facing localschools--the list goes on.The two lints above suggest two types of communication efforts that areneeded:(1) hose and school need to arrange ways to consider together theprogress ane needs of individual students; and (2) schools need to shareinformation with all parents in a timely manner about their program, activityschedule, accomplishments, and needs.Two methods have been espeadllysuccessful for communications of thesecond type, that is, for all parents. These are newsletters and open houseat the school. Open house draws in elementary parents a little more rapidly,but works at the secondary level as well. The newsletter is highly acceptedat both levels.Open house works best if: (a) held perhaps once a year, (b) at a time oflow schedule conflict, and (c) with much advance planning, preparation, andpublicity (the three glE.Y. Parents at both elementary and secondary levelsare more likely to attend open house if: (a) their child is featured in someway, (b) there will be an opportunity to examine student work and talk withteachers, (c) time is convenient, (d) notice is given far in advance, (e) theyreceive a personal welcome or invitation, (f) they expect to experience acordial atmosphere, including refreshments, (g) the open house has a statedpurpose the parents consider personally important, and (b) they have beeninvolved in some way in the planning.The newsletter is a more general purpose means of communication. Ourstudies show that a quality newsletter is the single most effective way ofreaching parents whose children attend an individual school building. Itfeels very personal to hear from \"my child's school.\" The evidence shows that VT-33 a largemajority of parents read and act upon information provided innewsletters.They are upset if news of school events comes too late.Onehelpful principle, in preparing the newsletter, is to emphasize upcomingevents with a brief but comprehensive calendar on the cover page. The moreinformative the newsletter, the more positive its reception. News developmentshould, however, be brief and pointed.Personal messages and viewpoints fromschool personnel are welcomed.Open house and newsletters can set the tone for all other home-schoolcommunications. They lead into the more personal forms of communication.They invite parent involvement.These more personal forms of communicationare discussed in the following section. Personalized Individual Bowe- School Communications Pertonalized home-school communications can be started by doing briefinterviews with parents to find out what they are thinking. Do they receivecommunications as often as they would like?What else do they want the schoolto communicate? What can be done to make the school's'existin4 channels ofcommunication work more effectively? An interview is far more effective thana questionnaire for answering these questions.Interviews of this type can beconducted by PTA/PTO members or other parent volunteers. Our experience isthat 95 percent or more of all parents contacted agreed to participate in abrief interview. Moreover, their answers can be analyzed and used by schoolpersonnel, with little outside assistance, to improve communications. We areavailable to assist schools that plan to carry out interviews of this type. Next, personalized communications about individual children need to beinitiated by school personnel rather than parents. This is so because parentsseldom know whether a child is having difficulty or needs additional help.The teacher is the one who usually spots this kind of thing first. Teachers find it easier to initiate communications about studentdifficulties if there are policies or guidelines that lead parents, teachers,and students to expect such communications. Policies or guidelines of thistype need to be developed thoughtfully by a school district committee. Theyshould be officially adopted by school board action. Based on our studies of exemplary practices in local school systems, wecan recommendthat the following personalized communications and followuppractices be considered. 1.Parents should be notified of any student academic difficultyabout mid-way through a grading period. This allows time forimprovement before the grade appears on a report card.Parents also need guidance on bow to follow up on academicdeficiency reports. We have prepared a single-pageguidance sheet to accompany these \"interim grade reports,\"and can make it available to interested school systems. 2.Parents should be contacted about most student conductproblems that are serious enough to require even milddisciplinary action. Prevention of further incidents isVI-34z the reason for comminicating promptly. Overwhelmingly,parents indicate they wish to be notified. Parents ofsecondary school students are especially keen about receivingprompt notification. Teachers and counselors more often riskbeing wrong, in the thinking of parents, when they fail tonotify parents than they do when they communicate aboutbehavior problems. Clearly, it is easier to do this whenreporting is an expected procedure. Exceptions to this ruleshould, of course, be allowed under special circumstances,such as when a further strained parent-child relationshipmight offset the benefits. 3.Prompt and regular notification of student absence is bestaccomplished by telephone message whenever possible. Policyin this area should encourage parents to call the schoolfirst whenever they know the student vill be absent. 4.Many parents indicate their willingness to review andacknowledge by signature their students' school work. Thisarrangement works well when the flow of communication isfully predictable, as when it is understood that this will bea daily or weekly transaction.These arrangements are bestmade by agreement between teacher and parent for a specifiedlength of time. 5.If parents are to be asked to help with or supervisecompletion of homework, this must be clearly communicated.In this event, parents should be offered instruction andsupport before they undertake this assignment.Parents andteacher will need to confer from time to time with each otherand the student about the process. By following thispattern, more predictable results will be achieved whenhomework is assigned.

Reading,Four:Single Parents and the Schools: The Effect of Marital Status onParent and Teacher Evaluations.Note:The \"expert sheet\" for this reading is at the end. ABSTRACTThe single-parent home is one of the major living arrangements of schoolchildren today. This paper uses data from a survey of 1,269 parents,including 24 percent single parents, to study whether single and marriedparents differ in their interactions with elementary schools and,teachers.Results show that initial differences between single and married parents'perceptions of teachers and teachers' evaluations of single and marriedparents are due to other family and school conditions. Race, parenteducation, grade level, teacher practices of parent involvement, and overallteacher quality significantly influence parent reports of teacher practices.Children's performance and behavior, teacher practices of parent involvement,and grade level significantly influence teacher evaluations of parenthelpfulness at home. Children's achievement and behavior are the maininfluences on teacher evaluations of the quality of children's homework, butsome teachers rate children from single-parent homes lower than otherchildren, even after classroom achievement is taken into account.Single parents felt more pressure than married parents to be involvedwith their children in learning activities at home. Married parents spentmore time assisting teachers at school. Both groups of parents were concernedabout their children's education, worked with their children at home whenthere were questions about school work, and were generally positive abouttheir children's elementary schools and teachers.The study shows the importance of measures of school structures and. processes in research on single parents. Single parents had better relationswith teachers whose philosophy and practices lead them toward more positiveattitudes about parents. Single parents reported differeut treatment frommarried parents when their children were in the classrooms of teachers whowere not leaders in the use of parent involvement, and single parents-andtheir children were viewed less positively by teachers who did not frequentlyinvolve parents in learning activities at home. Teacher leadership, notparent marital status, influenced parent awareness, appreciation of teachers'efforts, and knowledge about the school program. These findings requiredproximate measures of teacher practices that were linked directly to thestudents and thetY parents.Excerpts from the report follow: The one-parent hone is one of the majorfamily arrangements of school children today. Over thirteen million 'hildrenlive in single-parent homes, most in mother-only homes and most as a result ofsepare.ion or divorce. Each year about 2 million children under the age of 18have parents who divorce. Between 1970 and 1982 there was a 67 percentincrease in the number of Children living with one parent. In the UnitedStates in 1982, 22 percent of the households with childrenabout / in 5weresingle-parent homes. Membership in one-parent homes is even greater for blackchildren, with 49 percent of the children under 18 years old in one-parent VT-39 Theprevious numbered page Inthe original documentwas Wank. homes (U.S. Census, 1982).It is estimated that from 40 percent to 50 percentof all school-age children will spend some of their school years as part of aone parent home 1982). In earlier times, single earent hoses were atypical;12CMthey are common.The historic contrast raise. iy ideological and emotional questions aboutthe effects of single-parent e .es on the members of the family.Althoughmuch has been written about sivele parents, their children, their numbers, andtheir problems, little reseatzb as focused on how single parents and theirchildren fit into other social institutions that were designed to servetraditional ,families. Yet, when single or carried parents have children inschool, the family and school are inexorably linked.Researchers from different disciplines have recognized the importance ofunderstanding hos, institutions simultaneously affect human development.Litwak & Meyer, 1974, described clearly the potential for cooperationbetween schools (bureaucratic organizations) and families (primary groups).Coleman, 1974, discussed how individuals struggle with \"corporate act'rs\" toestablish a balance of power betweei individuals and the organisations thatserve them.Bronfenbrenner, 1979, explicitly called for research on how theinteractions of scar taneously socializing environments affect Schafer, 1983) havecalled fee' research on the family as part of the wider social system. In thispaper we examine some connections between families and schools, lookingespecially at single parents, their children, and their children's teachers. Opinions differ as to whether schools and teachers should be informedabout parents' marital status or changes in family structure. Some argue thatteachers are biased against children from one-parent homes.They suggest that-eschers negatively label children of divorced or separated-parents, explainchildren's school problems in terms of the family living arrangement ratherthan in terms of teacher practices or individsal needs, or assume parentalinadequac'es before the facts about are Othersargue that the school should be informed about parental separation or divorcebecause the teacher provides stability and support to children during theinitial period of family disruption, can be more sensitive to children'ssituations when discussing families, and can organize special services such asafter-school care that eey be needed by single parents and working mothers.These discrepant opinions are each supported by parents' accounts ofexperiences with teacher bias or with teacher understanding and assistance(Carew & Lightfoot, 1979; Keniston, 1977; National Public Radio, 1980; Snow,1982).There are few facts from research, however, about whether and howteacher practices are influenced by their students' family structures or abouthow single parents perceive or react to public schools and their children'steachers.This report focuses on the children's living arrangements that affect theday-to-diy communications and interactions rf the family and the school. Wedescribe the characteristics of single and married parents and presentcorrelates of marital status. We introduce a simple node/ that improves uponearlier research on the effects of marital status, parent education, andteacher leadership on parent-teacher exchanges and evaluations. We compare V - 4 0Q aload Owlto AWEq11111Miliarbai ..daa single and married ReaRtsL(...mmu_s of the frequency of teacher requests forparent involvement. Then we look at fetchers' repprto of the quality ofassistance from si.agle and married parents and the quality of the homeworkcompleted by children from one - and two-parent homes. Finally, we introducean explanatory model that places marital status in a fuller social context.The research takes into account measures pf family structure andprocesses, student characteristics, and school structures and processes,including family size, race, parent education, occupational statue; studentgrade level, ability, behavior in class; teacher leadership in parentinvolvement, experience, overall quality; and other teacher-parentiuteractions.Ualike earlier research that often used \"special problem\"samples to study single-parent families (Shinn, 1978), this sample is derivedfrom a state-wide sample of teachers in regular school settings. Mostimportantly, the data from teachers, parents, and students were directlylinked, so that effects of teacher practices on parents could be estimated(Epstein, 1983). This means that parents were identified whose children werein particular teachers' classrooms, and that other proximate measures offamily and school conditions could be taken into account in estimating effectson parents' and teachers' appraisals of each other's efforts. Data and ApproachSurveys of teachers, principals, parents, and students in 16 Marylandschool districts were conducted in 1980 and 1981. About 3,700 first, third,and fifth grade teachers and their principals in 600 schools were surveyed(Becker & Epstein, 1982; Epstein S Becker, 1982. From the originalsample, 36 teachers were identified who etrongly emphasized psTeat isvolvemettin learning activities at home. Then, 46 \"control\" teachers were selected whowere similar to the case teachers in grade level, type of school district,years of teaching experience, end school population, but who did not emphasizeparent involvement in their teaching practice. Among the case teachers, 17were confirmed by their principals as strong leaders in the use of parentinvolvement activiti, In 11, then, the 82 teachers ranged alonga...contin.,am of us of parent involvement, with the \"confirmed leaders\"making the most frequent use of the greatest number of learning activities athome.After extensive data collection on a number of variables related tofamily characteristics, and school and family practices, followed by carefulstatistical analysis, Epstein (1984) reached the following conclusions:Researchers have contributed three types of information on singleparents.First, descriptive repprpi offer statistics about single parents andtheir children. Many reports have focused on the dramatic increase in theprevalence of single parents, the number of children in single-parent homes,racial differences in marital patterns, and the economic disparities of singlevs. two parent bones, especially single-mother home vs. other familyarrangements (Bane, 1976; Merlin, 1982). It is important to document andmonitor the trends in separation, divorce, the numbers of children affected,and the emergence and increase of special cases such as teenage single-parents(Mott Foundation, 1981), and never married parents (U.S. Census, 1982). VI-41 Second, specific, analytic studies of the effects of family structure onchildren or parents go beyond descriptive statistics to consider familyconditions and processes that affect family members. Research of this typemeasures a range of family-lifevariables--such as socioeconomic status,ramily history, family practices, and attitudes such as parental commitment totneir children (Adams, 1982; Bane, 1983).These studiesincrease our understanding of the dynamics of family life under differentsocial and economic conditions. Third, iptegrativt, analytic studies of the effects of family structureon childrenand parents go beyond the boundaries of family conditions toinclude other institution? that affect family members (Btonfenbrenner, this paperwe see thatthe effects of family structure are, in fact,attributable tovariables that characterize school ee classroom organizations. During theyears whenfamilies have school-age children, the interplay of families andschools is a critical part of studies of family structure. The current studycontributes new knowledge based on data from parents and teachers about familystructure and the schools: 1.gmlepissAmAt.engt_as.nlegiam. The diversity insingle-parent homes means that an understanding of familiesis incomplete if it is based only on the simple category ofmarital status. In this statewide survey, single parentsvaried in education, family size, family resources,occupational status, confidence in ability to help theirchildren, and other family practices that concern theirchildren. sSingle parents' reports suggest that they fulfilltheir parenting role with about the same level of interactionwith and concern for their children ae do married parents.Some characteristics may differ in one- and two-parent homes,such as the amount of adult time available per child (wherethere is more than .one child), and parent time available toassist at the school. Indeed, the single parents felt theyhad had lees time and energy than needed to complete theteachers' requests for learning activities at Lome, and theyspent significantly fewer days helping at school than didmarried parents. But these differences do not seem to affectthe basic interactions of families with the elementaryschools.There is some evidence that marital status affectsteacher ratings of children's homework completion, even afterchildren's classroom achievement is taken into account.Future reports will be devoted to the effects on students ofteacher practices of parent involvement, and specialattention will be given to children from single-parent homes. 2.There is diversity in teacher.practicea that concernfamilies.Some teachers'philosophies and practices leadthem toward more positive attitudes about parents and abouthow parents can share the teacher's role by assisting theirchildren at home. Teachers who were not leaders in the usebf organized and frequent parent involvement practices hadlower opinions of the quality of help received from singleparents than from married parents, and lower opinions of VI-42(9 3 parents in general than did leaders in the use of parentinvolvement.Santrock and Tracy, 1978, found that teachersrated hypothetical children from two-parent bones higher onpositive traits and lower on negative traits than childrenfrom one-parent bones. In actual school settings, we foundthat teachers differed in their evaluations of children fromone- and two-parent bones. Teachers tended to rate childrenfrom one-parent homes lower on the quality of their homework,and teachers who were mL I...,mlers made greater distinctionsbetween children from one- and two-parent homes that wereotherwise equal in parent education. 3.Teacher leadership, not parent marital status. influencedrenaness ,.deceea ekngilske02ate142,2_.2121mhscl.

Although family members mayrecover relatively rapidly from the disruption caused bydivorce or separation (Bane, 1976; Hetherington, Cox & Cox, 1.1:1)V1-43 boo 1978; Zill, 1983), others, whose attitudes favor traditionalfamilies, may have difficulty dealing with families who differfrom the norm. Our analyses show that Leachers who weregatleaders in parent involvement rated single and loweducatedparents significantly lower than married parents inhelpfulness even after parent education, parent involvement atthe school, the child's classroom achievement, and otherimportant variables are taken into account. However, teacherswho were lesdex, and who organized active programs of parentinvolvement were more positive about the quality of assistancereceived from all parents, including single parents andparents with little formal education. The teacher's leadership in the frequent use of parent involvement is astatement by the teacher about the continuous and important role parents playin their children's education.The formal organization of parent involvementin the teacher's regular teaching practice may be especially important for asingle parent whose family situation makes involvement in school activitiesdifficult.

Many specialists, teachers,and administrators have learned concepts such as \"norm,\" \"I.Q.,\" and\"auditory memory\" in technical language, and find it difficult to explainthose concepts in plain words. This short inservice should be fun,heighten teachers' awareness of the technical terms they use, and give thempractice in \"translation.\"The work will be done in heterogeneous teams, so that participants hiveto depend on each other.

Many of us understand and get used to using technical terms and school\"jargon\" as a quick and easy way to communicate among ourselves. But otherpeople, especially parents and community people sometimes don't understandwhat we mean by \"percentiles,\" \"norms,\" \"psychological inventories,\" and we have to translate them into \"plain words.\"Sometimes that even helps us clarify to ourselves what those terms mean, Today you're going to work as _teams.

At one of our future meetings, we'llshare these demons. 4 - - Listen With Tour Wind and Heart (Two Sessions) TO The Leader:This activity is designed to help teachers, principals, and otherspecialists improve their ability to understand and to check theirunderstanding by restating what the speaker has said. The procedure combinesfour methods of learning and teaching: (1) demonstration, (2) role-taking andplaying to provide (3) practice, and (4) coaching. After the introductorymaterial, divide the participants into groups of three. In each practicesession:one participant pays the role of a parent telling a teacher,specialist, or principal something about a child;one participant practices active, reflective listening; sadone participant coaches the participant who is practicing. Then they switch roles. In the procedures section, we will give moreexamples and on explanation of what each of these methods requires of theparticipants. The first training session will focus on listening for and understandingfacts; the second will focus on listening for and understanding emotions thatthe speaker is also communicating.Remember, feel free to \"ad lib\" on the script. Just make sure theessential points are covered. For example, if participants seem somewhatunmotivated, discuss whet it feels like to talk to someone who is onlyhalf-listening, encouraging them to contribute their own experiences andfeelings.You'll need a room large enough that the trios can form small groups andtalk without the distraction of another group uncomfortably close. yI -55 Listen With Tour Mind and HeartFirst TraininSession Objective:Participants will restate a factual account to thesatisfaction of the person talking.

In spite of all these reasons, we sig, learn to listen better, and intalking with Tarents, whether on the telephone or in person, we probablyshould. We listen with more than our ears. Our eyes, our mind, and our feelingscan help us listen better, but sometimes they can keep us from listening, too. We can be better listeners if: 1.We $en4pgly, seriouslt, pint So listen to what say. 2.We actl.yoly &4ye our total at;gntion to understandingwhat someone is saying. 3.We are receotiore, both mentally and emotionally. 4.We are senajptive to the other person and respond towhatheor she is trying to communicate(Gotta, 1977). Put key words on chalkboard, flip chart, or transparencyfor an overhead projector. But in addition, we have to practice, because listening is a skill, andthat's the way you learn a skill. Since it's pretty hard to practice beinguceptite or sensirive, let's list some of the ways we can show that we areXenuine, serious, actively interested., rasmiljam, and sensitive.

One person viii be the speaker--inin this case, a parent. One person will be the listener--in this case, aa teacher, principal, or specialist.The third person will be the ma k. The person who is the parent is going to explain miterajggjiagagl tothe teacher.For example, the parent night explain what the doctor hasreported about a child's allergies and his or her instructions to the school,or something the PTA is proposing to do that has serious consequences foraparticular classroom or school. All of you have been involved in enough ofthese situations that you won't even have to use your imaginations!Justremember!The person who is the teacher, principal, or specialist is going toactively jisteu, practicing the skills we've listed, and any other specialtechniques they want to. Then, when the other person is through, the listenervill give an \"instant replay.\" That is, they will summarise the importantpoints and repeat then back to the parent, with the parent correcting untilthey both agree on what was said.So far, we have a familiar duet--a speaker,and a likteneti and you knowwhat you are to do. Check for understanding. Tell people who understandto fold their arms on the table.Those who don't puttheir hands in lap. tiplains demonstrate as necessary.Use those who understand to help others. VI-63 So who are the coaches? Just that.The conches watch the practice withunderstanding and support. They are not to criticise and yell at you likesome coaches do, but they are to see and point out what you did right, whatcould have been better, what you forgot to do, and what you could practicenest time.They'll do this after practice, or at a break in the practice, andhelp the two of you analyse what happened. One group of people studying howteachers and other people learn new skills has found that coaching hylps(Joyce & Showers, 1983). After we've practiced once, we'll change - -toles soyou all get a chance to practice listening and coaching.I've asked a couple of people to help me demonstrate. I'll be the coach. Short demonstration. Check for understanding, asabove. Notice that we gave the parent a chance to think about what be /she wasgoing to say, and a little help, and that we worked until he/she agreed thelistener understood. Notice that the coach gave both feedback and support.Now, we'll get in groups of three and get started. Practice once, then we'llstop and see if you have any questions. Give grouping directions apecific to the situation.Give each group the role cards, telling them todecide who is going to take which role first, second,and third.Move from group to group to help define theirtasks and get them started. Stop after practicerun, check for understanding and clarification,then continue. Continue to monitor, but don'tenter a group unless they need to be brought back onon track, rescued, or sent on to the nest task.They sometimes forget to switch roles.Keep the atanephere lig ht., so that people can becomecomfortable with practicing and coaching. If you don't 1:tarsome laughter and good-natured banter, something is wrong.Since the groups will be working at different speeds, what doyou do with those who have finished early? There are severaloptions. 1.Have them analyse what meat well, and what didn't gowell in their group to share with the others later. 2.Have them discuss what they liked or didn't likeabout coaching and being coached, and be ready toshare with the group.116VI-64 3.Ask them to identify other situations in their ovaschools or lives where this type of active listeningwould be useful; list and share with group. 4.Save some short readings on active listening orcoaching for them.As the groups finish, help the reflect combat theyhave dome.Sere are same possible questions. Selectthe appropriate ones from these, or develop your own. 1.What were some of the difficulties in doing activelistening for factual information? 2.In what usys did the am it? -Rot liket* 3.What mere some things you learned?What were some things that went well in your grotto?Didn't, go yell?* 5.In what other school or life situations could you usethis skill?* *Se sure to direct these (minions to any group assigned thattask. 6.Are there times when you shouldn't use active orreflective listening? Use question sir as a conclusion mud transition. Active or reflective listening is a skill to use when you want to makesure that you thoroughly understand another person, and that the other personknows you are concerned, listening, and un&Jrstapding. It is not somethingthat you do during every conversation, although most of us could probablylisten to each other a lot better than we do. Practicing is a lot easier than doing something in real life, so you'vegot a homework assignment. Try out, Practice this technique on yourcolleagues, family, and of course, the parents. Make some notes about bow itworked, their reactions, any difficulties you had, Or funny things thathappened. VI-651,7 We'll share these at the beginning of our next inservice, which willstart with a quick review, then practice and coaching on using activelistening when the person yoy are talking with is expressing a lot of emotion.This often happens when disciplinc and grades are the topic. Since you'll beplaying the parent role, think about what you're going to say and do, and alsoabout how you could use \"active listening\" as a teacher, principal, orspecialist in that cituation.Today, we listened with our winds; next time, we'll use mind Loa heart! Listen With Tour Mind and MmartItcond TrAini;g Sesaion Objective:Participants will state or restate emotions conveyed in astatement to the satisfaction of the person talking.

Today we're going tc practice again, but on reflecting feelings thatpeople express or imply. This is much more difficult to do than reflecting CTrestating facts, as those of you who have tried it know. What are somepossible reasons? Discuss list reasons if there seem to be a lot generated.Some possible ones:We get emotional, too.We feel uneasy or.tkreatened.60We don't know what to say.We don't have training and skill in interpreting whatpeople are feeling.We're afraid we'll say and do the wrong thing. All those are good reasons, but the high feelings art there, and we asschool people often have to deal with them. Sometimes all that is necessaryis for someone to listen to the parent and acknowledge how be or she feels. Those of you familiar with Teacher Effectiveness Training, ParentEffectiveness Training, or other \"affective listening\" approaches willrecognize the technique.We're going to pract4ce and coach the same way we did last time, butthere will be in changes: 1.You are to get in different groups. VT-67I4 2.Those of you playing the role of ;prents will focus onconveying to the teacher a feeling. You don't have tostate the feeling at all. In fact, you can talk aboutgrades, or a discipline or homework problem, but insuch a way that a feeling is conveyed. Lipteners, youare to reflect those feelings in a way acceptable tospeaker.Coacbes, give them support, guidance, helpfulhints on what they did right, and how they could4improve.

Introductory material is set up so thatparticipants' skill and experience are recognizedan important principlein inservice education.You'll need a room large enough that the trios can form small groups andtalk without distraction. School-Family Communications: Telephone Calls.0Objective:Participants will outline, practice, and receive coaching onat least two types of telephone calls to parents: (1) a getacquainted, good-news oie; and (2) one where they must bringup and discuss problems and concerns, such as discipline orgrades. Materials:1.Chalkboard, flipchart, or overhead projector andtransparencies. 2.index cards.Fold so theyviii stand up.

Some parents cone bythe school, we see others at the store, church, or other school and communityfunctions.Others wa never see at all. For them, a telephone cell may be thelink between school and hole. sf.ln fact, teachers report that phone call* tothe home are one of the best ways for Schools and families to communicate.Calls need not be long to be effective. In fact, we mien take s tip fromsuccess of the book \"The One-Minute Manager\" and try to become \"The One-MinuteTelephoner.\" A phone call doesn't need to be long to be effective. However, a personal telephone call has both advantages and disadvantagesfor teacher and parent. Let's quickly list some of them. V1-71122 The previousnumberedpagahsIlmoOginaidocamentwasalault This listing can be done two ways:I1.As a total group. To do this, write *Advantages\" and*Disadvantages\" at the top of the paper or chalkboard,then list each item in the appropriate place as thegroup suggests it. 2.As two or :ore smaller groups, with each group having anassigned focus of either \"advantages\" or \"disadvantages.*They generate the advantages or disadvantages withinthe group, then report back. This technique takeslonger. Among the items that should be listed are: AdvantatesEstablish personal contactKnow your message has gotten tothe parentMost parents have telephonesFind out things you don't learnin an exchange of notesGive chance to clarify whatpeople don't understandMost people are used tospeaking and 1.ateningCan exchange idaasPilift=1221Finding people homeCalling during dinner orfavorite at night--That's Ea time! Just because we all use the telephone a lot doesn't mean that we alwaysuse it, effectively. Businesses spend a lot of money training people to usethe telephone.Most of you, as teachers, have made a lot of telephone calls to parents,and have found out approaches that work and don't work. Among us, we have alot of expertise on this technique.

Rave parent and teacher face inopposite directions to simulate the telephonesituation. Take a minute to make notes on what you want to report on, then pretendto call.Coaches, remember to observe and tell the teachers what theydidrightand what could be improved. Parents, don't give the teachers a hardtime!Then switch roles. Circulate, monitor, give help as needed. One practice VI-7512ti The previousnumbered page inthe ongina1 documentwas blank is sot enough to master a skill, so go through theprocedure again if there is time. Rave those groupswho get through early begin generating ideas for thenext task:calling about a problem or concern. Good news is easy to talk abqut. Problems aren't. Teachers in theAppalachian Region asked for help in talking with parents about discipline andgrades--and telephone calls are frequently about problems. Indeed, someparents think that's the only time they hear from the school. Again, llt's tike three minutes to jot down our best ideas fortelephoning parents about discipline, grades, and other problems, then we'llshare and practice. Follow procedures as in previous ,activity. Ideas generated should include the ones below, plusothers:Don't make that your first call.Don't blame parent or child.Report objective information.Avoid labels.Talk about the problem as a shared one.Mike some positive suggestions as to MIA to do; look forsolutions.Start with something pleasanta but then get to the point. Choose words carefully; make some notes ahead of tine;avoid jargon.Call as soon as possible after the problem arises,while parents and school can do something.AILresearch says parents clear through secondaryschool welt this kind of information (Gotta, 1983). Ask if parents have noticed any problems at home. Se as specific as possible.Make a note about when you called and 'what the subject was.Put in student file.Close conversation on a pleasant note.Actively listen for both facts and feelings. VI-76126 Now you have a chance to practice making that difficult call. In yourgroups, take a few minutes to discuss the problem you're going to call about.Most of you can just draw on your own experience! Help each other decide thebest way or ways, then try out what you decided to do. Hake that phone call. Monitor group to make sure they understand task; givehelp as needed to teacher, parent, and coach; helpchange roles so all get a turn. If groups finishearly, ask them to start making notes for thecomcluding discussiom--reflecting back on what theylearned.Select from tLe ones below, or developyour own. 1,What were some things that went well in your group?Didn't go well? 2.In what ways did the coaching help or hinder? 3.What makes problems and concerns such as disciplineand grades so difficult to bring up?4. Mho are some specific things you learned that you'regoing to try with parents?After everyone has finished, briefly discuss some ofthe items above.

At one time or another, most of us have been irritated, annoyed,grateful, relieved, pleased, or angered by the telephone answering machinesthat seem to be everywhere. Some schools, however, have /earned to usethem to good advantagefor early morning call-ins; for generalinformation about the school when no one is there; or as \"bat lines\" whenparents have a complaint ormaroblem.

Let's look at how we might use recorded messages to improve school - familycommunications. I.First of all, remember that the message will be for aAcura; audienceall the parents or children in yourclass or classes--as opposed to telephone calls about anindividual child. 2.Second, the information must be short and to the point.The number of minutes will be determined by the machine'scapability.

Check for understanding of task- --arms on desk or thumbsup if they understand. Monitor work of groups, but don'tintrude unless _they need your help. When first groupgoes to record, you or someone else familiar with themachine's operation should be there. Some of theteachers probably halm these at home. Let people taketurns practicing.

It has two sections: 1.First, after initial background information, teachers willbrainstorm and.sbere ideas for each of the four coimunicationvehicles:individual messages, individual recognition,class calendars, class newsletters. 2.Second, teachers will experiment with diiferent headings orlogos, and develop at least one that they can use on thehome-family communications from their class.If they leave the session with ideas 21ge the material to implement thoseideas, they are far more likely to put the into operation. Sore of the techniques are more appropriate for elementary schools thansecondary.For example, certificates of appreciation and outstandingperformance are used freely at the secondary level, but are usually reservedfor special recognition ceremoniesand there are far more given fornon-academic pursuits than academic. As these differences arise, let theteachers discuss and decide what techniques are appropriate for what agechildren.Maybe \"what is\" isn't \"what ought to be.\" Perhaps a personal notemailed to a high school student and his or her parents could get around someof the problems of praise in front of peers. It's something to think about! An alternative approach for this inservice would be to divide into groupsand let each group generate the ideas for one vehicle of, communication. Thatis, you would have four groups; one would develop ideas for written messages,one for recognitions, one for class calendars, and one for class newslettersor newsbriefs. The listings would then be, posted for all to see and list ontheir handouts. This procedure would speed up the process, and would workwell with a group of over 24 people.In the second part of the session, arrange a \"hands-on\" workshop set-up.Materials could be placed in centers, where participants can work with onetype of material at a time.An alternative arrangement would be to put allmaterials on one large table, where people can get what they need and returnto their own workspace. jave some examples of different logos and formats forthem to look at, and either clear directions for how to use each unfamiliaritem or process, or have someone there to demonstrate.

Researchers and school people usually agree that theschool should take the initiative in establishing frequent contact withparents, informing them of what they need to know, and inviting participationand involvement in the school. Parents often respond by making more frequentcontact with teachers and the school. Almost always, when school-homecommunication becomes real communication--that is, flowing both vays--everyonewins, especially the child. There are innumerable ways for the hool to make more frequent contactwith parents, such as telephone calls, recorded messages, bulletin boards,school newsletters and notices, and parent-teacher conferences. Today we aregoing to concentrate on short and easily written communications that cjessrookteachers can do. These would be in addition to school wide communicationssuch as report cards, school handbooks, school newsletters, and schoolcalendars.We'll look at and work on two kinds: written messages about individualchildren--individual notes and recognition \"awards\"--and written messages forthe whole classroom groupclass calendars and class newsletters. Then you'llhave a chance to develop sou* models ready to use when you get back in yourown classroom.135VI-90 Let's look at hum and lolstat first.For written messages about Apdividual shild;en, probably nothing else hasquite as much meaning ss a short, personal note.

There are lots of good ideas here! Remember to make what you say brief,specific, and personal to that child and family.Always make your first notesomething vositive, and over the course of the year, talk about positivethings three to four times as often as problems or concerns. So you can remember all these good ideas, take 5 minutes to jot themdown, and they'll be ready to go in your file or notebook on school-familycommunications. Distribute Handout VI-10 *Ideas for Messages andSpecial Recognitions,\" then allow 5 minutes for copying.If people finish early, suggest that they start jottingdown ideas for special recognition. Now, let's look at ideas fa: special recognition for an individual child.Many schools or classrooms have simple certificates or awards that can be senthome with child. Show examples on next pages, or use local examples. You have to be a little careful not to seed these home indiscriminately,but what are some things a classroom teacher could send home a recognitioncertificate for? Let's list as many as we can think of. Use brainstorming procedures, ss in previous discussion,then give people 5 minutes to write down of Handout VI-10the individual and collective ideas to take home. 1 9 VI-92 \u00a36-IA P .R P.A.Poi 4 v a IRS 9 apt 3 I P pei qv' 9a q doing excellent work intiGATE OF p :SignedDate*c..x,.:...,, .4.41?,;1,..ntirerld-951.4.q.****R44).Y4401*.l..., Now, let's look at information that needs to go to the Ogle class. Ofcourse, there will be times when you want to send special notices home, but aregular class calendar, newsletter, \"newsbrief,\" or notices are also useful.In fact, in a recent survey in Naryland, over 95 percent of the teachersinvolved said they sent, notices home several times a year. The calendar canbe posted so that patents have an overview of the month ahead; the newsletteror newsbrief can share other information in-depth.Here is an example of a partially completed class calendar--see page 99.It has the lunch menu, parent-meeting, a minimal day, a \"multi-cultural week,\"and a few other things on it. What other information might a classroomteacher want to include?Alabama's State Community Education Office suggests a \"LearningCalendar,\" such rs this one. (Example on page 101.) Brainstorm and list its for class calendar as inprevious actiVities. Distribute liandent VI-11\"Class Calendars, Newsletters, or Neusbriefs.\" Haveparticipants fill in ideas the group has generated.If some get through before the others, ask then tobegin listing ideas for classroom neusbriefs. Periodic newsletters or newsbriefs are another valuable communicationtool.Current research is showing that parentslg read school newsletters andfind them important sources of information. But most school or districtnewsletters have little information in them about individual classes. Aone-page \"newsbrief\" might be worth considering. If you have a goodduplication system, consider putting the newsbrief on the back of the schoolcalendar for the coming month. Parents can then post the calendar.Exrlanstions of specific calendar items could be in the newsletter ornewsbrief.Now, let's generate some ideas about what to put in class newsletters ornewsbriefs.

F.(1977)School-based interventionfor the modification of Sheets To The Loader:We are so used to thinking of inservice training as group meetings orworkshops that we forget other methods. Teachers are quite capable oflearning on their own. In many cases, inservice training can be accomplishedthrough self-instructional materials that teachers can study and try out aloneor working informally with another group of teachers. This \"inservice\" is ofthat nature.The self-instructional module is designed to be distributed to teachersif a school, school district, or even an individual teacher decides to notifyparents that s child is having difficulty in a particular school expectationthrough \"interim progress reports,\" \"academic deficiency notices,\" or apersonal conference. When and if that decision is made, teachers need andwill be receptive to information and materials to help them.If information on the pages that follows is distributed to teachers atthe time a final decision on \"interim progress reports\" is made it will beboth immediate and relevant--and likely to be read and used. Attach the appropriate academic guidance sheet- - elementary, for elementaryteachers; secondary for secondary teachers.

Thank you for your help. 1 e, V1-126 Using Academic Guidance SheetsEdward E. Gotts Backeround.Over the past two years, AEL has studied the effects ofschools sending home \"interim grade reports.\" The interim report, is anacademic deficiency notice that is sent home between regular grading periods.Its purpose is to give the parents and student time to take corrective actionbefore the grade becomes an official part of the student's permanent record.IParents who have received such a notice or have heard about the practicetend to view this special effort at personal communication as \"helpful\" and\"useful.\" They hold positive attitudes toward the practice and, consequently,toward schools which implement it. Their comments suggest that the practiceis well accepted because it \"gives time\" to correct the deficiency--whilereport cards do not.A large majority of parents who received an interim grade report tooksome sort of action. Most talked to the child, the teacher, or both.However, a careful study of parents' remarks indicated that the kinds ofcorrective action taken were quite limited. That is, the interim reports didnot usually produce careful analysis of the child's learning difficulty nordid they lead to actions designed specifically to overcome particular barriersto effective learning.The foregoing findings caused us to reach the following conclusion:Interim grade reports are a potentially valuable means of school-homecommunication; however, the impact of this practice appears to be limited bythe need of parents for further guidance in how to respond to the particularcircumstances surrounding their child's academic difficulty. The challenge,thus, appeared to be: How could parents receive guidance that would permitthem to analyze the child's situation and to consider courses of correctiveaction?In seeking an answer to the preceding question, we allowed ourselves toconsider only solutions which would: (a) be exceedingly inexpen3ive toimplement (i.e., because of tight school budgets); (b) require no additionalpersonnel; (c) be usable within the framework of typical existing practices;(d) not be time consuming for school personnel; (e) be understandable,uncomplicated, and to the point; and (f) encourage an active, partnership rolefor parents.Academic Guidance Sheets, A solution which seemed to fulfill thepreceding six criteria was designed. It is our \"academic guidance sheets\"(i.e., \"Helping Your Child\"), of which we have prepared separate versions foruse at elementary aid secondary levels. These sheets are intended to be senthome with the interim grade reports, thereby providing parents with guidance,as needed.In connection with this suggested timing, it should be noted thatthe guidance would be of less practical value if distributed at regulargrading times. Guidance sheets would, further, appear to generate moremotivation to make corrections if distributed at times when correct.ions.- can -.make a more immediate difference. We, moreover, anticipate that parents willVI-127 15S view the guidance suggestions more positively when they can make adifferenceand perhaps even somewhat negatively if given out when thepossibility of change is already \"foreclosed\" for a grading period.The guidance sheets begin at the top of the page with an introductionthat:(a) encourages an scrive stance by the parent; (b) indicates thepurpose is to help the child perform better academically; and (c) explains howapply the guidance procedure. The procedure is divided into columns1abelled Refsons and Actiens. Parents are to read the listed \"Possiblereasons for poor work\" and to consider (i.e., analyze) whether aura themapplies.For anthat may apply they are to study and try the correspondinglynumbered action. The actions themselves may entail discussion, collaboration,supervision, monitoring, and other involvements in the child's establishmentof good study habits. Finally, general reminders appear at the bottom of thesheet that ask the parent to initiate further discussion with the teacher andothers.The guidance suggestions have been limited to a simple page. Thispage may be used as a checklist and worksheet as well.psithe Guidangt Sheets. Fitst, the sheets are to be sent home withinterim grade reports. This may be done by the individual teacher. Wheninterim reports are completed at the secondary level by all teachers at thesame tine, they are usually collected and sent home together. In this case, asingle copy of the guidance sheet would accompany the one or more deficiencyreports.The preceding discussion assumes that the guidance sheets will be seathome without comment. Another method is to send them home with the teacher'ssuggestions (e.g., noted by cheek marks or circling) about what some of thereasons may be for the academic deficiency.This method takes more teachertime; it may also result in more teacher-parent discussion.If this method isto be used at the secondary level, each teacher needs to complete a guidancesheet based on observations of the student in the particular classroom/subjectsetting.A related point is that, if the teacher checks the 'reasons', itwill also be necessary to keep some record of this to refer to in discussionswith parents.When teachers are to make suggestions about possible reasons, theintroduction should be changed at the top of the page to cover this.Forexample, in the introduction, just before the last sentence (that is, before,\"You can ask the school for more help if you need it\"), the following wordsmight be added: \"I have checked some of 'reasons' that seem to fit, based onhow I have seen your child acting in class. I hope that you will look overall the 'reasons' and decide for yourself which onL.s apply.\" Two methods of using the guidance sheets have been considered.Thefirst is less work for the teacher. The second is more personalized andpermits the tear:her to share with parents classroom observations aboutpossible reasons. We lack findings that would lead us to recommend one ofthese methods fiver the other, so the method selected should be based on localpreference.Since guidance sheets have been discussed in relation to interim gradereports, another point should be considered here. When academic deficiencies vr-i281 5a are reported, for most families this can be an unpleasant communication. Yet,it is often4poasible to say something positive about the student in the samereport(for example, \"she is trying,\" \"attendance has improved,\" \"the brought up by turning in two make-up assignments,\" etc.). In one highschool where teachers systematically made positive comments in interim gradereports, the result was that parents viewed the school's effort morepositively.Further, it should,be easier for parents to be constructive withtheir children if the emphasis of the report is not focused wholly on thestudent's shortcomings. When we.suggest this, however, we do not recommendthat teachers say positive things which they do not believe. The point is tolook for the positive; often it is there.Some parents may ask what they are expected to do with the guidancesheets.The best answer is to indicate that they are provided for theparent's use; the school does not expect to have them returned. Parents maybe instructed that school personnel hope that they will analyze the reasonsand take corrective actions as best they can, while seeking additional helpif needed.It is well, further, to emphasize with parents that perspective isimportant.This may call for discussion of these ideas: (a) there is time tocorrect the problem; (b) a failure in one subject area must be viewed in thecontext of the student's overall progress; (c) it 16 okay foe a parent to feelunable to help and to ask that someone else be allowed to do so; (d) theparent-child relationship is more important than the child's academicprogress; and (e) the parent will be more able to help the child academicallyif he or she will maintain a sense of perspective based on the foregoingpoints plus a sense of respect for the child's individuality.

As with any teaching, there is some artistryInvolved in this step. Selecting, varying, and pacing activities involvesan artistic blending of what you know about the group and about how peoplelearn, about the way one activity leads into another and about planning\"enough,\" but not \"too much.\" A few hints:Even with participants who know each other, a well-designedopening activity can help set the stage for what is tocome.It can also help you get to know the mood of yourgroup, and allow for the arrival of any latecomers. Openi'ig activities can help a group get acquainted, relax,get .n the mood to learn, become familiar with the topic,pose a pertinent problem, or achieve many other purposes.Plan at least oze activity that can be used or not used astime allows.Unless the inservice is very short, plan for more than onemethod of learning. If nothing else, use \"guided reflection\"to help teachers relate information to their own experiences. Rave the participants Aq somethingmentally, physically,emotionally, or socially.

What do youhope to accomplish? What do you need to communicate? What doyou want to communicate? Step Three: Conference PlanWhat steps can you follow during the conference to assure that youmeet your major objectives? For example, what questions will youask, what points will you make, what suggestions will you offer?Will you allow time for parents to ask questions and make comments? Step Four: MaterialsWhat materials should be shared with parents? Are they organizedin a sequence that will comp:ement your conference plan?Step Five: Action Planflow can you wind up the conference with an action orientation?What specific steps, if any, will you recommend? What ways can theparents work with you to improve their child's education? Step Six: ClosureSummarize what has been said during the conference. (Tell parentsagain what you have already told them.) End with a friendly thanksto the parents. Tell them it's nice to work with parents who arc con-cerned about their child. Step Seven: EvaluationAfter the conference, ask yourself these questions:Was I prepared?Did I have an informal setting and insure privacy?Did I use time well?Did I begin on a positive note?Did t listen attentively?Did I encourage parents to talk and offer suggestions?Did I plan withnot forthe parents?Did I learn anything new that will help me teach the child?Was I well enough informed about what's happening in myschool?If the conference could be repeated, what would I do dif-ferently?

V1-149 The previous numbered page inthe original document was blank Teacher-PaTen; ConferencesfromTeachers and Parents: A Guidc 0 Interaction and Cooperation Teacher-Parent Congerences. Individual conferences between teacher andparent permit maximum flexibility since most people communicate betterin person than in writing. Verbal exchanges also decrease thepossibilities of miscosimunication since questions can be asked andpoints clarified. In addition, they allow teachers to support theircomments about students with actual physical evidence (for example,samples of students' work). The standard teacher-parent conference isan excellent method for informing parents of their child's progress,but one requiring considerable preparation if it is to be successful..Table 1-3 is a brief outline for helping teachers prepare for such aconference.To help organize the conference, teachers should prepare an agendaand give s copy to parents at the beginning of the conference or sendone home beforehand. (See Table 1-4 for a sample agenda.) Beforebeginning a discussion of the child, teachers should review this agendawith parents, reminding them of the time limit agreed on when themeeting was scheduled..The sample agenda in Table 1-4 includes all the information theteacher plans to share with the parents. Samples of the child's workin each subject area would also be provided, whenever possible. Incommunicating specific information about the child, teachers must beaware of the parents' needs; that is, they must listen to themcarefully, answer their questions, explain each point thoroughly, andask for confirming feedback.Caution 1:interpretation of test scores end the reports ofothers.This can be a very delicate situation and should always behandled with the greatest care. First of all, labels derived from testresults useful function and should not becommunicated to parents. In many cases, these labels result in alteredexpectations, differential treatment, and at times, grossdiscrimination. By law, this information can be supplied only by theschool psychologist or the school administrator. If parents alreadyknow these labels, however, they will undoubtedly want to discuss themwith the teacher. We advocate the use of behavioral descriptions forthis task.Secondly, parents have a basic right to see all information intheir child's cumulative folder and to receive a clear explanation ofits meaning and possible consequences. Before discussing with parentsmaterials that could be potentially damaging, however, teachers should\"confer with their principal or supervisor to ensure that they presentthis information in the most appropriate manner. VT-15117,1 The previous numbered page inthe original document was blank Finally, teachers must be very cautious in interpreting to parentsinformation collected by other professionals (psychologists, socialworkers, and nurses, for example). They should never transmit thisinformation as if it were their observation but report mkt actuallymade the analysis.Caut*on 2:explanation of fchieyement testa. Most teachers feelvery comfortable in giving parents the results of achievements tests;however, few ensure that parents understand the meaning of thesescores.Grade equivalents, percentiles, and stanines make very littlesense to most parents, and when these results are used to evaluate theeffectiveness of one classroom versus another or one school districtversus another, problems usually result. Parents should understandthat the test score represents a child's standing in referoce to thenorm of the particylar test, that it is only ggs, measure of abilities,and that it only makes sense when compared with the child's dailyperformance in the classroom and in the home. The results from any onetest should be bandied very carefully since often they do not trulyrepresent a child's. ability. Daily observation in the classroom isgenerally a far superior method for evaluating a student's abilities. CgLutiCon 3:t,iminx of conferences. Teacher-parent conferences aremost often scheduled for late afternoon, often an impossible time forboth parents to attend. As Buskin (1975) points out, this results inone parent's feeling isolated and the other being burdened with theresponsibility of explaining the conference discussion to the absentparent.When everything is going well, this can be a pleasant duty.When there are problems, however, the presence of both parents greatlyincreases the likelihood of finding a successful solution. Since thenumbers of single-parent families and those in which both parents workare growing, we are very tempted to advocate that all teacher-parentconferences and meetings be scheduled in the early evening.Admittedly, having teachers work a fourteen-hour day is unrealistic.Nevertheless, parenting should .be a partnership, and schools should doeverything possible to encourage the full participation of all parents,we believe.Failing to do so will very likely result in an unsatis-factory resolution of the child's difficulties.

The way the secretary answers the telephone, meets and greets parents, fields questions, attends to orignores people standing at the desk, smiles or glares often creates a parent's first impression of school. Other support and servicepersonnelbus drivers, custodians, food service workers, and aidesare also an im?.part of a total schoolic communication to the home. This fact is immediately obvious to anyone working in or served by a school. Yet, in a recent survey of a random sample of service.: personnel in the Appalachian Region, only 7 percent of those responding had received any training related to working with parents. Nearly 35 percent of the respondents indicated they were interested in such training; 42 percent were not; and 23 percent did not respond to the question. Parent-related topics they were interested in were public relations (26%), parent-child interaction (24%), discipline (18%), and nutrition (14%). Most (almost 80%) of these same people reported that they co...lunicw-e with parents on a regular basis about such topic', as discipline, lunches, illness, school work, school activities, bus routes, and safety (Spriggs, 1983). Fifty-eight percent (58%) felt these talks were helpful to parents because as a result parents were better informed and understood a situation better. Support and service personnel also thought the talksimproved communication between the home and school. They reported Oat their interaction., with parents helped them understand the students and their parents better. It is clear that support and service personnel influence and are a part of a school's relationship with the home. Consequently, they should receive some help in carrying out that aspect of their job. Guides for Staff DevelopmentAlthough there are thousands of service and support personnel in schools throughout the United States, there is very little research to tell us how to provide staff development on school-home relations and communications, The recommendations we are making have been inferred from AEL's survey data from what little information we found in the literature, and extensive discussions with school administrators and staff developers who work with service personnel.Sound principles of adult education--including motivation techniques--are included as appropriate.Administrators set the expectations. An important method of staff development for service personnel is establishing high expectations and modeling appropriate behavior.Administrators should begin this in the hiring process.During the initial interview, ask questions such as, \"In what ways do you see yourself involved in school-community relations?\" and \"What could you do to helpschool-familycommunication?\" The administrator's expectations concerning that person's role and behavior as it impacts school-family communications should be made clear and specific before the person is hired. The administrator and other certified staff should also model respect, cordiality, friendliness, and diplomacy so that service personnel are constantly reminded of appropriate behavior. That works for new hires, but most support and service personnel have been in the school system for a long time.Over half the respondents VII -2 to AEL's survey had been employed in that district seven or more years. Ifservice personnel need reminding or retraining in school-home-communityrelations, what should the school do?Determine specific needs and conduct staff development activities tomeet those needs. Use the needs assessment planning process outlined inSection III or in other resources to develop a program that teaches peoplewhat they need to know. Remember that for our purposes a \"need\" is defined asa mismatch between preferred\" (Shively, 1982; and service personnel, \"what is preferred\" interms of their role in school-family relations is usually unspecified. Theirtraining is usually job-related (Spriggs, 1983). Moreover, schools and schooladministrators may be less than clear on \"what is preferred.\" Some hardthinking and setting of priorities may be in order. In other words, the firststep in staff development may not be with service personnel at all, but withparents, administrators, policy and advisory boards, and '-ommunity peopl,_ toobtain consensus on \"what is preferred.\" This could be done at the same timepriorities are set for certified school personnel. AEL has guides for the wayschools can conduct needs assessments to establish those priorities anddetermine the discrepancies between what is and what should be. See AppendixD for a summary of the process and how to obtain complete information.To get \"what is\" and \"what is preferred\" information from support andservice personnel, as well as considerable insight into sources of problemsand barriers, you may want to use a variety of measures, such as a small groupdiscussion or \"on the job\" observation, rather than written surveys. One_trainer experienced in teaching human relations skills to the drivers said shegot much of her information from a regular ten-minute \"open discussion\" at the VII-3 beginning of each staff development period. She could determine recurrentthemes, nonproductive attitudes, and counterproductive rules laid down by the central office. Training cannot overcome behavior mandated by a supervisor!Once needs have been identified, the rest of the planning process can proceed.Good staff development is effective with all people, so use theprinciples in Section III to guide planning and implementation.Only a few itenerpl topics apply to 411 school personnel. The broad topics that apply to all school personnel--professional, paraprofessional,support and service--are: A.Human Relations and School Climate B.Working as a Team C.Maintaining Confidentiality and School Ethics D.Appropriateness of the Topics Discussed with Parents A.Human Rel#40ns:Some training in human relations could be done with the entire staff,especially to share schoolwide expectations of employees. For example, the Ten Commandments of Human Relations could be distributed, discussed, andposted where all staff can see them. People can help each other keep the commandments. Ten Commandments of Rnman Relations 1.Speak to people.cheerful word of 2.Smile at people.only 14 to smile.There is nothing as nice as agreeting.It takes 72 muscles to frown, 3.Call s)eople by name.

What counts most inlife is what we do for others.Much of the \"affective\" and human relations training that schools do canbe adapted for all school personnel. B.Build Team Spirit:The entire utaff, led by the administrator, can build and maintain a team spirit to support each other. Support and service personnel need to know they are a part of the total school programincluding school-family relations--and that they are valued, appreciated, and depended on. Some of this can be done indirectly.Include them in parties and birthday celebrations; acknowledgetheir contributions in school newsletters; include them by name in the school handbook; and recognize specific praiseworthy behavior both orally and in writing.Often parents and children do not know the names of specialists, support, and service personnel. Include them in the school handbook to help everyone.An example of the way one school did this is on the next page. The half page goes opposite the listing of teaching and administrative staff.

In accepting the honor, the custodian said, \"I'm happy that I was picked torepresent all those backup people within the school system--the clerks, the secretaries, the cooks, the bus drivers, the custodians, the people who help the schools run. These are the people who register the kids, feed the kids, fix up the building when sometl,ing breaks down. In the past they'verecognized teachers, principals, and school board presidents. I'm glad thatfinally they're recognizing the rest of us, too\" (Bingham, 1984, p. A-2).No one could have better expressed the importance of gi the team.Special training in school-home communications is another way torecognize the importance of all school personnel in maintaining productive relations with families. Administrators and teachers should keep servicepeisonnel informed of all notices, special events, or changes that might affect them.If some parents are coming for lunch, let the lunchroom staff know!If a parent organization has special needs for night meetings, let the custodian know. These communications positively influence the way staffcommunicate with parents. Administrators should attend at least some of the inservice training for each group. The presence of a person in anadministrative position at a staff development meeting for service personnelgives that meetilt, the status and credibility it can get in no other way. C.gatillIfilgaiikaltlitl-AaA10001 Ethics:\"Don't tell tales out of school\" applies to ljt people working in the school setting. AEL's research shows that service and support personnel talk VII-7 regularly with parents. Some of this conversation may be informal and in settings outside of the school, such as occurs in small towns or rural communities where everybody knows everybody, creating the \"support network\" characteristic of -uch communities. But whether in or out of the school setting, everyone working in a school needs to know that they have privileged information.They need to know that information about certain incidents andsituations ds:pgtaismsekjanhscobudi. Anyone working in a school learns much about children, families, and the other staff. Frequently what they know is only part of the total picture, and a lot of damage can be done by idle gossip or discussion. All school people need to be reminded of professional ethics.Hypothetical examples specific to the various positions people hold will help make abstract concepts such as \"confidentiality,\" \"privileged information,\" \"discretion,\" and \"privacy\" real and applicable to the everyday ecisions they make. D.Appropriateness of Topics tp Discuss With Parents: Support and service personnel reported that they talked with parents about school work, discipline, and school activities, as well as topics specifically related to their service area, such as lunches and bus safety. It may be that service personnel need training in what is appropriate to discuss, and what they do if a parent brings up homework, grades, discipline problems, and other concerns specific to individual children and families. Service personnel may need coaching in how to diplomatically refer a parent to the teacher or principal, as well as knowing when to do so.They should know bow a parent can contact the school, and know what topics are \"off-limits\" to discuss.Make examples specific to tl situation the person is likely to be caught in.For example, what is an VII -8 aide to say if a parent asks \"Row is Shawn really doing?\" What is the custodian to say if an old friend asks, \"What really happened in that fight out on the playground? My kid says one thing and the principal says something else?\"Training Specific to Specialized AreasMost staff development for support and service personnel should bespecific to their particular areas. Local administrators can do much to set expectations` by meeting separately with each group at the beginning of each year.While this technique can be likened to \"preventive\" staff development, it may be more effective than \"picking up the pieces.\"We have not prepared examples of inservice training sessions as we did for teachers and principals. Rather, we are making recommendations andsuggestions to guide the development of training sessions to meet locally identified needs and situations.Know thg cvmmunitv And job skyation of the peoPle von are working with. The driver of a small van that bounces along a gravel road to deliver ten children to farms spread out over 15 or 20 miles has a different relationship to the school and families than the employee of a company that has a contract with the school to transport 60 children per bus through heavy city traffic. Their training needs may be quite different. In many communities, bus drivers have more contact and communication with parents than any other school person. In some schools, lunch money and lunch tickets are handled by the teachers; in others, by the lunch manager in the school. If food service personnel are dealing directly with parents and children on free or reduced- payment lunches, forgotten or lost lunch money or tickets, they'll need many skills in diplomacy and judgment. If a school is beginning a program of VII-9 inviting parents to lunch or breakfast on a given day, food service personnel may need help in planning how to handle these extra people so that everyone remains gracious and welcoming.Much training should be situationspecific. Highly educated teachers have difficulty transferring general information to their classroom situation (Bruce & Showers, 1983). Planners of staff development for service personnel must make general principles as specific, concrete, and directly applicable to a person's job situation as possible.One way to help do this is to take over another's duties or work along with the other staff people for a day. Some highlevel executives and elected officials make it a regular practice to anonymously take the position of their employees or constituents for a day. Since most staff development planners have come up through the ranks of teachers, they might gain valuable insights by stepping into another job to find out what it is reskly like. Use a wide varj-etv oi< traising tecbniaues. Because of the small number of custodians, secretaries, bus drivers, and other support staff in any one building or area, training may need to be somewhat different from that of certified personnel. Some staff development can be individualized. For example, one effective administrator watches for local offerings on telephone skills and public relations for secretaries, such as those sponsored by local businesses or management seminars. Another individualized technique is to arrange for a staff member to visit and work with a colleague in another school who can model and demonstrate the desired human relations attitudes and skills.Support and service staff like to get out of the building to see what other people in similar positions are doing. This provides valuable learning opportunities, in the same way that teachers learn from a visitation day or conference. VII -10 Keep concepts and goals simple and specific. \"Always smile and say'hello' to people coming into the building\" may have more impact than longdiscussions about human relations.Coach the night custodians (and others) to ask \"May I help you?\" \"Referparents to the teacher or principal when they ask about school discipline orgrades\" is a simple policy which is clear.Teach service personnel how to talk with and guide childrenconstructively. Bus drivers, for example, often have charge of as manychildren as a classroom teacher. Drivers need to be able to talk anddiscipline children in a way that is effective but not harsh. Acommunicationto the children is one to the home, also. Remember that support and service Personnel in some, communities may' becloser to parents mad homes Oen teachers and administraml. If there arecultural, ethnic, or language differences, support and service personnel mayhelp narrow those differences. They may know what parents and the communityare thinking and feeling long before teachers and a inistrators do. Solicit their insights and perceptions. Sometimes they are short on training but long on wisdom.Staff development can supply training to complement the wisdom. VII-11 REFERENCES Bingham, J.(1984, September 5).

Section VIIIEspecially for Families Most home-school communications are about an individual child's progress in school or general information about policies, dates, people, and other school matters. But families need and are interested in other kinds of information, education, and involvement as well.If there is anything that we have learned about school-home relations, it is that there are many ways for schools and homes to cooperate, and -hat no one way is \"superior.\" They accomplish different purposes. Almost always schools, families, and children benefit.All aspects of family functioning influence children's performance in school.Death, drugs, abuse, unemployment, poverty, and hunger can cripple even the best teachers' and schools' efforts. Other more subtle factors- also influence family effectiveness: Is the household at least moderately well-organized? Do parents know how to provide for their child's development and safety?Talk and play with the child? Get the TV off so older children can study and 1ger ones get to bed? Know how to use available community resources, including the school, to strengthen and enrich family life and their child's education and development?Some families -- frequently thosc whose children do well in school- -seem to do these things \"naturally.\" But many others do not. Some families havespecial needshandicapped children or a traumatic change in family structure following death, divorce, or remarriage. Families caught in a cycle of Ir.w educational achievement and poverty also have special needs in relation to the school (Gotta, 1984). In this section are ideas and resources appropriate for schools to use to help families function more effectively. Some are related directly.tochildren's performance in school, such as suggestions for \"tote bags\" to help yoengsters organize their school work and personal belongings. Others are indirect, such as making available brochures, booklets, and sources of information on all aspects of family life in a \"Family Information Center\" or \"Parent Restatrce Room.\" We give samples, sources, and savestions for use. As a continuation of our approach throughout this Resource Notebook, we urge you to continue to revise as new material becomes available, sources become obsolete, and as 'Local strengths and needs indicate. We are not suggesting that schools become all things to the family. Rather, we are suggesting that in their communications with families, schools can do much ta strengthen them. A narrow focus on the family only in relation to Shawn's arithmetic and Keri's spelling denies reality. Many of the activities we suggest can be organized and implemented by a volunteer committee of parents and school staff.Such a process has been carried out and documented by the Special Needs Families Project at AEL (Snow, 1984),Details of the process and the results are available on request. The Special Needs Families Project has also compiled much information on Parent Resource Centers, some of which is included here.More is available from A1L. Some of these activities can be implemented by an active parent-teacher organization or parent-advisory council.

I VIII-4 Bow to Work W44th a Schoolby Oralie McAfeeProfessor of EducationMetropolitan State CollegeDenver, Colorado For most children, the end of summer signifies .4 ned school and newteacher, whether it's nursery school, a child-care center, elementary,middle or high school. The wise parent get to know that school andthat Oild's teachers, so school and home can work together. \"But him?\" you ask. You're busy, the teachers are busy, and youaren't sure that seta' ls really want parents around, anyway. Not so.Most schools seek closer cooperation with homes, especiallyin this time of tight budgets and increased expectations.Schooladministrators, teachers and secretaries suggest the following \"pointersfor parents\" who want better communication:Get acquainted with people in the school early in theyear.Don't wait for a problem to arise.If possible, visit the school. That will help you knowmore about the way the school is organized, the way therooms are arranged and the children grouped.It helps to know where your child will be and the kindof organization he or she will be in.If you can't visit, use the telephone to introduceyourself to the secretary, teacher and principal.Mostschools have certain hours when teachers can be reachedby telephone.Post the school's number in a handy placeso you don't have to look it up every time.Find out whether teachers and administrators want youto make an appointment or just drop by.If you make anappointment, but sure to keep it.Have a friendly tone in your voice, a sincere smile andsomething positive to say, even if it is followed bysomething not so positive. If you are confident andsupportive, other people are likely to react the sameway.Remember that teachers, principals, and other schoolpeople are human. Treat them as individuals, not asstereotypes.For example, learn and use their names.Support the school's effort to keep parents informed andinvolved.Read and keep in a convenient place informationfrom the school, such as the school calendar, handbook VIII -5 and notices.If a response Is asked for, respond. Goto parent-teacher conferences, open houses and meetings.Many schools recognize that parents work away from homeduring the day and schedule conferences and meetingsat times today's parents can attend. If your schooldoesn't, request it.Try to take care of a problem of concern closest to itssource.Talk to the teacher first, then the principal.If you are not satisfied with these responses, find outwho you should see or what you should do next. Mostdistricts have procedures for you to follow.Call or go to school looking for solutions, not someoneto blame.If you are really upset at your child, theteacher or the school, take time to cool down beforedoing or saying anything. Think and talk about problemsand solutions, not personalities. Try to see the wholepicture before placing blame or responsibility onanyone.Be sure to keep the school up to date on your telephonenumber, work or address changes and how to reach you inan emergency.If something happens at home that might influence theway your child acts at school, let the teacher know.Maybe someone is in the hospital or has lost a job orthere is a divorce. Children worry about those things,and teachers will be more understanding if they know. Get to know your older children's schools, too.Parentsoften show a lot of interest in what their first-graderdoes, but leave their adolescent's schooling strictly upto them.Teen-agers might not want Mom or Dad visitingclass, but you and they nee4, to work closely with theschool on college and career requirements and on theiracademic progress.Get to know other parents in the school. Workingtogether, you can help strengthen and preserve the manyexcellent things schools are doing and let teachers,principals and school boards know that you appreciateand value that excellence. How to talk to a teacher by George S. Morrison,Professor of Education,Florida international UniversityMrs. Gilbert has just come home aftera busy day at work. As she sits down torelax for a minute before preparingdinner, the phone rings.\"Hello, Mrs. Gilbert? This is MaryLogan. Tommie's teacher. I'd like todiscuss a few things with you. Have aminute?\"Panic! \"Oh, no, what has he donenow? What am i going to say?\" thinksMrs. Gilbert.Meanwhile, across town, Juan Garciahas sat down to dinner. He asks hischildren, \"How did things go at schooltoday?\" His inquiry is greeted withmumoied assurances of \"OK...\"His youngest daughter. Ana, cud-denly says, \"Oh, Papa, I forgot to tellyou. I have a note from my teacher, shewants to have a conference with you orMommie.\" Mr. Garcia gets a knot in hisstomach. \"A conference? What for?What about?\" Ana shrugs don't know.\"These scenes of uncertainty aboutparent-teacher communication are notuncommon. Parents are faced with theneed to talk to their children's teachersbut don't know wrist to say or how tosay it.This insecurity cuts across culturesand socioeconomic lines but Is prob.aoly most common in parents whohave little contact with schools or feelalienated from them.Parents who have been rebuffed ortreated unfairly in previous attempts intalking with teachers are not likely togreet enthusiastically an invitation tocorn* to school for a conference. Buteven parents without such experiencesmay feel tension.The following guidelines are designedto help relieve anxiety and improvecommunication with teachers.a Develop interest and Involvementin your child's school, programs, activ-ities. and curriculum.Responsibility for being interestedin the school, classroom activities. andprogram of studies comes with being aparent. When children know theirparents are interested, they are mots-voted to do their best. Also, whenparents are interested in their children'sclasses, they have something to talkabout with their children and theirchildren's teachers. Finally, teachersare attentive and responsive to parentswho show an interest in their children.3 Don't think you are wasting ateacher's time. instead, act as thoughyou expect teachers to give you thetime needed to answer questions andto develop a program so your childrencan succeed.Sometimes parents are afraid theyare \"bothering\" the teacher when theyask for help. But many leachers wel-come the chance to about how processand parent-teacher relationships.s Initiatecommunicationwithteachers and school administrators.The beginning of this article describedparents who waited for teachers to getin touch with them. Many parentsassume that if they don't hear from theteacher, everytiiing is all right, but thismay not be the case. Parents shouldtake the initiative and talk with teachersbefore It is necessary for teachers totalk to them.Some teachers may Inver contactthe emote. Or when they do, It may betoo late ro help the child. A problemcan be handled best In its early stages.Unfortunately, parents are usually con-tacted when a behavior problem hasbecome serious or the lack of achieve-ment Is feuding to grade failure.Parents should contact teachers afew weeks after school has started andimmediately after every grading period.Make an appointment to visit theteacher rather than just showing up at',aloof. If you have difficulty getting aconference withateacher,don'thesitate to get help from the schooladministration.

You can includeactivities and work done at home aswell as at school. Work samples giveparents and teachers a basis for talkingabout a child's abilities and can helpresolve misconceptions that may existVIII -7as to what can and should be learned.Make contacts with school andteacher a positive experience.Start with a positive attitude. Don'tgo to school expectingtrouble or aconfrontation. Rather, \"zoom to helpand be helped.

Many community agen-cies can provide specialized servicesfree or at a nominal fee.3Treat teachers as consultants.Teachers have knowledge and ideasthat can help you and your children.They are trained In education methods.learning theories, behavior manage-ment, and child development. Theydon't have all the answers to your chil-dren's problems, but their backgroundand experiences make them experts Inmany areas. Questions such as, \"Doyou feel this behavior is abnormal forthis grid, and age level?\" and \"Howdo you suggest I handle this?' enableyou to take advantage of theteacher'sknowledge.if you anticipate a potential problem,ask for suggestions about how to han-dle It.

Instead, pose questions requiring explanationsthat not only keep you posted but also help your student say howhe or she will complete an assignment. For instance, don't ask,\"Didn't you have a chapter to read in Social Studies?\" Instead,ask, \"Row do you plan to read and study that chapter in SociciStudies?\"Know your son's or daughter's schedule of classes. Then youwill be better able to ask specific questions on content,assignments and study techn iques.Help provide a regular, well-equipped place for study that isfree of interruptions. Some types of music do helpconcentration. Chores, phone calls, and drop-in visitors shouldnot occur during study time.Learn about and help your son or daughter practice good timemanagement.It is not the amount of time but the quality oftine used that produces effective results. Students achievequality use of time by understanding assignments, having a planto co icy fete them efficiently by blocking time' periods forstudying and completing specific assignments, and by doingimportant things first.Discuss specific study techniques your child uses in readingassignments and completing homework. Some skills, such asscanning for key words, apply to many subject areas, butplotting information in word problems in math may be a singlesubject area skill. Find out what the teacher is suggesting anduse those approaches.Rave your student demonstrate the way he or she takes notes indifferent subject areas, how he prepares for various 'kinds oftests, and how she plans her time and uses different skills inlong-term assignments. You may be able to sake some suggestionsfor improvement.Once your son or daughter has identified a study problem, workwith your student in arriving at a solution. Some schools havestudy skills booklets, or there are commercial study skillsbooks you may wish to explore. Ask your school.Good study skills should become habits. They take time to learnand master, as do learning to swim or to type. After your childhas mastered the skills, he/she can apply them naturally to savetime and to be more successful. Be sure to praise your son ordaughter when they use good study habits. *Adapted slid used courtesy of Dr. Charles McLain, Jefferson CountySchools, Colorado.VIII-9The previous numbered page Mthe original dcrument was blank TWENTY Tips FOR TAMIN0,--AND TEACHING WITH TVcompiled by Oralie McAfee Ten Tips f_cq Taming 1.Put TV in an out-of-the-way place.2.Have interesting things to do that are more attractive than thetelevision show.3.Be a good model.

And these experts are worried.increased our concern for physical fitness forphysical welfare has declined. Why?Reasons seem to include lots of television watching, reduction ofphysical education programs in schools and day care centers because of thestress on providing basic subjects, working parents who come home tooexhausted to provide physical activities for their children, and thecurrent adult craze for physical fitness. Yes, we /Americans take trends soseriously that many adults who are actively involved in keeping their bodiesin shape have less tine to spend with their children.There are steps parents can take to assure their childrens' physicalhealth:Recognize that proper physical development is as importantas proper intellectual, emotional, and social development.When you exercise, include the kids. Jog with them,cycle with them, walk with them, hike and swim with them.Choose a health club that encourages participation ofchildrenand provides for physical activities forchildren of all ages.Demand that programs your children attend--day care, school,after school care, etc.--provide regular quality physicaleducation experiences for all children.Take children to playgrounds on a regular basis, or buildone in your backyard.Make physical *cavity a regular family experience.

There aresoccer teams, little league, etc. Pallet and folk dancingoffered by community centers and schools provides a good formof disciplined exercise. Not, only is this excellent exercise,but children gain a sense of self-confidence by performing. Analyse your weekly schedule. Is there any place where youcould walk with your children, rather than ride--to the baby-sitter, store, church, playground? Maybe you could walktwice a week.Also, when time permits, park a little fartheraway from the store, movie theater, or school. Children learn a great deal of enjoyment from physical activities.They also learn skills that will help them in other areas. Dance teaches alove of music and sense of rhythm and sequence. When climbing, childrenlearn rbout nature, weather, and challenge. Sports teach rules about groupactivities.But the most important thing is the children are developingphysical ability and potential.In our family we avoid competitive activities and activitiesinappropriate to our children.' physical development. Select free andinexpensive activities the entire family can enjoy together.Habits children develop early in life will continue into adulthood.Walking, jogging, cycling, strolling through the dusk for a relaxingevening, and hiking the mountains as a family will have a lasting impact onchildren and transfer to their adult lives.Parents must provide the model for these experiencesand they must bestarted when the child is young.

A 2.3 VIII-16 Help Your Child Get Organised for Success in SchoolBy Bonnie McCullough Help your child get organized for school.It is a good stepping stone for responsibility, it will help the childto be a better student, and it will improve his self-concept by handlinghomework and little details Like school notices and permission slips.Help your children keep track of their things by putting their nameson everything from notebooks to mittens. Markers work on many surfaces,and gummed address labels are convenient for others. Order fabric namelabels from local fabric shops and stitch them in coats, hats and gloves.It takes such a little time but the returns .on lost, stolen, and misplaceditems are terrific.Start the \"bag habit.\" Have the child take a backpack or tote bag toschool.The children put notes to parents, finished work, permission slips,and library books in their bags to be taken home at the end of the A4y. Athome, the bags became the \"gathering point\" for things to be returned toschool.The amazement comes as those children advance through their elementaryyears and maintain the habit. Success at school depends on how youorganize and keep track of papers and things as well es on bow much youknew.Most children take school seriously and want to succeed at it. Asimple vehicle such as the bag helps the children get organized andincreases confidence in their ability to handle the school experience.Luckily, backpacks and tote bags are in. Help your child get started offon a good foot and begin reinforcing this pattern early in the year. Youwill need to establish an acceptable place for the bag to be kept at home.Keep a family calendar on which you correlate activities andcommitments.Encourage your child to, transfer his or her school businessonto the calendar: minimal days, photos, parties, field trips, practices,rehearsals and meetings. Children can begin this time management skillearly and reap the rewards their whole lives.One family made the children responsible for getting up and off toschool from the beginning v;thout parental prodding. The family traditionwas to purchase an alarm clock for each child when he started school. Ifthe child had difficulty getting up, the. alarm clock was the bad guy, notthe parent.These children were learning personal responsibility.Children do not have enough intrinsic aotivatio to do ham cork ontheir own.Parents should not take over or do the ac al work for thechild, but there are three basics: time, placepand su port. Create an environment where learning is =ovation:it.Provide a tableor desk, good lighting, and proper suplies (paper, pen, pencil, dictionary,atlas, etc.) VIII-17 P.As a parent, be available to discuss or support. Do not take over.'Instead of telling the child what to do, help him or her see what to do.Trythe questioning techn;que: \"What homework do you have tonight?\"\"When do youplan on doing it?\" \"Will you be needing any assistance?\" Don't ride yourkids- -there is a difference between hassling and encouraging. Designate a time for homework. It is so hard to \"find\" time and mucheasier to nave work periods set aside. Daily short sessions are betterthan one long cramming session. Keep them 30 minutes or less until the .child's interest and aptitude increase. Since Friday is the day mostreports are due and quizzes take place, it may be necessary to schedulesome of your adult time to practice spelling words or proof reports onThursday evening. For sure, don't rent a movie or turn on TV and expectthe kids to do homework while you are watching. Lock over your child's papers when they are sent home, be interestedin what the child is studying and how the papers are marked. Encourage your children to succeed at school without doing their workfor them and you'll be initiating patterns of life-long success. Reprinted courtesy of Bonnie McCullough and the Denver Post.

Pack!. aud 9ther Organisers\"Not too many years ago, a sturdy school bag with a handle; pockets forpencils, crayons, a ruler; and compartments for papers and books was anessential part of growing up and going to school. The school bag, carried from home to school and back by the child, licked the twq, institutions thatwere concerned with his or her growth and learning\" (Nedler & McAfee 11979).Old fashioned school bags are not in style and have absolutely no statis,.buttote bags, day packs, bicycle packs, and small back packs definitely are \"in.\" Schools and families can take advantage of that trend to:establish a regular communication system between hove andschool;emphasize that neither home nor school can work alone;unobtrusively get reading material, paper, pencils, and otheressential study tools into homes that lack them; andhelp the youngster and the home get organized for home studyand for getting essential materials back and forth in anorganized way. Anyone who has ever been outside a schoolbuilding on a windy day or has peeked inside a school bus on=day has seen the futility of sending home loose papers.Older children have sports gear and personal items, as well asbooks and papers to keep organized.In some communities and schools, suggesting that each child have a tote bag or pack clearly labeled with his or her name may be all that is needed. Send home a copy of the article, \"Help Your Child Get Organized for Success intaho-o-4\"-on-the-previous page to tell parents how to use the bag ox pack and give other tips for organizing as well. You may reproduce the article.In some schools, a more organized effort may be needed, as parents maynot have money or motivation to act on a suggestion.If your school isincreasing homework expectations, sending more books, messages, and samples of children's homework, or trying to encourage parents to communicate with the school, consider the following ways to encourage a home-school bag for every child.VIII-19206 Encourage the student council, parent-teacher organization, oranother school group to consider this as a project. Sturdytote bags are not expensive, and they can easily be imprintedwith the school name, slogan, or symbol to help build schoolpride and spirit. Sell them for enough profit to provideevery child with one. Write the child's name on the bag inprominent letters before it leaves school. Permanent inkofelttip pens will provide a quick and lasting identification.Get a group of parents together to make bags for every child.The raw material is not expensive, and the problew of \"haves\"and \"have-nots\" doesn't come up. An art teacher, art student,or one of the parents talented in art can set up the silkscreening process to identify the school. in addition toaccomplishing a worthwhile project, parents will enjoy the funand fellowship of working together. Such a project may nothave the \"high-tech\" glamour of raising money for amicrocomputer, but may have a greater impact on children'ssuccess in school.If all else fails, the school can use heavy duty manilaenvelopes for sending work home. Sometimes called \"Fridayenvelopes,\" there is no reason they can't be used more often.The school name or logo on the outside is nice, but notessential.The child's name is.Youngsters in secondary schools present a different challenge.In all likelihood, they are going to carry whatever is thecurrent fad at their schools. Student council, schoolleaders, or school traditions may help them develop and usethe back pack, casually slung over one shoulder, to organizetheir material, but peer influence is more likely to prevail. Parent Information or Resource metersParent information or resource centers can range all the way from a bulletin board with a pocket chart for pamphlets to a tighly organized library with books, cassettes, learning materials for parents and children, and filmstrips organized and run by a person skilled in parent education.Whether simple or elaborate, the purpose is the same: To provide parents with information that will increase their knowledge and skill in family child development, and child education.Both the concept and its implementation are quite straightforward and relatively simple to carry out. The idea is that parents often lack the VIII-20 information they need about family life, child rearing, home management,guiding, disciplining, and enjoying children as they grow and develop, as wellas other things you have to know and do to create a family that nurtures all its members.If they have the information, they will be able to put it into practice.Now, such an assumption may or may not be correct, but familiescertainly can't apply any information without having it! And that is whatParent Information Centers or Parent Resource Centers supply.Creating an attractive and inviting \"parent space\" in the lobby, fronthall, or an empty classroom is a powerful communication to parents in and of itself.It says;Come in!You are welcome here! Sit down, relax, andvisit with us for a few minutes. This school valuesyou and your family, and knows that we need each otherto educate children. If you are interested in andwould like to read one of the pamphlets, take it. Youcan check out a book or a cassette tape to take homefor more information.Such resource centers are usually f)und in early childhood or elementaryschools where parents come relatively often. Since parents go to 4secondary schools less often, a general parent information center might notbe appropriate. Powever, parents gi come to school for open houses,college nights, and special events. Tables with \"take one\" informationitems on school, family, and child concerns might be worth experimenting with.Families of Adolescents have no less need for relevant informationthan those with young children; their need may simpl7 be different. Aninformation or resource center should be as close and convenient to parentsas possible--preferably in the school where their children go. One center in the district office won't do it. In rural areas, consider working withthe local library system and the bookmobile service, as well as featuringthe resource center at special events. VIII-21 2L'S BEST CC'How does an administrator, a group of parents and teachers, a media specialist, or whoever is the organizing group get started?As stated earlier, AEL has in-depth guidelines and research on how to involve families with special needs in planning, organizing, and implementing such a program.Use the following steps as a guide: 1.Organize a small working committee. Be sure to includeparents and the school principal. If families of olderchildren are to be involved, the children may have excellentinsights on what parents may want or need to know. 2.Refer to the results of any family and community needsassessment to determine what families would like to knowmore about.if such information is not available, AELhas a carefully designed and tested luestionnaire thatyou might want to use. It is available in both Spanishand English versions.

Just as important,they keep a project moving forward, with priorities anddirections immediately available.

There are a multitude of these, butlocating them is something like a non-stop scavenger hunt.Popular magazines, professional journals, and governmentpublications are not only good sources in and of themselves,but they often have listings of available publications oradvertisements that include items to send for. Local, county,and state agencies are other sources. The Extension Serviceof the Department of Agriculture almost always has a varietyof timely, factual, and reliable material related to familylife and child rearing. Sometimes this material is specific toregional or local concerns --a real plus. Non-profitfoundations and organizations develop and distributeinformation on an amazing variety of subjects. Somesupermarkets distribute excellent pamphlets related to healthand nutrition.Medical and dental groups are also goodsources.We have listed a number of resources at the end ofthis section, but don't stop there. Funding and interest comesand goes, and new material comes out almost daily. Seek outlocal sources, scour the magazines, and write for samples ofanything free. Prepare a form letter that explains what youare doing and that you need a listing, sample of materials,and any other information they can send.Don't forget your own state, county, and local school system.There are recommendations that schools should do more toinvolve parents in children's learning activities at home.Most schools have a wealth of material on that subject. Ifspecific needs for home learning are identified by theteachers in a local school, the parent information center mayhave or be able to find something to help. If not, get acurriculum specialist or teacher to write it!

Likewise, you can be sure that the last chapter or section in books on staff development, educational improyement, implementation of new programs, or almost any educational activity will be on evaluation.And so it is with this Resource Notebook. Yet, evaluation should be only one phase of the planning process. It is \"not a conclusion but a new beginning\" (Mertz, 1983, p. 59), as shown in the diagram below. Assess Needsand Interests Report ResultsDevelop Goalsand Objectives Evaluate Program ImplementActivitiesIdentify Resources:People, Materials,Time, Space, Money Design1Activities \"Rather than being a destination, evaluation is a map, or progress report that answers two questions: \"Where are we?Where do we go from here?\" (Mertz, 1983, p. 59).Ehjais to be evaluated and Ige We are recommending that local schools and school districts implement a staff development program to help the school and individual teachers in the school improve school-family relations and communications. The desired ead result is, of course, a \"better\" education for children.To help achieve that result, we have suggested a number of related goals: better staff develorlent in school-family relations and communicatious; co increase in the quantity, variety, and quality of school-home communications; and use of a systematic planning process for staff development, as well as specific examples of things administrators, teachers and specialists, and service and support peaonnel can do for and with parents. Some decision has to be made about which aspects of this multi-faceted approach will be evaluated and gi that will be done. Ideally, of course, all aspects should be evaluated.The chart on the following page illustrates the complexity of the task. 221 IX-2 Evaluation Concerns* Evaluation of staff development typically has five basic concerns: the content, the presenter, the participants'behaviors, short- and long-term, and the impact on student learning. The chart below addresses these concernson six levels, ranging from purpose through type of 1983. Columbus, Ohio:Ohio Department of Education. TX-3222BEST Realistically, we must also ask lam is to evaluate and when? Mostteachers, administrators, and staff development people already have full schedules.Some have little or no background in research and evaluation, andusually only large districts have an institutional research section.Descriptions of the ideal evaluation are sometimes so far from what localschools can do that schools may simply do nothing--a mistake, even if anunderstandable one. So, in this evaluation section we are going to do what we have done in the other sections: List and discuss the general principles thatshould guide evaluation of projects and processes of this nature; give avariety of examples and resources at several levels of precision anddifficulty; and refer you to appropriate sources for further info tion.In this way, local schools and school districts can construct and condoevaluation that will be useful to them, answer the questions they n to ask, and will ultimately help them improve communications with the families they serve.Informal judgments and evaluations about inservice training,communicating with parents, and the influence of school-family relations are made all the time. School personnel evaluate when they say \"I wish we couldhave more inservices like this one,\" or \"If I have to sit through one more ofthese...!\" Teachers evaluate when they wish, \"If only there were some way toreach these parents, some way to get them to show an interest in what we'redoing.\" Principals evaluate when they say, \"I don't understand this absentee rate; don't the parents know the youngsters can't learn unless they are here?\" or \"Everyone seemed to enjoy last year's open house. Shall we just do it the same way?\"Gathering information to do systematic evaluation of staff developmentand school-family communications may make these evaluations more accurate. IX-4223 Even more important, such systematic evaluation can guide the development of more acceptable, effective, and efficient programs. Evaluation done for thispurpose--formative evaluation--gives everyone concerned a chance to assess what's going on and make revisions or \"mid-course corrections\" to improve what is being done.Sunmative evaluation is usually done at the conclusion of a given program or course of action. Its purposes are to provide evidence of overall programeffectiveness and to provide information to guide decisions about future programs.In formative evaluation, sunmative evaluation, and points in between, remember that the purpose of evaluation is not to decide \"Did we fail?\" or \"Did we succeed?\" Instead, it is to document \"We did thit, with theseresults,\" and to suggest future directions.With this brief introduction, let's look at some of the principles that should guide evaluation.Decide what you want to find out.Involve participants in planning the evaluation.Whenever possible collect baseline infornation 'o that progresscan be determined.Relate evaluation directly to the objectives of the trainingsession, program, or whatever is being evaluated.Use a variety of measures.Use both immediate and follow-up measures.Use data-gathering techniques that are not burdensome.Share results with those who have a need and a right to know. Decide what you want to find out. Most inservice education is related to teachers' instructional practices in the classroom. Staff development in school-hone communication adds another dimension to an already complex evaluation problem. Let's look at examples of some possible questions. Each \"-5224 schoolwill have its own. 1.Was the workshop or inservice training cession itself wellorganized, interesting, and relevant? Were time, space, andlearning materials adequate and appropriate? Were the leadersknowledgeable and skilled? 2.Was the information appropriate and useful to participants intheir respective positions (professional affiliation and role,grade level teaching, or associated with experience level,professional training, school setting)?Examples of instruments to determine participants' reactionsare in Appendix I. Determining the answers to questions 3sad 4 is more difficult. 3.Did participants achieve the stated objectives? 4.Did participants put the information and skills intopractice?In school-family communication, some possible questions might be: 1.Was there a difference in quantity, type, or quality ofschool-family communications? If so, what was it? 2.What types communicatioes were Forrural were parents', 4.Were there awaai&ticipated results?If so, what were they? In evaluating the planning process, some questions might be: 1.What were the benefits of the planning process? 2.What were the drawbacks? 3.In what ways did systematic planning process affectthe program's acceptability? Effectiveness? Efficiency?12X21.2S21192. The same planning committee that guided needs assessment, goal setting, and the other steps of the inservice planning process can advise on evaluation, too. They may not know all the technical aspects, but they'll have their own insights and suggestions.Perhaps most important, they can represent teachers, principals, IX-6225 and other personnel regarding what types of data - gathering instruments andprocedures will be acceptable and feasible. An elaborate evaluation designthat depends on a time-consusing log that each teacher must work on each day is doomed to failure. The teachers on the committee or in any advisorycapacity will \"tell it like it is\"--and save everyone a lot of time and effort.e e re s determined.The familia; \"pre\" and \"post\" treatment has much to recommend.It is really the only way to know if progress toward the desired goals,whatever they are, is being made.Usually, when we think of \"pre\" and \"poet,\" we think \"Oh no, a test! Its tests!\"But remember, there are Enx, ways to get information. Testing is only one.For example, some home-school communications are specificallydesigned to decrease absenteeism. Pre- and post - treatment results areavailable from attendance records; parent perceptions are available through telephone interviews.Relate eva4ustionslirectb, 20j9ctiveg he tukpim session, prolaram_. 9r whatever is beim fvaluated. In the staff development, example. in this book, we have stated clear, measurable objectives. Participants' attainment or progress toward attainment of those objectives can be determined by the end of the session. However, the transfer of those skills back to theschool and to participants' communications with parents is far more difficult to determine.On-the-job performance is what really matters.However, when we get beyond the measurable skills of the trainingsessions to a school's actual goals and objectives in school-gFmilycommunications, the gals are seldom as clear. Do we simply want to increase the number of communications? Change their nature? Influence the quality?

Or all these things?Schools will have to define their goals for schtol-home communication beforeschool-level evaluation caw be done. La fact, they need to decide on thosegoals before local inservice trainers can select or develop appropriateobjectives and activities for school personnel.Evaluation of what actually transpires in interactions between parentsand school personnel is far more difficult than evaluating a teacher's abilityto give clear directions or use time efficiently.1114LyAtielisLsessam. Different data-gathering techniques can yield different kinds of information. While direct, written or oral measures ofvarious kinds are most often used, indirect or unobtrusive measures are also appropriate.Some of the staff development strategies and home-school communicationsin this Resource Notebook lend themselves to unobtrusive measures. Forexample, it is quite easy to keep track of the number of items on differenttopics taken or checked out from a family information or resource center.Such an unobtrusive measure gives reliable and quantifiable data for decision-making.An observer can rate the degree of participation and involvement ofinservice participants in relation to the different methods used. Forexample, we suggest an interdependent group technique called \"Jigsaw\" as a wayto help inservice participants get a shared base of information. An observer can tell if the groups are on task or if they use that time to talk about other concerns.Look beyond the traditional workshop evaluation for variations and otherways of finding out what went well and what needs improving.Some IX-8227 possibilities include:Formal pre- and post-test perform-Ince or written measuresProduct evaluationGroup discussions and interviewsIndividual interviews in person or by telephone ObservationWritten evaluation form with ratings, rankings, checklists,agree/disagree, or other predetermined responses mWritten evaluation using open questionsTask simulationsUnobtrusive measures, such as how (logs, diaries, checklists, reflectiveeva such as pre- and post-absentee data, homeworksigned and sent back, permission slips, and other informationpromptly returnednggj&thjassggt,simLfgllgltmsun,. Immediate reactions to staffdevelopment sessions may be glowing, but considerably faded a month or two later.Or the reverse may be true.Putting into practice some of the school -home communication approachessuggested in this Resource Notebook may seem like a formidable task when first presented, but well worth it after the procedures are in place and working in a school.Knowing that they are really expected to try out what they have learnedand that followup will be done to see how the suggested procedures worked may give people incentive to put them into practice. One of the elements in'' successful inservice is followup (Joyce El Showers, 1980), and although all followup is not done in the form of evaluation, some evaluation should be beyond the immediate.

The paper that follows presents an evaluation research framework for looking at school-family communications.' 229 IX-10 \"valuation of School-Some Communication StrategiesEdward E. Cott; and Richard F. Purnell The implementation of communication between school personnel and parentshas been shown to increase rates of attendance (Duncan, 1969; Parker 6 McCoy,1977; Sheets 6 Dunkelberger, 1979; Shelton 6 Dobson, 1973), to improve theschool performance of children (Kittle, 1975; Duncan, 1969; Shelton 6 Dobson,1973), and to contacts with schools (Bittle, 1975);Duncan, 1969; Hager, 1980;. Parker 6 McCoy, 1977). An extensive seArch of theschool -hone relations literature reveals, however, that present knowledge isbased principally on non-systematic studies at the preschool and primarylevels, while few studies have been conducted at the secondary level (Gotta 6Purnell, in press). Among researchers; school personnel, and parents, there appears to bewidespread consensus that improved school-family relations are beneficial andQthat increased parent involvement in schools is a worthwhile goal.Nevertheless, in reports of programs with this general goal, specificobjectives are seldom stated. Consequently evaluation results are sometimesvague others (1977) conclude that communicationbetween home and school requires an increased emphasis on measureable outcomesto assess program effectiveness.There remains much to be learned about this art of communicatingeffectively on the part of both school personnel and parents in order to haveschool-family relations become more meaningful and effective. This seemsclear from the mistrust, misperception, and miscommunication that so often martheir efforts to relate to one another (Lightfoot, 1978). Such negative Ix-11230 results need not be the norm. For example, our own research suggests that Communication and mutual positive feelings increase when schools pay particular attention to the artful practiceof communication in such areas as attendance, academic deficiencies, progress toward graduation, student misconduct, the school's expectations and standards, and providing current news on curricular and extracurricular events (Gotts 6 Purnell, in press). This brief review of literature plus our own experience support three conclusions: (1)Little is known about what works well at thesecondary level, and, while more is known at theprimary level, the knowledge is based onnon-systematic studies. (2)There is a broad consensus that improvedcommunications should be a goal of schools, buttoo little emphasis has been placed onestablishing specific objectives and assessingmeasurable outcomes. (3)In our research it has seemed mostproductive to define objectives in terms ofspecific promising techniques of com4unicationthat are being applied to typical daylo-dayissues in the operation of schools--such as; (a)reporting academic deficiences and (b)providing school'scurricular and extra-curricular events, andso forth.In short, this is a \"poorly researched\" area partly because the task of research has not been well-defined and conceptualized heretofore. Much that needs to be accomplished can be done within an evaluation research framework. For this reason, the balance of this presentation will focus on defining and conceptualizing the task from an evaluation perspective. We will present data in support of our conceptual approach and refer to some of our work-in-progress to illustrate how the approach is carried out.231 IX-12 A Conceptual Approach The following conceptual approach was developed to meet our study requirements during AEL's three years of action research into this-topical area.We have come to believe that researchers should link any proposed evaluation activities to six aspects of the school-home communications mix: (I)The level at which interactions occur (e.g., primaryvs. secondary); locus of communication (i.e., classroom, department,school, central (3)whether the school's message is directed to an individualfamily (type I) or to a group or schoolwide audience(type G); (4)whether consistnication flows from school to home S-R) or home to school (home-school or R-8); (5)the focal or topical areas around which interactionsmay interactions may occur; and (6)the methods or vehicles of communication employed. Levels of IaterWica.The styles of parent-child and teacher-child interaction change dramatically from the preschool through the elementary and into the secondary school years. 'Yet, as we have reviewed the literature thoroughly, it appears that parent involvement specialists and researchers have tried to apply a single model of school-home relations, irrespective of the child's age. Moreover, the uniform model applied is one that has developed out of early childhood education. Extrapolating from the preschool to the primary level seems to have worked reasonably well, e.g., regarding having parents vi ;it school or join parent-teacher organizations. When these expectations have not worked out at the secondary level, educators have erroneously concluded that IX-13 parents of teens have \"lost interest\"--yet, .t is the inappropriateapplication of an early childhood model of home-school relations that is at fault.From this we conclude that quite different outcome indicators areneeded to evaluate parent involvement across the years and levels of schooling. Locus of CommunicationIt is necessary first to conceptualize whether the locus or communicationis the classroom, school building, or other level. Locus of communication cannormally be determined by a functional analysis of where opportunity andresponsibility reside for the particular matter at issue. An academicdeficiency, for example, can be communicated naturally at the classroom level;relating a serious breech of conduct may fall to the principal or a designate.Attending to locus of communication leads the evaluator to consider wherewithin the system to look for and track interactions regarding particular issues.If communication fails to occur where expected, that may point upproblems at the level being examined or at some higher level in thesystem--e.g., teachers may not initiate communications about particularmatters because they believe it is the responsibility of personnel at a supervisory level. Either internal miscommunication or insufficientunderstanding/skills or the absence of policy and clear guidelines for practice may be the culprits.LIERELEILLIALLSELWhen schools communicate with parents, individuals (I) or groups (G) may be the intended audience. For example, all parents need to be familiar withattendance policy (type G); the parents of an absentee child need to be233TX-14 informed (type I). Both types I and G communications are needed if parents are to take expected actions.Evaluation may, thus, assess the sufficiency and quality of both G and I types and examine their relationships with various outcomes.Sometimes it is not enough to inform parents: they may require instruction, guidance, or direct help. We found in our research, for instance, that early notices of academic deficiency were appreciated by parents, but few parents knew how to go about analyzing and helping with such problems (Gotta and Purnell, in press). In response to this discovery, we have prepared\"guidance sheets\" to help parents analyze and respond more effectively to potential sources of academic failure, and we are currently assessing the effects of these in a number of sites. Prom this it can be seen that evaluation of school -borne communications must be conducted within a system's perspective by considering the interrelatedness of all elements in the system. S-H and E-S CommunicationsSchool to home (S -H) and home to school (E-S) communications are both part of an effective program. Schools tend to be active as S-H communicators but are much less successful in encouraging H-S messages.Even when the latter occur, they are likely to happen in incidental, spontaneous, iniormal, and unplanned ways. As a result, the H-S messages seldom leave any Jata-basei residual to influence schools systematically. To counteract the lark of H-S communications, we designed an interview procedure for sampling parents' views and feeding them directly back to principals and superintendents. In the process we learned that these administrator: (a) recognized the implications of the findings, (b) immediately indicated possible changes they might try, and (c) subsequently developed and carried out improved practices (Gotta and Purnell, in press). We are currently experimenting in several sites with the use of local volunteers to conduct interview of this type. If this strategyworks out, then we will prepare a step-by-step operational manual to guideinterested administrators, researchers, and others through the requiredactivities.In this way the H'-S side of the desired two-way process can beformalized.Our recommendation to evaluators is that any school-homerelations program should be advised to include plans for generating H-Smessages. F9Sal AXSS1It is difficult to develop operational measures for such broad constructsas involvement, relltignp, and cqmmunications. When evaluators try to workfrom these global notions, they often look at self-reported attitudes,measures of attendance or compliance ratings of satisfaction or success, andsimilar indicators. We recommend instead that efforts to improvecommunications should focus on specific areas such as academic progress,attendance, student conduct, progress toward graduation, extracurricularactivities, opportunities for parents to serve as volunteers, and so forth.Once these focal areas are linked to communication objectives, evaluation canseek to define success LA terms of: (a) whether parents learned about thesespecific areas, (b) if the information was timely and sufficient, (c) how theyresponded, (d) with what results, (e) what further they desire to know, and(f) which methods of communicating are both acceptable to parents andeffective in producing desired actions and results. Vehicles of C9?maynisittipnImproving relations and involvement is often thought of in terms of globalprograms or treatments. When such programs are studied, however, it is 235IX-16 unclear which independent variable components produce particular effects andwhich are ineffective. Alternatively, we recommend that research andevaluation examine instead the effects of parent-teacher handbooks,newsletters, academic deficiency reports, academic guidance sheets,parent-teacher conferences, open house, parent interviews, and so on. Whenthese individual vehicles are used as treatments, it becomes possible toexamine (a) their individual contributions, (b) the focal areas whichthey best convey, (c) optimum strategies for using them, and so on. Evaluation of Strategies In the preceding discussion we have considered a conceptual approach toevaluating school-home communications. It requires that empirical attentionbe directed toward six differentiated aspects of the communication mix. Whenwe refer to strategiep of communication, we mean those practices which occurat particular intersections of the six aspects. An example will illustratethe concept of strategy: Think of a communication at the high school level(aspect 1) involving teachers (2) and individual families (3) and being sentby the former to the latter (4)--i.e., from school to home -- dealing withacademic performance (5) and transmitted via a special notice (6). Aninstance of the foregoing strategy would be an academic deficiency report usedat the high school level.This brings us back to an earlier point: Much that needs to beaccomplished can be done within an evaluation research framework. We areadvocating that local school systems carefully select for study some limitedset of strategies that promise to meet their identified local communicationneeds.Evaluation will then be undertaken in the manner previously suggested above during discussion of the sir aspects. knowledge gained in this mannerOkcan impact directly on the operation of the local system; also it cansibultaneously contribute to the overall accumulation of understanding of theart of improving relations and school effectiveness.

Despite the volumes of rhetoric devoted to the topic, however, groups continue to countenancedifficulties in their attempts to define and solve the problems facing them. Consistently, problems tend to be defined morein terms of prescriptions for action than as discrepincies between actual and desired states of affairs. Commonly, groupsspend more time dealing with difficulties encountered in how they function than with the twits that brought them together,frequently without recognizing that thou are separate issues.DAP is the acronym for a set of concepts and procedures that the members of any group can employ to refine theirproblem solving skills and bring them to bear on real-life, day-toiday group needs. Based upon a particular view of humanbeings, communication. and the process of inquiry. DAP involves the members of a group in generating and using three kindsof information: dasigrativa information CD) about the \"what is\" state of some one or some thing; comparable appraisiveinformation (A) about \"what is preferred;\" and.Prollo'f0ao information 04 that saggests what to do when discrepencies canbe identified between \"what is\" and 'what is preferred.\"As group members generate and use these three kinds of information, they more systematically through three differentphases of the problem solving process. They begin by identifying their individual and common problems clearly and speci-fically. They then develop plans or prescriptions for dealing with the most critical of those common problems. And theycomplete the cycle of problem solving by implementing their plans, monitoring effects, and eveluiting their success as jointProblem solving systems.Two relatively simple, but terribly powerful conceptualizations undergird the DAP approach to identifying and resolvingproblems or needs within groups. One of these provides us with a way of thinking clearly about needs, needs assessment, andneed fulfilment. The other provides us with a way of thinking about communication within and across groups.How we think about needs or problems takes its cues from C. S. Morris, a communication theorist who has helped usdistinguish clearly among designative inquiry, appraisive inquiry, and prescriptive inquirythe source of DAP. To be moreillspecific:When any of us tries to identify \"what was, is, or will be\" with respect to otsmalves, others, or the world out there,we're engaged in des/ratify inoufry and the product of our efforts is designative information. \"Yesterday wasSunday.\" \"It's now after 2:00 will in Chicago.\" \"Fall it *mainly beautiful in the Appa-lachians.\"it is 80\u00b0 in this room.\" All of these statements provide designative information, for they attempt todescribe what was, what is, or what will be.By contrast, when we identify our preferences or desires for the past, present, or future, we're engaged in a verydifferent kind of inquiry, for our words become value-laden, and they describe, not \"what is,\" but, rather, \"whatis preferred.\" We call this second kind of effort appraitivi inquiry and the information it produces appraisiveinformation. For instance, \"I have always preferred ice cream to pie.\" \"My desire is to be an educator.\" \"I wishthat was 70\u00b0 in this room.\" These are appraisive statements.Now, needs or problems arise when there is a dear discrepancy or mismatch between \"what is\" and \"what is pre-ferred,\" between the designative and appraisive information we have about same common referent. \"Johnnyreads two kiwis below grade level; we prefer him to read at least at grade level.\" \"It is 80 degrees in this room;I prefer it to be 70 degrees.\" These are statements of need.To complete the cycle, there is yet a third kind of inquiry and resulting information that we call pre:alp:in inquiryand prescriptive information. As the words suggest, prescriptive inquiry attempts to identify specific actions, plans,strategies, tactics, and so forth that, if implemented, will reduce known discrepancies between \"what is\" and \"whatis preferred.\" Sometimes, prescriptions are designed to change \"what is\"the designative state. \"Turn on the airconditioner to reduce the temperature from WP to 70\u00b0.\" Other times, they are designed to change \"whet is pre-ferred\"the appraisive state. Either way, however, they take their cues from dearly identified needs that have beendefined in terms of \"what is\" and \"what conceptualizations that undergird the 1 i= * Needs Assessment Project of the Appalachia Educational Laboratory.

Group problem solving: The DAP approach. Final Project Report.Center for Educational Policy and Management. Eugene, Oregon, March 1974.253 4 In AEI's Needs Assessment Project. there were two specific influences of this pdrticular conceptusljut ion of needs and needs illiallinent- First. in our Won to distinguish dearly throughout the project between identifying needs on the one hand end. sans the other, developing plans to meat those needs. Throughout the project, we have tried assiduously not to ode these two refitted. but very different kinds of activities.- And second, in our effort to state needs in terms of clear discrepancies between \"what is\" and \"what is preferred.\"leather stated by pwticipents in Slats Confweitoes, sent to others for validation, strand with state departments, or used by AEL's board and staff to prepare lontterm R and D agendas, the educational needs that provided wit for the project were consistently framed in terms of parallel descriptions of what is and what is preferred with respect to some referent.The second conoeptuallzation that undiergirds DAP has to do with levels of cornmunicative contact among human beings. ft influenced, rather sibtly, the sequence of activities that comprised the Needs Assessment Project. Think for a moment about ate happens when you communicate with others, and see if these five Weis of communication contact are in evidence:Lard One:FidelityThat is, when i give a mussy, to someone else. can he or she replicate it faithfully. Sometimes,Mint/ of contact is all I want (e.g., reserving a flight to Cht :,ston when I know precisely the flight I want); more likely, however, fidelity is just the first my. but a very necessary one. in my efforts to communicate with others.!sled Two:UnderstandingThat is, does the person who can replicate my message also understand it? Does he or she know what t mean? Can he or she paraphrase the message to my satisfaction? If so, we've achieved effective communicative contact at the level of understanding,Lewd Three:Acceptance or AgreementDoes the person accept or agree with my message? That is, does he or she accept as true my assertion of what Is? Does he or she share my assertion of what is preferred? Doss he or she agree that the need I have identified is indeed a need, or that a prescription I have developedher a high probability of meeting the need to which it is addressed.Laval Four:Importance or Relevancewas the person may be able to replicate my message, while he or she may understand it and maybe oven agree with it, does the person place the same priority on it that I do? Is it as important to him or her as it is to me? Testing our priorities is the challenge of this fourth level of communicative contact.Level Five:CommitmentUltimately, of course, assuming that communicative contact has been effective at the prior four levels, the final test of my effort to communicate turns on whether the person is pre- pared to behave consistent with my message. it is at this usage that descriptions of what is and what is preferred, statements of need, and descriptions for action move from the domain of linguistics to the domain of behavior.The pal of the AR!: Needs Assessment Project was two4old: first, to Identify educational needs as they were Per- ceived frame variety of perspectives; and then to process those needs through a sequence of steps and with a variety of persons In/oder to produce a Kit of prescriptions of \"action piers\" far deal with those needs that am amenable to R and D and tat were perceived by most participants to be most important. T this mulditep process, our Impli- cit goal waft focus on needs that can survive the five levels of communicative contact just described-fidelity, under- standing. tipernent, importance, and commitment. Thus, the four major activities that comprised the project, made %wetland the two basic conceptualizations undergirding DAP-its three kinds of inquiry and its five levels of cative NEEDS ASSESSMENT CONFERENCE ACTIVITIES An annotated list of the eight activities that comprise a needs amassment conference: *Welty 1:An Overview of the Conference'This activity provides an overview of the conference -its purposes and prodaties. Painful IntroductheDam, the question that drives the conference is presented, the tight activities of the conference arebririly explicated, and the agenda is presented.Activity 2:Generating Initial Need StatementsA vied statement is defined and illustrated, practice in identification and generation of need statementsoccurs, rules and procedures for generation are explicated, and finally, statements of need we generatedby four small groups. This is when the grist is produced.Activity 3:Smirching for Clarity Within Each GroupThis activity provides an opportunity to address the question of clarity and understanding Within eachof the four small groups. Focus is on meaning of each statement, not on the truth or value of its assertions.Activity 4:Confirming Clarity Amos the GroupsThis activity provides an opportunity to address the question of clarity across the groups,are thestatements clear to individuals who were not part of the generation process.Activity 5:fVecering Each Group's ProductThis short activity involves preparing on 4 x 8 cards the reviewed and refined statements. These cardswill be used extensively in the next activity.Activity 8:Collapsing Need Statements so ROMOVII RedundanciesThis activity produces two products: a verbatim list of statements taken from the cards and a revisedeat of statements-collapsed and edited to reduce redundancy or ambiguity. This involves sorting theneed statements into dusters and rewriting. Two versions are prepared: one typed on slips of paperfor each participant end the other prepared on transparencies.ALlivity 7:Reviewing and Approving the Revised Need Statementsin this activity, the products from preceding activities we reviewed and then, using overhead transparencies,each revised need statement prepared for the total group is reviewed and approved. Any editing whichscours on the acetates is also recorded on the corresponding dips of paper.Activity 5:Assessing the imminence of the Need StatementsIn this activity participants sissies (pro or con) from *heir particular perspective each need statement.They then rats the importance of the needs described in each need statement using a modified 0 sorttechnique. The first five activities comprise the first afternoon's session. The sixth is carried out at night by the ConferenceCoordinators. The seventh comprises the next morning's session, and the eighth activity is the major activity duringthe second afternoon. Educational Services OfficeAppalachia Educational LaboratoryCharleston, West Virginia255,,,r4riV:1r ACTIVITY I PURPOSE:The pucmst of this activity is to provide an overview of theconfere, le, Its purposes and processes. PROCEDURES:Begin the conference with a welcome (by one or moreappropriate persons).Explain the purpose of the conferenceto learn what theparticipants consider to be the most important educationalneeds of the local school district.aProvide a brief explanation of the 2-step process: (I) identi.fying the needs, and (2) assessing their importance. Theprocesses to be ;lead are structured, group processes,requiring public display and review of many of their delib-erations. Inform participants of any validation activitiesthat will be conducted in connection with the conference,and give them some inforination about how the resultsof the Needs Assessment will be lased.Introduce the general categories of people who areparticipating in the conference, and then allow eachindividual to make his/her own personal Introductionand identify the category represented.Give a brief overview of the eight activities that willtake place during the conference. OUTCOME/PRODUCT:The participants have the \"content\" and the conferencecoordinators have the \"process.\" Together, they cancreate an effective conference and a useful product. 2566 7 ACTIVITY 2 PURPOSE:The purpose of this activity is to have conference participantsgenerate, in small groups, the initial set of nand statements. PROCEDURES:Provide some general information about the meaning of a\"need statement\" and the procedures that will be used togenerate it. Ask that they avoid the generation of \"prescriptions\"as much as possible, and tofocus instead on actual needs.Define a need statement by identifying its three parts: 11) a referent or broad topic,(2) a description of what is with respect to that topic,(3) a comparable description of what is preferred withrespect to that same topic.A need (or need statement) describes a discrepancy betweenwhat is and what is preferred. Give a feW examples of needstatements that have been written in this format.Conduct a two-part practice session in which participants firsttake a list of statements and identify each one as a what isor what is preferred statement in the second part, havethem actually generate several need statsmunts, using thethree parts described above.Then have them read their state-ments aloud for groupdiscussion.Be sure everyone has In mind the question that guides theconference: What dr, you, as a group, consider to be themost important educationalneeds of your local schooldistrict? Ask the participants to go to their assigned groups, identifya recorder and begingenerating need statements (on butcherpaper) with no questioning of clarity or understanding. OUTCOME/PRODUCT:The initial set of need statements, generated in small groups. 257 ACTIVITY 3 PURPOSE:The purpose of this activity is to search for clarity andunderstanding of the need statements within each group.PROCEDURES:While remaining in the original grwps, have participantsdiscuss each statement for clarity and understanding.Do not allow questioning of truth or value, and insistthat they focus on meaning.Save each group select a moderator to keep the discussionmoving, and to generally help the group achieve consensuson the meaning of each need statement. In addition, eachgroup must select a recorder who will make notations ofany necessary editing on the original set of need statements.Using a 3point scale, have each participant fete theclarity of each need statement. Then, ask that they discusseach need statement, focusing on them one at a time,using the clarity ratings.OUTCOME/PRODUCT:The outcome or goal is two-fold: PURPOSE: PROCEDURES:(1)to achieve reasonable consensus among group memberson the clarity, and(2)to make certain the intended meaning would be clearto people outside the group. ACTIVITY 4 The purpose of this activity is to have people who were notparty to the generation of the original need statementsconfirm the clarity of those statements.Ask that three members of each group (excluding moderatorand recorder) volunteer to move to another-group. Then havethe \"new\" members of each group use the procedures fromActivity 3 to rate clarity of the need statements. The intenthere is not to find fault, but to bring the perspective ofpersons who have not been party to each group's deliberations.This visit ought to confirm the general ammo of each group'searlier search for clarity.OUTCOME/PRODUCT:A set of need statements that are clear, not only to the groupof people who generated them, but also to individuals outsidethat group. 258 ACTIVITY 5 PURPOSE:The purpose of this activity is to get the \"final\" versionof the need statements transferred from the butcher/wiper to 4 x 6 cards. PROCEDURES:Ask that the visiting members return to their originalgroups for this activity.Have each group We a final look at their statements andrefine them ashecestery in light of the suggestionsoffered by the visitant When groups are satisfied withtheir prokhwts, have them write each need statement ona separate 4 x 6 nr\u00a2. 1'he group identifkation mustappear on each.card, and the statements must be writtenin the 3-part format (referent, what is, what is preferred).All need statements prepared by the groups, in finaledited form, on 4 x 6 cards.OUTCOME/PRODUCTf ACTIVITY 6 PURPOSE;The purpose of this activity is to remove redundancies andcollapse similar or related statements into one.PROCEDURES:The activity is performed by the conference coordinators.and occurs during the evening, following the first day'sconference activities.Read each card, and group together those statements thatseem to be addressing the same or closely related needs.After ell cards have been read and placed in a group, one or morerevised need statements must be written for each group.

The referents will have servedtheir purpose by this point, and can be dropped.OUTCOME/PRODUCT:Two products will result from this activity: 41)a-typed verbatim list of the need statements, exactlyas they were written on the 4 x 6 cards,(2)the statements, collapsed and revised as necessary toreduce redundancy or ambiguity.Produce a complete set (photo copy) for each participantand one set on transparencies for use with overhead projector. 259CESt r''1\")\"'\"9 PURPOSE:ACTIVITY 7 The purpose of this avivityls to have the participants,review the revised/collapsed statements for clarity, and toinsure that none of their original ideas were lost.PROCEDURES:Distribute to the participants the typed verbatim listof need statements and give them a few minutes to read/review the listNext, distribute the set of revised need statements. Givea brief overview of the procedures used the night beforeto remove redundancies, collapse and write the revisedetatements.Using the overhead projector and transparencies, review eachstatement with two concerns in mind:(1)arethe statements as clear as those on the verbatim list?(2)have any of the ideas presented in the origiiial needstatements been distorted, ignored or overemphasized?Record any editing by the group directly on the transparency,and instruct the participants to record those same editingson their set of need statements.After ail need.statements have been reviewed and any editingsrecorded, ask the following question before proceeding toActivity 8: Taken as a total set, can you accost the needstatements that we've just reviewed and given a final edit a$ fair representation of themultiple needs that were identifiedyesterday in the small groups?OUTCOME/PRODUCT:A set of 'revised/collapsed need statements that have beenconfirmed by participants to be a fair representation of theirperceived needs. 26010 ACTIVITY S PURPOSE:The purpose of this activity is to allow each participant torate the importance ufeach need statement that was reviewedby the group in Activity 7. PROCEDURES:Conduct this activity in a two-step proms, consideringeach statement one at a time:First, give participants the opportunity to argue the importanceof the statement from their particular perspective (e.g., parent,teacher, student).Next, allow each individual to draw his/her own conclusionsabout the importance of the need statement, and to rate thatstatement accordingly, using a 0-sort technique. Rating shouldbe done in terms of threeconsiderations:(1)the personal priority placed on that need, (2)the potential impact on theschool district if thatneed were met, and (3)the comments or arguments made about that needstatement.

We will use the case of twenty participants from various large organizations, attending a training conference on group techniques Our illustration will be a demonstration NGT entering. the purpose of which is to allow participants to develop questions concerning how to conduct such meetings in back- home settings.Them is a secondary benefit in selecting this particular case illustration. The illus- trated meeting format has been shown to be ass effective training device which evaders may wish to use as a means to introduce other individualg to NGT.

Andrew H Van de Van and David 14 Gustafson pp 40-06 Copynght19761 .Aloking Figure aMeeting Room Arrangement for Three NCT Tables Thus, the leader's welcoming statement should include:1) A cordial and warm welcome.2) A sense of importance concerning the group's task.3) Clarification of the importance of each member's contribution.4) An indication of the use or purpose of the meeting's output.We can exemplify such an introduction by going back to our illustration meetingof twenty participants from large organizations gathered to learn about the NCT technique The leader of the meeting might begin as follows.\"1 want to express my appreciation to each of you for attending this workshop onNCT. 1 cm aware that there are many other training opportunities as well as informal activities going on at our convention at the present time i appreciate thesacrifice you have made to take advantage of this workshop. I welcome each of youwarmly to this session. 279 288The leader passesa set of worksheets toeach table. Worksheetsare simpi Grouptablet paper with the nominal question writtenat the top.\"You will notice that thequestion which is the focissof our meetingis the is tag: What barriers tryingto the NGT techniqueback hesne: \"I would like each ofyou to take five minutesto list your ideas inresponse to this question. ina brief phrase or a few words. on the worksheet in fromof you Please wc.rk independentlyof other membersin trying touse back home. Duringthis period ofindependent thinking I ask thatyou not talk to other members. interrupt their thinking.or loot at their worksheets. Since this is the opportunity for eachof us toprepare his et her contributions to themeeting. I wouldappreciate intense effortduring the next five minutes. At the end of five minutes. I will call timeand suggest howwe can proceed to share our ideas. Are there any questions! Let'sproceed then with our individual effort for the next five minutes.\"The leader turns to hisown worksheet and beginsto write.Steps StepResist nonprocess clarifications.2) Have the question in writing.3) Model good group behaviorby writing in silence.4) Unction individuals whodisrupt the silent independentactivity.It is important to note that ...the leader shouldavoid providinganswers to the question for the group. Experimental evidence clearly sham,that a leader whoen- gages in detailed clarification of group tasks tends to lead thegroup toward his or her interpretation of the task In this case. the more the leader\"clarifies\" the question by providing exemplaryanswers. the more thegroup focuses on the leader's frame of reference.For example, if the leader inour case illustration was asked: \"By barriers. doyou mean leek of necessary skills?\" and answered by saying: \"Sure, thatmight be a bather. For example. perhaps theperson trying to use the technique back home did not have prior experience with the technique.\" he or she will have leethe group to focus on leadership skills as a bather. In fact. for the particulargroup of administrators present. other barriers such as statusimpediments. group compositions. etc.. might be far more important.The appropriateanswer the leader should giveis: \"Any barrier whichcomes to your mind should be written on your worksheet.\"If a member of thegroup still asks for greater clarification of the question. a useful technique is for the leader toanswer \"Think of the question as an inkblot. I want you to look at the words on the worksheet and write those ideaswhich come to your mind when you read the questions.\" Such a response isobviously dependenton having the question in writing in front of the group members.As alternatives to worksheets. the leader can write thestimulus question ona flip chart in front of thegroup. In any case, having thequestion in writing cies:1y aids group concentration on the appropriate question and decreasesneed for clarification. The NG'S leader isno smelly not an outsider to the meeting. but rather a working participant. As such. he or she should provide a model ofappropriate group behavior during the silent generation phase. A leader who is workinghard at the task provides ep example of pod group behavior. A leader who distracts thegroup by entsaging 280nrr,7A1E G TINTDPCI 5 ler-MakingThere is among scholars that the sharing of all ideasand equati. ration of participation increases group creativity. The rather mechanical formatof going to each member inturn to elicit ideas establishes an important behaviorpattern By the second or third round of idea giving. eachmember is an achievedparticipant in the group. A precedent for further participationhas been accomplishedwithout competition with high- status members, more aggressive personalities, or more'mo- tional members. _- A major concern ingroup meetings is problem-centeredneu. Earlier we docu merited the importance ofa group identifying all theelements of a problem and avoid. ing premature problem definition. By listing the entirearray of ideas before discussion and voting. the groupensures that significant ideas will not get lostor forgotten. Lists also facilitate hitchhiking and allow for the considetationof conflicting ideaswithout pressure.The fact that a list is written is of particular impartance.A written idea ismore objective and less personal than a verbal statement. If theidea is in writing.indi- viduals are better able toseparate it from the personality or position of the individual contributing it. Also. groupsan able to dial witha larger number of ideas in writing As a roi h rule of thumb.individuals remember40 percent of what theycan bear. but 70 percent of what theycan both see and hear. Thewritten list also becomesthe group's mastery, providingminutes and a working draft for later rafinenient. Going from member tomember eliciting onlyone idea at a time has its benefits as well. It is not unusual foras much as a third ofan individual's ideas relative to a problem to remain unspoken. .Embarrassment. conservatism: fear of self-disclosure. etc.. contribute much to the often spoken of \"hiddenwads.\" In pilot mattes.inti- vidual group memberswere asked to present theirentire list to the groupat Doe time. The effects were to: (I) have members hide a substantialnumber of ideas: and 121 decrease the depersonalization of ideas since itwas easy to ieerstify a cluster of ideas with an individual.Round-robin listingminimizes both negative futures. First. individuals are given models for self-disclosure. Theexample of early risk-takers encourages other group members to present mare controversial ideas. Second. as the list progresses in length.it is more andmore difficult and less rev/ailing to try to remember who presented what ides. Instead. the listbecomes a depersonalizedgroup product.Finally. the written list isan important early group reward. Members are impressed with the array of ideasgenerated by thegroup. the amount of overlap of ideas providing areas of agreement and consensus. the differentisted contninitionsof individual group members. and the immediate richness of resources forfurther analysis. At thesame time. the group is protectedagainst premature focuson selected ideas or problem simplification.Inasmuch as round-robin listing is it the heart of the NCTfeedback process.care- ful attention to this step iswarranted.Step 2 guidelines.Leader requirements forthis step include:1) Clear verbal statement of the step:a. the objective is to map the group's thinking.b. ideas should be presented in brief wordsor phrases. c. ideas will be taken serially. 281 292GroupDecisoriMakintThere are situations tospecialsituations and physical!rations.\" Recaro en will soon wear out the felt pens and patience dealingwith such lengthystatement.

The leader begins thevoting procedurewith a statementas follows:\"We have now completedour discussion of theentire list of ideas. haveclarified the meaning of each idea.and have discussedthe areas ofagreemelt and disagree- ment.

The role of the leader in Step 5 is to;1) Define the task of this discussion as clarification. not social pressure.2) Ensure that the discussion is brief. so as not to distort perceptions of items not tits.cussed.Studies of voting show that a threestep processvoting. discussion. revottnt-provides a more accurate indication of preferences than voting alone. However. theevidence is somewhat contradictory. Without getting into the scientific debate wewould offer the following speculation. groups who do not talk over votes sometime,mike errors due to misinformation. misunderstanding. or unequal information. A brilldiscussion of the first vote assures that this does not occur. On the other hand. lengthsdiscussion of earlier judgments can distort. group judgment by focusing too much at.tention on the itenis\"discussed as against the, total arts of items. Thus. in some studiesdiscussion decreases iiiiiuracy In striking a balance between costs and benefits of dic.cussion and mating. the way the leader introduces Step 5 and the amount of timedevoted to the step are important. With respect to the latter. the discussion of the voteshould be short so as not to distort judgments. With respect to role definitions. thefollowing statements at One beginning and end of the discussion are appropriate(At the beginning ...) 'it may be worthwhile to briefly examine the voting patternin front of us to see if there are any inconsistencies. sop-rises. or differences mem-bers wish to comment on.\"The purpose of this discussion is not to prelsure any member to change his orher vote. On the other hand, if we gain additional c.arifiCation, some membersmay wish to modify their original vote.\" .[At the end..\"Once again. the purpose of this discussion has not been to pres.sure you to change your original Vote. 'Indeed. you should think carefully beforedoing so. However. if you honestly have a new perspective as a result of the dis-cussion. you should change your vote.\" Step 5: Final VoleStep 6 is the final NCT step. This vote combines individual judgments into a groupdecision.
