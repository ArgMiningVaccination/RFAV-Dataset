As parasites feed off sugar, sticking closely to a low glycaemic diet; avoiding starchy and rened foods and including lots of healthy fats such as coconut oil and clean proteins can be benecial. It is recommended to cut out all pork products from your diet as they can contain parasites. Herbs to include when cooking or sprinkling on foods/ salads: ginger, cayenne pepper, thyme, garlic, oregano, turmeric. Intermittent fasting with a vegetable or bone broth is an ideal way to start the cleanse, and should be done under the supervision of your practitioner. An example of this would be an 8-hour eating window 11-7pm, and drinking lots of replenishing fluids outside this window. Optimally hydrating outside of mealtimes is very important, sipping on lemon water and herbal teas throughout the day to maximise the cleansing process. All of these recipes have been selected based on your needs, but you don't need to make them all at once. Start by adding a couple of new recipes from this book into your regular meal rotation. If you like to write out your own weekly meal plan to stay organized, you can print a blank meal plan template here. On each recipe, you'll see total time, number of servings, ingredients and directions. Before you start, check the ingredients list to see if anything needs to be prepped in advance. For example, you might need to dice up your veggies. It's also helpful to read through the directions before you start cooking so you have an idea of what's coming up before you dive in. Cook once, eat multiple times! Most leftovers can last about three days in the fridge, so maximize your time in the kitchen. Make enough dinner to take for lunch the next day or double a recipe to last for a few days. This is a great habit that will save you time and money.Hi,Zucchini Turkey Breakfast Skillet Celery with Sunflower Seed Butter Cream of Celery & Asparagus Soup Toasted Walnuts Butter Chicken & Cauliflower Rice Hibiscus Iced Tea, Lemon Ginger TeaHigh Fat Green Smoothie Celery with Sunflower Seed Butter Butter Chicken & Cauliflower Rice Steamed Radishes with Dill, Homemade Coconut Yogurt Cream of Celery & Asparagus Soup Green Tea, Ginger Mint TeaZucchini Turkey Breakfast Skillet Steamed Radishes with Dill, Homemade Coconut Yogurt Cream of Celery & Asparagus Soup Hummus Dippers Baked Lemon Cod, Crispy Asparagus with Coconut Hibiscus Iced Tea, Lemon Ginger Tea Pesto Zoodles with Poached Egg Toasted Walnuts Baked Lemon Cod, Crispy Asparagus with Coconut Coconut Almond Cups Cream of Broccoli, Kale & Spinach Soup Green Tea, Ginger Mint TeaGrain-Free Coconut Almond Porridge Sea Salt & Garlic Crackers Cream of Broccoli, Kale & Spinach Soup Hummus Dippers Baked Chicken with Tomatoes, Avocado & Spinach Salad Hibiscus Iced Tea, Lemon Ginger TeaPesto Zoodles with Poached Egg Sea Salt & Garlic Crackers Baked Chicken with Tomatoes, Avocado & Spinach Salad Coconut Almond Cups Spaghetti Squash Burrito Bowls Green Tea, Ginger Mint Tea Breakfast Cauliflower Casserole Hummus Dippers Spaghetti Squash Burrito Bowls Toasted Walnuts Baked Chicken with Tomatoes, Avocado & Spinach Salad Hibiscus Iced Tea, Lemon Ginger Tea Avocado Lemon Lemon Juice Lime Lime Juice Almond Butter Green Tea Black Pepper Chia Seeds Chili Flakes Chili Powder Cinnamon Curry Powder Garam Masala Garlic Powder Ground Flax Seed Hemp Seeds Oregano Paprika Pumpkin Seeds Sea Salt Sea Salt & Black Pepper Sunflower Seeds WalnutsAsparagus Baby Spinach Basil Leaves Broccoli Carrot Cauliflower Celery Cherry Tomatoes Cilantro Fresh Dill Garlic Ginger Kale Leaves Mint Leaves Parsley Radishes Red Onion Thyme Yellow Bell Pepper Yellow Onion Zucchini Organic Coconut Milk Organic Salsa Organic Vegetable Broth Tomato Paste Almond Flour Coconut Flour Nutritional Yeast Unsweetened Coconut Flakes Unsweetened Shredded Coconut Vanilla ExtractChicken Breast Cod Fillet Extra Lean Ground Turkey Hummus Apple Cider Vinegar Avocado Oil Coconut Aminos Coconut Oil Extra Virgin Olive Oil Sesame Oil Sunflower Seed Butter Coconut Butter Egg Unsweetened Almond Milk Coconut Meat Hibiscus Tea Probiotic Capsules Reishi Powder Water 20 MINUTES Coconut Oil Extra Lean Ground Turkey Zucchini (large, nely diced) Organic Salsa Egg Sea Salt & Black Pepper (to taste) For best results, refrigerate the turkey/zucchini mixture separate from the eggs in an airtight container for up to three days.
