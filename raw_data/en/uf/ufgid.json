[Speaking at the Wall Street Journal Health Forum](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/moderna-ceo-defends-pricing-strategy-for-covid-shot-41582d36), Bancel suggested that the vaccine's development is thanks to private investors and that the federal funding merely hastened development that would have occurred regardless. The comments came in response to a question of whether the company has a \"moral obligation\" to give back to the taxpayers who helped develop the life-saving immunization\u2014presumably by not dramatically hiking the vaccine's price as it moves from federal distribution to the commercial market this year. While the government most recently paid $26 per dose of Moderna's updated booster, the company is planning to [raise the price of its shots to $110 to $130 per dose](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/01/moderna-may-match-pfizers-400-price-hike-on-covid-vaccines-report-says/). \"The platform was funded by private investors. The platform was not funded by the government,\" Bancel argued. \"What the government did\u2014and we're very grateful for it and I think they got a lot of value out of it\u2014is to accelerate the development of a vaccine. We would have funded the vaccine, it would just have taken longer,\" he said. The company also \"didn't get a penny\" from the government to help with manufacturing, he added. Amid the pandemic, Moderna received nearly $10 billion in federal funding to develop, test, and provide vaccine doses for the US population. That includes [approximately $1.7 billion](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001682852/2d0166d4-2a0c-4ec2-8723-0ee190633c76.pdf) from an April 2020 agreement with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), which supported late-stage clinical development. Worldwide, the company also made roughly $36 billion in vaccine sales, [according to The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/23/science/moderna-covid-vaccine-patent-nih.html). [NIH $400 million for borrowing a molecular technique](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/02/moderna-forks-over-400m-to-nih-amid-dispute-over-covid-vaccine-ip/)developed by NIH researchers for the design of the company's vaccine. The NIH is currently in a bitter patent dispute with Moderna after the company purposefully excluded three NIAID researchers from the principal patent for the vaccine. Bancel's comments are sure to rile critics. And they come just two weeks ahead of a congressional hearing by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on the proposed price hike for the vaccine.
