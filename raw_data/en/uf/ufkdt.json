By developing highly effective vaccines against COVID-19, it was possible, in particular, to avoid severe illness and protect highly vulnerable groups of people. However, no vaccine, including those against COVID-19, is free of side effects. In very rare cases, it is also possible for serious side effects and/or vaccine complications to occur due to vaccination, which can in specific cases even lead to long-term health impairment. Against this backdrop, the Federal Ministry of Health provides answers to the most important questions regarding COVID-19 vaccination, side effects of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine injury law. Basic knowledge Who is recommended to get vaccinated? Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the epidemiological situation has changed greatly. At this point in time, it can be assumed that SARS-CoV-2 is transitioning from a pandemic event to an endemic wave-like event. This means that: While the virus is still circulating throughout the population, the dominant Omicron variants and the high levels of immunity in the population on account of vaccinations and past infection have, however, led to there now being significantly fewer cases of severe illness and long-term consequences such as long and post-COVID with the Omicron variant than there were at the beginning of the pandemic. Against this background, the Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) has undertaken to convert its recommendations to date into a longer-term COVID-19 vaccination recommendation. Healthy people aged 18 or over (including women who are pregnant) are recommended a basic immunisation as well as a booster to build up a basic immunity. It is important that the immune system is exposed to pathogen components (through vaccination) or the pathogen itself (through infection) three times. At least two of these exposures should occur through vaccination. Groups of people who are at increased risk are recommended an additional booster vaccination once a year. The vaccination should be administered with variant-adapted vaccines and at least 12 months after the previous vaccination or infection. Preferably vaccinations should be administered in autumn, so that in case of growing infection rates, vulnerable people still have the best-possible protection in autumn and winter. This applies to: - All people aged 60 or over - Residents of long-term care facilities - Anyone over the age of 6 months with underlying conditions (see below) - People of all ages with an increased infection risk on account of their occupation in medical or long-term care - Family members and close contacts of people for whom COVID-19 vaccination is unlikely to produce a protective immune response For people with an immune deficiency and a relevant limited immune response, additional vaccine doses in shorter intervals may be beneficial. Whether additional vaccine doses are needed is determined by the attending physician. Who is eligible for COVID-19 vaccination? Since 7 April 2023, entitlement to COVID-19 vaccinations for people insured with the statutory health insurance is subject to the provisions of the [vaccination guideline](https://www.g-ba.de/richtlinien/60/) passed by the Joint Federal Committee of Physicians and Health Insurance Funds (G-BA) on the basis of the Standing Committee on Vaccination's recommendation. Additionally, the COVID-19 Prevention Ordinance stipulates that people insured with the statutory health insurance are entitled to COVID-19 vaccination should a doctor deem it medically necessary. People insured with private health insurance are subject to their individual contractual terms. Where can you get vaccinated? A large proportion of COVID-19 vaccinations is carried out in the office-based physician sector, which includes vaccinations administered by doctors at nursing care facilities. Also company doctors and public pharmacies administer COVID-19 vaccines. Are healthy children and adolescents recommended to get vaccinated against COVID-19? The Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) now recommends that babies, (young) children and adolescents without underlying conditions do not get a basic immunisation or booster against COVID-19 on account of the now mostly mild courses of disease and very low rates of hospitalisation. Children and adolescents with underlying conditions are to continue to receive vaccinations according to the recommendations.
