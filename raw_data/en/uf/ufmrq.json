(2) The chance of successfully returning to a normal heart rhythm diminishes by 10 percent each minute following suddencardiac arrest. (3) Eighty percent of cardiac arrests are caused by ventric- ular fibrillation, for which defibrillation is the only effectivetreatment. (4) Sixty percent of all cardiac arrests occur outside the hospital. The average national survival rate for out-of-hospitalcardiac arrest is only 5 percent. (5) Communities that have established and implemented public access defibrillation programs have achieved averagesurvival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest as high as 50percent. (6) According to the American Heart Association, wide use of defibrillators could save as many as 50,000 lives nationallyeach year.
