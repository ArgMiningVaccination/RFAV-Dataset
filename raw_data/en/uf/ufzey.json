Unfortunately, most Americans rely on the advice of health food store employees to select botanical supplements. The top Herbal supplements will be presented to educate nurses. These include Aloe Vera, Ashwagandha, Black Cohosh, Butterbur, Horse Chestnut, Kava, Lemon Balm, Licorice, Milk Thistle, Peppermint, Red Yeast Rice, St. John's Wort, Saw Palmetto, Skullcap, Soy, Tea Tree Oil, Turmeric, Uva Ursi & Valerian. Each herb topics will include: Common Latin Binomial Name, Part Used, Active Ingredient, Primary Uses, Preparation & Dose, Pregnancy & Lactation, Contraindications, Adverse Effects, Duration, Toxicity & Drug Interactions. European countries far exceed the United States in standardizing, determining indications for usage & have developed formularies for herbal supplements. The German Commission E approves botanical supplements for primary uses. Even the textbooks about herbal medicine have been translated from German to English. Since many Americans are turning to Complementary Alternative Medicines, nurses need to have the knowledge base to advise patients. United States physicians are not schooled in herbal medicine and are unable to advise patients. Most physicians advise patients to not take herbal supplements because they are only schooled in medicine (pharmacotherapy) and surgery. There are more natural modalities that can benefit patients. Nurses have traditionally been open to new modalities to assist patient on health promotion & health maintenance. Medication & Surgery does not cure or benefit all illnesses, as nurses astutely know. Nurses & health professionals will have a better knowledge of Herbal Pharmacy to better inform their patients.
