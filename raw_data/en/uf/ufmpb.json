Based on experiences with the app lication and use of that document, and to include additional ESS applications and associated duty cycles , test procedures and performance metrics, a first revision of the November 2012 Protocol was issued in June 2014 (PNNL-22010 Rev. 1). As an update of the 2014 revision 1 to the Protocol, this document (the April 2016 revision 2 to the Protocol) is intended to supersede the June 2014 revision 1 to the Protoc ol and provide a more user-friendly yet more robust and comprehensive basis for measuring and expressing ESS performance. This foreword 1 provides general and specific details about wh at additions, revisions, and enhanc ements have been made to the June 2014 Protocol and the rationale for them in a rriving at this April 2016 Protocol (PNNL-22010 Rev. 2 / SAND2016-3078 R). Dynamic Updating Process Because energy storage technology development a nd deployment are dynamic, and as a result, the technologies and the applications and metrics needing to be covered in test standards continue to evolve, the provisions in the Protocol must continue to evol ve to more fully address the wide scope and purpose stated in Sections 1 and 2 of the Protocol. For inst ance, further enhancements have been made since the initial publication of the Protocol in 2012, including the addition of one more storage application in the June 2014 revision 1 to the Protocol, and five more applications in this April 2016 revision 2 to the Protocol, along with refinements to the way some performance metrics are determined. This April 2016 revision 2 to the Protocol also includes new system performance metrics and additional general information and technical specifications associated wi th ESSs. The dynamic nature of storage technology development and the growing demand for performan ce information by the many different entities involved with energy storage deployments supports c ontinual and ongoing work to enhance the Protocol. The continuing need for uniformity and comparability of the reported performance information for all storage technologies and the growing need for more types of performance-related information suggests that the Protocol will need to be revised and republishe d at reasonable intervals in the future to best serve the needs of all those who want to document ESS pe rformance or who need such documentation to make decisions about the application and use of ESSs. The development of the first edition of a brand new st andard can take considerab le time, especially when those participating in development of the sta ndard must \"start from scratch.\" Once approved and published, standards are generally upda ted and revised on a three- to five-year cycle and, in some cases, interim addenda covering needed revi sions or enhancements to a standard are also issued. When first published in 2012, it was a goal that the Protocol would provide a foundational basis for brand new standards covering the topic of ESS performance so th at standards development organizations (SDOs) did not have to \"start from scratch.\" That has been realized through the use of the Protocol by U.S. SDOs as 1 The information presented in this foreword is not part of the protocol. It is merely informative and does not contain requirements necessary for conformance with or use of the protocol. April 2016 Page iv well as internationally through International Elect rotechnical Commission (IEC) Technical Committee 120 who, among others, are developing an IEC sta ndard for measuring and expressing ESS performance using the Protocol as a basis for the provisions in the standard. In addition to these formal standards development efforts by SDOs, the Energy Storage Inte gration Council (ESIC), under the auspices of the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), is also deve loping information for utilities to use in fostering their consideration and application of energy stor age technology that in part covers ESS performance. Such efforts outside those of SDOs provide an additio nal opportunity for deployment of the Protocol in the short term until formal standards are a pproved and published by the sponsoring SDO. As formal standards are completed and availa ble from and updated by SDOs, ongoing Protocol enhancement efforts will continue to provide reco mmendations and relevant documentation that can support updating of those standards. Until the standard s are completed and published, this document and future versions of it provide the foundation and fo cal point for a uniform, consistent, and comparable basis for measuring and expressing system performance. The intention is to continuously enhance the Protocol based on a process open to all stakeholders on an equitable basis that provides them an opportunity to participate and provide input, while al so being sensitive to the need for continuity as enhancements to the Protocol are de veloped over time. Hence, the Protocol is expected to be updated at least biennially or more frequently if warranted th rough needed subgroups focusing on specific issues that again are open to any and all stakeholders. The updating process will include a cutoff time after which additional revisions will be deferred to the next revision cycle. Work on the deferred revisions will continue, but publication of an updated Protocol will occur no more frequently than annually. Protocol Enhancement Overview The enhancements contained in this document are based on a number of concurrent activities that were undertaken predominantly during 2015. One set of activities, hosted by Paci fic Northwest National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories, involve d the addition of criteria to cover five new applications for ESSs. Those new applications ar e photovoltaic (PV) smoothing, volt/var support, renewables (solar) firming, power quality, and frequency control. An overview of the revisions to the Protocol associated with each of these five new app lications is provided below, but in general, the revisions involved the development of a duty cycl e for each new application and guidance on how to determine the values of the relevant metrics for each application. Beyond the addition to the Protocol of criteria to cover new applications and metrics, minor adjustments were made to the Protocol based on experiences from its application and use along with a significant change to simplify the organization of the document to make it more user friendly. In response to needs of the utility sector as presented on their behalf through the EPRI ESIC, a number of enhancements were made to the Protocol. One fo cuses on the inclusion of general information and technical specifications associated with ESSs that utilities and other ESS users need above and beyond the performance metrics and test procedures covered in the Protocol. Other revisions were focused on technical clarifications and enhancements. For instan ce, capacity typically denotes power in the context of the grid. Hence, energy capacity (which has been used in prior editi ons of the protocol) has been replaced by energy in this edition of the Protocol to avoid co nfusion. While consideration was given to a recommendation to now use state of energy to describ e the ESS state, state of charge (SOC) has been retained because SOC associated with batteries is what the battery management system relies on in controlling the ESS. Since the Protocol also applies to other types of storage (e.g., other than batteries) SOC is also appropriate to capture their state. The EPRI ESIC also suggested that 100% SOC should be April 2016 Page v the maximum SOC and 0% SOC should be the minimu m SOC when conducting certain tests. However, to require the ESS to be charged to 100% SOC a nd discharged to 0% SOC is overly prescriptive and could compromise an ESS where the manufacturer may not want their ESS to be discharged to 0% SOC. Instances involving terms that were defined but not u sed in the document were identified and those terms deleted from the definitions. Definitions of some of th e new applications for an ESS were also enhanced based on input from the EPRI ESIC in addition to incl uding an equation for considering auxiliary power when auxiliary loads are powered by separate power sources. One comment suggested that an ESS can be used for power quality only in an is landed mode. It is not clear th at is the case, and the provisions covering this new application were not changed from the final draft developed by the subgroup that developed the power-quality-related provisions in the Protocol. In addition, the 1-minute, 1-5 minute, and 10-minute peak power tests for this application were identified as not necessar y. Since the overload capability of the power conversion system depends on duration, it was decided these tests would be retained as drafted by the subgroup. A comment about the rigor of data sampling frequency was also provided. Based on the application and use of the Pr otocol for frequency regul ation, which has been covered in the document since la te 2012, data every second appear s to be necessary for frequency regulation and other applications where the ESS is s ubjected to signals frequently. For peak shaving or energy arbitrage, data every 10 seconds was considered sufficient. On this issue, those developing the document feel the data acquisition frequency should be at least double the rate of the signal being sent to the ESS. As noted above, the intent of this document is to provide a foundation for formal standards developed by SDOs. The process for development and updating of this document is dynamic and intended to provide all stakeholders the opportunity to provide input through subgroups that are established to focus on additions and enhancements to the document (e .g., new applications, new metrics, and adjustments based on use of the document). New Organization of Content The organization of the November 2012 Protocol and its June 2014 revision was somewhat complicated in that it contained more sections than necessary in outlining the steps associated with using the Protocol. It also repeated a considerable amount of content for each ESS application that could have been presented once. This organization, while somewhat cumbersome , did make it easier to choose an application and then follow through the Protocol for all the releva nt provisions for that application. In essence, the Protocol contained a separate \"track\" for each of th e initial two and then the one additional application added in June 2014, even though the content in each track was in many cases identical. In revising the Protocol to include five more app lications and address additional metri cs, it became clear that continuing this organization would increase the complexity of usi ng the Protocol (i.e., now eight separate tracks) and make it less desirable to apply or to use as a basis for more formal standards. This April 2016 revision 2 to the Protocol has eliminated the separate-track appro ach and replaced it with three core sections that can be more easily applied to any ESS and the eight appli cations now covered in th e Protocol. In addition, this organization will facilitate the seamless inclusion of additional applications and metrics over time while not compromising the ease of use of the document. Section 4 of the Protocol provides an overview of th e Protocol and how it is to be applied to any ESS. Section 5 provides the detail associated with the releva nt performance metrics, test procedures to measure performance data associated with the metrics, as well as the duty cycle that is relevant to each application and is used to guide testing associated with duty-cy cle relevant metrics. Section 6 simply provides the April 2016 Page vi guidance for uniformly reporting the value of each metric based on the requirements in Section 5, covering testing, data gathering, and use of the data in calculating the relevant metrics associated with the ESS. This makes it much easier to address those items that are not dependent on duty cycle one time for all ESSs regardless of application. Beyond that, the t esting, measurement, and calculation of the metrics that are related to duty cycle and unique to each a pplication and their reporti ng is also only presented once, noting that they would have to be repeated for each of the applications for which the ESS was intended based on subjecting the ESS to a duty cycle th at is unique to each of the eight applications covered in the Protocol. New Applications As noted in the overview, five new ESS applications have been added to the three applications (peak shaving, frequency regulation and islanded microgr ids) covered in the June 2014 revision 1 to the Protocol. These are listed in Table 4.3 of the Protocol , which now covers eight applications. Each of these five new applications is then addressed in the same ma nner as the prior three applications; that is, they are listed along with the metrics that are applicable to each application, provisions have been added to provide a duty cycle for each new application, and the measurements to make when applying the duty cycle, determination of applicable performance metrics from these measurements, and the details associated with reporting those metrics are outlined. Sp ecific detail on each of these new applications is provided in the following descriptions. PV Smoothing PV smoothing is the use of an ESS to mitigate rapi d fluctuations in variable PV power output. The purpose of PV smoothing is to mitigate frequency variation and stability issues that can arise at both feeder and transmission levels in hi gh penetration PV scenarios to help meet ramp rate requirements. At the feeder level, PV smoothing is implemented to miti gate voltage flicker and vo ltage excursions outside desired bands. At the transmission level, PV variability can require additional operating reserve to be set aside and can cause traditional generation to cycle mo re than otherwise. The method by which the ESS can provide smoothing of PV output power is to absorb or supply power at appropriate times as determined by a control system resulting in a less variable composite power signal at the feeder and/or transmission level. Permission was given by the Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM) to the PV smoothing subgroup of the Protocol Working Group to use PV power output (expressed in kW) and battery power output (expressed in kW) from the PNM Prosperity Pr oject for construction of the PV smoothing duty cycle [see Roberson et al. (2014) for a description and analysis of the project]. The data featured one- second time resolution and is archived going back to 2011. The duty cycle is constructed by capturing one-hour \"slices\" of PV generation from different days and splicing these slices together into a composite signal of 10 hours in length. The majority of these slices represent moderate to very high levels of PV vari ability. Thus, the composite signal will lead to an aggressive tracking signal. Different times of the day a nd times of the year can be captured by one signal. The tracking signal is then computed by subtracting the 30-minute moving average of the composite \"day\" from the composite signal itself. The duty cycle is obtained by normalizing the tracking signal to the rated power of the smoothing battery. Care was ta ken to ensure that the full \"day\" signal as well as each hour of this day is sufficien tly close to net energy neutral. April 2016 Page vii The relevant metrics for PV smoothing are listed below. Reference performance metrics system rating round-trip energy efficiency response time ramp rate energy energy stability Duty-cycle-specific metrics reference signal tracking SOC excursion duty-cycle round-trip efficiency maximum ambient temperature, measured in degrees Fahrenheit. Volt/Var A volt/var application addresses fluctuations in grid voltage by providing volt-amperes reactive (var) support, injecting vars as grid voltage dips and ab sorbing vars as grid voltage increases. The ESS is assumed to be deployed only for volt/var support; hen ce, the full power rating of the ESS is available for this duty cycle. This work builds on the work done by the Smart Inverter Working Group (SIWG) convened by the California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) and the California Energy Commission. The SIWG provided a set of recommendations to the CPUC on February 7, 2014. Based on these recommendations, the three investor-owned utilities in California\u2014 Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison Company, and San Di ego Gas & Electric Company\u2014proposed revisions to the California Electric Tariff Rule 21. The CPUC has not yet ruled on the proposed revisions. Based on these proposed revisions, Underwriters Labo ratories (UL), Sandia National Laboratories, EPRI, Xanthus Logge rware, utilities, and PV inverter manufacturers developed a protocol to test smart inverters under a California Solar Initiative grant (Johnson et al. 2013a, Johnson et al. 2013b, Johnson et al. 2014, UL 2015). The relationship developed by the SIWG of ESS var output as a function of grid voltage was used to develop duty cycles for the volt/var application by simulating grid voltage at representative feeder locations using GridLAB-D. The voltage at the point of common coupling for a PV system at one end of a 4 kV feeder was also subjected to the SIWG relationship to develop duty cycles. The metrics that were determined to be relevant fo r volt/var are listed below. Note that duty cycle round-trip efficiency, which is a metric for other applications, is not rele vant to volt/var applications since no real power is being exchanged.

More precisely, the purpose of renewables firmi ng is to provide energy (or conversely, to absorb energy) when renewable generation falls below some threshold (or conversely, exceeds this threshold). This application is performed to provide steady power out put over a desired time window, usually a period of multiple hours. Typically, the threshold is based upon the forecasted nominal renewable power generation over the desired time window. Thus, the ESS is compensating for the forecast uncertainty in actual renewable generation during that time window. The me thod by which the ESS performs this application is described as follows. The ESS discharges power dur ing periods for which renewable generation falls short of the threshold and absorbs power when renewable generation exceeds this threshold. Generally, to yield multiple hours of steady power output, the time periods over which the ESS attempts to firm power output are normally in the range of minutes, with 15-minute time windows being common. The key differentiator between smoothing and firm ing applications can be explained as follows. Smoothing is applied to limit ramp rates, typically in the one-second to one-minute time periods. Firming is more appropriately applied in the 15-minute to several-hour time periods. As with PV smoothing, data from the PNM Prospe rity Project was used for construction of the renewables (solar) firming duty cycle [see Roberson et al. (2014) for a description and analysis of the April 2016 Page ix project]. The construction process is similar to PV sm oothing except that the time windows of interest are in the minutes to hours range, rather than seconds to minutes. The relevant metrics for renewables (solar) firming are listed below. Reference performance metrics: system rating round-trip energy efficiency response time ramp rate energy energy stability Duty-cycle-specific metrics: reference signal tracking SOC excursion duty-cycle round-trip efficiency maximum ambient temperature, measured in degrees Fahrenheit Power Quality A sag or interruption in voltage can cause power di sturbances that negatively impact power quality. This problem can be more common in distribution systems compared to transmission systems. Energy storage can mitigate voltage sags by injecting real power for up to a few tens of seconds. The application of an ESS to address power quality does not require the ESS to provide enough energy for customers to ride through an outage of greater than 10-minute duration. The duty cycle consists of continuous discharge at peak power for durations of 1, 5, and 10 minut es, where peak power is defined as maximum power delivered by the ESS for each of those time durations. The vendor and/or end user determines the SOC range for each duty cycle. Since power quality involves discharge, the starting SOC can be as high as 100%, with the lower limit at 20% (to ensure the ESS can provide peak power at the lower limit of the SOC range). The ESS ramps to the power specified and stays there for the specified duration. The duty-cycle duration is adjusted such that total disch arge capacity does not exceed energy withdrawn at rated power for one hour. This is to ensure that an unnecessarily heavy bu rden of energy requirement is not placed on the ESS, which could necessitate a derating of its power. In the development of the duty cycle for this application, it was determined that, for power-inten sive applications, derating the power to satisfy an arbitrarily long duty cycle does not appear to be practical. The metrics that are relevant to a power quality application of ESS are listed below. Reference performance metrics: round-trip efficiency response time and ramp rate energy energy stability April 2016 Page x Duty-cycle-specific metrics: peak discharge power for durations of 1, 5, and 10 minutes duty-cycle round-trip efficiency reference signal tracking SOC excursion Frequency Control The conventional name for the service provided by an ESS in this application is frequency response, but for the purposes of the Protocol, the term \"frequency control\" was selected. In this service, there is a sudden loss of generation that must be made up thro ugh a discharge from the ESS. There can also be a sudden loss of load, requiring the ESS to charge, however that situation is not a net zero energy signal (unlike frequency regulation), since power flows in one direction during this service\u2014discharge or charge. In revising the Protocol to cover a frequency control a pplication, it was assumed that tertiary frequency control is provided by other generators and th at the ESS provides primary and secondary frequency control. The primary frequency control lasts 30 sec onds; from that point until 20 minutes has elapsed, the secondary frequency control process occurs. As sec ondary frequency control starts at 30 seconds, the power provided by assets for primary frequency cont rol decrease, and the power levels provided by primary and secondary contro ls sum to a constant. If the ESS provides only primary frequency control, it ramps up to its 1-minute peak power and stays there for 30 seconds. Here, peak power is defi ned as the maximum power the ESS can provide for 1 minute continuously, which is a new metr ic relevant to this application. If the ESS provides both primary and secondary frequency control, it simply ramps up to its 20-minute peak power (the maximum power the ESS can provide for 20 minutes) and stays there for 20 minutes. Duty cycles for primary and secondary frequency control were developed, with the control events lasting up to 30 seconds and 20 minutes, respectively. The ener gy storage power used at an actual 2 MW storage system as the grid frequency deviated from its nominal frequency was also used as a basis to develop a linear relationship between storage power and normalized grid frequency deviation. The distribution grid frequency data was obtained from a utility for spring , summer, autumn, and winter; using the linear relationship that was developed, a duty cycle was deve loped for each of the four seasons. The metrics that were determined to be relevant for volt/var are listed below. Reference performance metrics: round-trip efficiency response time and ramp rate energy energy stability Duty-cycle-specific metrics peak power for 1 minute during charge and discharge April 2016 Page xi peak power for 20 minutes during charge and discharge duty-cycle round-trip efficiency reference signal tracking New Metrics As discussed above, a new duty cycle had to be devel oped for each of the five new applications. While no new general metrics were added to the Protocol to cover these new applications, there were new metrics deemed relevant to each of the new duty cycles. Th ese new metrics are listed below for each of the new applications that had new metrics included in the Protocol. Volt/Var reactive power ramp rate at 50% SOC, determined using the same procedure as real power ramp rate. The ESS is brought to 50% SOC and the time taken to go from 0 to 100 percent reactive power in the positive direction (capacitive) and in the ne gative direction (inductive) is measured. SOC_volt/var - the SOC between the end and the beginning of the volt/var duty cycle SOC_active_standby - the SOC between the end and the beginning of a 24-hour active standby with auxiliary load turned on, with the initial SO C the same as the value at the start of the volt/var duty cycle the real energy injected (with and without the volt/var duty cycle) the real energy absorbed (with and without the volt/var duty cycle) the net energy (injected or absorbed) (w ith and without the volt/var duty cycle) Power Quality peak power at discharge of 1, 5, and 10 minutes. Frequency Control peak power at 1 minute and 20 minutes for charge and discharge Technical Specifications As noted above, the EPRI ESIC requested that additi onal information be included in the Protocol that utilities and others could use in making decisions about the application and use of an ESS. This additional information was developed by a working group of th e ESIC, and included performance metrics that were already covered in the June 2014 revision 1 to th e Protocol. The information requested also included general information relevant to ESSs as well as certai n technical specifications associated with an ESS\u2014 that is, items not necessarily related to the performan ce of an ESS for any specific ESS application, but information broadly applicable to all ESS regardl ess of application. Section 4.2 of the June 2014 revision 1 to the Protocol provided for a descrip tion of the ESS including its weight, volume, and footprint (area). That section has been enhanced and the April 2016 revision 2 to the Protocol includes a Table 4.4.1 of general information and technical spec ifications that include those prior items and adds additional items, such as operating temperature range and required clearances.

H.1 April 2016 Page 1 Protocol1 for Uniformly Measuring and Ex pressing the Performance of Energy Storage Systems 1.0 Purpose This Protocol provides a set of \"best practices\" fo r characterizing energy storage systems (ESSs) and measuring and reporting their performance. It serv es as a basis for assessing how an ESS will perform with respect to key performance attributes relevant to different applications. It is intended to provide a valid and accurate basis for the comparison of diffe rent ESSs. By achieving the stated purpose, the Protocol will enable more informed decision-maki ng in the selection of ESSs for various stationary applications. 2.0 Scope The Protocol identifies general information and techni cal specifications relevant in describing an ESS and also defines a set of test, measurement, and evalua tion criteria with which to express the performance of ESSs that are intended for energy-intensive and/or power-intensive stationary applications. An ESS includes a storage device, battery management system , and any power conversion systems installed with the storage device. The Protocol is agnostic with r espect to the storage technology and the size and rating of the ESS. The Protocol does not apply to single-use storage de vices and storage devices that are not coupled with power conversion systems, nor does it address safety, secu rity, or operations and maintenance of ESSs, or provide any pass/fail criteria. 3.0 Definitions The following definitions shall be applied within the context of this protocol for the purposes of performance testing. To be useful, test procedures mu st include definitions to narrow the margin for interpretation and increase the repeatability of tests. Te rms not defined shall have their normal dictionary meaning and be applied as such when using the Protocol. Area Control Error. A measure of the deviation of the actua l interchange energy from the scheduled interchange energy on the ties with adjacent ba lancing authorities coupled with a frequency error component, a meter error component, a time error co rrection term, and an inadvertent energy payback term. Area Regulation.

For electrical ESSs, the SOC as reported by the battery management system or the flywheel management system shall be recorded. The energy input during charge, Wh Ci, into the ESS during ESS charging, including all parasitic losses, shall be measured directly duri ng charging and recorded as the charge energy of the ESS.

The DAS shall be started and shall command the po wer output of the ESS to change to full rated discharge power output, and T 1 and T2 shall be measured and recorded. 7. The DAS shall be reset to a state to begin reco rding data and the ESS placed in a state of active standby. RT D = T2 T1 (5-5) where RT D is the discharge response time in seconds; T1 is the beginning time stamp, in seconds, when the ESS starts responding to the discharge signal; an d T2 is the end time stamp, in seconds, when the output of the ESS reaches 100 \u00b1 2% of its rated power output. The discharge ramp rate (RR D) shall be calculated in accordance w ith Equation 5-6a and expressed in megawatts per second. April 2016 Page 16 RR D = [P T2]/[T 2 - T 1] (5-6a) where P T2 is the power output of the ESS recorded at time T 2 (100 \u00b12% of rated power capacity); T 1 is the beginning time stamp, in seconds, when the ESS st arts responding to the discharge signal; and T 2 is the end time stamp, in seconds, when the output of the ESS reaches 100 \u00b12% of its rated power output. The discharge ramp rate shall also be expressed as percent rated power per second (RR Dpct,) in accordance with Equation 5-6b. RR Dpct = RR D/ PR 100 (5-6b) where P R is the rated power of the ESS. The manufacturer shall provide information about the rated apparent power of the ESS, and the tests in Section 5.2.3.2 shall be repeated by replacing the rate d power with the rated appa rent power to determine the reactive power response time.

The duty cycles presented in this section shall be used in the determination of the performance of systems in tended for peak-shaving (management) applications and shall use charge and discharge time windows instead of normalized power levels or discharge rates to allow the duty-cycle profile to be applied in the same manner to different technologies regardless of system size, type, age, and condition. The duty cycles applied in determining system performance shall be in accordance with Figure 5.3.1 and the provisions in Sections 5.3.1.1 through 5.3.1.4. In applying the duty cycles, the discharge power and SOC range for each duty cycle shall be selected such that the power remains constant throughout the required discharge period (6 hours, 4 hours and 2 hours for duty cycles A, B, and C, respectively, shown in Figure 5.3.1). Each duty cycle shall have a total charge time of 12 hours: the required discharge period duration and a float window after charge and discharge that bring the total duration for each of the A, B, and C duty cycles to one 24-hour period. While Figure 5.3.1 displays the duty cycles for a midnight-to-midnight day with an evening peak, for the purposes of testing, the test starts with a discharge at 13:00 hours for duty cycle A, 14:00 hours for duty cycle B and 15:00 hours for duty cycle C. Prior to the test, the ESS shall be brought to the maximum SOC by charging at rated power. When conducting performance tests using duty cycles A, B, and C, the ESS shall be returned to the same SOC as the SOC at the start of the test, which in this case is the maximum SOC. As such, each duty cycle A, B, and C consists of a discharge, followed by active standby, discharge, active standby, and a top- off charge to bring the ESS to the initial SOC.

During the charge window, the ESS shall be charged at constant power in a 12-hour time period to bring the ESS to its upper SOC limit. 5.3.1.2 Float Window. During the float window, the upper SOC limit shall not be maintained and the operation of any internal support loads for the ESS, such as, but not limited to, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems, shall continue to operate as required in accordance with the ESS manufacturer's specifications and operating instructions. Discharging of the ESS that does not serve a load external to the ESS shall be permitted during the float window. 5.3.1.3 Discharge Window. During the discharge window, the ESS sh all be discharged at constant power until the minimum SOC level for the discharge power used, as specified by the ESS manufacturer, is reached. Figure 5.3.1 .

A reference to the data upon which Figure 5.3.6 is based is included in Appendix F. April 2016 Page 27 Figure 5.3.6 . Duty Cycle - Renewable (Solar) Firming 5.3.7 Power Quality Duty Cycle. The duty cycles presented in Figures 5.3.7a through 5.3.7c shall be applied in determining the performance of an ESS for a power quality application. The duty cycles shown in Figures 5.3.7a through 5.3.7c are shown as continuous discharge at peak power for durations of 1, 5, and 10 minutes respectively. In Figures 5.3.7a and 5.3. 7b, the first graph in each pair shows the entire duty cycle and the second graph in each pair shows a ma gnified portion of the duty cycle in order to provide detail on the discharge characteristics. The duty cycle in Figure 5.3.7a corresponds to the use of ESSs in a power quality application for a duration of 24 hours where there is a continuous ESS discharge of 1-minute duration every 30 minutes.

The duty cycles in Figures 5.3.8 a through5.3.8 e shall be applied in determining the performance of an ESS in a freque ncy control application. The duty cycles shown in Figures 5.3.8a covers a primary frequency control situa tion during a sudden loss of generation. This duty cycle corresponds to an ESS discharge for 30 seconds at 1-minute peak power, a rest for 29 minutes, and then repeats this same pattern of use over a period of 24 hours or to a point in time when the low SOC limit of the ESS is reached. The top portion of this figure is the entire duty cycle over 24 hours, while the bottom portion shows the magnified portion of the duty cycle in order to provide detail on the discharge characteristics.

The ESS performance metrics in Section 5.4 are dependent on the intended application(s) of the ESS as determined in accordance with Section 4.3 and the use of the relevant duty cycle(s) in Section 5.3 during the test s required in this section. The results from all tests conducted in accordance with this section shall be used to determine baseline ESS duty-cycle performance that can be subsequently used to assess any changes in the condition of the ESS and performance over time and use. The tests presented in th is section shall be repeated at regular intervals specified by the manufacturer during cycle testing for same-system comparison purposes. Such intervals shall be selected to identify how the testing or ope ration affects the performance of the ESS and shall be in units of time, number of cycles, or energy th roughput. Duty-cycle performance tests shall be conducted for each intended application of an ESS using the duty cycles as defined in Sections 5.3.1 through 5.3.8. Prior to initiating any of the duty-cycle performan ce tests, the initial SOC shall be set per the manufacturer's specifications and ope rating instructions. Where an ESS is to be evaluated under more than one duty cycle, the ESS shall be brought back to the same initial SOC used as a basis for testing conducted under the first duty cycle before application of one or more duty cycles. As provided in Section 5.3, the ESS manufacturer shal l be permitted to apply one or more alternative duty cycles beyond those provided in Section 5.3. When an alternative duty cycle is applied, the manufacturer shall provide a description of and rationale for th e alternative duty cycle and shall conduct all tests required in Section 5.4 for the intended ESS applica tion(s) while subjecting the ESS to the alternative duty cycle(s). Table 5.4 indicates which duty-cycle performance metrics in Section 5.4 are relevant for each of the ESS applications covered by this document. In determ ining the performance of an ESS for a power quality or frequency control application, testing in accordance with Sections 5.4.5.2 and 5.4.5.3, respectively, shall be performed first, followed by the testing in accordance with Sections 5.4.1 through 5.4.4.

Volt/var also has duty-cycle metrics for ramp rate, SOC_volt/var, SOC_active_standby, Wh_charge and Wh_net. 2. PQ also has a duty-cycle metric for peak discharge power for 1, 5, and 10 minutes. 3. FC also has a duty-cycle metric for peak char ge and discharge power for 1 and 20 minutes. 5.4.1 Duty-Cycle Round-Trip Efficiency. The duty-cycle round-trip efficiency of the ESS shall be determined in accordance with this section. The tests as described in items 1 through 5 below shall be conducted separately for each intended application of the ESS while applying the duty cycle in Section 5.3 relevant to each intended application of the ESS. The results shall be reported in accordance with Section 6.3 separately for each intended application of the ESS. Exception: Duty-cycle round-trip efficiency is not app licable to ESSs intended for volt/var support applications. The manufacturer shall charge and discharge the ESS in accordance with this section using the duty cycle in Section 5.3 applicable to the intended application(s) of the ESS. 1. The ESS shall be brought to the initial desired SOC as dictated by a given T initial, or P initial in accordance with the duty cycle in Section 5.3 applicable to the in tended application of the ESS by adding or removing the necessary amount of energy at the rated power of the ESS as provided by the manufacturer's specifications. For electrical ESSs, the SOC as reported by the battery management system or the flywheel management system shall be recorded. 2. The ESS shall then be subjected to the duty cycle in Section 5.3 that is applicable to the intended application of the ESS. 3. Where the duty cycle being applied has multiple prof iles, Steps 1 through 3 shall be repeated for all other profiles in the duty cycle. The duty-cycle round-trip efficiency at each discharge power level of a duty cycle with one profile, or each profile in a duty cycle with multiple profiles, sh all be determined by dividing the energy removed (output) from the ESS at a given power by the energy required to recharge (input) the ESS accounting for auxiliary loads as described in Section 5.2.2. When the discharge power tapers off, the duty-cycle round- trip efficiency shall be calculated for the SOC ra nge corresponding to consta nt power as described in Section 5.2.2. The percentage of discharge duration for which constant power was maintained shall be reported, along with average power. The duty-cycle round-trip efficiency shall be reported for the entire SOC range of the duty cycle, along with the averag e discharge power (discharge duration \u00f7 discharge time). The duty-cycle round-trip efficiency as a function of di scharge power shall be determined by dividing the energy removed from the ESS at a given power by th e energy required to recharge the ESS and reported in accordance with Section 6.3. Any auxiliary loads shall be accounted for as described in Section 5.2.2 and also reported in accordance with Section 6.3. When an application has multiple duty cycles, the charge and discharge energy shall include the energy to bring the ESS back to initial SOC after each duty cycle. 5.4.2 Reference Signal Tracking. The ability of the ESS to respond to a signal for the duration of the duty cycle for each intended application of the ESS reflect s the ability of the ESS to track the signal. The tests in Section 5.4.2.1 shall be conducted separat ely for each intended application of the ESS while April 2016 Page 36 applying the duty cycle in Section 5.3 relevant to each intended application of the ESS as described in 5.4.1. The results shall be reported in accordan ce with Section 6.3 separately for each intended application of the ESS. Exception: Reference signal tracking is not appli cable to ESSs intended for peak-shaving applications. 5.4.2.1 Calculation Procedure. The ability of the ESS to respond to a signal for the duration of the relevant duty cycle(s) from Section 5.3 that reflect the ability of the ESS to track the signal shall be defined and determined by the manufacturer of the ES S in accordance with the provisions of this section. The balancing signal shall be changed in accordan ce with duty cycle(s) from Section 5.3 for each intended application of the ESS. The manufacturer of the ESS shall also determine a nd report separately the total percentage tracking and the times when the ESS stops tracking and restarts trac king as an indication of whether the ESS is capable of tracking high peaks and/or high energy half-cycl es. The manufacturer shall also determine whether the ESS can go through the required duration of the duty cycle without reaching the lower or upper SOC limits. This shall be performed during the applicati on of the relevant duty cycle as described in Section 5.3, and any time during that period when the ESS i ndicates an ability or inability to follow the signal shall be reported. An inability to follow the signal shall be considered a situation where the ESS cannot deliver or absorb required signal power during the dur ation when the balancing signal is to be changed and cannot deliver or absorb the required signal ener gy during the duration when the signal remains above or below the x-axis. The ability of the ESS to respond to a reference signal shall be recorded during the duty-cycle round-trip efficiency test. The residual sum of squares or the sum of the square of errors between the balancing signal ( P signal) and the power delivered or absorbed by the ESS ( Pess) shall be calculated in accordance with Equation 5-12 and used to estimate the inability of the ESS to track the signal.

Normative Appendix A - Duty-Cycle Signal for Peak-Shaving Applications of Energy Storage Systems April 2016 Page A.1 Normative Appendix A Duty-Cycle Signal for Peak-Shaving Applications of Energy Storage Systems In Section 5.3.1, the charge duration is fixed at 12 hou rs, and discharge durations are 6, 4, and 2 hours for duty cycles A, B, and C, respectively. The corresponding rest times after charge and discharge are 3, 4, and 5 hours, respectively. Feedback from the Protocol Users Group indicated that the 12-hour charge window may be too long. Additional feedback indicated that the rest durations were too long. For example, for the 2-hour discharge duty cycle, 5 hours rest after charge and after discharge brings the total rest time to 10 hours. Based on the feedback, alternate duty cycles with charge duration va rying from 4 to 12 hours, and rest durations after charge and discharge varying from 1 to 3 hours may be used. In addition, the x-axis in Figure 5.3.1 shows the hour of the day, with 0 hours corresponding to start of the day and 12 corresponding to noon. In the first version of the Protocol (November 2012) the duty cy cle could be started at any time. In this version of the Protocol, the duty cycle is started at 22 h ours (or 10 p.m.) each day. This allows a continuous charge, followed by rest and continuous discharge, followed by rest. Rather than provide time of day on the x-axis, it may be preferred to show time from the start of the duty cycle on the x-axis. Each cycle starts with a charge from an initial state of charge (SOC), which is the estimated SOC from maximum SOC to the end of the c onstant power discharge period. At the end of the rest period after discharge, the energy storage system (ESS) is brought to its initial SOC by charge or discharge. The round-trip energy efficiency (RTE) is calculated as provided for in the Protocol, taking into account auxiliary power when applicable. The SOC excursion associated with this change in application of the duty cycle would also be reported. An example of an alternative duty cycle is as follo ws. For duty cycle A, the ESS is brought to the SOC expected after a 6-hour discharge from the upper SO C limit for the ESS, followed by a 15-minute test. For duty cycle B, the ESS is brought to the SOC e xpected after a 4-hour discharge from the upper SOC limit for the ESS, followed by a 15-minute test. For duty cycle C, the ESS is brought to the SOC expected after a 2-hour discharge from the upper SOC limit for the ESS, followed by a 15-minute test. The duty cycle in Fig. 5.3.1 is embedde d in this document as a spreadsheet. April 2016 Page A.2 Figure A.1 .

The si gnals were grouped into low, averag e, and high standard deviation days. A representative 2-hour average standard devi ation signal was chosen, and a representative 2-hour high standard deviation signal was chosen. It was also noted that 24-hour signals were energy neutral. The average and high standard deviation signals were chosen such that they were energy neutral and had the same standard deviation as the average and high devi ation signals over the one-year time frame. The duty cycle consisted of three 2-hour average signals, fo llowed by one 2-hour high deviation signal, three 2- hour average signals, one 2-hour high deviation signal, and four 2-hour average signals.

Since our working group does not have access to grid 1 Conover DR, AJ Crawford, J Fuller, SN Gourisetti, and VV Viswanathan.

At the end of the duty cycle, the ESS is brought to its initial SOC by charging or discharging at rated power. The RTE is calculated as described earlier, ta king into account auxiliary power when applicable. Grid frequency data for four seasons were obtained from a utility, as shown below in Figure H.2. The linear fit shown in Equation H-1 was applied to the gr id frequency data to generate the duty cycles shown in Figure H.3. Figure H.2 .
