The inclusion of anti-HER2 targets increased the detection of one CTC in a given sample from 89% to 95%. Interestingly, HER2 was detected in CTCs and tdEVs that express cytokeratin, which is often used to enhance CTC detection. Additionally, a preselected ROC target of 7% HER2+ CK+ tdEVs predicted HER2 expression with 74% sensitivity and specificity when compared with the HER2 amplification status of the primary tumor sample. - CTC and tdEV heterogeneity in the blood of patients is inversely associated with overall survival. {Open access}0 - These results should be validated with prospective, large-scale analysis of patient samples. However, they present an encouraging prospect for screening for the presence of HER2 based on liquid biopsy. - PBS NewsHour: The Best Health Care?

Among patients with bone, lymph node, and chest wall/breast/skin metastases at baseline, there was a small but significant overall survival benefit for patients who received eribulin versus control treatment. Improved overall survival was also observed in patients with liver metastases who received eribulin.These findings suggest that eribulin has benefits for patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with metastases to bone, liver, lung, lymph node, and chest wall/breast/skin.

Abstract Systemic therapies for primary breast cancer have made great progress over the past two decades. However, oncologists confront an insidious and particularly difficult problem: in those patients with metastatic breast cancer, up to 50% of human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-positive and 25-40% of triple-negative subtypes, metastases (BM) of them. Fortunately, standard- of-care treatments for BM have improved rapidly, with a decline in whole brain radiation therapy and use of fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery as well as targeted therapies and immunotherapies. Meanwhile, advances in fundamental understanding of the basic biological processes of breast cancer BM (BCBM) have led to many novel experimental therapeutic strategies. In this review, we describe the most recent clinical treatment options and emerging experimental therapeutic strategies that have the potential to combat BCBM.

Hang in htere.0 - New Therapy Targets Breast Cancer Metastases In Brain On Aug 26, 2020 Combination therapy reduces tumor size, dramatically improves survival in mice CHICAGO \u2014 When breast cancer spreads to the brain, the prognosis is grim. Patients only have about six months to live. Women with HER2-positive breast cancer tend to develop brain metastases in up to 55% of cases. Chemotherapy drugs targeting breast cancer cells in the brain aren't effective, because they can't cross the blood-brain-barrier. But a new combination therapy targeting breast cancer tumors in the brain dramatically decreased tumor size and increased survival in a study with mice, reports a new Northwestern Medicine study. An estimated 75% of mice that had brain metastases from breast cancer were cured and cancer-free after the therapy. \"The new combination therapy we identified can cross the blood-brain barrier,\" said lead study author Dr. Maciej Lesniak, Northwestern Medicine chair of neurological surgery and professor of neurosurgery at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. \"The therapy also targets brain metastases and significantly improves survival.\" The paper will be published on August 26 in Science Translational Medicine. The two drugs are tubulin inhibitor, vinorelbine, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and available in clinics, and bromodomain inhibitor, I-BET-762, FDA approved for clinical trials. The bromodomain inhibitor increased III-tubulin, a protein found in cancer cells that metastasize to the brain. Overexpression of III-tubulin sensitized cancer cells to be killed by vinorelbine. \"The findings of our work set the stage for a clinical trial, whereby patients with breast cancer brain metastases can be treated with the combination of these two drugs,\" Lesniak said. \"This will offer patients with breast cancer brain metastases, who have been systematically excluded from clinical trials, the chance to benefit from a new therapeutic regimen that has been proven to be strongly effective in experimental settings.\" Breast cancer spreads to other organs like brain, lung and bone. The metastasis of breast cancer to the brain is a terminal disease and the deadliest complication. There is a lack of targeted therapies for breast cancer brain metastases, said first study author Deepak Kanojia, research associate in neurological surgery at Feinberg. \"Patients with brain metastases are often excluded from clinical trials due to their poor outcomes and dismal survival,\" Kanojia said. \"Regular systemic therapies, like Herceptin, do not cross the blood-brain-barrier efficiently, and offer no benefit in brain metastases,\" he said. How the study worked Scientists developed a mouse model that can grow multiple brain metastases to simulate what happens in human patients. They injected tumor cells in the intracarotid artery, resulting in the formation of multiple brain tumors. After the tumors grew, scientists treated the mice with the combination therapy. Final results revealed that 75% of the mice that were treated with the combination were cured and cancer-free.

My MO + 2nd opinion both pushed Enhertu vs the Tucatinib, Xeloda, Herceptin combo. I think the sequencing is still subject to some debate. I couldn't find any good trials that met my needs this go-round, but I am encouraged that there seems to be some brain mets research going on.0 - I wish you the best luck with whatever you decide next and I'll post any new details about the treatment changes or trial on the brain mets thread after my meeting. Enjoy your weekend 0 - Dr. Pegram on the DESTINY-Breast01 Trial With Trastuzumab Deruxtecan in HER2+ Breast CancerOncLive - August 27, 2020 @{Watch the video at link below. Runtime @ 2:25. Transcript:} Mark D. Pegram, MD, co-director of Stanford's Molecular Therapeutics Program, and director of the Breast Cancer Oncology Program, at Stanford Women's Cancer Center, discusses the results of the phase 2 DESTINY-Breast01 study examining fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (Enhertu; DS-8201) in is a HER2 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that is based on a backbone sequence of trastuzumab (Herceptin), which is covalently linked to a topoisomerase exatecan a tetrapeptide-based cleavable says Pegram. This agent is unique, that distinguish it from ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1; Kadcyla). For example, T-DM1 has about 3.5 molecules per payload per antibody backbone, whereas trastuzumab deruxtecan has a drug-to-antibody ratio of 8, adds DESTINY-Breast01 study was a 2-part, open-label, single-group, multicenter, phase 2 study. In the first part of the study, 3 doses of trastuzumab deruxtecan were evaluated in order to identify a recommended phase 2 dose, which was determined to be 5.4 mg/kg given intravenously every 3 weeks. In the second part of the study, the efficacy and safety of the recommended dose was documented, says Pegram. Overall, 184 patients were enrolled and they had undergone a median of 6 previous treatments prior to study enrollment. The overall response rate (ORR) in this heavily pretreated population was 60.9%; this is the highest ORR reported for a single-agent HER2-targeted therapy in such heavily pretreated patients, according to Pegram. The disease control rate was 97.3% at the time of data presentation, adds Pegram. The durability of response with the ADC was also impressive, according to Pegram, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 16.4 months. Moreover, a subset analysis of the trial looked at 24 patients with central nervous system metastasis and showed that the ORR in that subset was approximately 58% with a median PFS of 18.1 months, which is very similar to what had been observed in the intention-to-treat populations. Once the ADC received regulatory approval from the FDA, it became a new practice standard, concludes Pegram.

Made my day!0 - New Era for Targeting HER2 Beckons in Breast Cancer and Beyond OncLive - September 3, 2020 Precision medicine advancements are opening a new chapter in the development of anticancer therapies that target the HER2 pathway, resulting in 3 approvals for breast cancer in less than a year and raising hopes for attacking other cancer types. In the breast cancer arena, the FDA approved 2 new drugs, fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (Enhertu) and tucatinib (Tukysa), and (Nerlynx).1-3 Margetuximab, a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb), is hot on their heels, with developer MacroGenics seeking approval following promising phase 3 outcomes.4-6 Efforts to expand HER2-targeted therapy into other HER2-positive cancer types have met with less success over the years. Except for trastuzumab (Herceptin) in gastric cancer,7 there are no approvals outside of breast cancer, and multiple clinical trial failures have underscored that all HER2positive cancers are not created equal.8 Now, however, ongoing clinical trials of novel HER2-targeted therapies in gastric, colorectal (CRC), and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are showing promise.9-12 Meanwhile, investigators are exploring the role of HER3, which preferentially partners with HER2 to drive oncogenic signaling in propelling resistance to HER2-targeted therapy.13-15 To date, HER3-targeted mAbs have demonstrated limited clinical efficacy, but the development of a HER2-HER3 bispecific antibody is generating early enthusiasm.16,17 Overall, a variety of approved and novel therapies are in the pipeline for targeting HER2 in a range of tumor types (see Table).

Abbvie is getting the exclusive global license to develop and sell the Chinese company's cancer-fighting drug known as lemzoparlimab, also known as TJC4, which is an antibody used to treat multiple forms of cancer. According to the article, the drug therapy targets a \"do not eat me\" signal that allows cancer cells to avoid being targeted by a patient's immune system, blocking the signal to allow the immune system to \"engulf and eradicate the malignant cells.\" Apparently, the Chinese company also has two other antibodies based upon the same drug, and AbbVie will develop those as well.0 - [moth](https://community.breastcancer.org/en/profile/moth)Member Posts: 3,293Oh interesting BevJen.

The method, only tested on lab-grown and patient-derived cancer cells, could advance efforts to find drugs that kill breast cancer cells in a subset of patients... The research team looked for cell division mechanisms specific to cancer cells in a variety of lab-grown cells. During their search, they encountered a line of human breast cancer cells that are very dependent on cell structures called centrioles to divide and survive.... Further observations revealed that the centriole-dependent breast cancer cells had a section of genome that had been abnormally copied many times, an alteration found in about 9% of breast cancers. The researchers observed the genes encoded in the highly copied region and found a gene that was producing high levels of a protein called TRIM37 shown to control centrosomes... They used a PLK4 inhibitor known to disrupt proteins that make centrioles, which interfered with TRIM37. When they added the drug to the lab-grown cancer cells with normal TRIM37 levels, they found that the cells were able to divide, even though the drug had removed the cell's centrioles. When the drug was added to breast cancer cells with high TRIM37 levels the cells were not able to divide and most cells stopped growing or died. \"The idea would be to identify tumors with high levels of TRIM37 and use a PLK4 inhibitor to selectively kill cancer cells and leave healthy cells relatively unharmed,\" explained Holland.
