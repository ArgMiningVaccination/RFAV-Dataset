Two common meditation techniques are concentrative and mindfulness: - During concentrative meditation, such as transcendental meditation, you focus on a single image or sound, the rhythm of your breathing or on words spoken in a mantra. - Mindfulness meditation, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction, brings your awareness to the thoughts, feelings, sounds or images that pass through your mind. All types of meditation usually involve slow, focused breathing and sitting quietly for at least 15 to 20 minutes. The goal is to achieve a calm, silent and alert mind, which can bring feelings of peace and satisfaction. According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, numerous studies shown mediation may reduce blood pressure, ease digestive problems, and soothe anxiety and depression.
