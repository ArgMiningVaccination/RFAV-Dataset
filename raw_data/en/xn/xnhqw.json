As such, this page has been updated to reflect this change and Health & Wellness will no longer use the term \"monkeypox\". Vaccines The NH DPHS recommends the following persons receive the JYNNEOS vaccine: - Persons who identify as gay, bisexual, queer, or other man who has sex with men (MSM) and believe they are at risk for mpox virus infection (including persons in a monogamous relationship who have a sex partner that is at higher risk for mpox); - A person of any gender or sexual orientation whom a provider thinks is at increased risk for mpox virus infection; and - Persons who report, in the prior 14 days, a known exposure to another person infected with mpox virus or contaminated objects. - Post-exposure vaccination should ideally occur within 4 days of an exposure to prevent disease, but vaccination should be offered up to 14 days after last exposure. If you are a UNH student, faculty, and/or staff, meet the above criteria, and would like to receive the vaccine, please fill out the form below and someone at Health & Wellness will reach out to you to set an appointment.

People with mpox typically get a distinct rash that changes over time as a person's illness progresses and then goes away. Other symptoms can include fever, chills, headache, exhaustion, muscle aches, sore throat, or swollen lymph nodes. Sometimes people may only have the rash. Is mpox deadly? The type of mpox virus causing the current outbreak is not usually fatal, and most people will get better within a few weeks after developing symptoms. However, people with a weakened immune system, children under 8 years old, people with a history of eczema, and pregnant or breastfeeding women may be more likely to get seriously ill or die. What should a person do if they have a new or unexplained rash or other symptoms? Mpox is not considered a sexually transmitted infection, but it is often transmitted through close, sustained physical contact, which can include sexual contact. If you think you have symptoms: - Avoid hugging, kissing, cuddling, or having sex or being intimate with anyone until you have been checked out at H&W or with another healthcare provider. - Avoid touching any rash. Do not share personal items like towels, sex toys, and toothbrushes. - Talk with your partner(s) about your symptoms. If you have symptoms of mpox, consider talking to your healthcare provider, even if you don't think you had contact with someone who has mpox. How is the campus responding? UNH is working closely with the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to keep the campus prepared, informed, and healthy. Health & Wellness' medical providers and staff have been trained in identifying, testing for, and managing mpox, and will continue to receive ongoing trainings as necessary. We also provide mpox immunizations on-campus, at UNH Health & Wellness. Please see the top of this page for information about eligibility and how to receive the vaccine. We understand that news of a new infectious disease on top of the last few years of the COVID-19 pandemic can be concerning and result in feelings of anxiety and uncertainty. Campus mental health resources are available through [Psychological and Counseling Services (PACS)](unh.edu/pacs) and [Health & Wellness (H&W)](/health/services). How does mpox spread? Mpox usually spreads from person-to-person through direct physical contact with the infectious rash, scabs, or body fluids of another person who has mpox, including during intimate physical contact such as kissing, cuddling, or sex. The virus can survive on surfaces, so spread can occur through contact with contaminated objects like bedding and clothing that has come into contact with another person's infectious body fluids or skin lesion material. It can also spread from an infected person's respiratory tract during prolonged face-to-face close contact. When is someone with mpox contagious? A person with mpox can spread their infection starting when they first develop symptoms, and they remain contagious until their rash has fully healed and a fresh layer of skin has formed. People who do not have mpox symptoms are not considered contagious or a risk to others. Can I get mpox from talking with someone or being in a room with someone that has mpox? Mpox is primarily spread through direct physical contact with another person who is sick with mpox or direct physical contact with their infectious body fluids. While mpox can be spread through respiratory droplets, this usually requires standing face-to-face with someone who is symptomatic for a long period of time. Briefly talking with someone or being in the same room with a person who has mpox is unlikely to cause to infection. How can I prevent spreading or getting mpox in general? - Avoid close, skin-to-skin contact with people who have a rash that looks like mpox. - Avoid contact with objects and materials that a person with mpox has used. - Wash your hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, especially before eating or touching your face and after you use the bathroom. How can a person lower their risk during sex? Even if you feel well, here are some ways to reduce your chances of being exposed to mpox if you are sexually active: - Make a habit of exchanging contact information with any new partner to allow for sexual health follow-up, if needed. - If you receive the mpox vaccine, take a temporary break from activities that increase exposure to mpox until you are two weeks after your second dose. This will greatly reduce your risk. - Limit your number of sex partners to reduce your likelihood of exposure. - Condoms (latex or polyurethane) may protect you from exposure to mpox during sex. Condoms are available for free\u2014no questions asked\u2014at H&W. - Keep in mind condoms alone may not prevent all exposures to mpox since the rash can occur on other parts of the body. - Dental Dams (latex or polyurethane sheets used between the mouth and genitals) can help reduce risk of transmission during oral sex. Dental dams are available for free\u2014no questions asked\u2014at H&W. - Gloves (latex, polyurethane, or nitrile) might also reduce the possibility of exposure if inserting fingers or hands into the body. The gloves must cover all exposed skin and be removed carefully to avoid touching the outer surface. - Avoid kissing or exchanging spit since mpox can spread this way. - Masturbate together at a distance without touching each other and without touching any rash. - Have virtual sex with no in-person contact. - Consider having sex with your clothes on (dry humping) or covering areas where rash is present, reducing as much skin-to-skin contact as possible. - Be aware that mpox can also spread through respiratory secretions with close, face-to-face contact. - Remember to wash your hands, sex toys, and any fabrics (bedding, towels, clothes) after having sex.

The JYNNEOS vaccine is the only FDA-approved vaccine to prevent mpox and is given as a 2-dose series. The second dose is given 28 days after the first dose. People have maximal protection starting about 14 days after the second dose. Those who are vaccinated should still take precautions to avoid infection since the vaccine does not provide 100% protection (see recommendations above for preventing mpox). Even if vaccinated, people should avoid close or physical contact with someone who has mpox. Please see the top of this page for more information about receiving the vaccine at UNH. Are there any treatments available for mpox? There are currently no treatments specifically for mpox virus infections. However, mpox and smallpox viruses are genetically similar, which means that antiviral drugs and vaccines developed to protect against smallpox may be used to prevent and treat mpox virus infections. Antivirals, such as tecovirimat (TPOXX), may be recommended for people who are more likely to get severely ill, like patients with weakened immune systems. "}
