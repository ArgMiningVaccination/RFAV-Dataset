Approve a new Contract (Master Contract No. 900124, Procurement Contract No. 1 9793 ) with (Principal: Anne Bakar Alameda ) to provide overnight / after -hours mental health treatment services at Santa Rita Jail for the period of 3/1/ 2020 - 6/30/ 2021 in the amount of $ 1,996,506 ; and B. Authorize the Agency Director or designee to execute the agreement with Telecare Corporation , waive the competitive procurement requirement through the Community -Based Organization master contract process and submit an executed copy to the Clerk of the Board for filing . DISCUSSION/SUMMARY Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (ACBH) is seeking approval of a procurement contract with Telecare Corporation to immediately initiate overnight / after -hours mental health services at Alameda County's Santa Rita Jail (Santa Rita) . ACBH has determin ed that the expansion of mental health services in Santa Rita will improve quality and continuity of care for clients receiving services at the jail. As such changes impact the hours and working conditions of existing County employees, the Department will be working closely with the County's Human Resource Services Department to develop implementation plans and properly notice the impacted labor organizations of the forthcoming changes in accordance with the Meyers -Milias -Brown Act. However, to address th e immediate need, and as a stop gap measure, the Department plans to contract with Telecare Corporation for the additional clinical care component required to expand operational hours at Santa Rita Jail pending labor negotiations and hiring permanent count y staff to provide the overnight/ after -hours coverage. Your Board authorized the initiation of the meet and con fer process with affected labor organizations on impacts related to the decision to implement training, procedures, and other matters associa ted with the provision of overnight / after -hours mental health treatment services in Santa Rita . Our ability to ensure that County staff are adequately trained and resourced to provide overnight / after -hours services is also reliant upon AGENDA _____ March 1 7, 2020 The Honorable Board of Supervisors March 9 , 2020 Page 2 of 2 successful comple tion of this formal process. Once this process has been completed, ACBH is committed to ensuring that the on -going overnight/ after -hours mental health services be provided by County employees . ACBH is currently contract ing with Telecare Corporation to p rovide a variety of services in the community, including services provided within sub -acute, locked behavioral health settings. Their knowledge and experience with navigating the Alameda County continuum of care, including resource coordination, crisis se rvices, outpatient, long -term recovery, residential care, and acute and sub -acute treatment was reviewed in relation to this local need. Additionally, Telecare has a proven history of timely start -up and program implementation. These assets were key fact ors considered by ACBH in relation to the department's ability to develop an interim measure that would allow for the immediate provision of overnight / after -hours coverage pending completion of the meet and confer process , and hiring of permanent county s taff to provide these services on an ongoing basis . Your Board's approval of the proposed contract would mean that Telecare could provide expanded overnight / after -hours mental health services until the meet and confer processes are completed , and perma nent county staff can be hired to provide these same services on an ongoing basis . SELECTION CRITERIA This is a request for a new contract with Telecare Corporation and a waiver of the competitive procurement requirement based upon the urgent need to ex pand services and provide 24/7 coverage at Santa Rita Jail. Telecare Corporation has had an ongoing master contract wi th ACBH since 1993 to provide clinical services for a variety of specialized mental health programs. On June 5, 2018 (Item No. 5) , your Board approved a request to waive the SLEB requirement to subcontract 20% of the total award amount for two important reasons: (1) clinical care to clients would be compromised; and (2) State regulations for Medi -Cal do not allow for clinical services to b e sub -contracted with entities that are subject to the cost reporting requirements of the State. This regulatory requirement is supported by good clinical practice. FINANCING The total estimated cost of the proposed new contract with Telecare Corp for ov ernight/after -hours clinical services at Santa Rita jail for the 16 -month period March 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020 is $1,996,506 . The estimated contract augmentation of $499,128 for the current year will be funded by 1991 Realignment funds included in t he FY 19 -20 ACBH Approved B udget with no increase in net county cost. Funding for the remaining $1,497,378 will be addressed in the proposed FY 2020 -2021 budget . VISION 2026 GOAL The provision of overnight / after -hours mental health service meet s the 1 0X goal pathwa y of Healthcare for All in support of the shared vision of a Thriving and Resilient Population.
