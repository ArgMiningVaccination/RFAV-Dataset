NMSU was founded in 1888 as Las Cruces College and later renamed New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts. In 1960, the constitution of New Mexico formally recognized the institution as NMSU. Throughout its history, the university has preserved many of the traditions of its land -grant origin while also increasing emphasis on the fine arts, humanities, social and natural sciences. Today, NMSU is a major institution of higher education.

Admission by GED Any student who has successfully completed the GED may apply for admission. Students must complete the GED in English. Students are encour aged to submit an official high school transcript of the work they completed in addition to their GED scores. The admission will depend upon satisfactory scores on the General Educational Development (GED) test and the American College Testing Program (ACT ) test, and a review of minimum high school unit requirements. AACCCCRREEDDIITTAATTIIOONN New Mexico State University has been accredited since 1926 by The Higher Learning Commission and is a member of the North Central Association. (NCA may be contacted at 30 North LaSalle St., Suite 2400, Chicago, IL 60602 -2504 and (800) 621 -7440.) The university was accredited in 1954 by the American Association of University Women. The university's teacher preparation program, which involves several colleges and which is directed by the College of Education, was accredited in 1962 by the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education. The Division of Student Services has two accredited departments as well. The Counseling Center is fully accredited by the International Association of Counseling Services (IACS), and the Student Health Center is accredited by the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC). Various academic departments and programs are accredited separately by indepen dent accreditation agencies. These may be found at the beginning of each college chapter. GENERAL INFORMATION 4| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2014 -2015 UNDERGRADUATE C ATALOG Dual Credit and Early Admission Programs for High School Students The Dual Credit Program is designed to give high school students an opportunity to enroll at NMSU prior to high school graduation. Students must be either a junior or senior in high school and enrolled in a New Mexico public school district. Under a Dual Credit Master Agreement b etween NMSU and the school district, students enrolled in approved dual credit courses are eligible to have the full cost of tuition and general fees waived. Students who wish to enroll in non - approved dual credit courses are responsible for all costs rela ted to enrollment. High school students not enrolled in a NM public school may be eligible for enrollment as an Early Admission student. Early Admission students are responsible for all costs related to enrollment. Students must complete the Admission Appl ication; provide official high school transcript and official ACT or SAT scores to the Admissions Office; and complete the Dual Credit Request form. Requirements to be admitted to the program are high school grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and an ACT of 2 3 and substantial progress toward completion of the following high school courses: 4 units of English, 3 units of Math (Algebra I, Algebra II, Geometry), 2 units of Science (beyond General Science), 1 unit of a language other than English or a unit of fine art. Western Undergraduate Exchange Program (WUE) The Western Undergraduate Exchange Program (WUE) offers nonresidents of NM a reduced tuition rate. Students from participating WUE states, who are eligi ble for regular admission to NMSU, will be charged regular resident tuition, plus any fees that all students are required to pay. WUE states include Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, Wyoming and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Students must be classified as degree seeking students at the NMSU - Las Cruces campus in good academic standing. Readmission (Degree Seeking) Former students of NMSU, or of one of its Community Colleges, who have been out of school for more than two consecutive terms are required to make formal application for readmission. Applications should be submitted to the Office of University Admissio ns at least 30 days before the opening of the semester or summer session for which the student plans to enroll. A student who has attended other institutions during an absence must have official transcripts forwarded directly to the Office of University Ad missions by the registrar of each institution and must be eligible to return to the college or university last attended. Transcripts must be received prior to the date of registration. Admission status at the time of readmission will normally be determined by previous NMSU academic standing. However, academic performance at other institutions attended during the applicant's absence from NMSU may be taken into consideration in determining the student's admission status. NMSU Graduation and Retention Rates These rates may be found on the NMSU Institutional Research web site at http://irpoa.nmsu.edu. TRANSFER STUDENTS (DOMESTIC) Transfer students from other colleges or universities may be accepted for undergraduate studies if they have at least a 2.0 cumulative grade -point average and are eligible to return to the college or university last attended, and have graduated from high school or successfully passed the GED. Transfer studen ts who have fewer than 30 credits have to meet first -time freshman admission requirements. Transcripts The transfer student must have official transcripts forwarded directly to the Office of University Admissions by the Registrar of eac h college or educational institution previously attended. The ACT or SAT may be required of students who have not earned credit for the first semester of college English. A student who conceals the fact that he or she has attended another college or univer sity, and who has not had the registrar submit a transcript for each institution whether or not credit was earned, will be subject to immediate suspension. Transcripts must be received before the date of registration. Transfer of Credits at NMSU NMSU evaluates courses from postsecondary institutions that are regionally accredited or are candidates for regional accreditation. Transfer students will receive full credit for coursework completed with a grade of C or better, provided the classes are similar or equivalent to courses offered at NMSU. A transfer student may, on the basis of an evaluation of his or her transcripts, receive credit for courses taken at other institutions in which a grade of D was received. However, N MSU does not accept the transfer of courses with D grades that satisfy basic academic competency (basic skills) in English and mathematics. NMSU will not accept transfer credit for 4 credit basic skills courses (such as ENGL 111G and CCDM 114N) when the in coming course carries less than 3 credit hours. Also, colleges or departments may choose to accept only courses graded C or higher in their programs for both transfer and native students. Any lower - division course from another institution receiving transfe r credit from NMSU at the 300 or above level will still count as a lower- division course. Transcripts will be reevaluated when students transfer from one NMSU college to another. Each college determines which transferred courses are applicable toward a degree or a minor. Grades earned in courses taken at other institutions are not included in the calculation of the NMSU GPA, except for grades earned by approved National Student Exchange students. Community/Junior College Transfers Community/junior college transfer students may be admitted and classified on the basis of acceptable credits earned at a two -year institution. However, transfer students are subject to the same graduation requirements as other NMSU student s. This includes the required minimum number of credits from courses numbered 300 or above and the requirement that the last 30 credits must be earned through this university. Evaluation of Transfer Credits Once a stu dent has been admitted to NMSU, an evaluation of credits on a course- by-course basis is submitted to the college (by the Registrar's Office) to which the student is admitted. The student's academic dean approves those transfer courses that are acceptable t oward a degree or a minor. Credits from non -accredited institutions may be evaluated by the student's academic dean after the student has completed two semesters in full- time status with satisfactory grades. Currently enrolled students must obtain prior ap proval from their academic dean before work taken at another institution may apply toward meeting graduation requirements. Religious Center Courses in Religion Courses in religion, offered by the various religio us centers through higher educational institutions with which they are affiliated, are open to all students, and these or similar courses from other universities may be transferred for credit to this university. Registration for these courses in religion i s separate from NMSU's registration and is conducted by the religious center offering the course. Not more than 6 credits in such courses may be transferred to NMSU. If a student wishes to have earned credits transferred to NMSU, the following procedures m ust be observed: _\u0001Obtain written approval from the academic dean prior to registration for the course at the religious center _\u0001Count the credit in the course as part of the total semester load _\u0001Following completion of the course, request that the instit ution granting the credit send a transcript of the credit to the registrar at NMSU Transferring Courses to Fulfill the New Mexico General Education Common Core During the 2005 New Mexico Legislative session, Senate Bill 161, consistent with requirements of state law (Chapter 224 of the Laws of New Mexico, 1995 as amended) was signed into law to further enhance and facilitate the articulation of general education courses amo ng New Mexico's colleges and universities. In accordance with policies established by the New Mexico Higher Education Department, designated general education core courses successfully completed at any regionally accredited public institution of higher edu cation in New Mexico are guaranteed to transfer to any New Mexico public institution. Students who have decided on a major and/or an institution at which to complete their studies should consult with an academic advisor at that particular institution to de termine the most appropriate course selections. Students enrolling for the first year of study at a New Mexico college or university and considering possible transfer into a certificate and/or degree program at another institution are encouraged to take the courses approved for transfer during their freshman and sophomore year of study. The core matrix of approved courses guaranteed to transfer and meet general education requirements at any New Mexico college or university can be found on the New Mexico Higher Education Department web site at www.hed.state.nm.us. Courses are listed by institution, whether university or community college, under each of the five general education areas. The courses for New Mexico State University are listed in the required cou rses section of this catalog. Transferring Courses Within Degree Programs To facilitate the transfer of courses within certain degree programs, New Mexico colleges and universities have collaborated to de velop transferable discipline modules. These are made up of an agreed upon number of hours and courses. When discipline module courses are taken in addition to the 35 hour general education core, the total number of hours in a transfer module are approximately 64. GENERAL INFORMATION | 5 For information on the transferable discipline module for Business, see the College of Business chapter. For information on the transferable discipline module for Early Childhood Education, see the College of Education chapter. Information on all available statewide transfer modules can be found on the New Mexico Higher Education Department web site at www.hed.state.nm.us. Student Responsibility Planning for effective transfer within maximum efficiency is ultimately t he student's responsibility. Responsible transfer planning includes early and regular consultation with the intended degree -granting institution to assure that all pre - transfer coursework will meet the requirements of the desired degree. Transfer Credit Appeal Process All New Mexico public post -secondary institutions are required to establish policies and practices for receiving and resolving complaints from students or from other complainants regarding the transfer of coursework from other public institutions in the state. A copy of NMSU's transfer credit policy may be obtained from the Office of the Registrar or from the Deputy Secretary for Academic Affairs, Higher Education Department, 2048 Galisteo St., Santa Fe, N ew Mexico 87505- 2100. National Student Exchange (NSE) Courses transferred back to NMSU by students participating in the National Student Exchange (NSE) Program will be evaluated as NMSU courses and recorded on the st udent's academic record. All computable grades earned will be included in calculating the student's cumulative grade -point average. Out-of-State Students and Legal Jurisdiction By applying for admission/ enrollment, both the student and parents agree that New Mexico law prevails and all litigation will be in federal court in New Mexico or in state court in Do\u00f1a Ana County, New Mexico. NONDEGREE ADMISSION Nondegree admission is d esigned to meet the needs of mature, part -time students who do not wish to pursue a degree at this university. Courses taken in this status may not be used to meet university admission requirements. Students on nondegree status are not eligible to receive financial aid or student employment; nor are they eligible to participate in student government or intercollegiate athletics; nor are they eligible to receive benefits from any veterans' program. Students interested in using nondegree credit for initial te acher certification or recertification in a new field need to contact the College of Education. Transcripts from previous institutions, high school, and/or results of college entrance exams may be required to assure readiness for university -level courses. A $20 non -refundable, non -degree application fee is required. Nondegree students may not transfer more than 30 credits from this status to any undergraduate degree program with the exception of students participating in a high school concurrent enrollment program. Nondegree students are subject to the same university regulations as regular students. Changing from Nondegree Status A nondegree student in good academic standing at NMSU may apply for change of status from nondegree to regular. Requirements for regular admission must be met. Auditing Courses Students who wish to audit courses may do so as nondegree students with the consent of the instructor, provided the facilities are not required for regular students. Regular students may also audit courses, but audited courses are not counted in determining maximum course loads, except for students on probation or graduate students. Application Materials All documents submitted as part of the admissions process become property of NMSU and will not be returned to the student. Application materials are retained for one calendar year for students who apply but do not attend. IINNTTEERRNNAATTIIOONNAALL SSTTUUDDEENNTTSS The general policies of the university as outlined in this catalog apply to international as well as domestic students. However, some special policies are necessitated by federal laws applicable only to international students.

Legal immigrants or refugees must present documentation of their status either to Admissions or to the International Student & Scholar Services (ISSS) O ffice. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Some of the more important rules as established by the United States Department of Homeland Security for students in non -immigrant status suc h as F- 1 or J-1 visa types are: 1. Each student must maintain full -time student status for both the fall and spring semesters. 2. International students may not work off campus without authorization. On - campus employment may be authorized under certain co nditions. 3. All international students must maintain an up -to-date record in the ISSS Office. This record must indicate the student's current living address and local phone number. 4. Prior to admission, a prospective international student must demonstrat e the following: _ Academic ability to succeed in the chosen course of study _ Adequate financial support to complete the chosen course of study _ Adequate command of the English language to maintain legal status as a full-time student for the fall and spr ing semesters. UNIVERSITY PROCEDURE S FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS Scholastic Ability 1. Prospective undergraduates must have completed a minimum of 12 year's schooling and/or submit official diploma or completion certificate. 2.

No hand -carried documents will be accepted unless received in a sealed envelope. 3. The scholastic average for the last three years of high school must be equivalent to 2.5 GPA on a 4.0 scale. International students are not admitted on a provisional or probationary basis. 4. Graduation from a high school in the United States does not a utomatically qualify an international student for admission to NMSU. The student must also submit official transcripts from his or her foreign secondary school. Financial Support No financial aid is available from NMSU. The univer sity reserves the right to demand advance deposit of funds for any period deemed reasonable prior to granting admission. An international student can never qualify for residency and must pay nonresident fees. Each prospective international student must sub mit a current financial support document with his or her application. This document must show that 1. The person providing the financial support has the necessary funds. 2. The funds can be transferred from the student's home country to the United States. English Language Proficiency NMSU requires a score of 520 paper -based or 68 internet -based or better on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), or a score of 6.0 on the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), for all international students, both nondegree and degree seeking. International students may also demonstrate English proficiency by satisfactorily completing NMSU's Center for English Language Programs (CELP) programs. A waiver of the TO EFL requirement may be considered for 1. Students who are native speakers of English. 2. Students completing high school in the United States who (a) have attended the high school for at least two full semesters and (b) h ave scored in at least the 75th per centile in English on the ACT. 3.

Students demonstrating English -language proficiency using methods accepted by the Office of University Admissions. 5. Students enrolling in certain programs where English lang uage proficiency is not required. 6. Students completing coursework in CELP. Satisfactory completion requires a final grade of no less than 70% in all courses. Visit http://ce lp.nmsu.edu/ for full details. The university reserves the right to require any prospective international student to meet the TOEFL requirement. For complete information concerning the TOEFL examination, applicants should review the following web site: www.toefl.org 6| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2014 -2015 UNDERGRADUATE C ATALOG Regular Undergraduate Admission and English Requirements After regular and full admission to an NMSU degree program, each international undergraduate student is administered an Academic English Proficiency Test. Based on the results, the student is either ass igned to SPCD 110 (a bridge course designed to ensure success in SPCD 111G), or allowed to enroll directly into SPCD 111G. International students excused from SPCD 110 will be required to take ENGL 111G, including students whose native language is English . The student may then be required to complete one or more regular English classes as required for a particular degree. Completion of basic English courses at other U.S. institutions does not automatically satisfy this requirement. Conditional CELP Admiss ion and English Requirements NMSU, via CELP, conducts an Intensive English Language Program (IELP) for undergraduate and graduate students prior to pursuing their degree programs at NMSU. Internat ional students in this program are admitted to the university for the sole purpose of studying English, with a guarantee of full admission to the university upon completion of the CELP program (subject to all other admission requirements). Undergraduate students who are conditionally admitted and complete the sequence of IELP courses will be admitted directly into SPCD 111G. Visit http:// celp.nmsu.edu/ for full details Admission Restrictions Although NMSU does not set a quota for the total number of international students, there may be several factors that would prohibit admission even though the student meets all general requirements. 1. The dean of a chosen college and the department head of a chosen major or the President of a Community College campus may refuse to grant admission. 2. There may be a disproportionate number of international students or a disproportionate number of a particular nationality in one department or college. 3. Academic advisors, especially in the Gr aduate School, may not be available. 4. International students may be nondegree if admitted as exchange students, or as part of a special program, or as holders of visas that allow incidental studies related to their current non -immigrant status. 5. Non- native speakers of English are not normally admitted, or allowed to begin studies, in the summer sessions. There are some exceptions such as students admitted to NMSU's Center for English Language Programs. 6. University Community College campuses reserve th e right to refuse admission to international students if the appropriate immigration and English -language support services are not available. 7. Preference for admission to the Community College campuses is shown to students who graduate from high school in the United States. 8. University Community College campuses reserve the right to set limits on the number of international students admitted to their respective campuses based on the percentage of international students within an academic program. All application material, including the application for admission, letters of recommendation, transcripts or national examination scores and/or transcripts from colleges or universities (with an English translation), test scores including the TOEFL or IELTS, sh ould be sent to the Office of University Admissions by the following dates.

Cooperative Educa tion and Internship Program Today's competitive employment market necessitates that students gain practical experience related to their major before they finish their college degree. This experience is c alled Experiential Learning. NMSU enjoys a national reputation for its Cooperative Education (Co -op) Program, which contributes to students' total educational experience and realization of career goals by integrating academic theory and practical applicati on on the job. Co -op assignments provide varied work experiences with employers from business, industry, government, and nonprofit organizations. All Co-op work assignments are for continuing full -time students, and must be completed prior to graduation. E ach semester (spring, summer, & fall) that a student participates in an approved Co -op a notation is placed on his/her permanent academic transcript. Students may register full- time for the alternating plan , working one of more work phases throughout the U .S.; each work phase will last the duration of an academic semester. Work phases are separated by at least one semester of full - time on -campus classroom instruction. Note : While on an alternating work phase, students are afforded full -time academic status with the university, which protects enrollment status, financial aid and other student eligibilities, whether they are registered for any credit or not. Continuous academic enrollment can be maintained through the parallel plan, wherein a student works par t-time (approximately 20- 29 hours per week) concurrent with full time enrollment. Employers are generally located within commuting distance of the university. In addition to gaining academically related work experience, Co- op students establish positive work ethics, receive remuneration for their educationally related experiences, and also may arrange for course credit through an academic department. Experiential learning also includes internships. Internships vary in definition based on the employer and ca n be one -time or multiple semester work assignments that may or may not be curriculum -related, of a short duration and are paid or unpaid. Internships may qualify for the NMSU Cooperative Education program, if they meet the program requirements. Internship s may earn academic credit through the approval of an academic department. All students interested in Cooperative Education or Internships must first register with the Cooperative Education office located in Career Services, Garcia Annex. Registration incl udes an NMSU AggieCAREER Manager Account and an advising session. For more information contact the Cooperative Education program at (575) 646 -4115 or coop@nmsu.edu.

or more credits in a specific sub ject area, even though the courses are not designated as General Education courses, will have met the general education requirements for that subject area. For example, a student may complete ART 150, 155 and 156 (9 hours) and thereby satisfy one course fr om the Area V: Humanities and Fine Arts category, even though none of those courses carries a G suffix. Please check with the office of the college associate dean or with college advisors. NMSU VIEWING A WIDER WORLD COURSES The Viewing a Wider World requirement fosters intelligent inquiry, abstract logical thinking, critical analysis and the integration and synthesis of knowledge; it strives for literacy in writing, reading, speaking, and listening; it teaches math ematical structures, acquainting students with precise abstract thought about numbers and space; it encourages an understanding of science and scientific inquiry; it provides a historical consciousness, including an understanding of one's own heritage as w ell as respect for other peoples and cultures; it includes an examination of values and stresses the importance of a carefully considered values system; it fosters an appreciation of the arts; and general education provides the breadth necessary to have a familiarity with the various branches of human understanding. All VWW courses can be identified by the V suffix. Prior to graduating, NMSU students are required to take two courses from separate colleges from the Viewing a Wider World list in the Undergraduate Catalog. These courses are upper -division (300 -400 level) General Education courses and should be taken in a student's junior and/or senior year. One of the two courses must be in a college other than their own. The other course may be taken within th eir home college, but this course (1) must be in a different department from their major department; (2) must not be cross -listed with a course in their home department; (3) cannot be counted as one of the requirements for the student's major. These cours es strongly emphasize the international character and multicultural influences in the fields of study and strengthen information retrieval skills. One of the courses (3 credits) can be replaced by study abroad experience, consisting of at least four weeks of a Study Abroad program or university coursework in a foreign country earning 3 credits. NOTE: This list is under continuous revision. Please check with the office of the college associate dean or with college advisors for additional eligible courses. Honors courses have a specific college designation based on course content. These are listed near the end of this section.

Veterans, active -duty personnel, National Guard and Reservists who are current students or students applying for admission to New Mexico State Univer sity may be granted academic credit on a case -by- case basis upon evaluation of military transcripts - the Joint Service Transcript and the Community College of the Air Force transcripts. Course equivalencies and credit hours awarded for a particular NMSU d egree are determined by colleges and/or academic departments. Credit hours may be awarded for specific courses toward degree requirement, or as elective credit. The number of credit hours awarded will be determined by the college and/or academic department . NOTE: Students submitting military transcripts for credit evaluation must keep in mind the Maximum Time Frame policy. See FINANCIAL AID section (p .9). Veterans' Attendance and Satisfactory Progress The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs requires all veterans receiving VA education benefits to make satisfactory progress and systematic advancement toward an educational objective or be liable for over -payments. Satisfactory progress and regular class a ttendance are expected of such students. If a veteran receiving benefits is suspended for academic reasons, benefits are terminated and will be restored only after readmission to NMSU. If the university has liability claims filed against it as a result of a veteran failing to meet compliance requirements of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the university will not release any academic records on the veteran until such time as the veteran has reimbursed the federal government for funds drawn in violat ion of those requirements. A student receiving VA education benefits who is pursuing a degree program offered by New Mexico State University should adhere to the curriculum of that program. Failure to do so will result in the student being certified for le ss than full -time status or becoming liable for an overpayment. Military Withdrawal The following steps must be taken by all New Mexico State University students called up for active duty who wish to withdraw from all their clas ses: 1. Military and Veterans Programs. VA students ordered to Active Duty must provide a copy of orders to the MVP office, Garcia Annex, room 141.

Veterans enrolled in less than 5 credit hours are reimbursed for tuition and allowable fees only. There are several sessions within the summer term. For the 10 week summer session, full -time enrollment is 6 credit hours and half time enrollment is 3 credit hours. During the five week sessions , full- time enrollment is 4 graded credit hours. SPECIAL PROGRAMS Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) The Reserve Officer Training Corps is a commissioning program designed to attract , motivate, and train qualified students for military service as officers. The ROTC program is represented on the NMSU campus by the Department of Military Science (U.S. Army) and the Department of Aerospace Studies (U.S. Air Force). Curricula in the Depar tments of Military Science and Aerospace Studies are divided into basic and advanced courses of two years each. Enrollment in the basic course is voluntary and involves no obligation. Participation in the advanced courses is on a contractual basis and lead s to military service as a commissioned officer. Elective academic credit is granted by the university for ROTC classes. Students with prior military service or Junior ROTC experience may receive credit, although not academic credit, for all or portions of the basic courses. All qualified cadets enrolled in ROTC receive a stipend that varies dependent upon the year the cadet is in the program. Scholarships, which pay full college tuition as well as various laboratory, textbook, and incidental fees, are available on a competitive basis. GENERAL INFORMATION | 23 For more detailed information about the ROTC programs, see the College of Arts and Sciences departments of Aerospace Studies and Military Science in this catalog. Additional information may be obtained by contacting the depart ments directly at (575) 646 -4030 (Army) and (575) 646 -2136 (Air Force). RREEGGUULLAATTIIOONNSS These regulations apply to all campuses of NMSU and are effective with the publication of this catalog. Tuition amounts, fees, and similar items subject to annual review and change are all effective with the current catalog. University Credits The unit of university credit is the semester hour, which is the equivalent of one hour of recitation/lecture or a minimum of two hours o f practice per week for one semester. Class Rank (Classification) A student's classification depends upon the number of credits completed toward graduation. Sophomore rank is achieved with successful completion of 28 credits; junior rank, 62 credits; senior rank, 94 credits. Class Load The normal load in a regular semester is 16 -18 credits in all colleges of the university. An overload is more than 18 credits. A normal load during the summer term is the same number of credits as there are weeks in the session. Written permission for the student to register for an overload must be obtained from the dean of the student's college. To be eligible to take an overload, the student must have a cumulative grade -point average for the two preceding semesters of 2.5, with no grade less than C. A one -credit course in physical activity may be taken without being included in the calculation for determining an overload. No freshman will be permitted to assume an overloa d. Students may enroll for non - NMSU courses only upon approval of the dean of their college. Such courses must be counted as part of a student's class load. Basic Academic Skills NMSU requires all students to demonstrate basic academic skills in both English and mathematics to ensure that they have the abilities to succeed in upper -division courses numbered 300 or higher. First -time students must meet both of these requirements before enrolling in any upper -division courses. Transfer students with 45 or more credits will be allowed to enroll in upper -division courses for one semester. After that point, they must meet both of these requirements before enrolling in upper -division courses. The options for satisfying basic skills in English and mathematics are listed below. Completion of basic skills requirements will not necessarily satisfy university general education requirements in English and mathematics. Students should consult the \"General Education Courses and Requirements\" s ection in this chapter for these requirements. English Basic Skill Requirement Options _\u000130 ACT English Score - Students may satisfy basic skills requirements in English by scoring 30 or higher on ACT English exams. However, students must still earn credit for ENGL 111G by one of these options: _\u0001ENGL 111G or ENGL 111GH - Students may satisfy basic skills by passing ENGL 111G or ENGL 111GH with a grade of C or higher. _\u0001CLEP Credit - Students may earn credit for ENGL 111G or ENGL 111GH by taking the College Level Examination Program subject exam in freshman college composition with a score of 57 (top quartile) or higher. See \"Credit by College Level Placement Examination\" (p. 25) for details. _\u0001Advanced Placement Credit - Students may receive advanced placement credit for ENGL 111G or ENGL 111GH by scoring 3, 4, or 5 on the English Advanced Placement Exam. See \"Advanced Placement\" (p. 25) for details. _\u0001Transfer Credits - Students may receive credit for ENGL 111G by transferring 3 or more credits of college- level English composition, with a grade of C or above from accredited institutions. International stud ents may be required to satisfy the requirements under \"SPCD 111G\" below. _\u0001Transfer Credits - from Nonaccredited Institutions. Students may receive credit for ENGL 111G by transferring 3 or more credits of college -level English composition with a grade of C or higher from a nonaccredited institution, and by writing a theme which is judged adequate by the Department of English. _\u0001SPCD 111G - International students who took the TOEFL examination must complete SPCD 111G with a satisfactory grade. _\u0001Developmen tal Courses - Students who score 12 or below on the ACT English exam must pass two developmental English courses (CCDE 105N, CCDE 110N) before enrolling in ENGL 111G. Students who score 13 to 15 on the ACT English exam must pass one developmental English c ourse (CCDE 110N) before enrolling in ENGL 111G. Developmental courses are included on the transcript and will be included in the calculation of the GPA; however, credits in developmental courses will not count toward a degree. Mathematics Basic Skills Req uirement Options _\u000123 ACT Mathematics Score - Students may satisfy basic skills requirements in mathematics by scoring 23 or higher on ACT mathematics exams. However, students must still fulfill the general education math requirement. _\u0001\u0001Coursework - Students scoring below 23 on ACT mathematics exams may satisfy basic skills in mathematics by earning a grade of C or higher in one of the following courses or course combinations: (a) CCDM 112N and CCDM 113N; (b) CCDM 114N; (c) MATH 111 and MATH 112G; (d) any mathematics course numbered 120 or above. New students are placed in these courses according to their high school GPAs and their ACT scores in mathematics. However, new engineering students must take t he mathematics placement exam (MPE), and any new student may choose to take the MPE to test towards a higher placement. Placement does not earn academic credit, and placement in a mathematics course numbered 120 or higher does not satisfy the basic skills requirement. _\u0001Basic Skills Exam - Students may take the Basic Skills Exam, which is offered twice a semester by the Department of Mathematical Sciences. A passing score will meet the basic skills requirement, although it will not appear as credit on the student's transcript. _\u0001Advanced Placement Credit - Students may receive credit for courses which may satisfy basic skills in mathematics by taking the math Advanced Placement Exam. See \"Advanced Placement\" later in this chapter for details. _\u0001Development al Courses - Students who score below 23 on the ACT mathematics exam and whose score on the math placement exam, if taken, does not qualify them for placement into university -level mathematics courses will be placed into the appropriate development mathem atics course or courses (CCDM). Placement into CCDM course(s) is dependent upon the student's ACT score and high school GPA. Students must pass the CCDM course or courses before enrolling in university -level mathematics courses. Developmental courses are i ncluded on the transcript and will be included in the calculation of the GPA; however, credits in developmental courses will not count toward a degree. Satisfactory Progress A full -time student is making satisfactory progress when the cumulative number of credits earned at NMSU, divided by the number of semesters attended at NMSU, equals at least 12. Part- time students must earn a proportional number of credits in the same time period for purposes of financial aid. In the case of new freshmen, this definition will not be applied until the beginning of the third semester of enrollment; however, for all other students, it will apply after one semester of enrollment. All students at the end of their second academic year must have a cumulative 2.0 GPA. University Grading System Grade reports are not automatically mailed to students. Students can access grades and credits by the web using my.nmsu.edu. It is the responsibility of the student to provid e updated grade addresses to the Office of the Registrar. At the request of the student, the instructor will provide information on progress in the course prior to the last day to drop a course. The NMSU system of grading is expressed in letters, which car ry grade points used in calculating the cumulative grade -point average: Letter Grade Grade points per unit of credit A+ 4.0 A 4.0 A- 3.7 B+ 3.3 B 3.0 B- 2.7 C+ 2.3 C 2.0 C- 2.0 D+, D, D - 1.0 24| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2014 -2015 UNDERGRADUATE C ATALOG F 0 W \u2014 Withdrawal 0 N \u2014 Grade not submitted 0 CR \u2014 Credit authorized, but not letter grade 0 IP \u2014 In progress 0 RR \u2014 Progress in undergraduate course 0 PR \u2014 Progress on graduate thesis 0 S* \u2014 Satisfactory work 0 U \u2014 Unsatisfactory work 0 I \u2014 Incomplete 0 AU \u2014 Audit 0 *An S grade is a grade satis factory to the professor and is normally equivalent to the letter grade of C or higher. In computing the overall grade -point average, the total credits in which grades of A, B, C, D, or F have been assigned is divided into the total number of grade points earned. A course for which only CR, but no letter grade, is given and a course in which an S or PR grade is earned will be included in earned hours but is not computed in the grade -point average. Prerequisite A prerequisite is an enfo rceable entry requirement for a particular course. Students must have successfully completed the prerequisite before enrolling in the subsequent course. Repeating Courses A student may repeat a course in which a D or F grade has been earned at this university. A computable grade (excluding I, W, RR, AU, CR, S , or U ) in a repeated course may be substituted in the calculation of the grade -point average, though the original grade also remains on the transcript. The first occurrence with a C or better grade will count in earned hours. Future attempts will not count in earned hours. If a student repeats a course eligible for grade substitution in which they have earned a D and then fails the course, the second grade of F will not be substituted for the original grade. Neither credits nor grade points may be earned by repeating a course for which a grade of C or higher has already been received. Incomplete Grade The grade of I (incomplete) is given for pas sable work that could not be completed due to circumstances beyond the student's control. The following regulations apply to removing or changing an I grade: 1. Instructors may assign I grades only if the student is unable to complete the course due to ci rcumstances beyond the student's control that develop after the last day to withdraw from the course. Examples of appropriate circumstances include documented illness, documented death or crisis in the student's immediate family, and similar circumstances. Job related circumstances are generally not appropriate grounds for assigning an I grade. In no case is an I grade to be used to avoid the assigning of D, F, U , or RR grades for marginal or failing work. 2. To assign an I grade, the instructor must co mplete the I Grade Information Form and have the form delivered to the course dean. The instructor will state in writing on the I Grade Information Form the steps necessary to complete the remaining coursework or the instructor may indicate that the student will be required to re -enroll in the course to receive credit (in which case the I grade will not be removed). The student will sign this document or the course dean will send a copy of the document to the student's official permanent address as recor ded in the Registrar's Office. 3. The student is entitled to have the I grade removed from their transcript only if they complete the remaining coursework as specified on the I Grade Information Form, in a manner satisfactory to the instructor. The work must be completed within 12 months after the I grade is assigned and prior to the student's graduation, or within a shorter period of time if specified by the instructor on the I Grade Information Form. If the student fails to complete the coursework, th e instructor may change the I grade to any appropriate grade (including D, F , or U ) provided that the instructor stated that this would occur on the I Grade Information Form. 4. I grades can be removed from the student's transcript by the instructor o nly during the 12- month period following assignment of the I grade or prior to the student's graduation, whichever comes first. To remove an I grade, the instructor must complete a Change of Grade Form and file the form with the Registrar. The instructor may assign whatever grade is appropriate for the entire course. This may include grades of D, F , or U . An I grade not changed by the assigning instructor within 12 months and prior to graduation shall remain an I grade thereafter. 5. A student may re- enroll and receive credit for any course for which an I grade was previously received, but retaking the course will not result in a removal of the I grade from the student's transcript. The effect of removing an I grade on a student's academic standing (scholastic warning, probation, or suspension) depends on the date the transaction is officially recorded on the student's academic record. If the transaction is recorded before the student begins another semester, the grade replacing the I is included in the grade -point average calculation that establishes the student's academic standing. If the transaction is recorded after the student begins another semester, the new grade's effect on academic standing is based upon its inclusion with grades for the sem ester in which the student is enrolled. RR Grade The RR grade applies only to designated skill development undergraduate courses approved by the University Curriculum Committee and indicates the student has made substantial progress towar d completing the requirements of the course. It carries neither penalty nor credit. The student must re -enroll and successfully complete the course in order to earn credit. The grade of RR may be received only once in any given course, and it remains on t he student's transcript. S/U Option Students with 28 credits at NMSU under traditional grading, with an overall average of 2.5 or better, may exercise the S/U option. The following limitations apply: 1. No more than 7 credits per semest er or 4 credits per summer session. 2. Not to exceed a total of 21 semester credits. These limitations do not apply to honors and courses officially designated S/U . Each course under this option must be requested during registration. Eligibility must be d etermined by the student's academic dean and certified by the student. The course must be taken outside the major. If the student changes majors, the new major department may require a traditional grade for a course previously passed with an S grade. The traditional grade change is made by the instructor or by a course challenge if the original instructor is no longer with the university. Eligibility for S/U grading must be re -established after adjusted credit has been approved. Nondegree students who do not meet the above requirements may take courses under the S/U option. However, these courses may not be applied toward an undergraduate degree at NMSU. Graduate students in regular standing may take courses for the S/U option, outside the major departme nt, under regulations stated in the Graduate Catalog. Each academic college of the university may designate courses in which the grading will be on a basis of S or U for all students enrolled in the courses. Credits in such courses are not included in th e 21-credit limitation or the 7 -credit - per-semester limit. Grade Point Average A student's NMSU semester and cumulative GPAs will be based solely on courses taken at NMSU or under an approved National Student Exchange. Independe nt Studies Independent study courses (including directed reading and special topics courses which do not carry a subtitle) are for students capable of self -direction who meet the requirements for the S/U option, i.e., if the st udents are not eligible for the S/U option, they are not eligible for independent study. Each college determines the maximum number of credits that may be earned in independent study courses. Adjusted Credit Option The adjusted credit option allows students who obtain a low grade -point average (less than 2.0 cumulative) during their first few semesters to get a fresh start. This option may be used only once and is not reversible. All courses carrying a grade of S, CR, C, or better earned prior to the grading period in which the student requests the adjusted credit option (including transfer courses) are included as adjusted credit. All allowable credits are designated on the permanent academic record as \"adjusted credit\" and are omitted from the calculations of the cumulative grade -point average. A fee of $10 is required for the submission of an adjusted credit option application. Application forms are available in the offices of the academic deans. Students applying for this option must: GENERAL INFORMATION | 25 1. not hold a baccalaureate degree 2. be currently enrolled as a degree -seeking/nondegree undergraduate student 3. have a cumulative grade -point average of less than 2.0 at NMSU 4. have successfully accumulated fewer than 60 transfer plus NMSU credits 5. exercise the option only during the fall or spring semester before the last day to withdraw from the university 6. pass an additional 30 graded credits before they may be awarded an associate's degree. Other courses taken during the period of c redit adjustment are not calculated in the cumulative grade -point average. The repeat rule for courses starts anew for students who have taken the adjusted credit option. Credits covered by this option are shown on the transcript with an appropriate notati on, and all coursework attempted is shown. In no circumstances will a transcript of this record be issued that does not include all courses attempted at this university. Probationary status and eligibility for on -campus employment is not affected by the exercise of the adjusted credit option. Students are eligible for university honors if the criteria for university honors are met for all courses taken at NMSU after the period of adjusted credit. Transfer Credits For the policy on t ransfer credits see \"Transfer of Credits at NMSU. \" National Student Exchange (NSE) For the policy on transfer credit for courses taken in the Nation Student Exchange program see National Student Exchange program (p. 10) section of the catalog. Credit by College Level Examination Program (CLEP) Prior to or during a student's enrollment at NMSU, credits may be ear ned through the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) of the College Entrance Examination Board. CLEP is a national program of credit by examination that offers the opportunity to earn credits for college level achievement wherever or however the studen t learned. Earned CLEP credit will be treated as transfer credit without a grade, will count toward graduation, and may be used in fulfilling specific curriculum requirements. A current NMSU CLEP policy as well as test schedule information is available thr ough Testing Services DACC East Mesa, room 210. Testing Services may be reached at (575) 528 -7294. Advanced Placement Students who have completed college -level courses in secondary schools and have taken the Advanced Placement Ex aminations of the College Examination Board with resulting composite scores of 3, 4, or 5 may receive college level credit. The amount of credit and the equivalent university courses for which credit will be granted will be determined by the head of the de partment in which the course is offered. Such credit will be treated as transfer credit without a grade, will count toward graduation, and may be used in fulfilling specific curriculum requirements. Credit for Military Service Special provisions consistent with NMSU Senate and Faculty legislation 24 - 07/08 and the American Council on Education (ACE) - see section Military/Veterans and Family Members. Credit by Examination Any enrolled student with a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 currently attending classes may, with permission of the appropriate department, challenge by examination any undergraduate course in which credit has not been previously earned except an independent study, research or reading course, or any foreign language course that precedes the final course in the lower -division sequence. The manner of administering the examination and granting permission shall be determined by the department in which the course is being challenged. Students may not enroll in a single course, challenge it by examination, and drop it during the drop/add period, unless they enroll in an additional course. In exceptional cases in which a student demonstrates outstanding ability in a course in which he i s already registered, he may be permitted to challenge the course. A student desiring to apply for special examination may obtain the necessary forms from the Office of the Registrar. The fee for challenging a course is the same as the approved tuition rat e. Courses may not be challenged under the S/U option. The special examination privilege is based on the principle that the student, exclusively, has the responsibility for preparing for a special examination. Audits A regularly enrolled st udent may register for any course prior to the last day of registration as an auditor without credit with the consent of instructor, provided the facilities are not required for regular students. The tuition and fees are the same as for credit courses. Aud it courses are not considered in determining the maximum load except for students on probation and graduate students. A student may not change from credit to audit after the last day to register but may withdraw and continue to attend with the permission o f the instructor. Changes in Registration Registration changes may be processed only in accordance with university regulations and with appropriate signatures. It is the responsibility of the student to initiate official withdrawal from a course. Forms are available from the academic advisor or in the deans' offices. Courses may not be added or dropped after the cutoff date indicated in the university calendar. For refund policy, see the \"Costs\" section of the catalog. When a student officially drops a course, the W grade is assigned as follows: 1. No grade is assigned during the registration period. 2. A W grade is assigned to any student who officially drops a course during the first half of its duration. A student may not officially withdraw from a course after this time. 3. A grade of W is assigned in all courses to any student officially withdrawing from the university prior to the last three weeks of classes. A student found insufficiently prepared to carry a regular c ourse may be transferred to a more elementary course in the same field any day before the last day to officially withdraw from an individual course. Any person attending under Veterans Educational Assistance must notify the Office of Veterans' Programs if dropping or adding courses changes enrollment status for benefits. Withdrawal from NMSU Withdrawal from any NMSU campus is an official procedure that must be approved as indicated on the withdrawal form. All such withdrawals wi ll be registered on the student's transcript. It is the student's responsibility to initiate withdrawal from the university and to obtain necessary signatures. Students who leave without following the official procedure are graded appropriately by the instructor. On the Las Cruces campus, withdrawal begins at the Registrar's Office. At all other campuses, withdrawal begins at the Student Services Office. Applicable dates are published in the university calendar for all regular sessions. Medical Withdrawal A medical withdrawal applies to a student who becomes seriously ill, injured, or hospitalized and is therefore unable to complete an academic term for which they are enrolled. Based on the physician's information, a determination will be made if the student is eligible for consideration of tuition or other refunds. At the Las Cruces campus, medical withdrawal begins at the Registrar's Office. At all other campuses, medical withdrawal begins at the Student Services Office. Attendance and Student Performance Students are expected to attend regularly all classes for which they are registered. Students making satisfactory progress in their classes will be excused from classes when they are representing NMSU on a university sponsored event (e.g. ASNMSU president representing NMSU at legislative session, student athletes competing in NMSU scheduled athletic events, or students attending educational field trips and conferences). Authorized absences do not relieve the student of their class responsibilities. Prior written notice of the authorized absence will be provided to the instructor by the sponsoring department. Specific class attendance requirements are determined by the instructor of the course. When the number of absences hinders a student's progress in a course, the instructor may initiate a statement of the student's excessive absences including a recommendation of retention or expulsion from the class. Based on the recommendation of the in structor and with the concurrence of the course department head and the student's academic dean, a student will be dropped for persistent absences or for persistent failure to complete assignments. Similarly, a student may also be dropped from a class for engaging in behavior that interferes with the educational environment of the class. Any student who has been dropped from a class shall have the right to appeal that decision through the Student Academic Grievance Policy. Only enrolled students, for credit or for audit, are permitted to attend classes. A student who has officially withdrawn from a course may continue to attend the course with the permission of the instructor for the remainder of the semester. Students not enrolled may visit classes only wit h the permission of the instructor. 26| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2014 -2015 UNDERGRADUATE C ATALOG Administrative Withdrawals When an administrative withdrawal from a course is initiated for a student who is representing the university at an official out -of-town event, the withdrawal will become effective upon the return of the student to the university from that event or five class days after the signed drop slip arrives in the dean's office, whichever is sooner. Nondegree Status See \"Nondegree Admission\" (p. 5) for more information. Military Withdrawal For special provisions consistent for military personnel, see the section on Military, Veterans and Family Members. Privacy Rights The following information has been designated as directory information and is subject to release to the public under the Buckley Amendment (PL 98 -380), \"The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974\": Student's name, address, email address, telephone listing, date and place of birth, major field of study, classification, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, and the most recent, previous educational agency or institution attended by the student. Other information regarding disclosure of student data is posted at the Office of the Registrar in compliance with the Act. Requests for withholding directory informat ion must be filed in writing with the Office of the Registrar. Social Security Numbers in Student Records As required by law, social security numbers are collected from prospective and current students who plan to seek employment on campus or, wish to receive financial aid. In addition, the university is mandated by federal tax regulations to provide tuition and fee payment information to the student and the Internal Revenue Service, so that applicable educ ational tax credits may be computed. The social security number will be necessary to submit this tax reporting. The social security number is a confidential record and is maintained as such by the university in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. OUTCOMES ASSESSMENT - Evaluating Your Academic Experience New Mexico State University is committed to providing its students with a quality education and a supportive learn ing environment. Assessment is a process of rigorous review followed by implementation of changes to enhance and improve the quality of education students receive at NMSU. For assessment to be effective, students must be actively aware of, and engaged in, assessment activities. Faculty and staff at NMSU will communicate to students the value and implications of assessment. For their part, students will provide feedback on personal, professional and academic development. Students are expected to participate in all types of assessment when asked to do so. Types of assessment activities include class assignments, course projects, exams, exit interviews, standardized tests, surveys, focus groups, etc. Data gathered through these assessments will be published only in aggregate form. Efforts will be made to inform students of assessment results and the program improvements implemented as a result of assessment. Academic Appeals Procedure for Initiating Grievance Complaints: This procedure has been established to provide a method to resolve undergraduate student grievances at the lowest administrative level in a fair and expeditious manner. For the purpose of this procedure, grievances are limited to alleged violations of university policy o r procedures by the university or its employees, disputes with faculty and/or alleged unfair treatment. Usually this method is used to appeal a grade the student feels was not justified. Under no condition should these policies be used when the student has allegedly violated the University Code of Conduct or a contractual agreement, and at no hearing should either party have a lawyer. Any student who believes that he/she has been unjustly treated within the academic process may proceed as far as necessary i n the steps detailed below. Should the alleged grievance not involve a faculty member or course, the student is to appeal directly to the department head or associate dean for academics in whose area or college the alleged grievance occurred. 1. Appeal to the faculty member: The student is to submit a written appeal to the faculty member within 30 days after the start of the semester following the semester in which the alleged grievance occurred. Semester in this case refers to fall and spring only. If the alleged grievance occurs during the summer session, the student is to submit an appeal no later than 30 days into the fall semester following the summer session in which the alleged grievance occurred. The faculty member and the student are to discuss the problem. The faculty member will submit a written report outlining his or her decision to the student and department head or appropriate unit designee within ten working days of receiving the student's written appeal. 2. Appeal to the department head or a ppropriate unit designee: If a decision satisfactory to the student cannot be reached, the student may submit a written appeal to the department head or appropriate unit designee in which the course in question is taught. This is to be done within ten day s of the receipt of the faculty member's written decision. The faculty member, the department head or appropriate unit designee, and the student are to meet to discuss the problem. The department head or appropriate unit designee will send a written respon se outlining his or her decision to the student and faculty member within ten days of this meeting. 3. Appeals to the associate dean for academics or associate dean of the library: If a satisfactory decision cannot be reached among the department head or appropriate unit designee, the faculty member, and the student, the student or the faculty member may submit a written state of appeal to the associate dean for academics of the college in which the course was taught. This is to be done within ten working days after the receipt of the written decision by the department head. The associate dean may request a written recommendation from an Academic Appeals Board. Should this be the case, the Academic Appeals Board will conduct a hearing with the student and f aculty member (not necessarily at the same time) to review the merits of the appeal. They may also ask for supporting evidence for or against the appeal. The Academic Appeals Board will submit the written recommendation to the associate dean within five wo rking days following the conclusion of their process. The associate dean may meet with the student, faculty member, and department head to discuss the appeal (not necessarily at the same time). The associate dean will submit a written response outlining hi s or her decision to the student, faculty member, department head, and dean within ten days of the last meeting. 4. Appeals to the dean: The dean of the college or library in which the course is taught or in whose college the alleged grievance occurred ma y, at his or her discretion, review the appeal upon the written request of the student or faculty member and render a final decision. An appeal to the dean is the last step in the appeals process and the dean's decision cannot be appealed further. Should t he dean not choose to review the appeal, the decision of the associate dean for academics or associate dean of the library is final. 5. Exceptions to the time involved: The associate dean for academics or associate dean of the library may waive the normal time frame for appeals for compelling reasons. Regardless of circumstances, academic appeals must be initiated with the course instructor within two years of the conclusion of the semester or summer session in which the course was taken. 6. Enrollment: A student need not be enrolled at the university to initiate an appeal. Academic Appeals Board Within each college of the university or the library, an academic appeals board will be appointed by the associate dean for academi cs to hear student appeals. The appeals board will consist of three faculty members and two students. Maintenance of Records Instructors and/or departments shall keep records used to compute individual grades for two years af ter the completion of a course. If a grade has been appealed, these records shall be kept for at least two years after completion of the appeal. Departments, colleges, or library may require that records be kept for longer periods. Academic Misconduct Students at NMSU are expected to observe and maintain the highest academic, ethical, and professional standards of conduct. Any student found guilty of academic misconduct shall be subject to disciplinary action. Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to, the following actions: 1. Cheating or knowingly assisting another student in committing an act of cheating or other forms of academic dishonesty 2. Plagiarism, which includes, but is not necessarily limited to, submitting examinations, themes, reports, drawings, laboratory notes, undocumented quotations, computer -processed materials, or other material as one's own work when such work has been prepared by another person or copied from another person 3. Unauthorized possessio n of examinations, reserve library materials, or laboratory materials 4. Unauthorized changing of grades on an examination, in an instructor's grade book, or on a grade report or unauthorized access to academic computer records 5. Nondisclosure or misrepre sentation in filling out applications or other university records in, or for, academic departments or colleges. GENERAL INFORMATION | 27 ACADEMIC STANDING Please see section on incomplete, I , grades to determine the effect of removal of I grades on acad emic standing. Academic Warning, Probation and Suspension: When students do not maintain adequate academic standing, they begin a progress of Academic Warning to Academic Probation I and II, and finally to Academic Suspension. Each stage imposes more stru cture and limitations on the student in order to help them return to normal academic standing. The intent is not to punish, but to help the student return to normal academic standing and success. Since some of these limitations involve limitations on the n umber of credit hours, students on Probation or Suspension may be subject to loss of financial aid. It is the responsibility of the student to determine the impact of their changed academic standing on their financial aid. Notification to students of academic warning, probation, or suspension appears on the student's grade report at the end of each grading period. Academic Warning: Issued only once, the first time a student's cumulative GPA falls below a 2.0 while in good academic standing. The relevant as sociate dean for academics or campus academic officer will send the student a letter detailing the consequences should the cumulative grade point remain below a 2.0 at the conclusion of the semester. A student on Academic Warning remains eligible for all e xtracurricular activities as governed by the rules of the specific activity. While under Academic Warning the following restrictions apply: 1. The student may be required to enroll in a 3 -hour special study skills/time management course specifically design ed for students on Academic Warning, or an equivalent course approved by the appropriate associate dean or CAO of their campus. 2. Students will be required to enter into a contract with their advisor, approved by their department head that places further stipulations on Academic Warning. The contract may include, but is not limited to the following: _\u0001The student may be required to take at least one repeat course to try to improve their GPA. _\u0001Except for the special study skills/time management course, the student's coursework may be restricted to their major. _\u0001The student may be required to get tutoring help. _\u0001The student may be required to see an academic counselor on a specified time schedule. _\u0001The number of hours a student may register for may be res tricted (due to extenuating circumstances such as the student's workload commitments). The associate dean or CAO may place the student on Academic Probation I should the student not adhere to the stipulations of the contract. If the student's semester GPA is less than a 2.0, and the cumulative GPA remains below a 2.0 at the end of the semester on Academic Warning, the student is placed on Academic Probation I. If the semester GPA is greater than 2.0 but the cumulative GPA is still less than 2.0, the student will remain on Academic Warning. If the cumulative GPA is greater than a 2.0 at the end of the semester then the student is returned to good academic standing. Summer Courses A student may use summer classes to try to get warning or probationary status removed. Under no circumstances may a student on Academic Warning or Academic Probation be allowed to register for an overload. Academic warning status is continued if the student withdraws from the university. Probation or suspension status applies to all subsequent enrollments. Academic Probation There are two stages in Academic Probation. Academic Probation I: This occurs when a student under Academic Warning has a semester GPA less than 2.0, and the cumu lative GPA remains below 2.0 at the conclusion of the semester or if the student maintains a semester GPA greater than 2.0 while on Academic Probation I but the cumulative GPA is still less than 2.0. Under Academic Probation I the following conditions appl y: 1. The student cannot enroll in more than 13 hours of coursework during the semester. Note: Students falling below 12 credits in any one semester will jeopardize their financial aid. Should this occur, students should see the associate dean in their co llege as soon as possible to try to implement corrective measures. 2. The student will enter into a contract or individualized education plan with their advisor and approved by the associate dean or CAO that place further stipulations on Academic Probation I. The associate dean or CAO may place the student on Academic Probation II or Academic Suspension should the student not adhere to the stipulations of the contract. 3. Students on Academic Probation receiving educational benefits from the Veterans' Admi nistration must obtain counseling from the Office of Veterans' Programs. The student must maintain a semester GPA equal to or greater than 2.0 until such time that the cumulative GPA is greater than 2.0 at which time the student goes back to good academic standing. Until the latter happens the student remains on Academic Probation I. The student will be placed on Academic Probation II if unable to maintain a 2.0 semester GPA, and the cumulative remains below a 2.0 GPA, while under Academic Probation I. A student on Academic Probation I remains eligible for all extracurricular activities as governed by the rules of the specific activity. Academic Probation II: Issued when a student falls below a semester 2.0 GPA, and the cumulative remains below a 2.0 GPA, while on Academic Probation I, or, if the student maintains a semester GPA greater than 2.0 while on Academic Probation II but the cumulative GPA is still less than 2.0. 1. The student cannot enroll in more than 7 hours of coursework during the semester. 2. As with rule 2 under Academic Warning and Academic Probation I and at the discretion of the associate dean or CAO, the student will be required to enter into a contract with their advisor, approved by the associate dean or CAO, to place further stipulati ons on Academic Probation II. The associate dean or CAO may place the student on Academic Suspension should the student not adhere to the stipulations of the contract. The student must maintain a semester 2.0 GPA or higher until the cumulative GPA reaches a 2.0 or higher at which time they are placed on good academic standing. A student unable to maintain a semester GPA of 2.0 or higher, and the cumulative remains below 2.0 GPA, while under Probation II will be placed on Suspension. A student on Academic P robation II remains eligible for all extracurricular activities as governed by the rules of the specific activity. Transfer students Students admitted under special provisions whose transcripts indicate less than a 2.0 GPA are adm itted on Academic Probation I. Continuing in probationary status Students may continue to enroll while on Academic Probation I or II provided they maintain a semester GPA of 2.0 or higher. They are continued on that same level of Academic Probation if they withdraw from the university while on Academic Probation. Removal of Academic Probation Such academic standing is removed when the cumulative GPA is raised to 2.0 or higher, w ith the following exceptions: (1) a transfer student may not remove probation by summer work alone; (2) if an I grade is removed after the student has enrolled, the new grade's effect on academic standing is based on its inclusion with grades for the term for which the student is enrolled; (3) exercise of the Adjusted Credit Option does not change academic status until subsequent grades are earned. Academic Suspension When a student does not achieve a semester 2.0 GPA or higher, and the cumulative remains below a 2.0 while under Academic Probation II, they are placed on Academic Suspension. Students under Academic Suspension are not allowed to take NMSU courses while under suspension. Students on Academic Suspension must sit out a minimum of 1 semester and then petition the Provost or designee to be removed from Academic Suspension. At this time the suspension status will be evaluated for possible removal. Should the suspension be lifted, the student is placed on Academic Probatio n II until such time as the cumulative GPA equals or exceeds a 2.0. At the discretion of the Provost or designee, the student will enter into a contract approved by the Provost or designee and the student's Dean or CAO, setting stipulations to have the sus pension removed. Failure to adhere to the contract will return the student to Academic Suspension. Under certain conditions, a student may be re -admitted at NMSU under regular status while under Academic Suspension when satisfactory progress has been demon strated at another college or university (see Readmission (Degree Seeking) (p. 4)). Credits earned at another university or college while under Academic Suspension from NMSU or another university or college will be accepted at NMSU only after the student demonstrates satisfactory progress over a period of two semesters after being re -admitted or admitted to NMSU. Acceptance of transfer credits that count toward degree requirements is still governed by the rul es established by the student's respective college or campus. Effect of summer attendance Students suspended at the close of the spring semester may have their Academic Suspension rescinded if they attend summer session at NMSU or one of its Community College colleges. Such attendance must raise the combined spring semester and summer GPA to 2.0 or better. 28| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2014 -2015 UNDERGRADUATE C ATALOG A certification of eligibility to attend summer session at NMSU after a spring semester Academic Suspension is available to the suspended student who wishes to attend summer sessions at other institutions. Disciplinary Probation and Suspension NMSU expects all students to regard themselves as responsible citizens on campus an d in the community. Repeated misconduct and major violations will cause the student to be subject to immediate suspension or expulsion from the university. The general rules and regulations applicable to students are in the \"Student Code of Conduct\" of the Student Handbook or can be obtained from the Scheduling and Information Desk in Corbett Center. Undergraduate Enrollment in Graduate Courses Undergraduates who wish to enroll in a graduate -level course numbered 500 or higher for undergraduate credit must secure prior written permission from the instructor and course dean. Enrollment is by petition only and is limited to outstanding juniors and seniors. Graduate Study by University Seniors A student who is in the final semester of a bachelor's degree program and who is completing all requirements for graduation may take up to 6 credits of graduate- level courses numbered from 450 through 598 for credit toward an advanced degree. The student must also: 1. File an Application for Admission to Graduate Student Services and be admitted by a department into a graduate program 2. Have a grade -point average of 3.0 or better over the most recent semesters in which the las t 45 semester hours were completed 3. File a petition for each course by the deadline to add courses for the semester in which the course was taken 4. Obtain approval by the instructor, department head, and undergraduate dean The combined total of graduat e and undergraduate courses for the semester may not exceed 17 credits. Students should consult an admission representative at the Graduate Student Services. If the student is not admitted into a graduate program, the course(s) will remain separate from th e undergraduate record. If the student is admitted into a graduate program, the course(s) will become part of the graduate record and will not be used in the calculation of the student's undergraduate grade -point average or credit hours. Program/Degree Req uirements NMSU offers a number of degrees and certificates. Those awards and requirements are given in the college sections. For graduation with a bachelor's degree, a student must meet all of the criteria for the major elected. The requirements listed are the minimum for the degree; students are encouraged to undertake more extensive and broadening courses of study. Student Responsibility The ultimate responsibility for planning an academic program in compliance with university, college, and departmental requirements rests with the student. In addition, the student bears ultimate responsibility for understanding all matters of the Undergraduate Catalog.

Any instruc tor may remand a student to the English remedial laboratory for further training in written English. In each case, the student must complete the remedial laboratory work prior to submitting the application to graduate. _\u0001Each student must complete at NMSU at least 30 of the last 36 credits necessary for the baccalaureate degree. Of these 36 credits, 21 credits must be upper division and at least 12 of these upper division credits must be in the major. Colleges or Departments may require that more than 12 of the upper division credits be from the major, and they may direct that certain of these credits be course specific. _\u0001Curricular requirements for a specific degree may be met by completing all of the course requirements for that degree as set forth in the catalog of matriculation provided that the selected catalog is not more than six years old when the requirements for graduation are met. This rule applies only to the course requirements and number of credits as specified for the degree. In all other cases, the current catalog is effective. The catalog is effective Summer Session I through Spring Semester. Special provisions consistent with the NMSU Servicemembers Opportunity College (SOC) and other agreements apply for active military and veterans - see section Military/Veterans and Family Members. Upon completion of all requirements, multiple majors for a single degree (e.g., B.A.) will be noted on the academic record. Multiple bachelor's degrees (e.g., B.A. and B.S.) may be granted if all requirements for the degrees have been completed. Multiple degrees may be granted at one commencement if all requirements have been met. Graduation fees must be paid for each degree. Both designated and undesignated associate degree residency requirements vary with the co llege awarding the degree. Requirements for the two-year associate degrees and for the certificates are found in the section(s) concerning these degrees. _\u0001Arts and Sciences, Business Administration, Education, and Health and Social Services require that t he last 15 credits be completed at NMSU or one of its Community College campuses. _\u0001College Of Agricultural, Consumer And Environmental Sciences requires that the last 30 credits be completed at NMSU or one of its Community College campuses.

This option is designed to meet the requirements for entry into most medical or dental schools as well as schools associated with other health professions such as physical therapy, pharmacy, and physician assistant. Most professional schools require chemistry (16 credits), biology (8 -16 credits), calculus (3 credits) and physics (8 credits). These requirements have been incorporated into this option. In addition to the requirements needed for the delineated health professions, this option will also provide an extensive background in nutrition, which is integral to these professions. Because there is a growing interest in having multi skilled professionals, you may want to also complete the addi tional course work outlined at the bottom of this program of study so that you will have met the academic requirements for becoming a registered dietitian. You must have a GPA of 2.5 or higher before enrolling in FCSC 400, Research Methods in FCSC; FCSE 348, Teaching in Informal Family and Consumer Sciences Settings; or HNDS 401/HNDS 407, Field Experience. Selection to professional schools is typically based on four separate but interrelated criteria: (1) evaluation of academic transcripts, (2) evaluation o f scores on admissions tests, (3) letters of recommendation, and (4) personal interviews. The Health Professions Advisory Committee works with all prospective applicants to professional school to provide advice and information on the admissions process and to ensure that all prehealth students have the best possible opportunity of gaining admission to the school of their choice. You are expected to register with the committee no later than the first semester of your sophomore year. Check with an advisor for information.

New Mexico State University offers an interdisciplinary, undergraduate program in Conservation Ecology. The goal of this program is to t rain biologists for the current and future challenges that we face in the conservation and wise use of 50| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2014 -2015 UNDERGRADUATE C ATALOG our Earth's natural resources. An overriding principle of the program is to provide a solid foundation in basic science coupled with a practical approach towards sustainability and stewardship. The curriculum encompasses several disciplines and includes a wide variety of courses from Biology, Fish, Wildlife and Conservation Ecology, Geography, Government, and Range Science. The education experience will pr ovide students with an overview of global biodiversity and an understanding of the ecological and evolutionary processes that have created and sustained it. Courses in population and community ecology coupled with population viability analysis and risk ass essment will give students the necessary background to understand the theory and development of these fields as well as the tools to tackle real -world problems. Courses in basic genetics, evolution, and conservation genetics will expose students to the imp ortance of conserving genetic variation in order to maintain adaptive potential within populations, thereby sustaining the evolutionary process. Students will also receive background on wildlife law and environmental policy, information vital for assisting governing bodies in making decisions regarding the protection and wise use of our natural resources. Skills obtained in the application of geographic information systems, molecular genetics, and professional communication can also be acquired through vari ous electives. In sum, we seek to provide undergraduate students with an education that will allow them the opportunity to contribute to the conservation of all life on Earth. The requirements are listed below. In addition each required course must be passed with a grade of C or better.

Shuster, St. Zhang; Assistant Professors: M. Shuster Have you ever wondered why your hair or eye color, facial features, or the build of your body resembles that of your parents, grandparents, or other close relatives? What factors are responsible for generating all the variety of colors and shapes of flowers, trees, and different ty pes of animals? If these questions have crossed your mind, then you have been thinking about Genetics; the science of heredity. Genetics is studied at the DNA/gene/genome level (molecular genetics, biotechnology, genomics and bioinformatics), the level of organisms (classical or Mendelian genetics), and within/among populations of individuals (population and quantitative genetics). One of the most significant scientific accomplishments in history has been the use of genomic technologies to recently identify most human genes, as well as, most genes for a number of other animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria. Geneticists now have tremendous opportunities to use molecular, biochemical, mathematical, and computer science -based (bioinformatics) approaches to investigate how these genes determine observable traits. This information can be used to significantly advance human health and well being, and to meet the food and fiber needs of the world. A degree in Genetics can provide excellent preparation for careers in academic research and technical support, teaching, agriculture, the biotechnology industry, medicine and health sciences, forensic science, technical writing, and sales or marketing. It is also an excellent background for students wishing to enter a gradua te program, medical school, and veterinary school. Undergraduates in the Genetics program must earn a grade of C or better to receive credit for required Basic Science Background and Genetics Core courses. Within the Genetics Core curriculum, Tier I course s must be taken by all majors, for a total of 28 credit hours. To accommodate differing interests among students, a series of Tier II courses comprising 11 to 13 credits are provided. Ethical considerations of genetic based technologies will be infused thr oughout the curriculum, with a focused course on \"Science and Ethics\" in the Tier III portion of the core curriculum.

Distance Education Courses The College of Arts and Sciences offers a variety of distance education courses each semester. Specific courses can be found under departmental course listings in the Schedule of Classes. Students who successfully complete NMSU distance education courses receive the same credit as students who take an equivalent course on the Las Cruces cam pus. Distance education courses appear on a student's transcript in the same way a course taken on the Las Cruces campus does. Majors, Minors and Supplementary Majors Students who wish to obtain a bachelor's degree must select a major field or fields. For a listing of major fields, the student should see the first page of this chapter. Course requirements for majors are listed under individual departments. Students should consult the department for current admissions requirements. Until a major is selected, the student is designated as unclassified. Each major consists of not less than 20 credits of upper -division courses (300 and above) in a specific field. Students must earn a grade of C - or better for all course requirements for a major, minor, or supplem entary major, including any courses required from outside the department. Students may not count an S grade towards completion of any major, minor or supplementary major requirement unless a course is automatically S/U for all enrolled students. A student may not earn a minor that bears the same name as a bachelor's degree that the student also earns. (For example, a student earning a B.S. in Biology cannot also earn a minor in Biology.) Some departments also require specific courses outside the major field . Please refer to the departmental section of the catalog for specific nondepartmental requirements. These nondepartmental requirements must be passed with a grade of C - or better. It is imperative that students consult the departmental sections of this ca talog and the department or departments for advice in planning to fulfill requirements for declared majors. The requirements for academic minors in the College of Arts and Sciences are found under each offering department or program's section of this catal og. Requirements for supplementary majors are found as follows: the Supplementary Majors in Chicano Studies, Latin American Studies, and Linguistics are listed under Languages and Linguistics; the Supplementary Major in Law and Society is listed under Gove rnment; and the Supplementary Major in Applied Mathematics is listed under Mathematical Sciences. Most students have considerable latitude in choosing elective courses. These are the courses beyond university and major requirements that a student must take to bring her or his total credits to a minimum of 128. This latitude provides students with opportunities to major in more than one field or to devise interdisciplinary programs tailored to individual interests or future career needs. Regardless of the op tion elected, students should consult regularly with an advisor and keep track of their progress towards graduation using the online degree audit system STAR (Student Academic Requirements), at http://www.my.nmsu.edu.

Cline, department head Affiliated Faculty : Vacant (575) 646 -2136 http://www.nmsu.edu/~afrotc/ Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) is a nationwide program that allows students to pursue commissions (become officers) in the United States Air Force (USAF) while simultaneously a ttending college. AFROTC classes are held on college campuses throughout the United States and Puerto Rico; students can register through normal course registration processes. AFROTC consists of four years of Aerospace Studies classes (Foundations of the U SAF, Evolution of USAF and Space Power, Air Force Leadership Studies, and National Security Affairs/Preparation for Active Duty), and a corresponding Leadership Laboratory for each year (where students apply leadership, demonstrate command and effective communication, develop physical fitness, and practice military customs and courtesies). College students enrolled in the AFROTC program (known as \"cadets\") who successfully complete both AFROTC training and college degree requirements will graduate and simul taneously commission as Second Lieutenants in the Active Duty Air Force. The AFROTC program is currently offered at New Mexico State University (NMSU), but they have a crosstown agreement that allows our students to enroll in AFROTC and become full -fledged cadet participants. Freshman and Sophomore Years (General Military Course or GMC) This group (AERO 121/122, AERO 221/222) provides a general background knowledge of the military establishment with emphasis on the Air Force. GMC courses may be taken out of sequence. Junior and Senior Years (Professional Officer Course or POC) This group (AERO 301, AERO 302, AERO 401, AERO 402) constitutes an in - depth study of topics that provides a broad preparation for a career as an Air Force officer. Students must have c ertain qualifications for entry and have a desire to be commissioned in the Air Force. These qualifications include, achieving a passing score on the Air Force Officer's Qualifying Test, passing a physical fitness test, and successfully completing a medical exam. They must also complete a four - or five - week summer orientation course. Students may, with departmental approval, take POC courses out of normal sequence. However, compressed or dual enrollment in upper -division POC courses is normally prohibited. Through this department, you can also earn a minor in Aerospace Studies.

Anderson, Boecklen, Desmond, Houde, Milligan, Nishiguchi, Preszler, Throop, Wright; New Mexico State University offers an interdisciplinary, undergraduate program in Conservation Ecology. The goal of this program is to train biologists for the current and future challenges that we face in the conservation and wise use of our Eart h's natural resources. An overriding principle of the program is to provide a solid foundation in basic science coupled with a practical approach towards sustainability and stewardship. The curriculum encompasses several disciplines and includes a wide var iety of courses from Biology, Fishery and Wildlife Science, Geography, Government, and Range Science. The curriculum will provide students with an overview of global biodiversity and an understanding of the ecological and evolutionary processes that have created and sustained it. Courses in population and community ecology coupled with population viability analysis and risk assessment will give students the necessary background to understand the theory and development of these fields as well as the tools to tackle real -world problems. Courses in basic genetics, evolution, and conservation genetics will expose students to the importance of conserving genetic variation in order to maintain adaptive potential within populations, thereby sustaining the evolution ary process. Students will also receive background on wildlife law and environmental policy, information vital for assisting governing bodies in making decisions regarding the protection and wise use of our natural resources. Skills obtained in the applica tion of geographic information systems, molecular genetics, and professional communication can also be acquired through various electives. In sum, we seek to provide undergraduate students with an education that will allow them the opportunity to contribut e to the conservation of all life on Earth. The requirements are listed below.

Full details of the program can be found at http://www.cs.nmsu.edu. Admission occurs in two steps. First, students will apply to the Computer Science department to receive approval for the BS+MS program. The stude nt submits the pre -application when he/she is within 48 credits of earning a BS in Computer Science; an application form is provided on the department website. Qualification for the BS+MS program will be based on the cumulative (non -grade replaced) grade p oint average in Computer Science and Math courses taken up to that point (at least 3.5), including at least two of the following: C S 370, C S 371 and C S 372, and recommendations by faculty members listed on the departmental application. Additional factor s might be taken into account when available (e.g., TOEFL/IELTS scores, GRE scores). Students having a grade point average below 3.5 may be admitted to the combined program on a case -by-case basis, depending on faculty recommendations and evaluations of th e individual academic and professional history. Once the Computer Science department has notified the applicant of acceptance in the combined BS+MS program, the applicant must then formally apply to the graduate school. (prospective.nmsu.edu/graduate) for formal admission to the graduate program; this application to the graduate school is made during the semester of graduation from the BS in Computer Science. The curriculum for the first three years of the BS+MS program coincides with the requirements of th e BS program. In particular; the general requirements include a grade of at least a C - in each course to satisfy the departmental and non - departmental requirements. No course may be counted as satisfying both a departmental and non -departmental requirement . No course taken to satisfy either a departmental or non -departmental requirement may be taken S/U.

The BAS degree helps minimize credit loss for associate degree graduates when pursuing a baccalaureate degree at NMSU. The student population targeted for this program differs significantly from traditional degree programs at NMS U. The BAS offers opportunity for current and prospective students, and welcomes those employed full- time, completing their upper division coursework at a distance, veterans, active duty military personnel or active duty family, transfers from other institutions, or returning to college after time away.

The program attracts motivated and self -directed students feeling constrained by the specialized nature of traditional degree programs and wanting to design a personalized plan of study. Other students, particularly those returning to the university after years away, or those with full- time jobs, choose the BIS degree because they have specific personal or job -related academic needs that can be met most efficiently through the BIS. Universities across the nation are discovering traditional degree programs sometimes do not address society's interdisciplinary educational needs. NMSU has responded by creating a more flexible program in the form of the individualized studies degree. The program allows students to pursue their educational goals in areas not available within an exis ting departmental curriculum or traditional majors. The BIS offers new opportunities for current and prospective students, and welcomes those who are employed full- time, completing their upper division coursework at a distance, veterans, active duty milita ry personnel or active duty family, transferring from other institutions, returning to college after time away, completing their baccalaureate degree for the purpose of attending graduate school.

A philosophy major is appropriate for students planning to attend medical school as well as for those students interested in a career that requires critical reading and argument analysis. Such careers include business, theology and above all, law. While the course requirements for the major should meet the ends of the liberal arts student, those students interested in graduat e study in philosophy or in a career in law are encouraged to seek advice from a faculty advisor as early in their career as possible. A minor program in philosophy requiring 18 hours of course work is also offered as well as a minor in Ethics.

(575) 646 -2005 http://honors.nmsu.edu/ Mission of the Honors College The mission of the New Mexico State University Honors College is to serve the citizens and state of New Mexico by providing an enriching environment for diverse, academically talented, and motivated students. The Honors College also seeks to create a community of sch olars and mentors that fosters personal growth, critical thinking, leadership, independence, curiosity, and social responsibility. The college aspires to cultivate student potential to broadly understand and positively impact communities, organizations, an d the larger world. The Honors College aims to focus campus attention on excellence in undergraduate education while strengthening New Mexico State University's reputation as the university of choice in New Mexico. In support of this mission, the Honors College integrates the following objectives: _\u0001Provide students with an interdisciplinary, intellectually challenging curriculum that integrates active and service -based learning; _\u0001Promote university -wide undergraduate research opportunities, linking students with faculty mentors; _\u0001Foster faculty enrichment and professional development; _\u0001Encourage, mentor, and guide students seeking postgraduate scholarships and fellowships; _\u0001Offer students opportunities for developing leadership skills; _\u0001Create a resid ential community that combines learning inside and outside the classroom. In small classes taught by master teachers, students in the Honors College engage in lively discussion and collaborative investigation of interdisciplinary topics. By taking honors courses, students may also work toward completing general education requirements and disciplinary requirements in the major. Students in the Honors College are 'dual citizens', i.e., they enroll in both the college(s) of their major/minor and the Honors Col lege. The Honors College does not offer a degree; instead, it offers students the opportunity to graduate with various levels of honors distinction (described below). The Honors Faculty The Honors College faculty come from academic departments from through out the university. Members of the faculty are chosen through a rigorous selection process and include many of New Mexico State University's most distinguished teachers and researchers. Professors Alexander, Amato, Andersen, Bosland, Bronstein, Butler, Cat lett, Cleveland, Fouillade, E. Harvey, Horodowich, Thompson Associate Professors Boeing, Holtzman, Huhmann, Knapp, Ketelaar, Lee, Miller Fitzsimmons, Gilpin , Gray, Lavender, Ocepek, Rundell, Staffeldt, Townley, Trevathan, Wolf Admission to the Honors College Students admitted to the Honors College are designated as Crimson Scholars, the follo wing eligibility criteria apply: Automatic Eligibility.

The final project is normally done during the seni or year and may be undertaken only if the student meets the eligibility requirements for graduation from the College (3.5 minimum GPA and the required courses). The final project carries 3 graded credit hours. Before beginning the final project, the studen t must choose a faculty advisor and file with the College a proposal that is approved by the faculty advisor and the Dean of the Honors College. The final project is graded by the faculty advisor, who submits a final grade to the Dean of the Honors College . Candidates for graduation with University Honors and Distinction in University Honors are expected to make public presentations of their final projects at one or more of the following: (1) the Undergraduate Research and Creative Arts Symposium, (2) a dep artment seminar, (3) and/or a seminar sponsored by the Honors College. The method of presentation shall be that deemed appropriate for the discipline in which the project is undertaken. The written component of the final project shall be filed with the Hon ors College in a bound copy according to the guidelines established by the college. The final project may be any one of the following: Thesis \u2014 The thesis is an independent scholarly or scientific research project that is undertaken with the advice and dir ection of a member of the university faculty. The thesis does not need to be on a topic in the student's major field, but must meet the guidelines and protocols of the discipline in which it is written. The faculty advisor, in consultation with the thesis committee, will examine the student's thesis and determine a final grade. Creative Arts or Performance Project \u2014 The Senior Creative Arts/Performance project may take the form of an exhibition, recital, or other venue deemed appropriate by the faculty advi sor and the Dean of the Honors College. In addition to the performance or exhibition, the student must complete a written report or description of the project that is approved by the faculty advisor, to be filed with the Honors College. Service Learning Pr oject \u2014 The Service Learning Project shall be undertaken under the auspices and supervision of an agency approved by the Dean of the Honors College. A faculty advisor must approve the project and monitor its progress. The Service Learning Project must be m ore than simply a certain number of hours volunteered to an agency. It must also involve a creative and leadership element, such as the design of a program or policy that identifies a problem and meets a specific need of the agency. A time log and journal shall be kept by the student during the course of the project. A written report describing the objective and design of the project, as well as an evaluation of its successes and failures, must be submitted to the Honors College according to norms establish ed by the college. The report must also contain a reflective component, demonstrating increased self -awareness and personal growth. At the completion of the final project, the student will be required to do an exit interview with the faculty advisor and/or Dean of the Honors College. Such interviews will be used in the formal assessment process. Honors Contract \u2014 An Honors Contract is a mechanism for adding an \"honors dimension\" to a course that is not listed as an honors course (HON prefix). The contract allows honors students to convert a regular non -honors course into an honors course that counts toward graduation with University Honors. The Honor Contract project should add an academic or experiential dimension to the course by introducing new material a nd/or experiences. Contract form may be downloaded from the Honors College website. Community Service Options The Honors College encourages its students to perform volunteer public service. Under certain circumstances, public service may be used as an alternative to completing some of the requirements for graduation from the Honors College. The following guidelines apply: During the sophomore, junior, or senior year, a student with at least a 3.5 GPA may undertake community service with an agency or organiz ation in Do\u00f1a Ana County (or an agency outside the area approved by the Honors College Dean) to earn a waiver of up to 3 of the hours required for University Honors (not including the Final Project). A minimum of 15 hours of community service per week, per semester is required for each honors credit hour to be waived. Community service hours must be verified by a supervisor of the agency or organization on a form approved by the Honors College. On -campus activities are not included under this option. The student must also certify that the community service hours are not being used for any course or degree requirement. Approval of the Dean of the Honors College must be obtained prior to beginning volunteer service to be eligible for this option. International Study Option Students in the Honors College are strongly encouraged to participate in international study. An NMSU honors student with at least a 3.5 GPA may earn a waiver of up to 3 credit hours required for University Honors for such international study (not including the Final Project). This waiver will be awarded for college credit earned while participating in any international study program approved by the Honors College or the Office of International Study. One honors hour will be waived for each 3 semester credit hours earned with a grade of 'A', 'B', or 'S'. Permission to use this option must be approved in advance by the Honors College. Note: Waiver of university honors credit for service learning or international study does not reduce or affect i n any way the total number of hours required for graduation. Waiver of honors credit for service learning or international study cannot be applied toward the final project requirement. Honors Certificate Program Sophomores, juniors, and seniors with a cumu lative grade -point average of 3.2 are eligible for the Honors Certificate Program. A student who completes at least two 300 - or 400- level honors seminars will be given a Certificate of Distinction at graduation and special recognition in the commencement p rogram.

Honors students, especially first -year students, are encouraged to t ake advantage of this special opportunity. The Honors Living and Learning Community is comprised of three components: The Conroy Honors Center \u2014 is the academic home of the Honors College. This historic building was designed by the renowned southwestern ar chitect Henry C. Trost and built in 1908 to house the campus chapter of the YMCA. The Conroy Center houses the administrative offices of the program along with three seminar rooms, a student commons area, a kitchen, and a computer lab. The Honors Residence Hall \u2014 is located in Rhodes , Garett, Hamiel Hall (RGH) and is the focus of NMSU's vibrant honors community. It is a place where honors students live among a community of excellent students with outstanding academic records and who are interested in getti ng the most out of the academic opportunities offered to them at a large research institution. It also hosts many social and extracurricular academic activities. The Honors Residence Hall is equipped with two electronic classrooms, where many introductory honors courses are taught. The honors faculty participate in residence hall programming and frequently attend residence hall floor meetings with students. The Honors Residence Hall is open to both men and women of any university class standing. The Crimson Scholar Residential Mentors Program \u2014 Crimson Scholar Residential Mentors live in the Honors Residence Hall and promote academic success of the entire student body by tutoring and mentoring residence hall students. Mentors also foster a sense of community throughout the Honors Residence Hall by creating personal affiliations, engaging in scholarly conversation, and lending academic support to their peers.
