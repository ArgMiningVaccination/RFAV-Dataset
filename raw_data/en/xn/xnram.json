The rst is that the German word for vaccination (Impfung ) is exactly the same as the word for injection. Etymo- logically we can understand quite easily the reason for this. The rst vaccinations were injections, and these injections con-ferred immunity when undertaken prophylactically. Even into the 21st century, in common usage German does not employ a separate word for the distinct procedures of injecting a sub-stance for any other reason, or an injection for the purpose of inoculation. German usage has, in more recent years, bor-rowed the word vakzination from the English, but this was not common usage during Steiner's time. He used it exactly once in the Collected Works, while talking to medical doctors. Yet he spoke extensively about the processes underlying vaccination to many audiences. The second challenge consists of the fact that in Steiner's view of healing, there is not much dierence between a remedy created to cure a condition, and one to be used prophylacti-cally. That is, when Steiner was developing the anthroposoph-ical pharmacopoeia, it did not matter to him at what point in the disease cycle the remedy was employed. If someone was susceptible to hay fever, they could take the remedy prophy-lactically before they had symptoms. This would technically make the remedy a vaccine, especially when injected for that purpose. In the case of the hay fever remedy, as with many other remedies invented by Steiner, it is actually injected. As Steiner also emphasized, it was not the particular substances that were important to his remedies, it was how they were used and how they were introduced into the body. And he gives a variety of options for diering eects: intravenous in-jection, subcutaneous injection, baths, oil rubs, oral ingestion, and vapor inhalation, among others. Steiner's entire view of medicine and the human body is fun- damentally dierent from the modern materialist conception that underlies 21st century medicine. He develops his views at great length in multiple cycles of lectures, as well as incidentally 1 See Viral Illness an Epidemics in the Work of Rudolf Steiner, also from Aelzina Books.4 VACCINATION Translator's Note The etymology of the word \"vaccine\" is interesting. Variolation , the practice of piercing a ripe smallpox pustule on a sick person and inserting the resulting liquid under the skin of a healthy per-son, was widely practiced outside of Europe since antiquity and was widespread within Europe by the 1600s. The only down-side: the healthy recipient stood about a two percent chance of con-tracting a full-blown case of smallpox and possibly sickening their immediate companions, and a smaller chance of possibly dying in the process. In the very late 1700s, English physician Edward Jenner began experimenting with secretions of cowpox pustules from humans applied to other humans as an inoculation against the related, but much more deadly smallpox. The idea came from examining the folk wisdom that milk maids had clear skin, with-out any pockmarks. Investigations eventually showed that anyone who contracted the milder cowpox and survived was im-mune from the more virulent smallpox for life. Jenner began in-oculating people with an inactivated cowpox pustule extract, by the same means as the smallpox variolation was delivered, and eventually established that this method, too, conferred immunity and at much lower risk. 2 The Latin word for cow is vacca ; cowpox was known in the medical literature of the time as vaccainania . The adjectival form of cow (that is, pertaining to cows ) is vaccinae , also written vaccine from which we get the word that Jenner used to name his injections. The new term quickly became widespread in English usage as the practice caught on. As Jenner's method spread to Germany in the early 1800s, the preferred term was Impfen , a usage that was carried over from the practice of variolation. In the German-speaking Central Eu-rope they updated the substance, but maintained the old term for the process. In both cases the practice was the same\u2014injec- 2 Jenner's significance is not so much that he was the first to experiment with cowpox injections\u2014he was not\u2014but that he proved by subsequently exposing his subjects first to cowpox, then to smallpox, that they had in-deed obtained immunity. The evidence in his write-ups, and their sub-sequent validation by other physicians, overcame considerable opposition to the idea and made him a hero of the scientific establishment. Smallpox was eventually declared eliminated by the WHO in 1980 due, in the eyes of science, to prophylactic immunization using his method. Unease with the process of vaccination existed from the beginning, something Steiner com-mented on (see the chapter on Smallpox, Karma, and Vaccination on page 28). RUDOLF STEINER 7 Public Lectures and Articles 8 VACCINATION How are We to Understand Illness and Death? This lecture was held on the 13th of December, 1906 in Berlin. It was presented as part of a regular series to create interest in the Theosophical Society, of which Steiner was then General Secretary of the German National Chapter. It was open to the general public and advertised in local newspapers. Anyone could wander in o the street to listen to this lecture and others like it. Members impressed with Steiner could likewise bring their friends and acquaintances to such public lectures. Quite a few of Steiner's early followers rst encountered him and his work in such public lectures. An equal or greater number of people listened to them and concluded that theos-ophy was not for them. These public lecturers were given catchy titles designed to awaken interest among the general public. The lecture is contained in CW 55. It was reconstructed by the editors from various listeners' notes. The lecture was rst pub-lished as a pamphlet in 1952 and then collected with other public lectures into book form in 1959. The translation was made from the unrevised 1983 second German edition. T oday we are dealing with a subject that is undoubtedly close to everyone's heart, because the two words \"illness and death\" ex-press something that enters every life, often like an uninvited guest, but often also as something tormenting, oppressive, and frightening. Y es, death itself poses the greatest question in the mys-tery of existence. When someone has solved the question of the meaning of death, then for them the question of the nature of life has also been solved. Y ou often hear people say: Death is a riddle, no one has solved it yet and no one will ever solve it. People who say such things do not even suspect what immodesty lies in these words; they do not even suspect that there is a solution to such riddles and that they simply do not understand it. T oday, when we are dealing with such an all-encompassing significant topic, I ask you to pay special attention to the fact that this presentation can-not be anything else than an answer to the question posed: How RUDOLF STEINER 9 does one conceive of illness and death? Therefore, we will not di- gress into specialized questions about specific diseases or health in general, but must by and large stick to the question: How do you gain an understanding of these two important questions of our ex- istence? The best-known answer to the question of the nature of death, which has been valid for centuries but that today has lost its value for the vast majority of educated mankind, is found in the words of Paul: \"For the wages of sin is death.\" 3 For many centuries these words served as a sort of solution to the riddle of death. T oday, anyone who thinks in the modern sense will not be able to do anything at all with such an answer. The idea that sin, some-thing completely of the moral realm, something purely in the na-ture of human behavior, could be the cause of a biological reality such as death\u2014that sin should somehow be connected with the nature of disease\u2014that is quite unfathomable to a modern thinker. It will perhaps still be useful to us if we also point out that our present age no longer even understands the meaning of the sentence: \"For the wages of sin is death.\" For by sin Paul and those who lived in his time understood something quite different from what is understood today by modern philistines. What is meant here by the term sin is not a transgression in the usual sense, not even a transgression of a some particularly egregious sort. Rather, by sin they understood that which arises from selfishness and ego- ism. Everything that has selfishness and egoism as its impetus of action\u2014in contrast to that which arises from objective impulses\u2014is sin. Egoism, selfish action, however, presupposes that the human being has become independent, I-conscious. This must be recog-nized, if you completely immerse yourself in the way of thinking of a spirit such as Paul. Whoever does not remain at a superficial level of understand- ing the Old and New T estaments, but really penetrates into the spirit of these works, knows that a very specific (you could say nat-ural philosophical) way of thinking forms the undercurrent of this Old and New T estament way of thinking. This undercurrent can be expressed approximately as follows: Everything that is present 3 Romans 6:23 RUDOLF STEINER 27 Lectures to the Members 28 VACCINATION Smallpox, Karma, and Vaccination The following excerpts are taken from a series of eleven lec- tures held in Hamburg in May of 1910 to an invitation-only au-dience who had been studying theosophy and Steiner's works for years. It was rst published in 1911 based on participant notes, which have since been lost. Since the oldest extant source is the 1911 rst printing, it is dicult to say how accu-rate it is. It is in volume 120 of the Collected Works. This trans-lation is based on the slightly revised 1975 edition. The lectures in this volume are a comprehensive treatment of the topic of karma\u2014how it works, what the eects look like, and many of the ramications. Of particular interest related to the topic of vaccination is Steiner's discussion of the ethical im-plications of intervening in infectious diseases, whether on a large scale through public health measures including vaccina-tion, or in individual cases. His response to the question shows that Steiner's view of karma is quite flexible, flowing both back-wards and forwards in time, and not at all deterministic. It is also a view of karma that allows for a multitude of possible paths into the future, a necessity if his view is to incorporate both human freedom and the laws of karma. In the paragraphs leading up to this excerpt Steiner had ex- plained the cosmic wisdom behind volcanic eruptions, earth-quakes, and epidemics. The present Earth is the product of both normal and abnormal cosmic forces, and human free-dom is only possible because of the interplay of both. Ex-cerpted below is his example. W e must be aware that where the Luciferic and Ahrimanic12 principles work together, whether simultaneously or over long periods of time, or where they work against each other, certain complications arise in human life. And these complications work in such a way that we encounter them in the most diverse ways in the most diverse cases, so that no two cases will be alike. But when we study human life we will find our way through the question in the following manner: If we look for the interaction of Lucifer and 12Luciferic and Ahrimic principles: the two forces that oppose human progress in different ways. See Steiner's book Occult Science . 36 VACCINATION Eliminating Spirituality by Injection I In 1917 the world had been at war for three years, at tremen- dous cost. Everywhere people pondered what had led to the war, and how to move forward. Steiner was stuck in neutral Switzerland where he and an international group of supporters were building his conference center, the Goetheanum. The following lecture is from a series of weekend lectures to members of the Anthroposophcial Society who were able to attend in person in Dornach. These paragraphs come from the lecture of October 7 th, 1917, contained in volume 177 of the Collected Works, and is translated from the 5th revised edition of 1999. The source of the text is the stenographic transcrip-tion made by Helen Finckh. The series is titled The Fall of the Spirits of Darkness , and Steiner's main thesis is that certain spiritual forces, which he calls Ahrimanic, were driven out of the spiritual realm in the late 19 th century and are working more actively among human- ity on Earth, usually in an unconscious way, to reinforce ma-terialism and stifle any breakthrough to a more spiritual culture. There will be circumstances in the future where you will not really know who you are dealing with. ... The institutions, the con-cepts, the social ideas that people make for themselves today are abstract, crude, and clumsy in the face of what approaches human-ity from the future in the form of complicated social relationships. And because people are not able to encompass what exists in re-ality with these clumsy concepts, with their ideas, humanity will fall more and more into chaos, as it is already sufficiently indicated by the events of this war. This chaos comes from the fact that re-ality is a different one, a richer one, than what people can imagine, what people work out in their heads. And you will have to realize that we are confronted with the choice: Either, because we do not know how to order the world, we continue pounding away at each other, as with the present shooting war, or we begin with the formation of such concepts, such ideas, as are up to the task of encompassing these complicated RUDOLF STEINER 58 Hayfever - to Doctors This excerpt comes from a pair of lectures given at The Haag on November 15th and 16th, 1923, stenographically recorded by Walter Vegelahn. The were rst published in a periodical in 1931, and then as part of the Collected Works in volume 319 in 1971. This translation is from the 1994 3 rd edition. In this No- vember 15th lecture Steiner talks about hay fever and the \"water being\" in human physiology as an aspect of the three fundamental systems in physiology: the Nerve-Sense system, the Metabolic-Limbic system, and the Circulatory system. The interaction, and in particular the imbalances in these systems underly illnesses both major and minor. This catarrhus aestivus [hayfever] has been traced back\u2014I need only mention this here\u2014to certain substances that are sup-posed to be contained in the pollen dust of the gramineae . 41 This only corresponds to the tendency of our time to attribute pathology to directly physical substances and external things. If we look at the human organism from a spiritual-scientific point of view, as well as at the processes which take place in the environment of the human being when the gramineae blossom, then we can defi- nitely say that the whole natural process in the season when the gramineae blossom takes place not only around the gramineae , but also around the human being, who is exposed to the same at- mospheric influences under which the gramineae blossom. Now, in a human being, when they have, I would like to say, specialized in the organization just towards the nose, the eyes, which then leads to catarrhus aestivus , when that, which under the preponderance of the nerve-sense process has then led to the ex- udative diathesis 42 in childhood\u2014localized to the start of of the res- piratory organs on the inside\u2014then just this annoying catarrh43 41 Gramineae: scientific name for the family of plants known as grass. 42 \"Exsudativen Diathese\" doesn't really translate. In English it describes a vitamin E deficiency in poultry. But in German medical terminology a Diathese is an inclination in the body to a specific type of illness, and ex-sudativen Diathese indicates an inflammatory skin diseases with fluid se-cretion or diseases with increased blood vessel permeability "}
