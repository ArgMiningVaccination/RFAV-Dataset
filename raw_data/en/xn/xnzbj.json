Program H istory This is the f irst review for the Bioengineering program . The material below is a summary of the creation and early years of the B.S. in Bioengineering at the University of California, Riverside. Proposed Major in Bioengineering August 3, 2004 I. Overview The College of Engineering proposes the establishment of a B.S. degree entitled \"Bioengineering.\" This degree program will be administered by a Bioengineering program committee to be select ed by the Dean of Engineering. The Bioengineering program committee is expected to have representatives from each of the Departments in the College of Engineering. Initially, the Bioengineering program Committee will have the respo nsibility for approval and management of Bioengineering c ourses within the curriculum. Also, in the early phase of establishing the Bioengineering Curriculum, the teaching faculty for the program will be drawn from the College of Engineering with the approval of the Dean and the chairs of the respective departments. Over the next five years, the plan is to hire new faculty with bioengineering expertise to carry the major teaching and rese arch thrusts of the program. During this transition period - each of the newly hired bioengineering faculty will be housed in one of existing departments of the College of Engineering that most closely matched their training. Then a new Department of Bioengineering will be formed, and the existing primary Bioengineering Fa culty at that time will transfer their primary appointments to the Department of Bioengineering. 6 II. The Major Major requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Bioengineering are as follows: Lower -division requirements (65 units) a) First Year Calculus; Multivariable Calculus; Differential Equations b) General Chemistry c) General Physics - Mechanics, Heat, Sound, Phys, Electricity, d) Cell and Molecular Biology, Organismal Biology e) Introduction to Bioengineering f) C++ Programing Proposed Upper -division requirements a) Organic Chemistry b) Biochemistry c) Modeling and Analysis d) Bioinstrumentation e) Biosystems and Signals f) Biotechnology and Molecular Bioengineering g) Biotransport h) Biophysics and Biothermodyamics i) Biomechanics j) Biomaterials k) Biostatistics l) Senior Biodesign m) Technical Electives III. Justification The proposed major in Bioengineering will allow students to complete a B.S. degree that will provide them with the basic education to enter the fields of bioengineering and biotechnology. Although the major will be termed \"bioengineering\" the course requirements will allow students to participate in the biotechnology industry as w ell. In general the term \"bioengineering\" is sometimes associated more with the medical industry and the term \"biotechnology\" is more associated with the phar maceutical and food industries. (More descriptions of these terms are given below). Training bioengineers is particularly important in the State of California. As shown in Figure 1 f rom the 2004 Annual Report of the California Healthcare Institute . 7 As can be seen , the biomedical and biotechnology industry is one of the prime employers of technology trained individuals in the State of California. This report goes on to give the following encouraging statistics for opportunities for students with a bioengineering education. \"Today 2,600 biomedical companies in California \u201486% of them founded in the last 25 years \u2014and 87 public and private research institutions continue to advance scientific knowledge and develop new treatments for serious diseases such as cancer, and cardiovascular, respiratory, and infectious disease. The pace of progress is accelerating with the expansion of information- based technology approaches \u2014for example, genomics is mining the human genome for biological information to create preventive therapies, and na notechnology is developing sensor technology and using microchips to diagnose disease. And as the industry matures in California with more products in advanced clinical trials, it is moving beyond a primarily R&D -based industry, adding more manufacturing t o its repertoire. California continues to receive more funds from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) \u2014in 2003, approximately $2.9 billion \u2014than any other state. And the total reported private investment in research and development is $15.5 billion, with the average company investing 48% of its revenues back into R&D. The industry employs more than 230,000 Californians in jobs with an estimated average annual salary of $67,000, and total estimated wages and salaries paid of $14 billion. It generates $ 32.3 billion in worldwide revenue and more than $7 billion for the state in exports. California companies are addressing issues of global health in new ways \u2014developing medicines for diseases in developing countries, and new pricing strategies to balance th e industry's successes with responsibilities to the developing world. They are balancing business risks by building networks of alliances that enable them to integrate virtually, with each member of a network focused on a specific role in bringing high val ue products to market. In many ways, it is an exciting time for what has always been a vibrant, innovative, and resilient industry.\" The following is a definition of bioengineering that was developed at NIH: \"Bioengineering is rooted in physics, mathem atics, chemistry, biology, and the life sciences. It is the application of a systematic, quantitative, and integrative way of thinking about and approaching the solutions of problems important to biology, medical research, clinical proactive, and populatio n studies. Figure 1. Leading employers of bioengineers 8 Bioengineering integrates physical, chemical, or mathematical sciences and engineering principles for the study of biology, medicine, behavior, or health. It advances fundamental concepts, creates knowledge for the molecular to the organ system s levels, and develops innovative biologics, materials, processes, implants, devices, and informatics approaches for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, for patient rehabilitation, and for improving health.\" The national biotechnology industry trade organization , BIO, gives the following definition of biotechnology: \"New \" Biotechnology \u2014the use of cellular and biomolecular processes to solve problems or make useful products. Biotechnology is a collection of technologies that capitalize on the attributes of cells, such as their manufacturing capabilities, and put biological molecules, such as DNA and proteins, to work for us. IV. Draft Description from the UCR General Catalog Bioengineering uses the principles of physics, mathematics, chemistry, biology, to develop processes and products that are important for health and treatment of diseases, new materials, protecting the envi ronments, and food production. Bioengineers are employed by the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device, environmental and food industries. For those interested in medicine, the Bioengineering program provides the basic courses to allow one to apply to medical schools. Bioengineering program Approval Timetable Approval of the Bioengineering B.S. degree and Department was in two stages. First approval by the College of Engineering Executive Committee was required , and then approval of the University Academic Senate was required. The Engineering Executive Committee has representatives of all engineering departments and the Academic Senate is comprised of the entire faculty at the University of California, Riverside . The Bioengineering Undergraduate Program and B.S. Degree were approved first, and then after the first cohort of faculty was recruited the Bioengineering Department was approved. May 24, 2005 The B.S. Degree in Bioengineering was a pproved by the University Academic Senate. May 2006 The Department Bioengineering was approved by t he University Academic Senate. Fall 2006 The first undergraduate students enrolled in the program . Bioengineering Faculty Plan The strategic plan for the B ioengineering Department is to have a core faculty of 15 members. Figure 2 shows the growth of the faculty since its inception. Today the Department of Bioengineering has eleven tenure -track faculty ; their names, research areas, and dates of appointment are listed below . We are currently recruiting an additional faculty member. 9 Figure 2. Growth of the number of b ioengineering faculty Table 1.

Freshman enrollment in 2010- 2011 was unusually high because of an aberration in the University admission system. Subsequently , the Colle ge of Engineering has instituted enrollment controls for each of the undergraduate programs. In 2011 the Bioengineering faculty decided on a target of about 80 freshmen each year for our No o ptions . Table 2.

Administrative organizational structure f or engineering programs 12 GENERAL CRITERIA CRITERION 1. STUDENTS A. Student Admissions The admissions processes for all Bourns College of Engineering programs conform to the UCR Academic Senate's interpretation of the admission policies of the University of California, which, in turn, interpret the mandates of the California Master Plan for Highe r Education. In broad terms, the Master Plan constrains the University of California to admitting only students ranking in the top 12.5% of the high school graduates in the State. Students in lower tiers are eligible for admission to c ampuses of the Califo rnia State University system, or to Community Colleges in the State. Placement in the top 12.5% of the graduating class is determined by the UC Eligibility Index, which is computed centrally by the UC Office of the President, based on criteria defined by t he UC System -Wide Academic Senate. Figure 6 summarizes the admissions process to our C ollege. Prospective students submit their applications to the Office of Admissions for the University of California, which serves all ten campuses of the University. Applicants may apply to multiple campuses, and to multiple programs at these campuses. They may also designate primary and alternate majors. The UC Office of Admissions determines whether each applicant meets the UC Eligibility criteria (which specify GPA and coursework requirements) and forwards each eligible application to the campuses to which admission is being sought. Ineligible applicants are rejected. Within UCR, processing of these forwarded applications begins through the Campus Office of Admission s, in accordance with guidelines defined by the Undergraduate Admissions Committee (UAC) of the UCR Academic Senate. An Enrollment Management Council (EMC) also exists at the Campus level to make decisions annually on the enrollment targets at the Campus a nd College levels. These decisions are informed by the strategic planning processes at the Campus and College levels. UCR follows a multi- tier admissions process, which operates as follows. At the first tier, an Academic Index Score (AIS) is computed for each applicant, based primarily on academic parameters such as the grade point average ( GPA) , the S cholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) score, and the number of completed Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate ( IB) courses. College -specific upper and l ower AIS thresholds are determined in accordance with the planned enrollment targets. All applicants to a College whose AIS scores exceed the upper threshold are automatically admitted to their program of interest. All applicants with AIS scores below the lower threshold for each college are removed from that college's pool. The remaining applicants are forwarded to the respective colleges for further processing. Once these forwarded applications arrive at BCOE , a, BCOE -specific Index Score (BIS) is compute d for each applicant. This BIS score is a function of the applicant's grades in mathematics and science, as well as the m ath part of the SAT Reasoning Test (the SAT Advanced test is not required by UC). The applicants to each program are ranked by BIS scor e, 13 and applicants are admitted starting at the top of the list for each program until the program's enrollment target is met. Applicants may be placed on a wait list, to be admitted if the yield rate from the admitted pool is insufficient to satisfy progra m targets. Figure 4. The admission p rocess B. Evaluating Student Performance B1. Overview Student performance monitoring is primarily the role of the Office of Student Academic Affairs, under the supervision of the Associate Dean. In the Bioengineering Department Professor Jerome Schultz is the designated as the Program Faculty Adviser, who serves as the primary departmental contact for program -specific policy decisions. College -level policy is under the purview of the Associate Dean. The staff of Office of Student Academic Affairs (OSA A) supports the undergraduate programs. 14 The Office of Student Academic Affairs (OSAA) implements and enforces academic policies developed by UCR/ BCOE & its Departments/programs. There is constant consultation and feedback between faculty and academic advisors. Below we review the mission of OSAA. MISSION : The Office of Student Academic Affairs mission is to support engineering students in achieving thei r educational goals by providing guidance and services which enhance their academic development. This mission is implemented by: Upholding academic policies of the university, BCOE and its departments. Assisting students in acclimating to and navigating the academic environment, policies and expectations. Working intentionally to build respect, trust and cooperation with students in support of their academic success. Considering individual student needs while encouraging student development. Encouraging ac ademic planning, self -awareness, accountability and resourcefulness. Helping students respond proactively and productively to issues impacting academic success. Committing to excellence, the academic counseling profession and continued development. In Table 4, we list the current OSAA staff, with brief biographical details. Note that they have decades of combined experience, and they have an exceptionally low turnover rate for OSAA staff. Table 4.

In addition, attendance at a mandatory Annual Major Advising session is required of all undergraduat es in the college. The Annual Major Advising session for Bioengineering is conducted jointly by the OS AA staff and Professor Jerome Schultz , and provides information on a variety of topics to students, including program requirements as well as academic su ccess strategies and professional development opportunities. Figure 7 depicts the process for monitoring student progress. Students are required to maintain a GPA of 2.0 each quarter, as well as cumulatively. Students are reminded of these requirements regularly, first during the registration process in their first quarter as freshmen, and again each year during Annual Major Advising. Grades are posted by instructors each quarter to the central Student Information System ( SIS) database, which tracks student performance, and provides degree audits to check for completion of degree requirements. At the end of each quarter, staff advisers in the OSA A review the academic records of BCOE students and identify all whose term and cumulative GPAs are below 2.0. 16 Figure 5. Flow diagram for a cademic advising and performance monitoring A failure to meet these GPA requirements results in a student being placed on probation. The student is notified of this probationary status, and advised that a failure to obtain at least a 2.0 GPA the following term will result in dismissal. A registration hold is now placed on the student's record, to be released only upon the completion of Academic Success Workshops and other advising and mentoring activities through the OS AA. A student who receives a dismissal notice may appeal the dismissal to the Associate Dean, who may grant or reject the appeal based on extenuating circumstances. The primary source of information regarding student performance is the campus -wide Student Information System (SIS) , which records all student registrations and grades, and which is maintained by the Computing and Communications organization. All staff and faculty advisers have access to this system, either directly, or through the Student Advising System (SAS) front - end that provides access to student transcripts and degree audits. This system is used regularly by the staff of the OS AA to monitor student progress. SIS Course Grades GPA < 2? Dismissal? Appeal? N Granted By Associate Dean?

This course plan incorporates prerequisites, so that students who follow the course plan automatically satisfy prerequisites. Whether or not students follow this course plan, prerequisites are enforced by the registration system. Students register for courses through the Grades Online Web Link ( GROWL ) system that interfaces with SIS, and is able to enforce prerequisites. A student prevented from taking a course due to lack of prerequisites can petition the course instructor, who has the authority to grant the student a prerequisite waiver. The student is not permitted to take the course without such a waiver. (GROWL is the secure student portal used to complete the majority of administrative transactions neede d during a student's academic career. This includes submission of a student's Statement of Intent to Register, control of all privacy through FERPA based controls, access to bills, submission of payment, term registration, review of administrative or advi sing holds, grades, transcript requests and review and acceptance of their financial aid to name a few.) C. Transfer Students and Transfer Courses Transfer students apply using the same application portal that freshmen use. This portal is maintained by the System -Wide Office of Admissions, located in Oakland, CA. This office collects applications and forwards them to the UCR Office of Admissions. In accordance with the California Master Plan for Higher Education, the University of California maintains extens ive articulation agreements with Community Colleges in the State. Course articulations are reviewed and approved by the cognizant departments, and are tracked and maintained by the Campus Articulation Officer. All system- wide articulation agreements are available at the website http://www.assist.org , which is open access. The transfer route appears to be gaining popularity, especially given recent increases in tuition. When a transfer applicant (typically, from out of state) presents a transcript containing courses that have not already been articulated, the staff of the BCOE OSAA collect the relevant course syllabi and work with the cognizant departments at UCR to determine articulations. All BCOE programs have published detailed requirements for transfer a dmission. Admission to our programs requires a minimum GPA of 2.8, and the completion of coursework specific to the major being applied to. Incoming transfer students may transfer up to 105 quarter units (70 semester units) towards their degrees from the U niversity. To ease the burden of consulting http://www.assist.org for each major an applicant may be interested in, we have prepared brochures showing transfer requirements for each of our majors. We make these brochures available both in hardcopy, as well as on the Web. Some examples appear at www.engr.ucr.edu/undergrads/transferring/SpecialAgreements.html. If the transfer applicant for a major meets all the requirements specified by that major, the UCR Office of Admissions admits that applicant. Applicant s who satisfy most transfer requirements are forwarded to the College for additional review. The OS AA staff reviews these applications, and in consultation with the departments and the Associate Dean, grants exceptions as warranted. 18 Conditional admission i s also sometimes granted, subject to the completion of some requirements that may not have been met at the time of application. Bourns College of Engineering Transfer Admission Requirements Transfer applicant to the College of Engineering must meet both UC R Admission criteria and BCOE major -selection criteria. Here are the selection criteria for a transfer student into a Bioengineering Major (UCR course equivalents shown in parenthes es): A cumulative GPA of at least 2.80 in UC -transferable coursework Minimum 2.50 GPA in one year of single -variable calculus (MATH 9A, 9B, 9C). Completion of one year college level English c omposition (ENGL 1A, 1B, 1C). Two courses in general chemistry with labs (CHEM 1A/1LA, 1B/1LB) One course in introduction to cellul ar and molecular biology with lab (BIOL 5A/5LA). A minimum of three (3) additional courses chosen from*: One course in introduction to organismal biology (BIOL 5B) One course in general chemistry with lab (CHEM 1C/1LC) Three courses in calculus based physi cs with labs (PHYS 40A, 40B, 40C) *The selection of the three additional courses s hould ensure that a second science sequence is complete with at least a 2.50 GPA. Potential sequences are: General Chemistry - CHEM 1A/1LA, CHEM 1B/1LB, CHEM PHYS 40B, PHYS 40C D. Advising and Career Guidance The mechanisms by which students receive academic advice have already been outlined in Section B: Evaluating Student Performance . Here, we will describe the mechan isms for providing Career and Professional guidance. A summary of the range of Professional Development, Mentoring, and Success program in BCOE appears the Figure. Professional guidance and mentoring is provided by staff (particularly, the Director of Student Professional Development), the f aculty, and the Career Center. The overall College philosophy that guides all interactions with students is to ensure that they are both academically and professionally prepared to become leaders in their chosen fiel ds. This goal is especially challenging to meet in engineering colleges. As is typical for undergraduate programs in engineering, our students spend the first two years of their undergraduate work completing prerequisite coursework in mathematics, sciences, and the humanities and social sciences. In the Bioengineering program we provide an introductory course to our students during the first term they are on campus. Bioengineering 10 - (BIEN 010) Overview of Bioengineering provides our students wit h a perspective of the engineering discipline and in particular it is designed to motivate students towards careers in engineering. In addition, all of the Bioengineering students 19 are required to meet with a Bioengineering faculty member at least twice dur ing each academic year. In these meetings the faculty reviews the student progress in their courses as well as review possible career paths with them. During these discussions the faculty will suggest possible technical electives that would support the student's career interests. This yearly meeting of students with faculty is enforced by withholding student registration for the next term until the mentoring session is completed. Also , many of the Bioengineering students participate in research projects with the Bioengineering faculty. Appr oximately one -half of the upper -division students (juniors and seniors) work with faculty on projects; and in the course of these activities the students receive individual mentoring by faculty and graduate students in the se laboratories. In addition to the mentoring that the students receive by Bioengineering faculty, a suite of activities supported by the college under the Professional Development Milestones program complement the program- specific content in these courses. Examples of such activities are academically -oriented workshops on time management and study -skills, as well as professionally -oriented activities such as mock interviews, resume writing, as well as research and industrial internships. Figure 8 and Tabl e 5 summarize these milestones.

Advising resources for u ndergraduates 20 Table 5. Calendar of Professional Development Milestones A total of 18 Student Professional Organizations exist in BCOE , and are supported financially by the College. These organizations are student -led, and are very active. Just over 800 students are active members of these organizations (roughly 40% of the students in College). Some of the organizations that are of particular interest to Bioengineering students are: BMES (Biomedical Engineering Society) BCOE SLC (Student Leadership Council) EWB (Engineers Without Border s) MRS (Material Research Society) NSBE ( National Society of Black Engineers) OSA (Optical Society of America) SACNAS (Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science) SHPE (Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers) SWE (Society of Women Engineers) TBP (Tau Beta Pi) - Honors Society These organizations, under the mentorship of the Director of Student Professional Development, Mr. Jun Wang, participate in a broad range of activities during the year.

PROGRAM EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES A. Mission Statement s A.1 Mission of the University of California, Riverside The University of California, Riverside serves the needs and enhances the quality of life of the diverse people of California, the nation and the world through knowledge - its communication, discovery, translation, application, and preservation. The undergraduate, graduate and professional degree programs; research programs; and outreach activities develop leaders who inspire, cre ate, and enrich California's economic, social, cultural, and environmental future. With its roots as a Citrus Experiment Station, UC Riverside is guided by its land grant tradition of giving back by addressing some of the most vexing problems facing societ y. Whether it is assuring a safe, nutritious, and affordable food supply; stimulating the human mind and soul through the humanities and arts; or finding solutions to the profound challenges in education, engineering, business, healthcare, and the environm ent, UC Riverside is living the promise. The M ission of the Bourns College of Engineering is to: Produce engineers with the educational foundation and adaptive skills to serve rapidly evolving technology industries; Conduct nationally recognized engineeri ng research focused on providing a technical edge for the United States; Contribute to knowledge of both fundamental and applied areas of engineering; Provide diverse curricula that will instill in our students the imagination, talents, creativity, and skills necessary for the varied and rapidly changing requirements of modern life; Enable our graduates to serve in a wide variety of other fields that require leadership, teamwork, decision- making and problem -solving abilities; and Be a catalyst for indust rial growth in Inland Southern California. The Vision of the Bourns College of Engineering is to become a nationally recognized leader in engineering research and education. A.2 Mission of the Department of Bioengineering Our unique interdisciplinary program combines building a solid fundamental foundation in biological science and engineering, developing diverse communication skills and providing training in the most advanced quantitative bioengineering research. The result is a rigorous, but exceptio nally interactive and welcoming educational training for Bioengineering students leading towards B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. The following mission statement was reviewed and approved by the Bioengineering Advisory Board in May 2007 30 The mission of the new ly formed Department of Bioengineering at the University of California, Riverside focuses on two interrelated themes: Advancing Bioengineering research, particularly in BioCellular Engineering, and, Preparing future leadership in Bioengineering and relat ed fields. The next meeting of the Advisory Board, July 2011, suggested the following slight modification that was approved by the faculty Advancing Bioengineering research, particularly in cellular, molecular, and tissue systems and in -silico models and, Building future leaders in Bioengineering and related fields. The Bioengineering Department Mission Statement is po sted on the Bioengineering web s ite, http://www.bioeng.ucr.edu/index.php?content=events/ABET.html B. Program Educational Objectives The Department of Bioengineering program Educational Objectives listed below are published in the UCR Catalog of courses and on our web site http://www.bioeng.ucr.edu/index.php?content=events/ABET.html Table 9. Program Educational Objectives shows the Program Educational O bjectives . Table 9. Program Educational Objectives Program Educational Objectives The Bioengineering program is to produce graduates who : 1. Have a strong foundation to apply science, engineering and biological principles to meet the challenges at the interface of engineering, life sciences, and medicine. 2. Have the capability to pursue graduate studies, careers in the medical device or biotechnology industries, or entry into medical or other health related professional schools. 3. Are effective working professionally as individuals and in teams and can co mmunicate effectively to integrate contributions from multiple disciplines to address biological and medical problems 4. Have an appreciation of and sensitivity to a broad range of ethical and social concerns related to bioengineering C. Consistency of the Program Educational Objectives with the Mission of the Institution The mission of the Bourns College of Engineering is inherently broader than the goals of the Bioengineering Department since the College's missi on includes it s graduate programs and several centers. Bioengineering Departmental PEOs are focused on the undergraduate program. Table 10 compares several of the mission elements for the Bourns College of Engineering with the PEOs of the Department of Engineering. Although the Mission Statements for the College 31 are somewhat broader in scope they certainly encompass the PEOs for the Bioengineering program . Table 10. Relationship o f the College and Departmental mission e lements Bourns College of Engineering Mission Statements Department of Bioengineering Program Educational Objectives Produce engineers with the educational foundation and adaptive skills to serve rapidly evolving technology industries; 1.

Provide diverse curricula that will instill in our students the imagination, talents, creativity, and skills necessary for the varied and rapidly changing requirements of modern life; 4. Have an appreciation of and sensitivity to a broad range of ethical and social concerns related to bioengineering. D. Program Constituencies The Department of Bioengineering faculty considered the appropriate constituencies for the undergraduate progr am in 2007. In discussion with the Advisory Board in 2007 the key significant constituencies of the Bioengineering program were determined to be the following: 1. The s tudents enrolled in the program 2. The faculty and staff responsible for delivering the program 3. The various organizations that are associated with the graduates of our program (e.g, industrial/government/academic/higher education organizations ) 4. Graduates of our program Students during their enrollment in the program benefit from a foundation in science, engineering and biological principles that will provide them with employment opportunities post-graduation. The faculty of the Department benefit from the capability of these students to participate in individual research projects. As mentioned earlier, about half of our junior/senior cohort carries out an individual research project with a faculty member. Organizations that employ our students benefit from their ability to work in teams and communicate effectively. The graduates of our program have intense and broad capabilities in a variety of technical areas, but very importantly, they are able to apply the ir technical knowledge in a socially responsible way. 32 Table 11 below maps how t he Bioengineering program Educational Objectives meet the needs of the various constituencies of the Bioengineering program as determined in a March 2012 faculty meeting .

Process for Revision of the Program Educational Objectives This is the firs t review of the Bioengineering program , thus there are no changes in the Program Educational Objectives to report since the last review. The constituencies involved in the review of the PEOs are the departmental faculty, alumni of the program, Departmental Advisory Board, and employers of our graduates. During the start -up period of the Department of Bioengineering the following Program Educational Objectives were formulated by the Department faculty and the Departmental Advisory Committee in April 2007. These PEOs were publish ed in the UC Riverside 2008- 2009 General Catalog . The objective of the bioengineering (undergraduate) program is to produce graduates who: 1. have life- long learning skills that maintain their high level of professional competence, 2. have the skills to apply engineering and biological principles to meet the challenges of this rapidly evolving field, 3. be prepared for advanced postgraduate training in bioengineering and biomedical allied fields . Subsequently , as the Department matured and a new Dean was appoint ed, we reformulated our PEOs to be in concert with the goals of the Bourns College of Engineering. This refinement of our PEO s was formulated by t he Bioengineering faculty in 2008 our new statement of 33 Bioengineering program Educational Objectives was publi shed in the UC Rivers ide 2009- 2010 General Catalog. During the recent meeting of the Bioengineering Board of Advisors in July 2011, these PEOs were reviewed and approved as listed below. 1. Have a strong foundation to apply science, engineering and biological principles to meet the challenges at the interface of engineering, life sciences, and medicine. 2. Have the capability to pursue graduate studies, careers in the medical device or biotechnology industries, or entry into medical or other health related profes sional schools. 3. Are effective working professionally as individuals and in teams and can communicate effectively to integrate contributions from multiple disciplines to address biological and medical problems. 4. Have an appreciation of and sensitivity to a broad range of ethical and social concerns related to bioengineering. Our process for revision of the PEOs in the future will involve obtaining input from alumni, Bioengineering Advisory Board and employers of our students. This information will be discuss ed at a Bioengineering faculty meeting, and a revision in the PEOs will be made if the faculty determines it is necessary. This year we obtained input from Bioengineering alumni and employers via a survey , outlined in Table 12. In March , 2012, bioengineering alumni were surveyed concerning these PEOs . The survey was sent to all of the bioengineering alumni and 75 students, and 31 responded. Overall our alumni are satisfied that our undergraduate program has prepared them to meet the targets stated in the Program Educational Objectives . Table 12. Survey for Bioengineering a lumni The department of Bioengineering has established several objecti ves to serve as a base for your future career. We would like to know how well the undergraduate program prepared you to meet these goals. Please rate on a scale of one to five; five being very well, and one being minimally.

Faculty review ed and evaluated the three assessments - alumni survey, workplace surve y, and Advisory Board comments at a faculty meeting in May 2012 and came to the conclusion that no revisions in the PEOs were required at this time. The next review will be in three years. We realize that it is difficult to obtain feedback from employers of our students. So in the future we will increase the number of industrial representatives on our Advisory Board and discuss with them how well our graduates are meeting our PEO's and any suggested changes in our PEOs. 35 CRITERION 3.

CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT A. Program Educational Objectives Assessment Process The general approach for our continuous improvement process is illustrated in Figure 9 . Basically the process starts with the key inputs for the program to satisfy - namely the ABET Student Outcomes combined with the ABET Bioengineering program Criteria - and ends with the Curriculum Plan and the individual Course Syllabi. The assessment process for Program Educational Objectives consists of data collection from four sources listed in Table 14 . Table 14. Dates of Data Collection of Constituents Input Dates A.

Continuous improvement process 39 The planned frequency with whic h these assessment processes will be carried out is every three years. However we have just started this cycle of complete assessment for our Continuous Improvement Program. Soon after our Bioengineering program was established we formulated tentative Program Educational Objectives for the program with input from our Departmental Advisory Board. These initial PEOs listed below were published in the UCR Course Catalog for the 2006- 2007 academic year. The objective of the Bioengineering program is to produce graduates who: 1. Have life- long learning skills that maintain their high level of professional competence, 2. Have the skills to apply engineering and biological principles to meet the challenges of this rapidly evolving field, 3. Be prepared for advanced postgraduate training in bioengineeri ng and biomedical allied fields. Subsequently through discussions at faculty meetings and Advisory Board meetings , these PEOs were modified to be more consistent with the mission of the Department and College. The modified PEOs were published in the UCR Catalog for the aca demic year 2009 -2010. 1. Have a strong foundation to apply science, engineering and biological principles to meet the challenges at the interface of engineering, life sciences, and medicine. 2. Have the capability to pursue graduate studies, careers in the medical device or biotechnology industries, or entry into medical or other health related professional schools. 3. Are effective working professionally as individuals and in teams and can communi cate effectively to integrate contributions from multiple disciplines to address biological and medical problems. 4. Have an appreciation of and sensitivity to a broad range of ethical and social concerns related to bioengineering. Since the PEOs are targeted to the performance of graduates several years post-graduation , we waited on surveying our alumni until there were a sufficient number of alumni with several years of post-graduate experience. Our first alumni s urvey was conducted this year. We believe th at this is a successful survey as 35 of a total of 75 graduates responded. In addition this year we surveyed t he employers of our graduates. Frequency of Assessment Thus we have now started a successful cycle of including input from all four of our constituencies for the assessment and continuous improvement of our Program Educational Objectives. 40 Level of Attainment Our intention is to continue surveying our graduates at three year intervals. The surveys have a scoring system of 5= very well and 1=minimally. Based on discussions at our faculty meetings, the Bioengineering Faculty decided that a score of 3.5 or better was the expected level of attainment for the program . B. Results of the Evaluation P rocesses We have sent surveys to graduates of our program and their workplace supervisors. C. Survey of Alumni (See Appendix F) Table 12 shows the summary of this survey for March, 2012 with respect to the PEOs for the program . D. Workplace Sur vey of Bioengineering Graduates Although we have be en successful in maintaining contact information for our alumni, we have not been as fortunate in maintaining their workplace information. We plan to improve our interaction with our alumni through interactive networking and thus have better information on their employment situation. This year our survey was sent to 10 ins titutions, eight from academia and two from industry. Usefu l responses were obtained from four in academic institutions . Workplace Questionnaire The results of the workplace questionnaire are shown in T able 15. Table 15. Results for Workplace Survey \"We would like to have your evaluation of our how our students are meeting the objectives of our undergraduate progra m and, if needed, how we might implement improvements.

These are shown here. PEO 1 30% of our graduates belong to professional societies 60% read professional journals, 20% collaborated on projects related to intellectual property 30% received awards PEO 2 40% of the respondents were in graduate program s 13% in related professional programs 26% were in a bio -related industry 30% received awards 20% have received a post -graduate degree. PEO 3 60% of the graduates had successfully worked in teams and had supervisory responsibilities From the Workplace ( Employer ) Survey PEO 4 All respondents indic ated that our graduates were sensitive to social and ethical issues. For example: \"No doubt, the diverse training in bioengineering at UCR was very helpful for them to see a wide range of areas in the discipline.\" \"The results of these surveys were review ed by Bioengineering Advisory Committee who consider ed the response from alumni and the workplace of alumni to be ve ry satisfactory. \" \"The input from three constituencies alumni of our program , workplace of alumni, and Bioengineering Advisory Committee on the Bioengineering program Engineering Objectives were evaluated by the Bioengineering Faculty at a faculty meeting. \" \"The conclusion of this evaluation by the faculty was that our students are making satisfactory progress in m eeting the Bioengineering PEO's and no further changes are needed at this time. \" Documentation and Maintenance of R esults. Surveys are carried out using the web program called SurveyMonkey. The survey text and results are maintained by the Dean's Office of the College of Engineeri ng and are available for inspection of the College of Engineering Intranet site. 42 E. Student Outcomes Student Outcome A ssessment Process and F requency Student Outcomes are assessed by four methods as illustrated in Table 16. Table 16. Student outcome assessment process and frequency Assessment Methods Frequency Evaluation A. Individual course measures Annually Course Instructors B. Departmental administered senior surveys before graduation Annually Department Faculty C. College administered EBI survey at graduation Annually Department Faculty Advisory Board D. Departmental administered alumni survey Every three years Department Faculty Advisory Board Three methods (B, C, and D) are based on surveys. Even though these assessments provide numerical results, they are somewhat subjective in character as they do not provide direct actionabl e indications for improvement. Thus two years ago we decided to initiate Method A that involves individual assessments of each course by the instructor on an annual basis. This assessment method turned out to be very effort intensive as it required the instructor to gather data for all students in the class for each of the specific illustrative exercises . In the future we plan to select a fewer number of courses for the evaluation of each of the Student Outcomes by Method A. Examples o f Data Collection for Each Assessment M ethod Method A Each required course in the Bioengineering Department is assigned one or more of the student outcomes to cover during the course. These initial Student Outcomes C ourse Assignments are outlined in the matrix below. The assignment of Student Outcomes to s pecific courses was determined by the faculty after the curriculum was taught for a few years ). Then each faculty member selected which of Student Outcome was ad dressed in his or her courses. These preliminary assignments were discussed at a faculty retreat and the following prim ary assignments were selected. Subsequently, as noted below, this year we have examined each course to review specific student work related to Student Outcomes. Based on this evaluation, some of the Student Outcome assignments to certain courses will be modified. 43 Table 17. Mapping of Student Outcomes to required Bioengineering c ourses Student Outcomes (SO) a b c d e f g h i j k BIEN 10 Overview BIEN 105 Circulation Physiology BIEN 110 BioMechanics BIEN 115 Quantitative Physilogy BIEN 120 Signals and Systems BIEN 125 Biotechnology BIEN 130 Bioinstrumentation BIEN 130L Bioinstrumentation Lab BIEN 135 Biophysics and Thermodynamics BIEN 140 A Biomaterials BIEN 155 Biotechnology Lab BIEN 159 Dynamics of Biological Systems BIEN 175 A,B Senior Design We have a Faculty Course Appraisal Form (FCAR) for each of the courses. In the FCAR each faculty member (instructor) designates certain course elements (exam questions, homework questions, projects, reports, etc .) that are related to the SOs, and student performance and grades for these element s are assembled for the assessment and evaluation. For each of these items , each time the course is offered all the student grades are evaluated and the instructor rates the performance of the class. Then each of those items from all the courses are collected and sorted according to Student Outcome. For example, for Student Outcome (a) examples of student work was collected from the following Bioengineering courses: 105, 110, 115, 125, 130, 130L, 135, 140A, and 159. This collection of student work is eval uated by a Bioengineering faculty member and a report written for SO (a) as illustrated in Table 18. Table 18. Example of process for e valuation of Student Outcome (a) Evaluation of Student Outcome (a). (a) an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science (including biology and physiology (PC1)), and engineering Several core Bioengineering courses provide students with instruction that meets the characteristics of this required student capability. In order to illustrate the range of materials and concepts that students were exposed to in our program we selected a few examples of student work that shows the depth and bre adth of student abilities to apply these fundamental principles. BIEN 130L - Bioinstrumentation Laboratory Hands -on utilization of biomedical instruments is a focus of this course. Students are required 44 Table 18. Example of process for e valuation of Student Outcome (a) to assemble instrument s and evaluate their behavior. An example report from a student illustrates the in depth discussion of the circuitry of an electrocardiogram device and the thorough analysis of measurements made on a person. 63% of the students performed satisfactorily i n this experiment. BIEN 135 - Biophysics and Biothermodynamics The fundamental principles of free energy considerations are applied to protein structur e and function in this course. This homework example challenges the students to predict protein structur al changes caused by hypothetical mutations of various amino acids. 92% of the students were able to able to satisfactorily apply thermodynamic principles to this situation. BIEN 140A - Biomaterials This course emphasizes the importance of certain chemical/biophysical properties of materials that tend to determine their behavior when placed in a biological milieu. One of the key materials often overlooked in discussing biomaterial behavior is the ubiquitous solvent - water. In this quiz students were challenged to show how the unique properties of water distinguish this solvent from others. 67% of the students were able to answer these questions satisfactorily. BIEN 159 - Dynamics of Biological System s This course focuses on the modeling of kinetic behavior of biological systems. These particular exam questions challenge the students to explain oxygen binding to various proteins (such as hemoglobin) and how those binding characteristics affect oxygen exchange in the body. 54% of the students were able to answer these questions satisfactorily. SUMMARY Overall students in the Bioengineering program satisfactorily meet the Criteria (a) of Student Outcomes. The departmental goal is for at least 70% of the students to reach the level of satisfactory performance in the Student Outcome Criteria. Although we m eet our goal if one averages student performance in the examples quoted above , there are some spots that will need attention in the future. In particular we will place emphasis on providing students more thorough lecture material in BIEN 130L (Bioinstrumentation Laboratory) , BIEN 140A (Biomaterials) , and BIEN 159 (Dynamics of Biological Systems) to enhance their performance. This will be implemented in the 2012- 2013 academic year . 45 Similar reports are assembled for a ll the other Student Outcomes. These reports are collected in Appendix E . All the faculty reports for each of the Student Outcomes are then reviewed and evaluated by the Bioengineering faculty at a retreat. If remedial action is indicated that information is provided to the course instructors to implement the next time the course is taught. In addition each bioengineering course has designated Course Learning Objectives that relate to the Student Outcomes. The Course Objectives for each bioengineering course are given in Appendix A along with the syllabus f or each course. An example of the Course Objective s for BIEN 105 Circulation Physiology is shown in Table 19. Table 19. Example of Course Objectives for BIEN 105 Circulation Physiology i. You will be able to understand the basic governing momentum conservation equations and associated basic constitutive equations for describing biofluid processes. ii. You will be able to apply these governing equations to real biological systems and descr ibe these systems mathematically, develop strategies to analyze the biofluid problem, recognize particular behavior of real processes, and recognize limitations in approximating the process. iii. You will have developed an ability to utilize practical and mathematical tools, an ability to logically think through biomechanical problems from conception to design, and be familiar with the relative significance of your results. iv. You will have had opportunities to further your professional development t hrough practicing written and oral communication skills, working on group assignments, and using modern computer tools. v. You will demonstrate confidence in assessing and developing basic mathematical/computational models of biomechanical problems. vi. AND, you will demonstrate professional accountability for your engineering design analysis. In addition there is an assessment of senior project presentations . Method B The second assessment tool for Student Outcomes is a Senior Survey. The survey is shown below along with the student responses for the last four years. This survey is carried out every year. The expected level of attainment is 3.5. and Figure 10 summarize these outcomes for the last four years. 46 Table 20.

This survey is required of all engineering graduating seniors and is administered b y the Office of Student Affairs . The responses are coded by program. EBI has associated several of its questions to the ABET (a) through (k) Student Outcomes. Using the algorithm produced by EBI we assembled the responses of the graduating seniors in a manne r similar to our Senior Survey. In particular, the EBI survey scores on a basis of 1 to 7, where as ou r Senior Survey (and Alumni Survey) score on a basis of 1 to 5. Therefore we scaled the EBI results to a range of 1 to 5. The results are show n in Figure 11. Senior Survey 00.511.522.533.544.55 a b c d e f g h i j k ABE T Student OutcomesSatisfaction Value 5=Best2009 2010 2011 2012 Figure 8.

Since we are a new program, this is the first year this survey has been conducted. The results of this recent survey are shown in Table 21. The entire Alumni Survey r esults are given in Appendix F . Even though Student Outcomes are targeted for students at graduation, we wanted to get additional feedback from our alumni on their perception of the preparation provided by the undergraduate program.

The three student surveys (Methods B, C, and D ) indicated that from the point of view of the students and alumni that the Departmental Bioengineering program is satisfactorily meeting the level of attainment (3.5) specified. However the faculty made an in depth review of the specific examples of student work in each of these Student O utcom e areas. A summary of faculty review of student performance (Method A ) showed that we can enhance our program in several areas as described below. The suggested improvements will be initiated in the 2012 -2013 AY. Faculty Retreat - Summar ies of Proposed Action s Related to Student Outcomes Student Outcome (a) An ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering (including biology and physiology (PC1)) . Summary Overall students in the Bioengineering program satisfactorily meet the Cri teria (a) of Student Outcomes. The departmental goal is for at least 70% of the students to reach the level of satisfactory performance in the Student Outcome Criteria. Although we meet our goal if one averages student performance in the examples quoted above, there are some spots that will need attention in the future. Action Plan In particular we will place emphasis on providing enhanced lecture materials for BIEN 130L (Bioinstrumentation Laboratory) , BIEN 140A (Biomaterials) , and BIEN 159 (Dynamics of Biological Systems). Student Outcome (b) An ability to design and conduct experiments, make measurements, analyze and interpret data from living systems addressing the problems associated with the interaction between living and non-living materials and systems. Summary Seven courses, BIEN 115 (Quantitative Physiology), BIEN 125 (Biotechnology), BIEN 130 (Bioinstrumentation), BIEN 140A (Biomaterials), BIEN 155 (Biotechnology Lab), BIEN 159 (Dynamics of Biological Systems), and BIEN 175 (Senior Design) i nclude components that contribute to this SO. Action Plan In particular, s tudents show proficiency in interpreting data from living systems in BIEN 130 (Bioinstrumentation). They show proficiency in designing and conducting experiments with living systems in BIEN 155 (Biotechnology Laboratory). 50 Student Outcome (c) An ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability Summary The following courses are listed as contributing to Student Outcome (c) : BIEN 120, BIEN 130, BIEN 130L, BIEN 155, and BIEN 175 (course titles are shown below). The examples given for BIEN 120, BIEN 130, BIEN 130L and BIEN 175 clearly provide support for demonstrating that the program meets this Student O utcome. The example for BIEN 155 did not clearly meet the objectives for this Student O utcome based on the example given. BIEN 120 Signals and Systems A term -long project to design a feedback control of a student prescribed process relevant to bioengineering. The control system design is analyzed within the limits of the process. The design project has an objective and considers a realistic project. The students are asked to consider limitations. BIEN 130 Bioinstrumentation A question on final exam asking to design iron suit armor to respond to various signals from the user. The students must design within limits of available equipment and pricing. A well-defined question that requires students to design a specific device within economic and part -availability limitations. BIEN 130L Bioinstrumentation Lab A lab to acquire ECG signals from a human subject. An important lab where the students are requi red to design a circuit to measure ECG signals. BIEN 155 Biotechnology Lab A lab to conduct recombinant fluorescence protein production. Although an important lab, the students need only follow instruction and provide no design components. Remove . BIEN 1 75 Senior Design A two -term project to design and build a device for specific applications with an economic, health and safety constraint. Action Plan The program is strong with respect to Student Outcome (c). It is recommended that BIEN 155 be removed from the list of courses that demonstrate proficiency in this Student O utcome. Student Outcome (d) An ability to function on multi disciplinary teams Summary The examples provided clearly demonstrate the ability of our students to work in teams on projects of a multidisciplinary nature. However, they do little with regard to demonstrating an 51 ability to work in teams composed of people with a background in different academic disciplines. Action Plan The mult idisciplinary team experience is currently being addressed through the recent integration of business students and material into our Senior Design course ( BIEN 175A ) in the current 2011- 2012 AY . Develop a more direct assessment of SO ( d) in the future. While it is difficult to imagine a truly objective method for doing so, a subjective measure can made through student feedback specifically asking to assess their ability to work in i) teams ii) of a multidisciplinary nature. Student Outcome (e) An ability to identify, formulate, and apply advanced mathematics, science, and engineering to solve problems at the interface of engineering and biology. (PC2) Summary In the following courses our undergradua te students have demonstrated ability to combine advanced mathematics, science, and engineering to solve bioengineering problems: BIEN 105 (Circulation Physiology) , BIEN 110 (BioMechanics) , BIEN 115 (Quantitative Physiology) , BIEN 120 (Signals and Systems) , BIEN 130 (Bioinstrumentation) , BIEN 135 (Biophysics and Thermodynamics) , and BIEN 140A (Biomaterials) . The assessments show that most of the students have met the performance standard in these classes. Action Plan Based on the presented course material, t he following recommendations wil l be implemented to strengthen SO (e) in our program: (i) Increase experimental and data analysis content. Emphasize statistical analysis of experimental data. (ii) Increase bioimaging and medical content. Student Outcome (f) An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility Summary Primary courses BIEN 10 (Overview) and BIEN 140A (Biomaterials). Action Plan Overall, SO Criterion (f) needs to be stressed more in other courses, for example, in courses related to drug development, tissue engineering, etc Student Outcome (g ) An ability to communicate effectively 52 Summary Primary courses BIEN 10 (Overview), BIEN 105 (Circulation Physiology) , BIEN 120 (Signals and Systems) , BIEN 1 30L (Bioinstrumentation Lab ). These courses require group projec ts involving several students. Students are required to write comprehens ive reports on their projects. Also , they make present ations that evaluated for effectiveness. Overall student performance is very good. Action Plan No changes needed . Student Outcome (h) Awareness of the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context Summary In a range of courses (BIEN 120 Signals and Systems, and 159 Dynamics of Biological Systems ), our undergraduate students have demonstrated the use of engineering solutions in an economic and societal context. For example, in BIEN125, students learned to compare a few approaches to characterize engineering protein products in an economic and soci etal context, which is, considering the cost of labor and time for each approach when making a decision on choice of engineering solution. The environmental and global context is less evident for both courses. The assessments show that most of the student s (75%) have met the performance standard for BIEN 120, and 54% met the performance standard for BIEN 159. Action Plan Based on the presented course materials, the following recommendations will strengthen SO (h) in our program . (i) Widen the courses involving economic and societal context. Out of the two courses providing SO (h), only one showed obvious economic and societal context. We need t o develop more course material for SO (h). An introduction level presentation on \"Engineering Ethics and Impacts on Global, Economic, Environmental, and Societal Context\" will be beneficial. (ii) Demonstrating the global and environmental context. None courses targeted to cover this item had sufficient material to satisfy this Student O utcome. More course material needs to be provided to demonstrate global and environmental context. Again, an introduction level \"Engineering Ethics and Impacts on Global, Economic, Environmental, and Societal Context\" w ill be added. Student Outcome (i) A recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life -long learning 53 Summary Review of student work in this area indicated that much more effort needs to be devoted to this topic. Action Plan (i) Introduce examples in the cognitive domain (analysis) that represent students' mastery of the skills as lifelong learners. An example from BIEN10 (Overview) course showing analysis of new information, concept, etc. by breaking it down, comparing and contra sting, recognizing patterns, interpreting information, etc. as appropriate. BIEN140A (Biomaterials) can include examples of students' skills to access information from variety of sources, to assess the quality of informat ion and categorize/classify it. Include courses at an upper level that provide our students' skills to model, simplify, approximate, make and recognize assumptions as well as inquiring. (ii) Expand examples in the affective domain (attitudes and values) that represent students' development into the lifelong learners. The development of the skills in the cognitive domain depends on the attitudes and values of the learners and our program will overall benefit from students gaining competence in the affective domain, which directs behaviors. Example exercises will introduce the theory and practice of engineering ethics using a multidisciplinary and cross -cultural approach focusing on sciences and engineering case stu dies. This will introduce the professional attitudes and ethical values to hel p students recognize the need for lifelong learning beyond their engineering degree. Student Outcome (j) A knowledge of contemporary issues Summary This outcome is an important criterion for the B.S. degree in Bioengineering. The awareness of contemporary issues will not only make students more motivated but also clues for their future career and responsibilities. Many courses can contribute to this Student O utcome. The example should come from higher level knowledge, other than a very specific examp le for a specific issue. Action Plan We will to select at least one course from each category to enhance this Student O utcome, e.g. BIEN125 (Biotechnology) , and BIEN135 (Biophysics and Thermodynamics) . This emphasis will also make students aware of scientific and social issues in various disciplines to their studies as bioengineering and their future careers. Student Outcome (k) An ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice 54 Summary In a range of courses our undergraduate students have demonstrated the use of theoretical (e.g., BIEN 135), computational (e.g., BIEN 105) and experimental (e .g., BIEN 155) skills for bioengineering at various scales: i.e., from protein engineering (e.g., BIEN 155) to device engineering (BIEN 175). The assessments show that most of the students have met the performance standard for all classes. Action Plan Based on the presented materials course materials, the fol lowing recommendations will strengthen SO (k) in our program: (i) Widen the courses involving experimental skills. Out of the ten courses providing SO (k) only three involve the use of hands -on experimental skills. Concurrently, all of the ten courses involve the use of theoretical or computational abilities. (ii) Demonstrating the use of statistics. According to P rogram Criteria for Bioengineering, \"The program must prepare graduates to have: an understanding of biology and physiology, and the capability to apply advanced mathematics (including differential equations and statistics), science, and engineering to sol ve the problems at the interface of engineering and biology.\" Having enough biology and physiology courses suffices to satisfy some of the program criteria. Regarding advanced math and statistics, however, the students have to demonstrate the use of these skills via SO (k). The lab courses are the best for allowing students to demonstrate skills in statistics (and just placing error bars will not be sufficient). Documentation The results of these reviews are documented and maintained in Course Note books and Departmental minutes. F. Continuous Improvement Continuous improvement of the Bioengineering program is implemented in several way s. Continuous improvement related to the Program Educational Objectives is implemented in the following manner. First the content of the PEOs are discussed in faculty meetings and with input from the Advisory Board. This has occurred over a 3- 4 year period and resulted in a change in the content of the PEOs. Assessment of the extent that our students meet the PEOs is obtained by a survey of our alumni, particularly those who have significant post -graduate experience. Since we are a new program the first alumni survey was held this year. The results of the recent survey of alum ni (given above in Section A) showed that our alumni are satisfied that our undergraduate curriculum prepared them to meet the PEOs. This information was discussed at a faculty meeting and it was decided that remedial action is not required at this time. We will also solicit input from employers of our students to obtain further feedback concerning the PEOs. 55 Continuous improvement of the Student Outcomes occurs through several modes. First, and very importantly, a Course Notebook is maintained by each facul ty member for each course over the last two years . The Course Notebook contains the following information (also know n as the Faculty Course Assessment Report) shown in Table 2 2. These Course Notebooks contain examples of student work that demonstrate how w ell the students are meeting the Course Learning Objectives, and Student Outcomes. 56 Faculty Course Assessment Report Template Date of Preparation: Course: Academic Term: Textbooks/Required Material: Final Grade Distribution: Course Learning Outcomes: FACULTY ASSESSMENT \"Assignment\" can be homework, exam question, term paper, presentation, etc. Course Learning Outcomes FACULTY EXPECTATIONS Assessment Method Average Score Performance Standard % Meeting Standard STUDENT ASSESSMENT BY SURVEY Course Learning Outcomes STUDENT ASSESSMENT Score: Strongly Agree = 5, Agree = 4, Neutral = 3, Disagree = 2, Strongly Disagree = 1 Avg.

Mark Saltzman, Cambridge University Press, ISBN:978 -0-521-84099- 6. SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENT RESULTS FOR THIS QUARTER : The Pass/Fail structure of this course does not allow an appropriate structure for assessment. PROPOSED ACTIONS FOR COURSE IMPROVEMENT : This course has been changed to a Letter Grade course so as to motivate students to focus on course material. PERSON(S) WHO PREPARED THIS DESCRIPTION Victor G. J. Rodgers AND DATE OF PREPARATION: July 20, 2010 Other important contributions to the continuous improvement of Student Outcomes are the various surveys reviewed above. Evaluation of these various s ources of information has le d to several changes in the program over the past few years. All technical el ectives are engineering courses. Two years ago, the technical elective requirement was changed from allowing chemistry and biology courses as technical electives to only engineering courses. Thus we have worked with the other engineering departments to sel ect a suite of technical elective courses that would be open to Bioengineering students. This required approval from the instructors of these courses to allow Bioengineering student to take their courses using bioengineering courses to satisfy the prerequi sites. In several of the surveys students commented on a desire to have several in depth courses to supplement the general overview of bioengineering topics provided in the core curriculum. Also, our recent review has indicated that more emphasis needs to be placed on ethical and social issues. We will make adjustments in our core courses in the future for these topics. G. Additional Information Course Notebooks and departmental meeting m inutes will be made available at the visit. 58 CRITERION 5. CURRICULUM A.

In the freshman and sophomore years students receive a comprehensive background in the basic sciences and mathematics. In particular they take two cours es in biology and organic chemistry to prepare for the departmental core courses . The bioengineering core courses provide students with a thorough understanding of biomechanics, fluid mechanics, systems analysis, bioinstrumentation, biotechnology, biomater ials, model building, and thermodynamics . Students are required to take four technical electives to provide further brea dth and depth related to their areas of interest. For example a student interested in biomaterials could elect BIEN 140B Biomaterials which is a follow -up to the required BIEN 140A Biomaterials UCR .A student interested in imaging could elect BIEN 160 Medical Imaging. All students are required to ta ke BIEN 175 A&B Senior Design. Here they work in teams to formulate and execute a prototype design. Mapping of the bioengineering courses to Student Outcomes was presented above in under Criterion 4, in 63 Table 17, which is repeated here for convenience. The darkened locations indicate which courses contribute to a specific Student Outcome. Table 17.

Program R equirements in Math and Basic Sciences, Engineering Topics, and General Education Over the p ast few years we have been fine- tuning our curriculum to meet our Educational Objectives (Table 27) . Biology 5C was dropped as a requirement in 2008 because it deals mainly with evolution and ecology that are not particularly relevant to bioengineering. Biochemistry Laboratory 102 was substituted for Biochemistry 101 in 2008 because of changes in the prerequisite s. Biology 171 (Physiology) was added in 2008 because of ABET's requirement for physiology in the Bioengineering Program Criteria (PC1). It was then learned that ABET require s engineering analysis in physiology. For this reason we developed BIEN 115 - Quan titative Physiology to meet the PC1 requirement. This course was offered for the first time in the 2009- 2010 AY. In AY 2007 and 2008 we found that some students were electing advanced biology courses as their technical electives. Although these courses enhanced the student's capabilities in biology they would not meet the minimum ABET Engineering Topics requirement of 72 units. Thus we have made it mandatory that students elect engineering courses for their technical el ectives. We also created several addit ional Bioengineering elective courses such as BIEN 160 Biomedical Imaging and BIEN 165 Biomolecular Engineering to provide further depth in bioengineering subjects . In addition we contacted other engineering departments to develop a list of courses that wo uld be open to our students as technical electives (listed below). 64 Table 26.

In AY 2008 ME 10 Statics was deleted from the program because the needed material was incorporated into BIEN 110 Biomechanics of the Human Body. 65 Table 27. Evolution of B.S.

Faculty Qualifications The Bioengineering faculty is now comprised of 11 individuals , all of whom have Ph.D .s in fields that include engineer ing, chemist ry, physics, and biolog y (Table 29. Bioengineering faculty qualifications . The diverse expertise of our faculty in science and engineering allows us to capitalize these capabilitie s in our teaching assignments. For example the biological based courses are taught by Prof. Liao a molecular biologist, and the thermodynamics course is taught by Prof. Morikis, a biophysicist. Four of our f aculty are members of the American Institute of Biological and Medical Engineering and Fellows of AAAS. One individual is a member of the National Academy of Engineering. All of our faculty members belong to technical societies such as the Biomedical Engineering Society, American Chemical Society, American Institute of Chemical Engineering, and Materials Research Society. Various faculty have funding from major institutions such as NSF and NIH. As can be seen in Appendix B all of our faculty have extensive publications in major scientific and professional journals. Several of our faculty have industrial experience - Profs. Liao, Liu, Park, Rodgers, Schultz, and Vullev. 71 Table 29.

The level of activity (high, medium or low ) should reflect an average over the year prior to the visit plus the two previous years. 72 B. Faculty Workload Typically full time senior faculty is expected to teach four courses throughout the academic year. This is a combination of undergraduate and graduate courses. Thus although fewer than four courses are listed in Table 30 (EAC Self -Study Table 6- 2) for some of the faculty, some are given course relief for major administrative duties. Research and professional service account for the balance of faculty effort. The entire faculty listed has 100% full -time appointments in the Department of Bioengineering. Table 30.

Faculty Size The current faculty size in the Department of Bioengineering is 11 individuals . This year we are recruiting an additional person that will bring out total to 12. In addition to faculty with engineering degrees, some of the bioengineering faculty has degrees in chemistry, biology, biophysics, physic s, and material science. All of our faculty teach at least one undergraduate course, thus providing undergraduates with a wide diversity of faculty backgrounds. Most of the faculty sponsor undergraduates in research projects; many of our undergraduates have publications in scientific journals before finishing their program. Each of our faculty members is available for student advising and counseling on an as needed basis. In addition students are required to meet with faculty to discuss their progress in the program at least once a year. Our faculty serves on a variety of College and University committees including the College Executive Committee, laser safety committee, Stem Cell Center Advisory Committee, University Wellness Committee , UC Biophotonics Committee, and UC Systemwide Bioengineering Committee. Our faculty has served as symposium organizers for the American Chemical Society, American Institute of Chemical Engineers, Biomedical Engineering Society, and Gordon Conferences. D. Professional Developme nt All faculty members are expected to be active in research and professional activity throughout their careers. It is common for new faculty hires to have money in their initial complements for travel to meetings of professional societies or other schola rly events. Later in their careers, grant funding typically supports the cost of travel to meetings and conferences, where they share research results. The departments and degree programs cooperate to present lecture series every academic year. These seri es bring faculty candidates and distinguished guests from academia or industry to campus. Faculty and students attend these sessions. Intramurally, professional development opportunities include workshops on teaching skills, interpersonal skills, and other matters. State law and University policy also require training in sexual harassment prevention, laboratory safety, and other matters. For the past few years, the National Science Foundation has required grantees to provide training in responsible conduct of research (RCR) to all trainees who are paid on NSF grants. In response, UCR and the College have established training resources including an on- line tutorial, and departments are encouraged to include topics in research ethics and engineering ethics in their lecture series and courses. By being required to train their students in RCR, faculty members continually refresh themselves in this subject area. Similarly, NSF requires postdoctoral trainees who are supported by its grants to be mentored by their faculty advisors so they can become independent investigators. This mentoring takes many forms but requires faculty members to maintain their skills as mentors. 74 E. Authority and Responsibility of Faculty All program issues are initiated by the Departmental faculty. Many of the faculty devise new courses as technical electives based on their research expertise. Changes in program must be approved by a vote of the Departmental faculty and also the Executive Committee of the College of Engineering as depicted i n the chart below. The process for program approval is shown in Figure 10. Process for obtaining academic approval for program and course changes Figure 10. Process for obtaining academic approval for program and course c hanges The Bioengineering f aculty have the primary responsibility for the development , initiation and implementation the continuous improvement processes in our program below ( repeated for convenience) shows the three primary roles f or faculty - namely revision of course learning outcomes, Program Educational Objectives, curriculum plan, and course syllabi.

Campus -wide support, services , and facilities are provided by Computing and Communications (C&C) and managed by full -time professional staff. 2. The College, through its programs of Chemical/Environmental Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechani cal Engineering, and its Research units also provide a variety of technical services and support. Details of these support, services, and facilities are listed in Appendix I : Other Services and Support CENIC Regional Higher Education Network o C&C provides support and maintenance of off -campus network access via connections to the CENIC regional higher education network. All Bourns College of Engineering computing facilities and faculty have high -speed access to CENIC members (e.g. other UC campuses, private research universities in California, the California State University System, etc.) and to Internet2 via C&C support of the CENIC network. C. Guidance Students are advised to take the appropriate on-line safety classes (http://www.ehs.ucr.edu/training/online/ ) from the following list: Laboratory Safety Orientation Hazardous Waste Management Laser Safety Bloodborne Pathogens Biosafety D. Maintenance and Upgrading of Facilities BCOE budgets approximately $300,000/year for instructional equipment acquisition and upgrades. These funds are allocated to BCOE academic programs on an annual request basis. In addition, most BCOE undergraduate lab courses charge a ($20- 50/student) Course Materials Fee. Per UCR policy, these fees can only be used to purchase expendable laborat ory materials and supplies including chemicals, glassware, software, computers, etc. For FY 10/11, 79 approximately $210,000 was generated in Course Materials Fees by BCOE academic programs. (NOTE: This information also applies to Criterion 8.B.3) E. Library Services The UCR Libraries have over 400 public computers among the four campus libraries with selected information resources and software to support and enhance student learning and the research and scholarship activities of the University. Specialized so ftware has been installed on the Learning Commons Computers located in Rivera Library 1st Floor, Rivera Basement, Rivera 2nd Floor, Rivera 3rd Floor, and Science Library 1st Floor. 20 wireless laptops/netbooks are available in Rivera and Science Libraries to faculty, students and staff. Library collections that support the Bourns College of Engineering are housed in the Orbach Science Library. The Orbach Science Library has a seating capacity of 1,500 including individual carrels, study tables and 25 group study rooms. The library makes available 79 computer workstations for students to use in their research and study, and another 32 computers to support information literacy instruction. The entire UCR library system provides both wired and wireless access to the internet for student laptop use, and laptops are available for check- out at the Circulation Desk. Normal library hours during the regular school year are as follows: Monday -Thursday 7:30am - 11pm Friday 7:30am 5:00pm and Sunday 1:00pm to11:00pm. The Orbach Science Library maintains a professional staff of eight librarians, all of whom provide reference and research assistance to engineering students, faculty, and staff. Of these librarians, one is assigned subject responsibility for engineering and is available to assist students, faculty and staff with in depth research questions. The Engineering Librarian and Subject Specialist also offers tutorials and classes on engineering information topics, and maintains Web pages and path- finders to assist engineering students, faculty, and staff in locating the information they need. The UCR Libraries offers a full range of reference services, including walk -up, telephone, and 24/7 e -mail reference services (Ask A Librarian) through a UC -wide and national network as well as reference by appointment. The Orbach Science Library reference desk is staffed 52 hours per week during the academic year (9am -8pm. Monday -Thursday, 9am -5pm on Friday) and 40 hours per week dur ing inter -session periods. In addition to these standard services, engineering students can receive additional reference help from other reference librarians who are assigned to the Science Information Services desk. The Engineering Librarian is available for extended consultation on Senior Design or other research projects. Incoming freshman typically receive library orientation sessions in their introductory classes. They might also have additional information literacy instruction in classes th at require independent research, such as senior design classes. One -on-one or group tutorials are available for any research topic that might be desired and helpful to engineering students. Information on Library Collections are provided in Appendix I . 80 F. Overall Comments on Facilities The Department of Bioengineering has a full time staff person (Development Engineer) who oversees the instructional and research laboratories. She insures that all laboratories and personnel meet University safety standar ds. BCOE takes community safety seriously and utilize a variety of resources and strategies to maximize our community's safety and security and protect the environment. BCOE follows the University of California Policy on Management of Health, Safety and t he Environment - a systemwide policy applied to all UC campuses. The policy has received personal commitment from the President of the University of California. University of California Poli cy on Management of Health, Safety and the Environment The University of California is committed to achieving excellence in providing a healthy and safe working environment, and to supporting environmentally sound practices in the conduct of University activities. It is University policy to comply with all applicable health, safety, and environmental protection laws, regulations and requirements. To meet this standard of excellence, the University implements management initiatives and best practices to sy stematically integrate health, safety, and environmental considerations and sustainable use of natural resources into all activities. All University activities are to be conducted in a manner that ensures the protection of students, faculty, staff, visitor s, the public, property, and the environment. The University's goal is to prevent all workplace injuries and illnesses, environmental incidents, and property losses or damage. Achieving this goal is the responsibility of every member of the University com munity. Supervisors have particular responsibility for the activities of those people who report to them. BCOE also partners closely with UCR's Office of Environmental Health & Safety, UC Police Department, Office of Risk Management, and to implement UC sa fety policies and best practices. UCR EHS uses methods developed by the systemwide Environment, Health, & Safety Leadership Council in an effort to implement the UC systemwide p olicy on management of health, safety, and the environment in order to bring safety, health, and sustainability into work practices at all levels. BCOE Safety Partners BCOE employs a full time Safety & Facilities Coordinator. This individual coordinates the facilities, health, safety, and training activities for the entire college. The Safety & Facilities Coordinator represents BCOE on the campus Research Integrated Safety Committee (RISC) and the campu s Laboratory Safety Officers group. Membership on these committees enables BCOE to stay abreast of the latest safety best practices, regulations and policies as well as allowing BCOE to plan in advance to manage special processes and potential hazards. The Safety & Facilities Coordinator also participates in UC systemwide laboratory safety conference calls and facilitates monthly meetings of the BCOE department and program Laboratory Safety Officers. 81 BCOE utilizes the many UCR Environmental Health & Safe ty's Laboratory / Research Safety program safety and compliance implementation tools, training courses, and safety guidelines for hazards found in the laboratory setting including; chemical safety, radiation safety , biological safety , field research safety, and general safety . Maintaining safe laboratorie s provides a safe and healthy environment for faculty and students to expand research ideas, develop new techniques, and master their subject matter. BCOE Laboratory Safety Officers act as their departments' safety liaisons and are the Chemical Hygiene Off icer and Hazard Communication officer for their departments. They direct and advise faculty, staff, and students on laboratory safety, the proper handling and disposal of chemicals, perform department lab safety audits, provide and document safety training , and attend both campus and college -wide Laboratory Safety Officer meetings. Safety information and best practices are shared between College departments via the BCOE Laboratory Safety Officers group. In addition to setting up instructional labs, LSOs provides course -specific laboratory safety training at the beginning of the course and as needed prior to each laboratory experiment. Documentation is managed by the LSO in concert with the department administrative staff. 82 CRITERION 8. INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT A. Leadership The Chair of the Department of Bioengineering is responsible for ensuring the quality and continuity of the program. Typically the Chair is appointed for a three year term by the Dean. The Chair participates in a biweekly meeting of Chairs and Center Directors that is led by the Dean. This meeting provides the Chair to represent the needs of the Department of Bioengineering to the College Administration and also through this meeting the Chair informs the Bioengineering Faculty of college -wide issues and initiatives. The Chair's leadership is evaluated by the Dean. The Chair appoints a faculty member to be the Undergraduate Advisor who has the responsibility of overseeing course content and student advising. At the end of each cours e the students complete a course evaluation form that can be reviewed by the Chair and corrections made if needed. B. Program Budget and Financial Support Resources Provided to the Program The program is supported by staff, part-time student assistants, teaching assistants, readers, and graders as needed to support individual courses and program ad ministration. The College provides Student Advisors who interact with program students, monitor academ ic progress, enable registration, and direct them to appropriate services on ca mpus for tutoring, career counseling, etc. Tutoring service is provided at the Learning Center and in the student dormitories (free for students living on campus). The College has developed a Professional Milestones Program to enable each program student to prepare for internships, job interviews, and research opportunities. The College provides funds to support teaching assistants, graders, and readers, assigned based on course enroll ment and need for laboratory supervision. Teaching Assistants conduct discussion sessions in which students are exposed to additional proble ms and concepts to reinforce material covered in lectures, and to enable students to complete course assign ments. All instructors and teaching assistants maintain posted office hours for assisting students outside scheduled classes. The program has a designated Undergraduate Advisor (currently Dr. Jerome Schultz ) to oversee curricular matters and to offer advice on curricular issues. Budgeting The University of California, Riverside has a multi -step budget development process. The major steps in the annual process are: February: Campus Budget Call Letter is distributed and meetings held with academ ic units to discuss faculty renewal models March: Comprehensive Planning Docu ments are subm itted to the Executive Vice Chancellor April: Individual unit hearings with senior UCR m anage ment 83 May: Input and feedback from Faculty Senate Committee on Planning and Budget to EVC June: Final unit budgets announced In response to the February Budget Call Letter, the Dean's Office in the Bourns College of Engineering requests budget proposals from each acade mic unit in the College. These proposals include undergraduate and graduate student projections, course load infor mation, staffing require ments and needs for additional supply, travel and miscellaneous expenses. Any additional resources requested are presented in the context of depart mental Five -Year Plans. In this way, depart ments demonstrate their progress in attaining Five-Year goals and request the resources required for the next year to maintain that progress. In most cases, depart mental current year (Permanent) budgets are the starting points for the next fiscal year's budgets. UC Permanent Budget resources do not have expiration dates and are used to fund long-term commitm ents from the University. In addition to Permanent funds, depart ments can request Temporary funds from the Dean's Office either during the budget proposal cycle or during the fiscal year for exceptional (one -time) expenses. The Dean's Office evaluates annual depart mental funding requests and subm its a combined budget proposal from the College in late March to the EVC's Office. After the final College budget is announced in June, any additional resources approved are allocated to the depart ments beginning the start of the fiscal year, July 1. Te mporary funding requests approved during the fiscal year are allocated at the time of approval or are reimbursed to depart ments after expenses are incurred. Each depart ment is responsible for m onitoring its expenses and projected ending balances during the fiscal year. All BCOE academic programs receive Permanent University funding for tenure track faculty, program staff, materials and supplies and travel . Table 32 summarizes Permanent Univ ersity funding allocations to BCOE departments over the last five fiscal years. Table 32. History of the Bourns Co llege of Engineering Permanent budget by degree p 5-year PERM In addition, BCOE academic departments receive t emporary University funding each fiscal year for lecturers, teaching assistants, instructional equipment, etc. The amounts of these annual allocations over the last five fiscal years can be found in Table 33. (Note: FY 11/12 allocations for Instructional Equipment will be made at the end of the fiscal year). 84 Table 33. Temporary funding per d egre e program TEMP Funding 2007-08 2008-09 2009-10 2010-11 2011-12 Totals Bioengineering Materials Science & Engineering 0 0 6,500 12,000 12,000 30,500 Teaching Asst/Grd Stdnts 1,000 0 12,000 18,000 18,887 49,887 Instructional Equipment of Engineering 5-year TEMP Funding Summary 85 As detailed in the table above, each BCOE academic program receives annual Temporary University funding allocations for teaching assistants and graders. Each program allocates these resources independently but in general, each lab section is supported by a 25% time TA. Details of BCOE offices, classrooms and Laboratories can be found in Criterion 7. BCOE budgets approximately $300,000/year for instructional equipment acquisition and upgrades. These funds are allocated to BCOE academic programs on an annual request basis. The instructional equipment obtained by this process over the past three fiscal years is listed below: Bioengineering Student Instructional Laboratories Both undergraduate laboratory courses are taught in the same room (MSE 154) approximately 1300 sq.ft. These courses are taught in alternate terms so that the equipment is changed for each course. Bioinstrumentation Laboratory (BIEN 130L): Lab Quest, Spirometer, O2 Sensors, etc. Pasco Stress Strain testers Balance Gel Columns Ni ELVIS Computers and monitors for Ni ELVIS BioPac MP36 Stress -strain Experiments Lung Capacity Experiment Biotechnology Laboratory (BIEN 155): Gene Xcell System Biomate 400 -500g Electrophoresis Gene Pulser Xcell Main Unit A separate room MSE of approximately 1000 sq. ft. is used for senior design projects. C. Staffing Below is a brief description of the adequacy of the staff (administrative, instructional, and technical) and institutional services pro vided to the program. M ethods used to retain and train staff are also indicated . Several years ago, BCOE centralized the following functions in the Dean's Office: undergraduate student affairs and advising; contract/grant pre -award processing and academic personnel. All other administrative functions (purchasing, payroll, grad student support, etc.) are provided at the departmental level. Over the past five fiscal years, the number of BCOE administrative and technical staff has decreased by 8.75 FTE due to UCR budget reductions. However, all but 0.25 FTE of these positions have occurred in central Dean's Office operations and were accomplished with little direct impact on BCOE 's academic programs. 86 During each fiscal year, BCOE administrative and technical staff salaries are compared with salaries of similar positions within BCOE and within other UCR aca demic and administrative units. Any significant salary lags are addressed through UCR's staff equity and reclassification process. During the past two fiscal years, 10- 11 staff reclassifications /equities were processed per year. This process has helped to reward and retain experienced BCOE staff. In addition to offering on- line and in- class training required to perform a staff position's basic responsibilities (i.e., payroll, purchasing, etc.), UCR offers extensive career development training programs including: Certificate programs in Building Core Competencies, Diversity Training, Performance Management, Professional Academic Advising, Professional Graduate Student Advising and Work Leadership Emerging Leader (mentorship) Program Management Skills Ass essment Program Most of the above training is at no cost to the employee. All required and optional training is offered through UCR's Human Resource's Learning Center. The completion of employee's required and optional training is recorded in UCR's automated Learning Management System (LMS). D. Faculty Hiring and Retention Summary of Hiring Process Each year, departments are asked to submit a faculty recruitment plan that is consistent with their strategic plan. The recruitment plan is sent to the Dean for his review. The Dean then outlines a collective recruitment plan for the College and requests ladder -rank faculty lines from the Provost. The Provost makes an allocation of ladder -rank faculty lines to the College and the Dean determines the overall priorities for the College. The Dean lets the departments know if they can begin a search for faculty members and, if so, how many. The department then forms a faculty committee to prepare a detailed recr uitment plan for the position(s). The detailed recruitment plan includes a listing of the search committee, written ads and where they will be placed, flyers for distribution at professional conferences, letter templates for bulk mailings to other relevant departments, an affirmative action plan, and a deadline for priority recruitment. Those detailed plans are sent to the Dean, Provost, and Affirmative Action offices for approval. 87 Once approved, ads are placed, mailings are sent, and the College on- line r ecruitment website is opened. All applications are received through the College recruitment website. All applications received by the priority deadline are reviewed by the faculty search committee. The committee assesses how well the applicants meet the goals of the department and their potential as a faculty colleague. An initial short- list is developed, and then further refined until a list of interviewees is developed. Once the list of interviewees is developed, the list is shared with the department at large, the Dean, and the Affirmative Action office. The Affirmative Action office requires reasons for why candidates were not considered for further consideration. Once the department, Dean, and Affirmative Action Office approve the list, the candida tes are invited to campus for an interview where they give one or two seminars, meet with department and other potentially relevant faculty, and the dean. Following the interviews, the department recommends one or more candidates to the Dean for approval t o make an offer of appointment. Upon his approval, the candidates are informed of the offer. The offer is contingent upon approval through the campus policies (Academic Personnel Manual and the Call) for faculty appointments. Procedures differ depending on level of appointment. Once a formal offer is signed and approved by the Chancellor, the candidate becomes a faculty member in the department. Strategies Used to Retain Current Qualified F aculty The primary strategy is to maintaining an atmosphere conducive to achieving excellence in all that we do. We strive to recognize excellent performance in teaching, research and service. We provide adequate resources for the faculty to advance their research, initial complement funds, laborato ry space, and assigned students . Annual training is provided f or improving teaching methods. The faculty is encouraged to take online training on a regular basis in topics including. Health and Safety, Information Secur ity, Leadership, and Effective Use of Advanced Technology in the Classroom . They are given assignments to college and campus committees to provide service and growth of responsibilities. We work to accelerate promotion opportunities for outstanding perform ance. Junior faculty are provided with mentoring by senior facult y members. We want our faculty to be of the highest quality and thereby a ttractive to other engineering schools. If as result a faculty member receives an offer from another institution we p rovide matching offers to retain the individual. These strategies and actions are predominately successful. E. Support of Faculty Professional Development Faculty professional develop ment funds are provide d to assistant professors as part of their faculty start-up packages. In addition, the Acade mic Senate provides travel assistance grants, 88 and the campus provides grants to support innovative teaching. Also, funds are available to all faculty from their faculty support accounts, which are funde d by a number of activities including a (small) portion of indirect costs generated by grants and contracts. The University offers leaves of absence with pay to attend professional meetings or other University business in addition to its normal sabbatical leave program in order to maintain faculty currency. The University also offers other types of leave with or without pay that may extend over a longer period of time, for good cause. The University Leave policies are covered in section V. (Benefits and Privileges) of the Academic Personnel Manual (APM) http://www.ucop.edu/acadpersonnel/apm/sec5 -pdf.html . The College provides funds to cover the cost of the faculty member's replacement while on leave. Faculty are also given latitude to modify class schedules/exams to some extent when necessary to accommodate specific professional development needs that require short or intermittent absences during the academic year. In some cases, other department faculty assist with covering a particular class or exam. 89 PROGRAM CRITERIA Our curriculum meets all the ABET Program Criteria for Bioengineering. Some of the co urses that directly contribute to the Program Criteria are shown in Table 34. Table 34.

For each experiment you must include the following five sections in your laboratory notebook. You will retain the original pages in your notebook and turn in the carbonless duplicate pages (marked \"COPY\") to your Teaching Ass istant. 133 1. Purpose 2. Procedure (in outline form) 3. Data (measurements and observations recorded in your lab notebook) 4. Calculations (written in your lab notebook) 5. Results and Conclusion; this section includes these two components: a. Error Analysis b. Conclusion Below is an explanation of what needs to be in each section. 1. Purpose - the purpose of the experiment should a succinct statement of the main point of the lab. It should not be more than 2- 3 sentences long. 2. Procedure - a step-by-step procedure in outline form. Do not write the procedure in paragraph format. The outline be should as concise as possible, but include sufficient detail for you to carry out the experiment without the aid of your lab manual. Refer to the example on page 80 in the lab manual. Turn in the copy of the notebook pages containing the Purpose and Procedure to your TA at the beginning of the period. 3. Data - Begin a new page and record all your measurements and observations in a table forma t (see example on page 81 in the lab manual) and underneath the table write any observations or comments pertaining to the experiment. Use the whole page for this. You might find it useful to set up the data table before coming to lab. Do not include cal culated values in the Data section. At the conclusion of each lab period you must get your TA's signature (in the \"Witness/TA\" box at the bottom) on each of the Data pages in your lab notebook and turn in the copy. 4. Calculations - on a new page followi ng the Data, show sample calculations of all the important calculations leading to the final results of the experiment. If you did multiple trials, use only the first trial to show the set- up of the calculations. Keep in mind that in some instances you will be asked by the TA to show sample calculations of all the trials.The duplicate notebook pages containing the Calculations are attached to your Report sheets and turned in the following week. 5. Results and Conclusion. This section must include these two components. The duplicate pages from your notebook are to be attached to your Report sheets and turned in the following week. a. Error Analysis - If your final results were not what was expected, then use thi s section to describe what went wrong and to give any possible sources of error. For example, suppose you performed three titrations to determine the molarity of an acid solution and one of the titrations resulted in a value of the molarity significantly d ifferent than the other two. If you noticed halfway through one titration that there was an air bubble in the tip of the buret, you would discuss what effect this might have on the accuracy of your results. b. Conclusion - In no more than 3 to 5 coherent sentences state your final conclusions of the lab BASED on your experimental results. Most importantly you want to answer the question: \"Did I 134 accomplish the purpose of this experiment?\" and if so, you must relate how you accomplished the purpose by stati ng your final results. For example, if the purpose of the experiment was to determine the concentration of a base by titration with an acid, your conclusion should state the average concentration of base, and assess the precision of your results by providi ng the standard deviation of your trials. Moreover, in your conclusion you should present one or two new ideas that were learned by doing the experiment. This section should be written in the third person, and kept concise. Laboratory Safety. The instruct ors and staff place the highest priority on your safety. To this end, you are required to understand and follow the safety precautions and rules that are printed below and in your lab manual (pages v- ix). In addition, you may be given specific instructions for each experiment and you are expected to follow these. The most basic safety requirement in lab is that goggles are to be worn at all times that experiments are in progress. This means that even after you have finished the experiment, you are required to wear your goggles so long as any other person in the lab is still working. NOTE: You are not allowed to bring food or beverages (even in closed containers) or wear sandal -type shoes in the lab. Department of Chemistry Laboratory Safety Instructions and Rules 1. EYE PROTECTION: One of the most common (and damaging) types of laboratory accidents involves the eyes. EYE PROTECTION IS MANDATORY AT ALL TIMES IN ALL TEACHING AND RESEARCH LABORATORIES. NO EXCEPTIONS. PERSONS WITH INADEQUATE EYE PROTECTION WILL BE TOLD TO LEAVE THE LABORATORY. a. All persons in a laboratory must wear safety goggles. b. Persons who normally wear prescription glasses must wear safety goggles over their glasses. Regular prescription glasses do not provide adequate protection for chemical laboratories. 2. PROPER ATTIRE: You will not be allowed in lab unless you are wearing clothing which completely covers the torso and legs (to within six inches above your ankles). Shoes must completely enclose the foot. A lab coat or apron is recommended. You may wear shorts only under a full -length lab coat. For your protection, you will not be allowed to attend lab without appropriate attire. 3. MEDICAL CONDITIONS: Notify the supervising laboratory instructor immediat ely if you have any medical conditions (such as pregnancy, allergies, diabetes, etc.) that may require special precautionary measures in the laboratory. 4. EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT: Know the locations of the lab fire extinguishers, safety showers, eyewash fountains, hallway emergency telephones, fire alarms, and lab and building exits. 135 5. FIRE: Immediately alert the TA, who will give instructions. A fire confined to a small container or flask can usually be extinguished by covering the container with somethi ng nonflammable (e.g. a large beaker). Use a fire extinguisher if necessary, but only if it appears that the fire can be easily contained; if not, pull the fire alarm and exit the building. Go directly to the designated assembly area. Do not use the elevat or. If a person's clothing is on fire, use the safety shower to put out the flames. If the shower is not readily available, douse the individual with water or wrap the person in a coat or whatever is available to extinguish the fire and roll the person on the floor. Fire blankets must be used with caution because wrapping someone while they are in the vertical position can force flames toward the face and neck. 6. INJURY: Immediately report any injury to a Teaching Assistant, no matter how minor. The TA will initiate emergency procedures and arrange for transportation to a medical care facililty. Do not transport a seriously injured person. Call for help. Complete an Incident Report in consultation with your TA as soon as possible, and submit it to the Stockroom staff (see Item 7). NOTE: The Student Health Center is open only during the day, from 8:00 - 4:30. Laboratory injuries after these hours will be treated at the Emergency Room at Riverside Community Hospital or a nearby Urgent Care Center. Students (or their health insurance company) will be assessed Emergency Room charges for off campus treatment. The Chemistry Department (or University) cannot pay. Students under 18 years must submit in advance, a treatment release form signed by parents or guar dians to be held on file in the stockroom. 7. CHEMICAL SPILLS: Chemical contact with eyes and skin must be washed immediately with lots of water for no less than 15 minutes. USE THE EYE WASH AND SAFETY SHOWER. Quickly remove all contaminated clothing. Re port chemical spills on persons, tables, or floors to a TA immediately regardless of how minor they appear. 8. EARTHQUAKE: Exit the laboratory if possible, but stay in the building and protect yourself from breaking windows or objects falling from above. When the quake subsides, quickly check, if possible, that all gas valves are closed and all electrical heating devices are turned off to stop reactions and prevent fires. Exit the building to the designated assembly area (see item 9). Do not use elevators . 9. BUILDING ALARM: Leave the building immediately and quietly to the designated assembly area, which is the grassy mall adjacent to the south wing of Pierce Hall and east of the bell tower (see map on the following page). Do not return until specifical ly told to re -enter. Note: Do not leave the building during active shaking from an earthquake. 10. REPORT OF INCIDENT: All incidents of fire, explosion, injury, or chemical spills (including mercury from broken thermometers) should be reported i mmediately to a TA. A written report is required after the incident; the stockroom has forms for filing written reports. 136 11. PREPARATION FOR LABORATORY: All students are expected to have read the experiment thoroughly prior to starting the lab work. Quest ions about procedures or precautions should be resolved by asking the TA or professor before the experiment. 12. ADDITIONAL LABORATORY RULES: a. You may not bring nor consume any food or beverage in the laboratories. Smoking and application of cosmetics is not permitted in the labs. b. You may not remove chemicals, equipment or supplies from the laboratories or stockrooms without written permission of the instructor, teaching assistant, or Laboratory Coordinator. Removal of any of the mentioned items will be treated as Academic Dishonesty and may result in a grade of F for the course. c. Do not deliberately smell or taste chemicals. d. Do not mix reagents unless you are instructed to do so or know the likely results. e. Do not use unlabeled chemicals. Report them to the TA. f. Never adulterate reagents by \"pouring back\" unused portions into stock bottles or using a contaminated pipet. g. Do not dump chemicals into trash cans or sinks. Waste chemicals are to be disposed of in specially labeled containers onl y. h. Extinguish matches with water and dispose of them in trash cans, never in the sinks. i. Absolutely no horseplay of any kind is permitted in the labs. j. Do not store chemicals in your lab drawer, unless specifically instructed to do so by your TA (e. g., when an experiment requires more than one lab period). All containers for storing chemicals must be clearly labeled (your name, experiment, and the full chemical name(s) of the contents). k. No visiting by friends is allowed during lab sessions. Pets or children are not allowed. l. Do not drink water from lab faucets. This water may not be safe. 137 E. CHEM 01LB. General Chemistry Laboratory (1) Laboratory, 3 hours.

(a) an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science (including biology and physiology (PC1)), and engineering Several core Bioengineering courses provide students with instruction that meets the characteristics of this required student capability. In order to illustrate the range of materials and concepts that students were exposed to in our program we selected a few examples of student work that shows the depth and breadth of student abilities to apply these fundamental principles. BIEN 115 - Quantitative Physiology Students are challenged with quantitatively analyzing physiological phenomena . Various pharmacokinetic situations are covered in the course, for example in the mid -term exam they derive compartmental models to explain various types of drug distribution patterns. Thermal effects are another aspect that is illustrated in this cou rse; the mid -term exam shows an example of transient heat conduction in tissues. BIEN 125 - Biotechnology One of the areas covered in this course is the modeling of cell growth and metabolism. Illustrative examples from the midterm and final exams show that the students were challenged with modeling the growth of microorganisms in batch and continuous culture and the production of various products such as insulin. 89 percent of students answered these questions satisfactorily. Average score = 45 Perform std = 36 BIEN 130 - Bioinstrumentation Mathematical skills are emphasized in this course, especially as related to management of data from various instruments. An example problem in the final exam required students to derive the Fourier transfor m of a complex mathematical expression. 76 percent of the students answered this question satisfactorily. BIEN 130L - Bioinstrumentation Laboratory Hands -on utilization of biomedical instruments is a focus of this course. Students are required to assem ble instruments and evaluate their behavior. An example report from a student illustrates 197 the in depth discussion of the circuitry of an electrocardiogram device and the thorough analysis of measurements made on a person. 63% of the students performed satisfactorily in this experiment. BIEN 135 - Biophysics and Biothermodynamics The fundamental principles of free energy considerations are applied to protein structure and function in this course. This homework example challenges the students to predic t protein structural changes caused by hypothetical mutations of various amino acids. 92% of the students were able to able to satisfactorily apply thermodynamic principles to this situation. BIEN 140A - Biomaterials This course emphasizes the importanc e of certain chemical/biophysical properties of materials that tend to determine their behavior when placed in a biological milieu. One of the key materials often overlooked in discussing biomaterial behavior is the ubiquitous solvent - water. In this qui z students were challenged to show how the unique properties of water distinguish this solvent from others. 67% of the students were able to answer these questions satisfactorily. BIEN 159 - Dynamics of Biological Systems This course focuses on the modeling of kinetic behavior of biological systems. These particular exam questions challenge the students to explain oxygen binding to various proteins (such as hemoglobin) and how those binding characteristics affect oxygen exchange in the body. 54% of the students were able to answer these questions satisfactorily. SUMMARY Overall students in the Bioengineering program satisfactorily meet the Criteria (a) of Student Outcomes. The departmental goal is for at least 70% of the students to reach the level of satisfactory performance in the Student Outcome Criteria. Although we meet our goals if one averages student performance in the examples quoted above , there are some spots that will need attention in the future. In particular we will place emphasis on improving BIEN 130L, BIEN 140A, and BIEN 159. 198 EVALUATION OF STUDENT OUTCOME ( b) (b) A n ability to design and conduct experiments, make measurements, analyze and interpret data from living systems addressing the problems associated with the interaction between living and non- living materials and systems. Seven courses, BIEN 115 (Quantitative Physiology), BIEN 125 (Biotechnology), BIEN 130 (Bioinstrumentation), BIEN 140A (Biomaterials), BIEN 155 (Biotechnology Lab), BIEN 159 (Dynamics of Biological Systems), and BIEN 175 (Senior Design) include components aimed at meeting this SO. In BIEN 115, particular quizzes constitute part of the course requirement aimed at meeting SO B. Under these quizzes, students apply pharmacokinetics analyses to character ize the biodistribution of various agents administered into the body. As such, these components of the course are mostly focused on interpretation of data from living systems. In BIEN 125, specific questions on a midterm and a final are used to assess SO ( b). The topics of these questions are related to protein expression systems and processes related to protein purification. SO B is met through these examples .( b) is met. In BIEN 140A , a final exam is used to assess for SO ( b). Under this exam, student s are required to answer questions related to a journal paper that address the properties of a biodegradable material. This evaluates the students ability in data interpretation is provided. In BIEN 155, three laboratory exercises related to performing f luorescent measurements, verification of DNA sequencing, and protein expression are used to asses SO ( b). The emphasis is at molecular and cellular level. In BIEN 159, an exam question related to binding of hemoglobin to oxygen is used to assess for SO(b). As such, the component of SO ( b related to interpretation of data is met. In BIEN 175, various student groups complete a senior design project over the course of two quarters. Overall the projects collectively address the various components related to SO ( b). Most of the projects appear to be related to the faculty research areas. 199 EVALUATION OF STUDENT OUTCOME ( c) Student Outcome (c): an ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability. Overview The following courses: BIEN 120, BIEN 130, BIEN 130L, BIEN 155, and BIEN 175, were all listed to contribute to Student Outcome (c ). The examples given for BIEN 120, BIEN 130, BIEN 130L and BIEN 175 clearly provide support for demonstrating that the program meets this outcome. The example for BIEN 155 did not clearly meet the objectives for this outcome based on the example given. Recommendation The program is strong with respect to Student Outcome (c). It is recommended that BIEN 155 be removed from the list of courses that demonstrate proficiency in this outcome. Course No. Summary of Assessment Method Justification % Meeting Standard BIEN 120 A term -long project to design a feedback control of a student prescribed process relevant to bioengineering. The control system design is analyzed within the limits of the process. The design project has an objective and considers a realistic project. The students are asked to consider limitations. This course clearly meets SO (c). 63.2 BIEN 130 A question on final exam asking to design iron suit armor to respond to various signals from the user. The students must design within limits of available equipment and pricing. A well -defined question that requires students to design a specific device within economic and part -availability limitations. This course c learly meets SO (c). 95.2 BIEN 130L A lab to acquire ECG signals from a human subject. An important lab where the students are required to design a circuit to measure ECG signals. This course clearly meets SO (c). 63.0 BIEN 155 A lab to conduct recombinant fluorescence protein production. Although an important lab, the students need only follow instruction and provide no design components. The example does not give enough evidence to strongly meet SO (c). 88 BIEN 175 A two -term project to design and build a device for specific This senior design project is the quintessential representation of - 200 applications with an economic, health and safety constraint. SO (c) . 201 EVALUATION OF STUDENT OUTCOME ( d) Student Outcome (d): an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams. Overview: This SO can be decomposed into two aspects: an ability to work in teams on multidisciplinary projects, and an ability to work on teams of a multidisciplinary composition. The undergraduate cur riculum places an emphasis on working in teams on multidisciplinary projects, often with individuals or small subgroups specializing on different aspects of a larger project (e.g., a group of bioengineering students with assigned responsibility for physiol ogy, theoretical design, and computation modeling working together to re -design a heart valve). The percentage of students/groups that met or exceeded set performance standards on assignments used to assess this SO was higher than 63% in all courses. Whi le these marks are not a direct indicator of the ability of student to function on multidisciplinary teams, an inability to do so would have been reflected through lower marks such assignments. The second aspect of this SO, an ability to work in teams of a multidisciplinary composition, has been somewhat lacking. However, we are currently addressing this issue, as noted in the Recommendation section below. Recommendation: Possible improvements to the curriculum include: 1) A more direct assessment of SO (d) would be desirable in the future. While it is difficult to imagine a truly objective method for doing so, a subjective measure can made through student feedback specifically asking to assess their ability to work in i) teams ii) of a multidisciplinar y nature. 2) The examples provided clearly demonstrate the ability of our students to work in teams on projects of a multidisciplinary nature. However, they do little with regard to demonstrating an ability to work in teams composed of people with a back ground in different academic disciplines. This is currently being addressed through the recent integration of business students and material into BIEN 175A. Summary of assessment data BIEN 010: In this first- year course, students worked in groups of 3 on a multidisciplinary final project. The example provided was titled \"Artificial Lungs,\" and demonstrated a basic understanding of the biological/clinical motivation as well as a quantitative analysis of the required level of gas exchange for such a device. BIEN 105: In this third -year course, students worked in groups of 3 on a multidisciplinary final project. The example provided was titled \"Computational modeling of thrombi in the titanium Greenfield filter.\" Presentation slides demonstrate an underst anding of the biological/medical motivation behind removal of thrombi from circulation, a description of titanium Greenfield filter (TGF) for clots, and a detailed computational model of flow with and without spherical or conical clots in COMSOL. 202 BIEN 120 : In this third -year course, students worked in groups of 3 on a multidisciplinary final project. The example provided was titled \"Thermoregulatory sweat response of the human body due to a change in environmental conditions.\" A comprehensive report demonstrates an understanding of physiology, feedback control mechanisms, and open and closed loop analysis of thermoregulation/sweat response using Matlab/Simulink. BIEN 130L: In this third -year course, students worked in groups of 2 on different laboratory experiments every week. The example provided was titled \"Biomechanical measurements.\" The lab report demonstrates an ability to acquire and analyze data from compression testing of bone and tensile testing of skin. BIEN 175: In this fourth- year course, students worked in groups of 3 or 4 students over the course of two quarters on highly multidisciplinary design projects. The example provided was titled \"Utilization of inkjet technology to print cellular sheets.\" The project required familiarity in a w ide range of disciplines, with presentation slides demonstrating modification of an inkjet printer to print a layer of alginate, then cells, and then alginate in successive passes as well as SEM imaging to test printed sheets. 203 EVALUATION OF STUDENT OUTCOME ( e) Student Outcome (e): an ability to identify, formulate, and apply advanced mathematics, science, and engineering to solve problems at the interface of engineering and biology. (PC2) Overview. In the following courses our undergraduate students have demonstrated ability to combine advanced mathematics, science, and engineering to solve bioengineering problems: BIEN 105, BIEN 110, BIEN 115, BIEN 120, BIEN 130, BIEN 135, and BIEN 140A. The assessments show that most of the students have met the performance standard in these classes. Recommendation. Based on the presented course material, the following recommendations may be useful to strengthen SO (e) of our program: (i) Increase experimental and data analysis content. Emphasize statistical analysis of experimental data. (ii) Increase bioimaging and medical device content. Summary of the contributions that each course offers to SO (e): BIEN 105 - Circulation Physiology. The students demonstrated understanding of the relationship between physical systems and mathematical models through the use of biosimulators (e.g. in COMSOL). They applied theoretical, computational and analytical, methods in designing fluid biomechanics models. They quant itatively analyzed their data and were able to recognize limitations in the approximations underlying their mathematical/physical models and design. BIEN 110 - Biomechanics of the Human Body. The students used computational tools to develop physical and m athematical models of bioengineering problems. The course focuses on solid mechanics problems and is complementary to BIEN 105, which focuses on fluid mechanics problems. BIEN 115 - Quantitative Physiology. The students demonstrated abilities to use diffe rential equations to describe physical models useful in medical applications. Students learned how the diffusion equation is derived from energy balance principles and applied it to physiological heat and mass transfer applications. BIEN 120 - Biosystems and Signal Analysis. The students developed physical and mathematical models with the use of biosimulators (e.g. MATLAB) to model biological, biomedical, and bioengineering processes. They were able to use time -dependent differential equations to model rea l bioprocesses and they quantitatively analyzed their data. They were able to recognize limitations in the approximations underlying their mathematical/physical models and design and to translate the results from the modeled bioprocesses to outputs of real bioprocesses. BIEN 130 - Bioinstrumentation. 204 The students demonstrated abilities to quantify physiological processes, using mathematical equations that describe physical models and chemical processes. They also demonstrated ability to apply statistical analysis to hypothetical data taken from a bioin strument. BIEN 135 - Biophysics and Biothermodynamics. The students demonstrated abilities to apply thermodynamic principles to understanding the behavior of biological systems. They obtained knowledge on biophysical properties of biomolecules, and on usi ng molecular and statistical thermodynamics to model biomolecular processes. The students used advanced mathematical methods to describe biomolecular structure and function at atomic detail and to understand the role of biomolecules in cellular and physiol ogical processes. The students also obtained knowledge of a variety of physical methods applied in the study of biological molecules (e.g., spectroscopic, scattering, diffraction, microscopies, calorimetry, etc). BIEN 140A - Biomaterials. The students dem onstrated abilities to analyze and explain data related to biomaterials and interactions between biomaterials and tissues. This course has strong statistical content for experimental data analysis. 205 EVALUATION OF STUDENT OUTCOME (f) Student Outcome (f) : 'an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility Overview. Three BIEN courses, 010, 140A and 175 were assessed to evaluate SO (f). The assessments show that most students met the expected performance for all classes. Recommendation. SO Criterion (f) needs to be emphasized more in other courses, for example, those related to drug development, tissue engineering, etc. Summary of the contributions that each course offers to SO (f): BIEN010: the SO (avg. score of 92.3) exceeded the performance standard (70) meeting 100% of the standard. Group project and presentation were used as instructional and measuring methods to evaluate the SO Criterion (f). The students were asked to incorporate relevant aspects of 'Code of Ethics for Professional Engineers' and 'Code of Ethics for Biomedical Engineers' into their group projects. One of student presentation slides, in which the students correlated 'Code of Ethics' with their proposed hearing device is included as an example. The course materials and instructional method seem effective to instill the concept of the SO criterion (f) as an introductory course for bioengineering freshmen. BIEN140A : the SO (avg. score of 93) exceeded the performance standard (85) meeting 100% of the standard. Students were asked to do literature review regarding professional and ethical problems in the bioengineering field. Several articles found from their literature review were included as examples. It appears that examples of students' work, e.g. their presentation mater ials or term papers regarding those articles, would strengthen this SO. BIEN175: for this senior design course, quantitative scores were not measured. The students were given a case study regarding bioethics and their responses in the form of essay were documented. Since ethical issues do not always have right answers, discussion and writing seem to be effective methods to instill the SO (f) . Overall, SO Criterion (f) needs to be stressed more in other courses, for example, in courses related to drug development, tissue engineering, etc. 206 EVALUATION OF STUDENT OUTCOME (g) Student Outcome (g): The outcomes of several courses viz. BIEN 010, BIEN 105, BI EN 120, BIEN 130L, BIEN 155, and BIEN159 were assessed to evaluate the students' \" ability to communicate effectively \". Summary These courses require group projects involving several students. Students are required to write comprehensive reports on their projects. Also they make presentations that evaluated for effectiveness. Overall student performance is very good. BIEN 010. Group projects and class presentations were used as metrics for evaluation of effective scientific communication. The students used lucid power point presentations to demonstrate their understanding of the key steps involved in the development of an artificial organ (skin). This included (1) the manufacturing steps (2) FDA regulatory issues for eventual marketing of the finished p roduct, and (3) the ethical issues related to the use of autologous/allogenous skin grafts. The average score (92.3) far exceed the performance standard (70) for this course, with all students meeting the standard criterion. BIEN 105. This course introduces the physiological principles of blood flow. The students worked on group projects and gave PowerPoint presentations to communicate their ability to design flow -based biofluid mechanics process. Student presentations included results from their COMSOL modeling and simulations, which were particularly helpful in demonstrating their thorough understanding of subject matter. All students met the performance standard (70), with the average score of 94.35. BIEN 120. This course provides an analytical understanding of the dynamic behavior of biological systems. Final project reports by student groups were used to evaluate their ability to effectively communicate their scientific understanding of the course material. Student reports included detailed illustrations, flow charts, data plots, and equations. 63.2% of the students met the performance standard (70), with the average score being 71.8. BIEN 130L. In this Bioinstrumentation Laboratory course, student lab reports were used to evaluate their written communication skills. These lab reports, which included an abstract, introduction, methods, results and discussion sections, were structured according to the format used for preparing peer -reviewed journal manuscripts. Thus, this laboratory c ourse gives students a first -hand experience of communicating their independent scientific findings for peer review. 63% of the students met the standard (>=80), with the average score being 89. BIEN 155. This lab course provides hands -on experience with fundamental biochemistry and molecular -biology techniques. Student group lab reports and presentations were used to asses their interpretation and communication of the laboratory bench work. Both presentations and lab reports effectively described the experimental techniques and results obtained from each week's laboratory work, followed by conclusions and future directions. 86% of the students met the standard (14), with the average score being 16.6. 207 BIEN 159. In this course on the \"Dynamics of Biological Systems\", a final problem set of 8 problems was used to determine the students' understanding of subject matter. Although 66% of the students met the standard (80), with the average score being 81, this problem set may not represent an ideal criterion for evaluating student communication skills. 208 EVALUATION OF STUDENT OUTCOME (h) Student Outcome (h): a broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context. Overview. In a ran ge of courses (BIEN 125 and 159), our undergraduate students have demonstrated the use of engineering solutions in an economic and societal context. For example, in BIEN125, students learned to compare a few approaches to characterize engineering protein products in an economic and societal context, that is, considering the cost of labor and time for each approach when making a decision on choice of engineering solution. The environmental and global context is less evident for both courses. The assessments show that most of the students (75%) have met the performance standard for BIEN 125, and 54% met the performance standard for BIEN 159. Recommendation. Based on the presented course materials, the following recommendations may allow us to strengthen SO ( h) of our program: 1) Widen the courses involving economic and societal context. Out of the 2 courses providing SO (h), only one showed obvious economic and societal context. We need to develop more courses for SO (h). An introduction level \"Engineering E thics and Impacts on Global, Economic, Environmental, and Societal Context\" will be beneficial. 2) Demonstrating the global and environmental context. None of the materials in the folder contained clear global and environmental context. More courses are c ertainly needed to demonstrate global and environmental context. Again, an introduction level \"Engineering Ethics and Impacts on Global, Economic, Environmental, and Societal Context\" will be beneficial. Summary of the contributions that each course offers to SO (h): BIEN 120. The students demonstrated how they would choose among multiple engineering solutions in protein purification and characterization in consideration of economic context (e.g. cost), and societal context (e.g. labor time involved) . 75% students in the class have met the performance standard. BIEN 159. 54% students met the performance standard. The connection to economic and societal context is less apparent. Neither course has an apparent global and environmental context. 209 EVAL UATION OF STUDENT OUTCOME (i) Student Outcome (i): a recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life -long learning Overview. Our bioengineering students demonstrate a recognition of the need for (BIEN 10), and an ability (BIEN 125? and BIE N 140A) to engage in life -long learning. The assessments show that 100% of the students have met the performance standard for BIEN 10 and BIEN 140A classes. Recommendation. Based on the presented course materials, the following recommendations may allow us to strengthen SO (i) of our program: 1) Introduce examples in the cognitive domain (analysis) that represent students' mastery of the skills as lifelong learners. An example from BIEN10 course showing analysis of new information, concept, etc. by breakin g it down, comparing and contrasting, recognizing patterns, interpreting information, etc. as appropriate. BIEN140A can include examples of students' skills to access information from variety of sources, to assess the quality of information and categorize/ classify it. Widen the course selection and include courses at an upper level that show our students' skills to model, simplify, approximate, make and recognize assumptions as well as inquiring. 2) Expand examples in the affective domain (attitudes and values) that represent students' development into the life -long learners. This can be accomplished through a development of an Engineering Ethics Course. This self -standing course can help students to develop attitudes and values at the highest (ethical) level upon graduation and become lifelong learners. The development of the skills in the cognitive domain depends on the attitudes and values of the learn ers and our program will overall benefit from students gaining competence in the affective domain, which directs behaviors. The course will introduce the theory and practice of engineering ethics using a multidisciplinary and cross -cultural approach focusi ng on sciences and engineering case studies. This comprehensive course will introduce the professional attitudes and ethical values to help students recognize the need for lifelong learning beyond their engineering degree. 3) Introduce students' periodic ref lections on their learning process. The students themselves identify their technical strengths and weaknesses and develop their own learning strategies to become lifelong learners. 4) Introduce evidence of students' participation in professional organizations, conference presentations, publications or design competitions. 210 Summary of the contributions that each course offers to SO (i): BIEN 10. The students demonstrated the ability to reflect on their background The Assignment 1 for the class requir ed (1) reading the chapter introducing \"the keys to success in engineering study\" with discussions of the learning in the university environment, strategies for maximizing performance in engineering courses, studying, and models for what the student should expect from their engineering degree; (2) answering questions for example such as outlining personal goals, establishing a goal for the grade, etc.; (3) preparing 5 min PowerPoint presentations addressing answers to at least 3 questions in (2); 100% of st udents (with an 80 being an average score) meet the score of 70, which is a performance standard. BIEN 125. This course provides our students with an overview of biochemical process in cells and their use in developing new products and processes. There is no performance standard available for (i). BIEN 140A. The students read the papers and discuss them during the quarter. This assignment is designed to make the students aware of the various publications in the field and help them see how the concepts they learn apply in more complex, real world problems. 211 EVALUATION OF STUDENT OUTCOME (j ) a knowledge of contemporary issues related to bioengineering Summary: This outcome determines the knowledge of students acquired during the 4 years of Bioengineering program study about current scientific and social issues related to bioengineering. The outcome makes BIEN students aware of how bioengineering skills and knowledge could contribute to the contemporary issues in a very broad range. In the ma trix table, the student outcome (j) should be contributed by courses BIEN10, BIEN115, BIEN125, BIEN140(A), and BIEN175. The current materials come from BIEN10 and BIEN140(A). Two course materials are presented in this category, 1. BIEN10: Assignment 6A -Simpl e Mathematical Modeling Using Matlab This assignment requires student to carry a project using Matlab to describe one of biological system and prepare a powerpoint presentation, such as Drug concentration in the Urine. The presentation covers the functions and regulations of kidney, mathematic modeling and calculation of drug concentration in urine. Comments: This material covers the mathematic power of bioenginee ring in determining drug concentration, such as Marijuana, in urine. This is a good example from mathematic point in biological system. But this project seems focusing on a very specific question of drug concentration modeling. The background of the projec t and roles of bioengineering in this process are not very clearly presented in this project. 2. BIEN 140A: Quiz 2 last question -Do you know of any socioeconomic and /or environmental impact caused by usage of this material? (metal Coltan wire/fiber) This question makes student aware of the Coltan is a main export of Congo and it is main financial income of Congo. This knowledge takes care of the metal Ta use in cell phone, computers and other electronic devices and recycles these machines after use. Comment : This question is proper for this category. The BIEN students can gain knowledge of materials and biomaterials in socioeconomics impacts. But if biomaterials are used in this case, it would be even better for applications of transplant, medical devices an d regenerative medicine . Recommendations: This outcome is one of important criterion for B.S.degree of Bioengineering. The awareness of contemporary issues will not only make students more motivated but also clues for their future career and respo nsibilities. Many courses can contribute to this outcome. The example should come from higher level knowledge, other than a very specific example for a specific issue. We need to select at least one course from each category to contribute to this Student O utcome, e.g. BIEN125, BIEN130, BIEN120, BIEN135. This emphasis will also make students aware of scientific and social issues in various disciplines to their studies as bioengineering and their future careers. 212 EVALUATION OF STUDENT OUTCOME (k) Student Outcome (k): an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice. Overview. In a range of courses our undergraduate students have demonstrated the use of theoretical (e.g., BIEN 135), computational (e.g., BIEN 105) and experimental (e.g., BIEN 155) skills for bioengineering at various scales: i.e., from protein engineering (e.g., BIEN 155) to device engineering (BIEN 175). The assessments show that most of the students have met the performance standard for all classes. Recommendation. Based on the presented materials course materials, the following recommendations may allow us to strengthen SO (k) of our program: 1) Widen the courses involving experimental skills. Out of the ten courses providing SO (k) only three involve the use of hands -on experimental skills. Concurrently, all of the ten courses involve the use of theoretical or computational abilities. 2) Demonstrating the use of statistics. According to the Program Criteria for Bioengineering, \"The program must prepare graduates to have: an understanding of biology and physiology, and the capability to apply advanced math ematics (including differential equations and statistics), science, and engineering to solve the problems at the interface of engineering and biology.\" Having enough biology and physiology courses suffices to satisfy some of the program criteria. Regardin g advanced math and statistics, however, the students have to demonstrate the use of these skills via SO (k). The lab courses are the best for allowing students to demonstrate skills in statistics (and just placing error bars will not be sufficient). Neith er of the materials in the folder contained any concepts of statistical analysis. We might need to address this issue. 3) Improve the connection with the strength of the department. Imaging is one of the trademark strengths of our department. I might be w rong, but from the materials I've seen, our lab courses do not involve the use of imaging skills (taking photographs is not really advanced imaging). It might help to use some of the campus resources to allow students to develop and apply skills in imaging to their course projects. Summary of the contributions that each course offers to SO (k): BIEN 105. The students demonstrated the use of finite element analysis for fluid dynamics with physiological relevance. The final project for the class requi red: (1) designing the physiological models; (2) carrying the computational simulations with these models; and (3) analyzing the obtained results. All students in the class have met the performance standard. BIEN 120. The students demonstrated the use of applied mathematics for signal analysis and system control at cellular and organ levels. The final project involved: (1) developing of mathematical models based, for example, on kinetics and mass transport; (2) carrying the 213 calculations; and (3) analyzing the results. More than half of the students have met the performance standard. BIEN 125. This course introduces to students established and modern biochemistry and molecular -biology techniques, and their use in bioengineering. The students were tested on the ability to recognize these techniques and their use. More than 2/3 of the students have met the performance standard. BIEN 130. This course introduces techniques and instrumentation for biomedical applications. The students are expected to understa nd not only the techniques, but also the technical limitations of the used instrumentation. They demonstrated the ability to code for accounting the shortcomings in the interface between state of the art medical equipment and a patient. More than 2/3 of the students have met the performance standard. BIEN 135. This course introduces methods for approaching problems in macromolecular chemistry and biophysics of physiological and medical importance. The students demonstrated the use of basic physical chemi stry / thermodynamics principles, along with 2D NMR data, for analysis of protein structural properties. Almost all students in the class have met the performance standard. BIEN 155. This lab course provides hands -on experience with fundamental biochemis try and molecular -biology techniques. The students have demonstrated the use of these techniques for protein engineering, involving expression, isolation, and characterization of photoactive fused proteins. The student employed qualitative FRET theory (i.e ., in a binary mode) to spectroscopic data for analyzing protein -protein interactions. More than 3/4 of the students have met the performance standard. BIEN 175. This Senior Design course is perhaps the best example of SO (k). The students employ interdisciplinary technical skills toward designing a method and/or devices and testing their performance. 214 Appendix F - Bioengineering Survey of Alumni and Workplace F.1 Bioengineering Survey of Alumni March 2012 1 What year did you earn your bachelor's degree in Bioengineering?

If so please comment below. Answered Question 13 Skipped Question 22 Response Text Focus more on applicable biology such as medicine/drugs and cell culture. The \"capability\" objective should be split into its three components so they can be rated individually. If so, I would give preparation for graduate studies a 5, preparation for industry a 3, and I cannot comment on the preparation for medical school. More opportunities to work with industry to prepare for non- academic careers. I think the university as a whole does a poor job in preparing us for the reality of the work world. Finding a job isn't easy, especially in entry level engineering and I feel like in a sense I was led to believe it wouldn't be that difficult of a task. i think there should be more pursue for helping in finding a career N/A Rather than having a biased curriculum towards chemistry and biochemistry, it would be nice to have a broader sense of what bioengineering really is. Students may be disinterested in chemistry and biochemistry, thus turning away their interest from the department. The integration of tracks so that bioengineering students can specialize and become more proficie nt in what sub- topics they enjoy. More bioengineering classes in lower division so that they know more about the careers path they've chosen. Maybe the department will be able to partner with local biotech or biomedical companies to help undergraduates at tain some experience. None The program was good and it very well managed by the HOD and good program. 216 Not enough emphasis is placed on the engineering perspective of the program. Several Professors lazily prepare for the lectures and good supplemental i nformation cannot be found. It is understandable that Bioengineering is a new field of study, but obtaining information should not be as difficult as it is. Professors should be able to provide supplemental material so material can be learned and understoo d outside of the class. Also, assignments and projects usually had vague/unknown requirements. These processes need to be improved. Also, the program should have more than one \"track\" the program focuses far too much on the biology aspect and far too littl e on the engineering aspect. People with a background strong in biology may want to choose a track that contains more engineering classes in order to broaden their knowledge base. Please add a co -op program for the students.

Based on your experience, what comments do you have on our program and our objectives? Answered question 17 Skipped question 18 Response to text: When I was a part of the program, I felt the main objective was to prepare students for research or graduate school. Industry was almost always an afterthought and there was very little offered in the way of internships or industry experiences. none More preparation for careers outside of academics. I feel like the program heavily discourages going into industry and puts too much emphasis on graduate studies. When I gradua ted I felt embarrassed to not be going on for a phd. i think there should be more focus on starting a career The actual curriculum is good as is, and shouldn't be changed. It would be nice to see some faculty members put in effort that involve the improvem ent of the infant department rather than excusing and only looking out for themselves. It would also be nice if there was an inclusion of broader range of classes which involve other aspects of bioengineering other than chemistry and biochemistry. More ap plication of the learning we have obtained as it relates to the work force. I think most of the context of the material I learned was for Research/Graduate School work and not so much for the practicality of the work force. The training was comprehensive t o allow transfer to a very wide range of fields The only drawback I've felt regarding the program is how broad it is. At the end of the degree, I felt that I knew of a lot of topics, but not enough about any particular one. It was a great position to be in for graduate school, but made me feel unprepared to start an engineering job. In short, about the right amount of theory, not quite enough hands on experience. The program is very well diversified. Faculty are involved in different areas of bioengineerin g which reflects on the courses taught. This allows the students to be 222 exposed to different topics and allows them to broaden their knowledge. This ultimately leads to an opportunity of pursuing a higher education, not only in bioengineering but any other related fields, as well as starting a career with the different skills acquired. again form a partnership with a company because not alot of companies know what we do and what we know so exp will be much needed I think it would have been nice if we had speakers from industry as well. TERRIBLE, MOST PEOPLE BREEZE THROUGH CLASS EVEN WHEN THEY WERE SCORING 5 -10% ON THEIR MIDTERMS!!!! THE AVG SCORE WAS 5%! WE DID NOT LEARN ANYTHING USEFUL!!!!!!! WASTED 4 YEARS OF MY LIFE HERE. Many skills above I had ranked low because I was able to achieve those prior to the program, or through other means. I think this was achieved for even the first graduating class ok 17 Please give us your suggestions on how to better serve our students as well as alumni. Answered question 16 Skipped question 19 If the program has not taken an approach that also prepares students for industry, it should. Create industry friendly alternatives in the program. Examples: Elective credit could be given for internships. Instead of working on a senior design project, some students may instead be part of a Co- Op and report their experience at the end. During senior design, let the undergrads have time in the labs. Stop giving the grad students the power to cut our time to nothing. We can't learn and achieve if we are never given the chance. More effort to work with companies. When I entered the program I was under the impression that UCR's Bioengineering program made certain disciplines much more accessible than they actually where. I was given a two page list of \"Technical Electives\", however, very few of these classes were available. Keep an open mind to other opportunities within the engineering discipline. Resources to finding careers/ graduate programs It would be nice to have a te am that focuses on finding collaborative projects between the university and the industry. This will open the door to co- op programs and internships, and better connect recent graduates and alumni to job search in the industry. Have classes on Bioethics an d Applying their skills to the workforce. Networking for alumni and career opportunities within bioengineering The departments' faculty and staff is very approachable and I feel this is a very precious asset that UCR Bioengineering should keep. As the depa rtment grows in 223 size, both student and professional, it will be difficult to retain the close knit community. Informal gatherings after finals should help in retaining that. Maybe the email newsletter or something similar would be nice. DO A BETTER JOB HEL PING THEM FIND WORK AFTER GRADUATION!!!!!!!!!!! OUR DEGREES ARE USELESS IN THE REAL WORLD! Expanding the faculty will greatly improve the process. Also, more effort should be made to assign the correct faculty to the correct class. Some professors that taught some of the bioengineering courses did not understand the course content themselves. They needed their notes to figure out the problems and could not solve problems correctly without their notes. Undoubtedly, the professor has his strong suits, he was just assigned the wrong class to teach. Keep improving all aspects. Need better internship/Co- Op programs specifically for bioengineers. However, this will naturally come with time as the field is still young.

Response 5 4 3 2 1 3 1 The research projects in which the undergraduates are involved, are in the general areas of energy and infectious agents. Because of it, at group meetings, the students often discuss socioeconomic and ethical issues related these areas of research. Ethical and social concerns related to bioengineering are addressed frequently in our lab group meetings and casual discussions. No doubt, the diverse training in bioengineering at UCR was very helpful for them to see a wide range of areas in the discipline.

PERSON(S) WHO PREPARED THIS DESCRIPTION Victor Rodgers - AND DATE OF PREPARATION: 22 -Jul-10 ________________________________________________ CHANGES MADE THIS QUARTER BASED ON PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT RESULTS: Year, we have included an additional exam (three closed -book exams in this case, to help students continuously focus on mathematical techniques. The results are most prevalent in the final projects w here it appears that this year's performance was particularly satisfying. SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENT RESULTS FOR THIS QUARTER: Overall, the final design project remains the capstone representation of student performance in all critical categories. The design p roject requires a solid ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, and engineering to related biological topics [ SO(a)]. In addition, the project is a group activity fostering team communication [ SO(d), SO (g)] However, these students are all bioengineering students so the interdisciplinary component is not directly resolved. Because the project requires the students to identify, formulate and apply advanced mathematics, science and engineering to solve problems at the interface of engineering and biology [ SO(e)], this is strongly satisfied by the successful performance of the students at the final project. Finally, because the students must learn computations tools such as COMSOL, they have successfully 228 developed the ability to use techniques, skills and modern engineering tools for engineering practice [ SO(k)]. The students met or exceeded the Course Outcomes well this year. This is primarily because the latter evaluation tools are used to determine their performance while the initial examinations are used to help identify deficiencies. PROPOSED ACTIONS FOR COURSE IMPROVEMENT: The course should continue in its form for the upcoming class however, with the class size beginning to increase, the number of 3 -member groups will be substantial. It does not appear that BIEN 105 can satisfy the interdisciplinary compone nt of SO d so it may be necessary to relax the contribution of BIEN 105 in fulfilling this Student Outcome.

PROPOSED ACTIONS FOR COURSE IMPROVEMENT: PERSON(S) WHO PREPARED THIS DESCRIPTION AND DATE OF PREPARATION: Bahman Anvari - October 7, 2011 231 BIEN 120 DATE OF PREPARATION: July 20, 2010 COURSE: BIEN 120: Biosystems and Signal Analysis. 4 units ACADEMIC TERM: Winter 2010 INSTRUCTOR: V. G. J. Rodgers EVALUATION BY INSTRUCTOR: CHANGES MADE THIS QUARTER BASED ON PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT RESULTS: None SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENT RESULTS FOR THIS QUARTER: The results of this assessment indicate that the students can benefit from earlier evaluation of mathematical skill development and understanding of the relationship between mathematical models and designing. PROPOSED ACTIONS FOR COURSE IMPROVEMENT: 1) With reference to the assessment, it will be beneficially if an additional text is used to supplement this current limitation. We are considering several texts that might be helpful. 2) It is clear that this design -based course provides extensive mathemat ical preparation and training for the engineer. Thus, it is appropriate to include BIEN120 when assessing Student O utcome (a) in the Student Outcomes. PERSON(S) WHO PREPARED THIS DESCRIPTION Victor G. J. Rodgers AND DATE OF PREPARATION: July 20, 2010 __________________________________ BIEN 120 Winter 2011 EVALUATION BY INSTRUCTOR: CHANGES MADE THIS QUARTER BASED ON PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT RESULTS: In the last assessment, it was recommended that additional mathematical supplements are provided to suppor t the students' grasp of the mathematical material. As a result additional course material on mathematical modeling analysis was added. ______________________________________________________________________ SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENT RESULTS FOR THIS QUARTER: Overall, the final design project remains the capstone representation of student performance in all critical categories. The design project requires a solid ability to apply knowledge of 232 mathematics, and engineering to related biological topics [ SO(a)] although BIEN 120 is not considered a major contribution to this Student Outcome. In addition, the project is a group activity fostering team communication [ SO(d), SO(g)]. However, these students are all bioengineering students so the interdisciplinary component is not directly resolved. Because the project requires the students to identify, formulate and apply advanced mathematics, science and engineering to solve problems at the interface of engineering and biology [ SO(e)], this is strongly satisfied by the successful performance of the students at the final project. Finally, because the students must learn computations tools such as Matlab and its Control Toolbox, they have successfully developed the ability to use techniques, skills and modern engineering tools for engineering practice [ SO(k)]. The students' for 2011 as a class only resulted in a lackluster performance in BIEN 120 with only 63.2% meeting the program performance standard via the above Student Outcomes. This may be the result of an unusual class as this class also had the highest failure rate for BIEN 120 than any in our program since its inception. PROPOSED ACTIONS FOR COURSE IMPROVEMENT: The course should continue in its form for the upcoming class however additional mathematical suppl ements should be further increased. It might be useful to increase the number of short quizzes that are not graded. _____________________________________________________________________ PERSON(S) WHO PREPARED THIS DESCRIPTION AND DATE OF PREPARATION: Victor Rodgers - February 26, 2012 233 BIEN 125 _____________________________________- DATE OF PREPARATION: February 6, 2012 COURSE: BIEN 125: Biotechnology and Molecular Bioengineering 4 units ACADEMIC TERM: Winter 2011 INSTRUCTOR: Jiayu Liao EVALUATION BY INSTRUCTOR: CHANGES MADE THIS QUARTER BASED ON PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT RESULTS: We continue emphasizing mathematic applications in enzymatic kinetics, cell growth and fermentation process. We also put more efforts on experimental design and biotechnology social impacts. SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENT RESULTS FOR THIS QUARTER: The overall outcomes are above average of expectations. Students have exposed to real biotechnology techniques, products, bioengineeirng industrial opportunities and direct impact on their career in the future. PROPOSED ACTIONS FOR COURSE IMPROVEMENT: We still need to emphasize mathematic a pplications and give more examples in cell growth calculations and specific protein engineering examples. At the same time, we should give more clear directions for future directions of biotechnology and bioengineering. PERSON(S) WHO PREPARED THIS DESCRIP TION Jiayu Liao AND DATE OF PREPARATION:Feb, 2012 234 BIEN 130 DATE OF PREPARATION: July 15, 2010 COURSE: BIEN 130 (Bioinstrumentation) ACADEMIC TERM: Spring 2010 INSTRUCTOR: B. Hyle Park EVALUATION BY INSTRUCTOR: CHANGES MADE THIS QUARTER BASED ON PRE VIOUS ASSESSMENT RESULTS: Significant effort was made to introduce material in this lecture course prior to its use in the co - requisite laboratory course (BIEN 130L). Integration between the two courses was greatly enhanced this year as both were taught b y the same instructor. SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENT RESULTS FOR THIS QUARTER: This quarter went fairly smoothly with the exception of 1 student, who failed to take advantage of extra credit and optional work offered to bolster their grade. While it might be expected that the percentage of students meeting performance standards increased with repetition, this was not seen as the difficulty level of similar problems was raised each time a particular topic was presented. PROPOSED ACTIONS FOR COURSE IMPROVEMENT: The course will be improved through increased emphasis on statistics and statistical analysis, incorporation of more challenging problem sets, and increased utilization of computational software (e.g., Matlab). PERSON(S) WHO PREPARED THIS DESCRIPTION H yle Park ____________________________________________ DATE OF PREPARATION: July 5, 2011 COURSE: BIEN 130 (Bioinstrumentation) ACADEMIC TERM: Spring 2011 INSTRUCTOR: B. Hyle Park EVALUATION BY INSTRUCTOR: CHANGES MADE THIS QUARTER BASED ON PREVIOUS ASSE SSMENT RESULTS: Significant effort was still put into introducing concepts in the lecture course before students encountered them in the concurrent laboratory course. Statistics, especially as related to interpretation of results obtained with bioinstrume ntation, was added to the course curriculum. In addition, a greater emphasis was placed on the use of Matlab to solve practical problems related to course material. SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENT RESULTS FOR THIS QUARTER: 235 This quarter went fairly smoothly. Whil e it might be expected that the percentage of students meeting performance standards increased with repetition, this was not seen as the difficulty level of similar problems was raised each time a particular topic was presented. PROPOSED ACTIONS FOR COURS E IMPROVEMENT: It was assumed that students had a better working knowledge of Matlab than they actually did, and this shortcoming will be addressed in next year's curriculum. PREPARER Hyle Park PREPARATION:July 3, 2011 236 BIEN 130L PREPARATION: July 15, 2010 COURSE: BIEN 130L (Bioinstrumentation Laboratory) ACADEMIC TERM: Spring 2010 INSTRUCTOR: B. Hyle Park EVALUATION BY INSTRUCTOR: CHANGES MADE THIS QUARTER BASED ON PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT RESULTS: Significant effort was made to introduce material in the co -requisite lecture course (BIEN 130) prior to its use in this laboratory course. Integration between the two courses was greatly enhanced this year as both were taught by the same instructor. SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENT RESULTS FOR THIS QUARTER: This quarter went fairly smoothly with the exception of 2 students, who failed to submit acceptable lab reports. Students felt the last two labs (hemoglobin and respiratory analysis) were a bit too scattered and random in nature, and that there was too muc h emphasis on circuitry through the first half of the class. PROPOSED ACTIONS FOR COURSE IMPROVEMENT: The course will be improved through increased emphasis on statistics and statistical analysis, a reworking of all labs to move away from a \"cookbook\" ty pe environment where students simply follow direction in favor of one in which they understand why certain steps and analysis are necessary and replacement of the hemoglobin lab with one on ultrasound imaging. PERSON(S) WHO PREPARED THIS DESCRIPTION Hyl e Park AND DATE OF PREPARATION: July 15, 2010 _______________________________ DATE OF PREPARATION: August 10, 2011 COURSE: BIEN 130L (Bioinstrumentation Laboratory) ACADEMIC TERM: Spring 2011 INSTRUCTOR: Huinan Liu EVALUATION BY INSTRUCTOR CHANGES MADE THIS QUARTER BASED ON PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT RESULTS: Significant efforts were made to encourage students' pre -lab preparation. The following three elements were added to facilitate students' learning: (1) added pre -lab introduction in the discussion two wee ks before the lab; 237 (2) added pre -lab review in the discussion before the lab; (3) added the pre -lab quizzes in the discussion to further involve students in pre -lab preparation. Through developing these three elements, students were much better prepared for the labs. Students read and understood the lab objectives and guidelines before entering the lab. Better prepared students were naturally moved away from a \"cookbook\" type of lab environment and they followed the lab guideline after they actually unde rstood the concepts, steps and analysis done in the lab. Communicate with the instructor (Dr. Hyle Park) for the co- requisite lecture course (BIEN 130) regularly to ensure the pace of 130 and 130L matches. As a result, the integration between the two cour ses was greatly enhanced. Syllabus Completed the lab policy in the course syllabus to improve transparency and fairness. SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENT RESULTS FOR THIS QUARTER: This quarter went smoothly except 1 student complained about grading on the circuit test. The standard point -by-point grading sheet was used throughout the test. However, due to the large size of the class, the instructor had to split the TAs to grade different sections using the same standard grading sheet. The correct answers are alway s the same, but the mistakes made by different students are always different. Instructor had to make a final judgment. Students commented: \"This course really taught me about the importance of bio instruments and I now have a much better understanding of t he electrical elements that make up bio sensors.\" \"I have been able to improve my circuit skills remarkably.\" \"Great course was able to learn a lot.\" PROPOSED ACTION FOR COURSE IMPROVEMENT: The course can be further improved if more instruments can be add ed to the teaching lab to accommodate more students concurrently for Lab 6, 7, 8. 238 BIEN 135 DATE OF PREPARATION: 07/22/2010 COURSE: BIEN 135 - Biophysics and Biothermodynamics Fall 2009 INSTRUCTOR: Dimitrios Morikis EVALUATION BY INSTRUCTOR: CHANGES MADE THIS QUARTER BASED ON PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT RESULTS: 1. Course Assessment for 2008- 2009 AY Homework problems were a significant medium for the comprehension of sometimes abstract concepts. Discussion sessions were taught by the pr ofessor and were highly interactive. Introduction of clickers with assessment of each question during discussion contributed to lively class interactions. 2. Recommendations for 2009- 2010 AY Change the textbook from van Holde, Johnson and Ho to Jackson. Since the incoming class is bigger, introduce weekly quizzes for better student assessment. Administer quizzes using clickers. Add a second in- class midterm exam. Request a Teaching Assistant. SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENT RESULTS FOR THIS QUARTER: As in previ ous year, homework problems were a significant medium for the comprehension of sometimes abstract concepts. Introduction of a second midterm was helpful in keeping the students alert and contributed in the continuity of the students' engagement with the cl ass material. Given the class size, Teaching Assistant was helpful for running highly interactive discussion sessions. Some discussion sessions were taught by the professor, who had the opportunity to communicate with the class in a more relaxed and interactive setting. Grading was performed jointly between the Teaching Assistant and the Professor. Use of clickers for quizzes, with assessment of each question during discussion, contributed to lively class interactions. Quizzes with clickers were a great le arning medium. Although students were not performing well in quizzes, they were knowledgeable when they subsequently encountered individual quiz questions during class or in exams. New textbook was not welcomed by the students. Although it covers a large variety of contemporary topics, it is more of a reference book rather than a self -contained textbook. In many topics the textbook referred to other books, instead of presenting first principles or working out examples. PROPOSED ACTIONS FOR COURSE IMPROVEMENT: Change the textbook back to van Holde, Johnson and Ho. Increase thermodynamics content in line with the textbook. 239 Keep the format of two midterms, one final, and several quizzes and homework problems.

Keep the format of two midterms, one final, and several quizzes and homework problems. SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENT RESULTS FOR THIS QUARTER: Topics in Biophysical methods were not covered to the extent of previous years because of more emphasis on problem solving and consequent time constraints. 240 Homework on drug design was not given because of time constraints, although the subject was well covered. Teaching Assistant, who had taken the class as an undergraduate at UCR, was helpful for running interactive discussi on sessions. As this was the fourth time the class was taught and the class material had become more standardized, the discussion sessions were the responsibility of the Teaching Assistant. As in previous years: Homework problems were a significant medium for the comprehension of sometimes abstract concepts. Two midterm exams were helpful in keeping the students alert and contributed in the continuity of the students' engagement with the class material. Quizzes were a great learning medium. Use of clickers for quizzes, with discussion following each question, contributed to lively class interactions. Grading was performed mainly by the very meticulous Teaching Assistant and was checked by the Professor. PROPOSED ACTIONS FOR COURSE IMPROVEMENT: Increase ti me spent on the survey of biophysical methods. This will increase % Meeting Standard of FE 3 of Table 2. Introduce a homework set on drug design. This will populate % Meeting Standard of FE 7 of Tables 1 and 2. Re-introduce a homework set in reading a pape r and writing an assay in conjunction with Homework 4 (hands -on work on computational protein modeling and analysis). This will increase % Meeting Standard of FE 8 of Table 2. Keep the format of two midterms, one final, and several quizzes and homework problems.

SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENT RESULTS FOR THIS QUARTER: The students' assessment of the course still varied between about 4 and 5, which showed that the quality of the course did not deteriorate with the increase in the s ize of the class, which was a big concern of mine in the beginning of the quarter. PROPOSED ACTIONS FOR COURSE IMPROVEMENT: 1. Increase the discussion time (one hour a week is not enough). Include more controversial topics on ethics and contemporary sc ience and engineering related to materials. 242 PERSON(S) WHO PREPARED THIS DESCRIPTION Valentine Vullev AND DATE OF PREPARATION: June 22, 2010 _________________________________ 243 BIEN 155 DATE OF PREPARATION: Sep.28th, 2009 COURSE: BIEN 155 Biotechnology Lab. 2 units ACADEMIC TERM: Fall 2009 INSTRUCTOR: Jiayu liao ACADEMIC TERM : Fall 2009 EVALUATION BY INSTRUCTOR: CHANGES MADE THIS QUARTER BASED ON PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT RESULTS: Based on previous two years outcomes and assessment, we have changed our experimental objective of expression and characterizations from Interferon alpha to two fluorescence proteins -CyPet -SUMO1 and Ypet -Ubc9 in order to increase the contents of modern bioengineering contents this year. SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENT RESULTS FOR THIS QUARTER: Students have developed and gained various abilities in a multidisciplinary team to conduct a series of bioengineering experiments to measure protein interactions using modern fluorescence technology -Forst Energy Transfer (FRET). Students have been able to understand and design a system including various components, such as DNA, bacterial cells, fluorescence proteins, electroporation apparatus, fluorescence imaging machine, spectroscopy, and high- throughput fluorescence plate reader, in order to detect protein interactions with the understandings of various realistic constraints. Students have developed effectively written and oral communication skills through experimental pr ocedure discussion, four written lab reports and final oral presentation. Students have gained completely understandings and practice with skills and techniques for a modern bioengineering project PROPOSED ACTIONS FOR COURSE IMPROVEMENT: Because the second experiment of pET28(b) expression vector cloning is too challenging and cloning techniques cannot be learned in just one experiment, we will remove this experiment. We will focus more on fluorescence protein characterizations, which have a widely applications in both academic and industry.

Lyubovitsky EVALUATION BY INSTRUCTOR: CHANGES MADE THIS QUARTER BASED ON PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT RESULTS: To achieve the learning outcomes more effectiv ely, more emphasis will be placed on group/class interactions and 'in- class' learning. More class time and emphasis will be placed on preparation for exams with examples specifically focused on what will be tested during the exam. The project requirement w ill be removed. The course will be restructured and consist of series of power point presentations. SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENT RESULTS FOR THIS QUARTER: The students did not have prior exposure to the fundamental concepts of dynamic/thermodynamic processes. To match the rate of learning, the amount of material presented to the students was reduced. Per students' assessment regarding meeting these reduced course outcomes (100% student responded at the last class of the quarter), about 35 % of students disagre e/strongly disagree that they were able to achieve 3 out of 5 outcomes. Out of 75% of students that responded to the numerical online evaluations, 50% had a low understanding of the course content.

This is a new course. SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENT RESULTS FOR THIS QUARTER: Hands -on computer projects were a significant medium for understanding and extending material taught in class. Discussion sessions, taught by the TA, included tutorials on the computer software used for the projects. Invited lectures were an excellent medium to provide detailed research ex amples, which were elaborations on material taught in class. PROPOSED ACTIONS FOR COURSE IMPROVEMENT: Change pre- requisites to BIEN 125 and BIEN 135. These include lower -division pre -requisites. Increase content on de novo protein design using computational methods. Include a sixth project on protein- ligand docking. Spend more time on QSAR methods for drug design.

Schultz Spring 2011 EVALUATION. CHANGES MADE THIS QUARTER BASED ON PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT RESULTS: Required teams to maintain a Gantt c hart to keep up with goals and benchmarks. Lectures were distributed over 15 week period so that students could get a good start on their design project Team reports were required each week, report writer was distributed among team members and report grades were factored into final grade for each student. SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENT RESULTS FOR THIS QUARTER: A method of requiring individual teams to meet with their faculty mentors on a weekly basis is needed. Several teams did not meet with their mentors frequently enough to avoid pitfalls in planning and implementing their projects. 249 A multidisciplinary component should be added to the course. PROPOSED ACTIONS FOR COURSE IMPROVEMENT: Make team meetings with mentors part of the grade for the team to encourage students to arrange these meetings. Connect the course with business students to provide multidisciplinary context and a better understanding of business aspects of bioengineering projects. Enhance the coverag e of ethics and global aspects of bioengineering in the course. ____________________________________ 250 Appendix H Bioengineering Office and Laboratory Facilities New Material Science and Engineering Building home of the Bioengineering Department 251 252 253 254 Appendix I Computer and Library Facilities Computer and Communications Overview Support Services Facilities and Infrastructure Other Services and Support C&C (which includes the Instructional Technology Group, Computing Infrastructure and Security, the Computer Support Group, and Communications) is under the direction of the Associate Vice Chancellor and CIO who reports to the Provost. The Instructional Technology Group, Computer Support Group, and Communications sub- units have primary responsibility for providing network access and general computing services to the UC Riverside campus. Support Services Instructional Technology Support C&C's Instructional Technology Group offers faculty and students technical and pedagogical support t hat is academic discipline specific. The Instructional Technology Group emphasize a \"hands -on\" approach to its services including Blackboard (learning management system) training and support and the management and support of campus site-licensed software. Classroom Technology Support C&C provides classroom technology support, services, and infrastructure services (e.g. connection to the wireless network, projection systems, etc.). UCR's best -of-breed technology -enabled classrooms include the following: o The capability to present materials from a wide variety of sources, including (at a minimum) DVD, document camera, a personal computer, laptop computer, and Internet. o Chalkboard or whiteboard that is available and viewable at the same time digital or ana log presentations are underway. o Combination of high- powered data projectors and/or lighting zone controls that allow students to take notes and view presentation material at the same time. o \"Self -service\" design which allows instruction to occur without the aid of technical operators and without the delivery of equipment. o Based on the academic discipline, sound systems and data projection resolution requirements may drive certain classroom minimum standards. 255 UCR has implemented \"clicker\" technology in all its classrooms. In actual use on this campus clicker technology has been shown to: o Increase attendance (sometimes dramatically) o Coax participation from normally non- participative students o Create a more engaging lecture environment Additionally, all UCR classrooms are equipped with podcasting capabilities. This can be in the form of audio podcasting or lecture capture as supported by Echo360 course capture technology. Students in these classrooms will have on- demand access to archived educational content as presented during lecture, including a video camera feed and classroom audio. General Technology Support C&C provides UCR faculty and students with technology to assist them in their instructional and academic pursuits. Services like e -mail, iLearn (Blackboard Learning Management System) and the wireless network ensure that all of UCR faculty and students stay connected with their colleagues, peers and the rest of the world. The Computer Support Group provides desktop computing support for faculty and staff. Services include consulting on hardware, software and networking, plus assistance with acquiring, learning and using stand- alone or networked microcomputers (Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and UNIX platforms). Services offered incl ude telephone support, on-site and carry -in services, on- line remote support, a knowledgebase and software downloads. C&C also implemented and spearhead the Microcomputer Support Specialist (MSS) program, which provides decentralized departmental support. Multimedia Development and Research Visualization Support This group provides innovative and creative full service web and graphic design for the UCR campus and community. With fully integrated, back- end programming solutions tailored to each client's specific needs, the group supports university's efforts to secure extramural funds and the campus' various outreach efforts. Facilities and Infrastructure Computer Labs Student Computing Services maintains four public computer labs featuring approximately 149 computers available for academic use by all UCR students, with open hours of approximately 160 hours per week. Faculty instructing a course may reserve the public co mputing facilities for instructional use or request to have software installed on the machines. Lab assistance and software checkout is available in the labs. C&C provides research software (SAS, SPSS, Mathematica) in most public computer labs. 256 Classro oms and Learning Spaces The Multimedia Technologies Group maintains all of UCR's general assignment classrooms that have been equipped with data/video projectors, document cameras, DVD players, PC computer on the network, computer interface for laptop use rs and network connections. Lecture halls are also equipped with wireless microphones and multiple (two to three) projection systems. Their commitment to instructional technology has led the design and implementation of \"smarter\" classrooms, such as the Flex Rooms and the Hyperstruction Studio. These rooms feature mobile furniture, whiteboards on every wall, and multiple projection systems. All general assignment classrooms are equipped with a multimedia controller maintained by C&Cs Multimedia Technolo gies Group for operation the various presentation technologies and audio equipment. Internet connectivity is via a robust wired and wireless network. Each controller has a \"Help\" button for the instructor to alert technicians if there is a problem with the equipment. A help desk is staffed full time, and at least one field technician is available on campus during instructional hours. Either the help desk (working remotely) or the field technician (in the classroom) can quickly resolve any problem that occurs. In a survey (most recently conducted in 2011), 90% of instructors responded that UCR's available classroom technology either \"Completely\" or \"Mostly\" met their pedagogical needs. Research Technology As part of UCR's Cyberinfrastructure (CI) strategy , C&C supports three computational cluster support models. These include departmentally maintained clusters, dedicated clusters, and a shared collaborative cluster. Three programs are described as follows: 1. A centrally managed, standardized/dedicated clust er of processors, in which researchers pay an annual fee for essentially unlimited use. 2. A collaborative computational cluster, in which each PI can buy a certain amount of hardware, which Computing and Communications will manage. The PI has priority access to the equipment that he or she acquired, plus access to the entire cluster as available. UCR's collaborative cluster provides a shared system as a computing resource for campus researchers with limited financial resources. 3. Departmentally maintaine d clusters, centrally managed. This type of cluster is meant for researchers who have computing needs that fall outside of the campus cluster standards. These systems are built to particular PI/lab/center specifications and managed by PI funded staff, but housed within C&C's data center with C&C C&C also provides other research technology support, ranging from network creation / configuration, colocation support, budget preparation / equipment configuration, and cloud services provisioning. 257 Wired and Wireless Networks UCR supports 1,200+ wireless access points that provide wireless connectivity to approximately 8,000 concurrent users daily. Additionally, the campus network backbone consists of 10 GB fiber -optic connections, with a minimum of 1 GB capacity to each building on campus. The campus has more than 500,000 feet of air blown fiber conduit, which enables the addition of fiber connectivity essentially \"on demand\". Library Collections Books Engineering books are acquired as part of the Orbach Science Library's purchasing profile, ordered from catalogs or suggested by students, faculty, and staff. Within the past three years, the library has initiated the purchase of engineering e -books and currently supports and maintains a collection of thousands of electronic books in the discipline. The Libraries provides licensed access to all of the current Springer books online, many of the e -books from the CRC EngNetBase, the Knovel Collection, the Wiley Online collection and many more. Recently, thro ugh a special competitive initiative, the UCR Libraries has brought to our campus, from its former Berkeley location, the extensive and world class Water Resources and Archives Collection (WRCA) containing many materials relevant to dam and bridge construc tion which is also available to engineering students and researchers from across UCR and the UC system. Journals The Libraries currently subscribe to 121 engineering print journals, and Engineering students have access to a vast collection of online j ournals ( 94,770 unique titles). UCR maintains access, for example, to all of the journals and proceedings of IEEE, OSA, MRS, and ACM, as well as either proceedings or journals from many other societies. Faculty, staff, and students may suggest new books, journals or other media to be purchased by the library. Library users may request materials that are not available on campus through Interlibrary Loans, and the materials will be made available to them at no cost in a very reasonable amount of time. Rese arch (Journal Article) Databases UC Riverside engineering students have access to a number of journal databases to assist them in their research in engineering and in other areas of study. Through co- investments with the other eight UC campuses and the Ca lifornia Digital Library (CDL) Inspec, Compendex, and the Web of Science as well as SciFinder Scholar for chemistry and chemical engineering and Biosis or MEDLINE for biotechnological literature are all available to engineering faculty and students. UCR al so licenses Water Resources 258 Abstracts locally with the arrival on our campus in 2010 of the Water Resources Archives and Collections.
