Its a quick intro read I think you'll enjoy! The genesis of crystals is at the heart of our planet where the action of intense pressure and temperature shifts produces materials with a regular molecular structure organized in a lattice pattern. Since ancient times, humans have been drawn to the useful properties of crystals as well as to their aesthetic beauty. The use of crystals in healing rituals dates back to at least 4000 B.C. The historical and archeological record shows that many ancient cultures independently used crystals for this purpose, including the Native Americans, Egyptians, Chinese, Tibetans, Celts, Romans, Greeks and Sumerians. Often, the crystals were used as part of the practice of laying-on of stones on the body, but crystals were also ground up and used in various medicines and potions. How are Crystals Used in Healing? Many people believe the key to understanding the human body is to understand the way that energy is distributed and flows around the body. They believe there are seven [chakra points](https://blog.mindvalley.com/7-chakras/) in the body representing the major energy centers. These chakras can become blocked by illness, stress and emotional pain. Therefore, unblocking the chakras can lead to healing. Crystal healers believe each chakra has its own color and vibratory rate and that by laying the correct crystals at the appropriate chakra point on the body, the intent of the healer and the energy and vibration of the crystal will combine to create a slight energy shift which will unblock the chakra and release the energy. In a formal crystal healing session, the patient will lie flat on a couch or table. The healer will then lay fifty or more crystals on the seven chakra points of their body. They may also place stones in the hands and on the feet of the patient. Crystals are also used more holistically in healing. For example, they may be used as an aid in meditation, worn as jewelry or placed around the home for specific effects. Is there a Scientific Basis for Crystal Healing? Although there is currently no scientific proof that [crystal healing](https://www.livescience.com/40347-crystal-healing.html) works, some of the concepts that underpin the theory of crystal healing are similar to the way crystals are already successfully used in other contexts. It is widely accepted that crystals emit energy and they vibrate at different frequencies. The properties of crystals such as quartz, that transmit and transform data and energy, are already used extensively in computer chips, time-keeping, electronics and data storage. Choosing the Right Crystals for Your Purpose If you want to give crystal healing a try, experts in the art suggest tapping into your intuition when you choose your crystals. The energy and vibration of certain crystals may be a better match for you than others, and these crystals will effectively call out to you if you can quiet yourself enough to hear them. To check if a stone is right for you, hold it loosely in your hand and notice how you feel. If you can sense any kind of energy such as changes in temperature, a sense of wellness, an infusion of vibrancy or a feeling of calmness, then that crystal may be a good choice for healing. Every crystal is part of a family of stones that shares several characteristics. Many of the crystals commonly used by crystal healers fall into the quartz or chalcedony families. These include crystals such as amethyst, citrine, jasper, agate, and onyx. Each color and variation of stone within each type also has a defined use. If you have a specific healing need in mind, then it's a good idea to choose crystals which are believed to assist with that particular type of issue. There are many detailed books and online guides that explain the different crystal properties. Preparing Your Crystals for Use Cleansing Experienced crystal users strongly recommend you take the time to cleanse your crystals before you use them for healing purposes, just like you would sterilize medical equipment in between uses. The idea is that cleansing the crystal will release any stuck energy and erase any previous intentions that might have been programmed into the crystal. There are several different ways you can do this. If you live near the ocean or close to a fast-flowing stream, you can immerse your crystal in the water for several hours. Alternatively, bury the crystal in good soil overnight to reconnect it to the energy of the earth. You can also bathe the crystal in the light of the sun and moon for at least 24 hours or, if speed is important, you can hold the stone over a burning sage stick for around five minutes. Programming your crystal with your intentions Once your crystals are cleansed, they are ready for you to download your intentions. Crystal healers believe your thoughts shape the energy and vibration of a crystal so that it can perform its role in healing. Therefore, before you use a crystal in healing, you need to hold it and think about what you are trying to achieve. Tune in to your intuition to feel when your crystal is ready to use. Final Thoughts Although the power of crystals to heal is not proven, many people find them both fascinating and strangely appealing. Bringing some crystals into your home or wearing some beautiful crystal jewelry, as well as laying them on the body in healing rituals, are all ways you can enjoy and benefit from these wonderful objects.
