Chairman V ander W oude called the meeting to order at 9:00 a.m. MOTION: Rep. Dixon (24) made a motion to approve the minutes of the January 1 1, 2023, meeting. Motion carried by voice vote. RS 29988: Rep. Jordan Redman , District 3, presented RS 29988 to repeal an obsolete T itle 56 chapter for the food stamp revolving fund which was created in 1941 and not used in the past forty-five years. Answering a question he said there are no other references to the revolving fund in Idaho Code. MOTION: Rep. Blanksma made a motion to introduce RS 29988. Motion carried by voice vote. RS 29987: T im Frost , Deputy Administrator , Division of Occupational and Professional Licenses (DOPL), presented RS 29987 on behalf of the Board of Pharmacy . As a regulatory provision of the Uniform Controlled Substance Act updates have been made to mirror the federal controlled substance schedules. Multiple synthetic opioids are placed into Schedule I, a substance to treat insomnia is added to Schedule IV , and an anti-seizure medication is made part of Schedule V . MOTION: Rep.

RS 29910C1: T im Frost, Deputy Administrator , DOPL, on behalf of the Board of Medicine, presented RS 29910C1 , proposed legislation to remove an outdated supervision requirement, clean up definition language, remove an obsolete annual physician assistant advisory committee report, and properly reference the occupational licenses fund. MOTION: Rep. Blanksma made a motion to introduce RS 29910C1. Motion carried by voice vote. Chairman V ander W oude put the committee at ease at 9:15 a.m. The committee was called to order at 9:27 a.m. Josh Scholer , Bureau Chief, Regulatory and Legislative Af fairs, Division of Financial Management (DFM), presented an overview of the legislative Administrative Rules review . He explained any board, commission, or agency must have statutory authority before any rules can be promulgated. They must also follow the Administrative Procedures Act, which includes public comment parameters. There are three types of rules: temporary , proposed, and pending. T emporary rules are in place within limitations. First drafts are proposed rules. Pending rules are the final draft which comes before the legislature. Within the pending rules are two sub-types: fee and non-fee. Fee rules impose one or more fees and must be approved by a concurrent resolution in order to go into ef fect. Non-fee rules go into ef fect upon unless rejected. Mr . Scholer described the rulemaking process, including formal and informal negotiating. Responding to questions, he said a rule or section of rule not approved by the committee would revert back to the previous existing language. The committee has to accept or reject a rule in whole or in part. They are not able to add words or reject partial sentences. Zero Based Regulation (ZBR) is an Executive Order established in 2020 and continues until 2026. A reduction tool built of f of the Red T ape Reduction Act of 2019, it is used to simplify statute through clarification and removing duplicated or obsolete chapters. The agencies review the evidence behind the rule and analyze both the prospective and cost benefit. The process includes public meetings and publication of the prospective analysis. This is a step-by-step process, not a random reduction. The legislative review authority is located in the Idaho Constitution, Article III, Section 29. It occurs every legislative session and provides another opportunity for the public and stakeholders to weigh in on the rules. The statute states any administrative rule, whether presented to the committee or not, can be reviewed. During such review , the legislature may approve or reject a rule, in whole or in part. Additionally , approval or rejection of a rule is not subject to gubernatorial veto. Unless extended, the rules expire every year by June 30. Responding to committee questions, Mr . Scholer reiterated a single word cannot be rejected. In such a case, the entire subsection where the word is housed would have to be rejected. If a new rule chapter is rejected there is nothing to go into ef fect. If an existing chapter with changes is rejected in its entirety , the chapter reverts to what it was before the changes. Fee rules require both legislative bodies to agree through a concurrent resolution. A concurrent resolution is also used when rejecting a non-fee rule. Discussions continue regarding statute changes for this process. Pending rules are not in ef fect without legislative approval. T emporary rules can go into ef fect immediately , with an ef fective date stipulation. There is a gentlemen's agreement additional rules are not created during the legislative session. This is because any temporary rule necessary during the session would probably not allow stakeholders and their representatives to voice concern, which is not transparent. Answering further questions, Mr . Scholer said part of his division's process for vetting rules is asking if the changes have been proposed previously . If the response is af firmative a conversation begins on the reason for repeating the proposed changes. He further assured the committee he and his of fice are willing to meet with any member regarding any rule. Chairman V ander W oude turned the gavel over to V ice Chairman Erickson . DOCKET NO. 16-0103-2201: W ayne Denny , Bureau Chief, Bureau of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and Preparedness, presented Docket No. 16-0103-2201 , EMS Agency Licensure. The updates include adding verbatim sections moved from the data collection rule chapter and incorporation of the data collection standards manual. The changes align with the National EMS Information System. HOUSE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE T uesday , January 17, 2023\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 2 MOTION: Rep.

DOCKET NO. 16-0418-2201: Frede' T eske , Program Manager , Therapeutic and Residential Program, Division of Licensing and Certification, Department of Health and W elfare (DHW), presented Docket No. 16-0418-2201 . In order to reduce confusion by stakeholders, this new chapter separates programs licensed by the Division of Licensing and Certification from those licensed by the Division of Family and Community Services and the Division of W elfare. The content of the current Child Care Licensing chapter was used, reorganized, streamlined, and simplified. This chapter impacts children's agencies, children's therapeutic outdoor programs, children's residential care facilities, children's camps, and children's substance abuse treatment facilities licensed by this division. MOTION: Rep. Blanksma made a motion to approve Docket No. 16-0418-2201. Motion carried by voice vote. Rep. Gallagher requested to be recorded as voting NA Y . DOCKET NO. 16-0601-2201: Kaela Whitehead , Program Specialist, DHW , Division of Family and Community Services, presented Docket No. 16-0601-2201 . This rule change reflects the legislative approved foster parent rate increase which became ef fective April 1, 2022. She noted many foster parents have expressed their gratitude for the increase. The change provides consistency for both in- and out-of-state applications. MOTION: Rep. Healey made a motion to approve Docket No. 16-0601-2201. Motion carried by voice vote. DOCKET NO. 16-0602-2201: Kaela Whitehead , Program Specialist, DHW , Division of Family and Community Services, presented Docket No. 16-0602-2201 . This chapter , renamed \"Child Care And Foster Care Licensing,\" has been rewritten to streamline and align the rule with standards identified in public law . Model licensing standards are added to assure safe physical surroundings for children in foster homes. The number of children allowed in a home has been increased to six. This aligns with federal requirements and allows for additional children based on specific criteria. There is no fiscal impact on any funds. Answering a question regarding the number of families with five or more children in their home, Ms. Whitehead said she will provide the number for the committee. There are 1,017 licensed foster families in Idaho. MOTION: Rep. Rubel made a motion to approve Docket No. 16-0602-2201 . Responding to further questions, Ms. Whitehead shared an example of when an exemption for additional children would occur . As of January 17, 2023, there are 1,500 foster children within Idaho, with 1,017 foster placements. This rule provides transparency for the existing clinical assessment process. Aubrie Hunt , Program Manager , Childcare and Payments, Division of Self Reliance, was invited to answer a committee question. She explained daycare licensing was historically included with the Division of Family and Community Services. Because they rely on the same regulations, the inclusion continues. SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep. Mitchell made a motion to approve Docket No. 16-0602-2201 with the exception of Section 100, Subsections 5 and 6. Ms. Hunt said Section 100 contains specific daycare licensing programs, is in alignment with state statute, and has been added for clarity . Concern was expressed regarding other daycare licensing sections within the rule, mixing the two subjects beyond what is necessary , and the large task of splitting apart the two topics. It was noted the daycare sections are important provisions to help working foster care families. AMENDED SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep. Rubel made an amended substitute motion to HOLD Docket No. 16-0602-2201 in committee for time certain to be determined by the chair . Motion carried by voice vote. DOCKET NO. 16-0601-2202: Julie Sevcik , Project Manager , DHW , Division of Family and Community Services, presented Docket No. 16-0601-2202 . In 2018 the Family First Act became ef fective and allowed use of federal funds to prevent children at risk from entering foster care. Idaho is in the final steps to receive federal approval of the five-year prevention plan which outlines defining requirements for use of these funds. The Core Child and Family Services section updates reflect the use of evidence-based prevention services. This includes services for mental health, substance use prevention and treatment, and in-home parent skill-based programs. The rule also clarifies the setting of rates and notifications to providers. Service costs are covered by state general funds and federal grants. State funds will continue to be used and are estimated to be less than $100,000 during the first twelve months the new services are available. These costs will increase with new services and will be initially eligible for T itle IV -E funds at 50% of the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) through 2026 and will then increase to the full FMAP rate of just under 71%, after 2026. MOTION: Rep. Dixon (24) made a motion to approve Docket No. 16-0601-2202. Motion carried by voice vote. DOCKET NO. 16-0208-2201: James A ydelotte , State Registrar , Bureau Chief, Bureau of V ital Records and Health Statistics, Division of Public Health, DHW , presented Docket No. 16-0208-2201 . The changes bring the vital statistics rules into alignment with legislation passed in 2022. The Idaho T ransportation Department issues a no-fee identification card for individuals experiencing homelessness, removing job & housing barriers. Because a birth certificate is necessary for this card, the certificate fee is waived. The second change allows adoptees born on or after July 1, 2022, to access birth records after they reach 18 years of age. Additional changes maintain consistency . MOTION: Rep. Rubel made a motion to approve Docket No. 16-0208-2201. Motion carried by voice vote.

Chairman V ander W oude called the meeting to order at 9:02 a.m. He reminded the committee pursuant to Idaho Code \u00a756-267, subsection 7, the House and Senate Health and W elfare committees must review Medicaid expansion and make a recommendation to the legislature whether or not the expansion should remain in ef fect. This presentation provides the information necessary to make the recommendation. Dave Jeppesen , Director , Department of Health and W elfare (DHW) said the DHW is committed to providing legislators with the information to make necessary decisions. All Department members will be available for any questions or follow-up. Juliet Charron , Administrator , Medicaid Division, DHW , came before the committee. As of January , 2023, there are approximately 145,000 enrolled Medicaid participants. The expansion provides coverage to non-disabled adults whose annual household income falls below 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL). She shared the profiles of a few individuals who, through the expansion, have improved their health and can now better support their families. The top utilization categories are pharmacy , inpatient hospital services, outpatient hospital services, and non-hospital medical visits. When compared to the traditional adult population, the average utilization is lower . The expansion was implemented at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since implementation, 867 participants have had inpatient hospital stays ($21.3M) and 6,715 have had outpatient hospital visits ($3.4M). Without the expansion, the cost of providing care to uninsured and under-insured individuals would have fallen to the state, counties and providers. Serious mental illness (SMI) was diagnosed in 24% of the expansion participants in state fiscal year (SFY) 2022. The number of participants requiring behavioral health (BH) hospital stays totaled 2,400. Additional impacts tied to BH needs were: 2,500 emergency room (ER) visits, 4,600 partial hospitalization admissions, and outpatient BH services for 13,000 participants. As a prevention focus, participants are assigned a Primary Care Provider to support their use of services. There were 154,815 primary care visits for expansion members in SFY22. Preventive services are prioritized to keep the expansion population healthy , reduce avoidable hospitalizations, and contain costs. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) mandated continuous Medicaid enrollment throughout the federal COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE) for nearly all of those enrolled in Medicaid on or after March 18, 2020. As of April 1, 2023, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 ended the continuous enrollment requirement. Beginning February 1, 2023, it will take six months to complete the redeterminations and notify individuals protected by the FFCRA if they no longer qualify . The DHW has identified 151k Medicaid participants to notify . Of that group, approximately 67k are expansion participants. Some participants are expected to move to Y our Health Idaho (YHI). Medicaid expansion is 22.90% of the Medicaid budget. The current federal funding amount is $.90 out of every dollar spent. The budget drivers include case load increases, higher than projected service utilizations, higher adult coverage cost, supplemental payment to hospitals (UPL), and reimbursement rate fee schedule updates. The SFY24 Medicaid expansion budget request of $1,035,766,800 consists of $803,028,800 in federal funds, $67,423,200 in general funds, $20,901,600 in dedicated funds (including UPL), and $144,413,300 in receipts. Methods of cost containment include participation in the Healthy Connections V alue Care. Through this method primary care providers focus on prevention and are paid for value over volume. The expansion population has been included as of performance year two, which is 2023. The Division of Financial Management contracted with a consultant to review Medicaid cost containment opportunities. The interim report was published in December and is being reviewed. Most of the recommendations are not specific to Medicaid expansion. Since the Medicaid expansion was implemented in 2020, providers have seen lower costs and increased revenue. The burden on Idaho and the counties to help the indigent and uninsured population has been alleviated. The federal match now includes BH costs. Through reduced health care costs and increased productivity , a healthier workforce is supported. Without Medicaid expansion, approximately $77.7M from general funds would be needed as ex-participants access services. Of the $77.7M, $28,877,642 would be utilized for BH, $1.9M for public health, $12M for the Catastrophic Health Care Program (CA T), $24M to help the medically indigent, $708k for the drug courts, and $10,242,200 for the Department of Correction. Participants would lose access to potential life-saving care, such as cancer treatment. Coverage gaps would impose financial pressures on providers. Lack of preventative care access could lead to increased ER use, which is more costly . The increased local government burden could lead to the need for local taxes and higher rates for charity care. Employers not of fering health insurance would be faced with a less healthy workforce. Answering questions, Ms. Charron explained states adopting the expansion early in the process received a 100% federal match, which had reduced to 90% when Idaho proceeded with the expansion. Removal of participants from the program is not retroactive. She reiterated the SFY24 request reflects a decrease in general funds and an increase in federal funds based on the UPL and receipts. JOINT HOUSE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE SENA TE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE Monday , January 23, 2023\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 2 The eligibility system has the staf f and technology to support ongoing determinations. This has given Idaho an edge over other states who have not done ongoing determinations and the lengthy process they face. This has also provided the ineligible participants quality information for the six-month completion plan. The PHE prohibits any recovery of funds. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) would prohibit eligibility termination prior to completion of the redetermination process. Should the process not be followed, Idaho would be at risk for a federal disallowance and loss of funds. Responding to a request, Ms. Charron gave an update on the waivers filed for the Medicaid expansion. The 1 1 15 waiver for BH inpatient services was approved and implemented. The YHI or Medicaid choice waiver was determined by CMS to be incomplete and would have no further action. CMS just informed them both the W ork Requirement Demonstration and the Family Planning Services waivers will have no action taken during this administration. Statutes exist for the Department's team to connect participants with primary care providers upon enrollment. Statute also requires a co-pay for non-emergency ER visits. Individuals with an annual household income at 138% FPL or higher are ineligible for Medicaid expansion and are referred to YHI, where they may be eligible for a tax credit to reduce the insurance cost. Ms. Charron explained every state of fers dif ferent Medicaid services and FPLs. Idaho has a basic benefits package with the addition of adult dental services. She noted geography becomes a challenge for connecting rural participants and providers. The projected expansion cost underestimated the service utilization and case load. There is no Medicaid advertising beyond general information available on their website. A number of Health Connection resources are also found on the website. Shane Leach , Administrator , Division of Self-Reliance, was invited to answer a committee question. He said beginning February 1, 2023, over six months, batches of 30k eligibility notices will be sent out each month. CMS requires the recipients to have sixty days to respond to the notices. Answering questions, Ms. Charron stated she will provide the following follow up information: the impact of not continuing Medicaid expansion, the amount of pharmacy and psychotropic drug spending for this population, a breakdown of provider types within the primary care network, the correlation between Idaho and other states for the number of disabled participants, the participants impacted by the estate recovery program, information on the use of hormone therapy within the program, the dental spend outside of preventative care, original expansion projections vs. actual costs (year-by-year format), and information, if possible, for ER visits pre and post Medicaid expansion. She will also provide additional information on cost recovery for out-of-state Medicaid eligible individuals. She said the information would be provided to the committees by Friday , January 27, 2023.

RS 29968: T im Frost , Deputy Administrator , Division of Occupational and Professional Licenses (DOPL), presented RS 29968 on behalf of the Health Professions Bureau. This proposed legislation creates the Idaho Allied Health Professionals Board. It will combine the boards for physical therapy licensure, dietetic licensure, occupational therapy licensure, athletic trainers, and respiratory therapy licensure. The downsize to one nine-member board will result in fewer board meetings and lower costs. MOTION: Rep. Blanksma made a motion to introduce RS 29968. Motion carried by voice vote. Chairman V ander W oude asked the committee for their input regarding the continuation of Medicaid expansion. Responses included the need for extending the reporting time frame in order to analyze the expansion during a non-pandemic period. Concern was expressed regarding the increased budget request and lack of cost controls when one-third of the participants are expected to be ineligible. Additional concern was voiced regarding focusing on fiscal issues and not the benefits. Ross Edmunds , Administrator , Division of Behavioral Health (BH), was invited to share how the expansion has provided an improved continuum of services, especially for individuals with chronic health conditions. Improved physical health directly impacts BH. Without Medicaid expansion, BH services would be limited and not include general health care. Dave Jeppeson , Director , Department of Health and W elfare (DHW), stated Idaho would pay $20M to return to the previous limited array of BH services. The current services have allowed these individuals to stay in their homes, have jobs, and contribute to society . Without the expansion a large group of individuals who fall below the 138% federal poverty limit (FPL) would again be uninsured. He and Mr . Edmunds emphasized BH and mental health (MH) are treatable conditions. These individuals are inclined to be violent towards themselves, not the public. Director Jeppeson stated the 2024 budget request was formulated prior to the removal of the public health emergency . CMS requires a full determination process before anyone can be determined no longer eligible and removed. Not following these guidelines would result in serious fines.

RS 29912C1: Rep. Dori Healey , District 15, presented RS 29912C1 . This proposed legislation removes the sunset date set when the Maternity Mortality Review Committee was established in 2019. The removal is necessary because the importance of this committee has been substantiated and it needs to be continued. MOTION: Rep. Wheeler made a motion to introduce RS 29912C1. Motion carried by voice vote. RS 30212: Rep. Dori Healey , District 15, presented RS 30212 , proposed legislation for the Conrad J-1 V isa W aiver which removes cumbersome restrictions to allow more physicians to participate in the program. Answering a question, she explained the provider time frame reduction does not impact the application process. MOTION: Rep. Dixon (24) made a motion to introduce RS 30212. Motion carried by voice vote. RS 30213: Rep. Dori Healey , District 15, presented RS 30213 . The Rural Nurse Loan Repayment Program addresses the in-demand critical access hospital need for nurses by of fering to pay their student loans. The participants would have to stay at the institution for four years in order to have their loans repaid. MOTION: Rep. Dixon (24) made a motion to introduce RS 30213. Motion carried by voice vote. H 28: T im Frost , Deputy Administrator , Division of Occupational and Professional Licenses, presented H 28 . This legislation creates the Allied Health Professionals Board (AHPB) by combining the boards for physical therapy licensure, dietetic licensure, occupational therapy licensure, athletic trainers, and respiratory therapy licensure into one board to regulate each of the licensees. This consolidation is consistent with combinations made by other boards in the past and in alignment with other states. There are no changes to their scope of practice, ability to work, or public safety . This will lower expenses through fewer board meetings and members. It will also impact future funding allocation. MOTION: Rep. Rubel made a motion to send H 28 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Answering questions, Mr . Frost explained the physical and occupational therapist boards are independent and oversee licensure, discipline and rule making. The other three boards are under the Board of Medicine (BOM) and have no voting authority . Each listed board has a very low cash balance, which would not be enough to handle any litigation and could impact their decisions. He said the stakeholders are being contacted. SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep. Healey made a substitute motion to HOLD H 28 in committee for time certain, fourteen days. Jody Lester , Idaho Society of Respiratory Care, testified in opposition to H 28 , stating there are no licensure or operating issues which would cause the consolidation. The new board would only have one lay person to represent the public. The BOM has been responsive to their recommendations. Megan Doyle , Idaho Occupational Therapist Association, testified in opposition to H 28 . She shared concern regarding future therapists deciding to go other states because of the combined board. Jessica Kerns , Idaho Athletic T rainers Association, testified in opposition to H 28 . She shared concerns regarding the lack of transparency and contact during the creation of this legislation. The unique relationship they have with the supervising physician is reflected in their current board. There would only be one board member who would have any understanding regarding their profession. T im Olson , Pinnacle Business Group, representing Dietitians, testified in opposition to H 28 . He voiced confusion regarding the cost ef fectiveness when the existing board is limited to one meeting a year and the new board would have multiple meetings. Jonathan Gardunia , President, American Physical Therapy Association, testified in opposition to H 28 , stating an independent board better regulates, enforces, and protects the public through peer and public members. AMENDED SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep. Wheeler made an amended substitute motion to HOLD H 28 in committee. In closing remarks Mr . Frost emphasized there are no statutory authority changes. The AHPB allows all of the participants to have a vote, which is not experienced by the BOM participants. This is a fiscally responsible step to continue to protect the public. VOTE ON AMENDED SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Chairman V ander W oude stated he was in doubt regarding the voice vote and requested a roll call vote.

Chairman V ander W oude called the meeting to order at 9:00 a.m. MOTION: Rep. Dixon (24) made a motion to approve the minutes of the January 26, 2023, meeting. Motion carried by voice vote. Michael Heifetz , Director , Sellers Dorsey , presented information regarding the interim report on Idaho Medicaid Cost Containment, in compliance with a Request For Proposal (RFP). The first phase of the evaluation reviews short-term cost containment methods in the interim report. The next report will be a long-term review of the program with suggested areas of cost reduction. When giving recommendations, the access to care and workforce are of foremost consideration. Stakeholders include legislators, member families, and many others. The fiscal year (FY) 2022 Medicaid claims expenditures reflect the highest weekly expenses for non-hospital medical and pharmacy categories. Hospital claims provide the highest expenditures. The target general fund savings of $45M was exceeded by the report recommendations, which totalled $65.7M. Of the thirteen areas for savings, professional services ($21M) is the largest amount. The report recommends an across-the-board 7.5% rate decrease for professional services, although such a dramatic reduction could lead to access challenges. He further explained the suggested savings for hospital reimbursements, developmental disabilities services, value-based purchasing initiatives, adult dental benefits. Withholding school based service (SBS) claims will improve processing. An increased provider assessment for long-term care nursing facilities will generate additional federal revenue. T ransportation recommendations include reducing both per-member per-month and ambulance rates. Recommendations include reductions in the pay-to-cost ratio, reimbursements, and single case agreement expenditures. Standardization and compliance are recommended for rate reviews and wage pass-through requirements. It is suggested the primary care case management program and adult dental benefits be removed or suspended. After the next steps are completed the final recommendations will be made in April, 2023, as stipulated in the RFP . Answering questions, Mr . Heifetz said the decisions are not easy to make and some will have minimal impact. These are short-term cost savings. The down-stream ef fects could include access issues. Any general fund reductions will also reduce the federal match funds. The final recommendation will be unique to Idaho. The pharmacy increased costs have a base driver in the number of high-end products being prescribed. The Medicaid team is providing good management with their limited ability for negotiation of pharmaceutical products. A possible long-term component is a waiver giving the team permission to talk to drug companies in a more ef fective way . The Medicaid team is doing an impressive job, but will hit critical mass in a couple of areas in the near future. There is no statewide consensus for adult dental benefits. Federal agreement will be needed because Medicaid is a partnership between Idaho and the federal government.

Chairman V ander W oude called the meeting to order at 9:00 a.m. MOTION: Rep. Roberts made a motion to approve the minutes of the January 31, 2023, meeting. Motion carried by voice vote. Pat Kelly , Executive Director , Y our Health Idaho (YHI) presented the insurance exchange's annual report. Key accomplishments include elimination of a backlog, deployment of real-time eligibility , and installation of a new telephony platform. Approximately 78k Idahoans are enrolled with YHI and enrollments remain consistent throughout the year . The stability is driven by enhanced tax credits, advertising, and real-time eligibility . The financial position follows a fiscally conservative business model, with a cash reserve equivalency of six to nine months of operating costs. There is also a capital expenditure reserve. Assets include the building, equipment, and technology . Income is derived from assessment fees for every plan sold and rent from the building purchased in 2020. Operating expenses are predominately employee costs, marketing, and technology . In 2022 real-time eligibility went live and the new telephony platform was integrated. Open enrollment began two weeks earlier than any other state. This provided additional time to avoid historical disruption to the holiday season. Mr . Kelly described how the agents, brokers, and enrollment professionals work with three-quarters of all enrollees. Partnerships with the Department of Insurance, Department of Health and W elfare (DHW), GetInsured, and Sharpen CX made the easier enrollment period possible. For open enrollment 2023, three new carriers are added for a total of eight medical carriers and four dental carriers. In-person events returned in 2022, building relationships with Idahoans in their home towns. The Hispanic community represents the largest uninsured population and YHI invested in these relationships by attending events and providing a critical link for their health insurance. The \"Always Present\" advertising campaign was a major contributor of enrollment and revenue stability . With Medicaid continuous coverage provisions ending in April, YHI continues to work closely with the DHW to assist those who may be eligible for the Advanced Premium T ax Credit. Focus continues on areas of opportunity to further improve the customer experience. Since its inception, YHI has delivered on the original vision to deliver Idaho solutions, by Idahoans, for Idahoans. The lowest operating costs of any state-based exchange in the country have been maintained along with one of the highest per capita enrollments. Answering questions, Mr . Kelly said the telephony platform allows communication via text directly with the consumer , provides a live chat function, and captures history for any additional contact. There are an estimated 30k Idahoans moving from Medicaid expansion who may be tax credit eligible. One-third of YHI enrollees pay nothing for their plans due to the tax credit. YHI does not receive federal dollars. T ax credits are paid directly to the insurance carriers from the Department of the T reasury . Consumers discontinued from Medicaid will receive a YHI enrollment notice, the specifics of which are still being formalized. The assessment fee, which began at a rough estimate of 1.5%, is now at 2.49% with no anticipated increase through 2029. The sixty-day allowance for those leaving Medicaid is typical for persons experiencing qualifying life events. Follow up contact is planned during the sixty-day period.

Chairman V ander W oude called the meeting to order at 9:02 a.m. MOTION: Rep. Dixon (24) made a motion to approve the minutes of the January 30, 2023, meeting. Motion carried by voice vote. UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST : Chairman V ander W oude asked unanimous consent to amend his motion made January 8, 2023, for Docket No. 16-0612-2201 to include in the exceptions Section 602.02. There being no objection, the request was granted. H 63: Rep. Julianne Y oung , District 30, presented H 63 . This legislation provides conscience protection for counselors and therapists and recognizes the need for them to disclose their values so a client can choose a counselor with consistent values. Answering questions, Rep. Y oung explained this is a relationship between individuals who need to be unified in a single set of values and insures the coordinated referral to a more suitable counselor or therapist when there is a conflict. Dr . Chad Y ates , Idaho Counseling Association (ICA), Current Public Policy Legislative Chairman, testified in opposition to H 63 which contradicts the code of ethics. Allowing referrals when there are value conflicts can pose a danger to a client and lead to legal action. T raining includes working with individuals regardless of their values. The ICA was not consulted during the development of this legislation. Amanda Arnold , ICA Member , testified in opposition to H 63 . This will put clients at risk and contradicts standards. Clients already face long waiting lists and referrals would lead to a longer wait, which is dangerous for this fragile population. The imminent risk transfer to in-patient care does not cover responsibility for follow-up by the counselor when the individual is discharged and at high risk. Dr . Ngonidzashe Mpofu , self, testified in opposition to H 63 stating Idaho already faces a mental health (MH) crisis. This allows counselors to consider their own inconvenience or comfort rather than the need of the client. Anna Baird , ICA, President Elect, Idaho Association for Marriage and Family Counselors, testified in opposition to H 63 , emphasizing she became an MH professional to help individuals, not to serve herself, her own agenda, or put her needs first. Peggy McFarland , Licensed Clinical Counselor , testified in support of H 63 . The long standing ethical standard allowed the freedom to provide clients adequate information regarding the counseling process and the counselor . The new standards' removal of such ability harms the client with the false promise of a neutral counselor . H 63 protects and supports clients, therapists, and families without the worry of any penalties. L ynn Laird , Psychologist, testified in support of H 63 , sharing her concern regarding a national group setting general ethical standards. Liz Horn , Counselor , ICA Member , testified in opposition to H 63 . T urning away vulnerable individuals will do harm by sending the message they are not worthy of help. Part of being a counselor is understanding one's own values and how to not impose those values on clients. Josi Christensen , ICA Member , Idaho State University Student, testified in opposition to H 63 . Clients told \"their kind\" needs to seek counseling elsewhere are already fearful regarding talking to a stranger . This unnecessarily expands the size and scope of the government. Mark Hand , Counselor , testified in support of H 63 , stating honest relationships and rapport are the base for great outcomes. Clients know when there is an issue with their counselor and appreciate honest and caring practitioners. Rep. Y oung , in closing, said this legislation doesn't require a counselor to turn away anyone. Instead referrals address whether or not the goals, values, or outcomes would conflict with the client's sincerely held principals. This issue is not addressed in the current code of ethics. This is regarding a fundamental freedom of conscience. MOTION: Rep. Redman made a motion to send H 63 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep. Rubel made a substitute motion to HOLD H 63 in committee. VOTE ON SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep. Gallagher requested a roll call vote. Substitute motion failed by a vote of 6 A YE and 7 NA Y .

DOCKET NO. 15-0102-2201: Julie Bicknell T aylor , Director , Commission on Aging, presented Docket No. 15-0102-2201 . This is a zero base regulation (ZBR) chapter rewrite. It has been streamlined, modernized, and simplified. Nothing relating to protection of vulnerable adults has been lost. MOTION: Rep. Wheeler made a motion to approve Docket No. 15-0102-2201. Motion carried by voice vote. DOCKET NO. 16-0324-2201: Kristin Matthews , Bureau Chief, Department of Health and W elfare (DHW), Division of Medicaid, presented Docket No. 16-0324-2201 to repeal a section which became obsolete upon passage of H 735 in 2022. MOTION: Rep. Roberts made a motion to approve Docket No. 16-0324-2201. Motion carried by voice vote.

There are no changes to the eligibility requirements. MOTION: Rep. Dixon (24) made a motion to approve Docket No. 16-0414-2201. Motion carried by voice vote. DOCKET NO. 16-0602-2201: Kaela Whitehead , Program Specialist, Foster Care Licensing, DHW , Division of Family and Community Services, presented Docket No. 16-0602-2201 . This is a ZBR rewrite and renames the chapter Child Care and Foster Care Licensing. Changes align with existing licensing standards. Updates include qualifications, suitability , training, home environment, and the maximum number of children within the foster home. The changes clarify expectations and insure children have safe surroundings with appropriate care. The number of children in a foster home has been increased to six, with additional children allowed based on an assessment and specified criteria. The updates assure persons physically and emotionally able are providing safe surroundings and care. Aubrie Hunt , Program Manager , was invited to answer a question. She explained the listed daycare fees cover the cost of health and safety inspections. Additional inspection costs are underwritten by the Idaho Child Care Association. Brenda Felton , Foster Parent, testified in support of Docket No. 16-0602-2201 . She shared information regarding the current number of foster children and foster homes. Recruitment is hindered by the requirements surrounding trips outside of Idaho and fencing bodies of water , especially in rural farming areas. The six children requirement includes family members, which limits the actual number of foster children. This becomes an issue when trying to keep siblings together . She pointed out a side ef fect of splitting up siblings is the reduction in educational hours when all of the siblings are transported to one location from various areas for visitations several times a week. Foster parents want and can help more. Answering a question, Ms. Felton suggested improvements could include increasing the training requirements from ten to twenty hours to include specialized care training. Also of help would be allowing case workers and court appointed special advocates (CASA) to perform more frequent home visits. MOTION: Chairman V ander W oude made a motion to approve Docket No. 16-0602-2201 . Speaking to the motion, Chairman V ander W oude reminded the committee Docket No. 16-0602-2201 was held previously when concern was raised regarding child and foster care being in the same rule. An understanding has been reached for a separation of the two categories in 2023. VOTE ON MOTION: V ice Chairman Erickson called for a vote on the motion to approve Docket No. 16-0602-2201.

Stipulation is also made to assure the standards for visitors and staf f are the same. This bill is silent on vaccine requirements.

Linda Hines , Owner , Grace Assisted Living and Memory Care, testified in support of H 64 .

In closing remarks, Rep. Y oung emphasized this legislation was instituted on behalf of the facility owners who asked for help during the pandemic.

Rep. Gallagher requested she be recorded as voting NA Y . Rep. Y oung will sponsor the bill on the floor . Jackie Smith , President, Idaho Association of Home Care Agencies (IAHCA) presented information regarding the association. She described their support services for persons wishing to age in place. Members are paid through Medicaid, the V eterans Administration, or privately . The current 70% to 80% rate of Medicaid clients to all participants is increasing. Administrative costs are increasing due to requirements for training, oversight, documentation, overtime, health insurance costs, and the electronic visit verification mandate. Cost cutting measures have included minimizing staf f, limiting caregiver hours, and shifting costs to their applicants. Keeping participants in their homes saves money by helping them remain stable outside of the expensive long-term care facilities, emergency rooms, and hospitals. Branden Beier , V ice President, IAHCA, explained the nationwide caregiver shortage causes include an increased aging population, low Medicaid reimbursement, and increased wage competition from outside of the industry . The emergency waiver allowing spouses and parents to care for loved ones will cause further shortages when it ends in May , 2023. With only a $2.54 increase from 2009 to 2020, they are requesting a rate increase ef fective July 1, 2023. Answering a committee question, Robert V ande Merwe , representing the IAHCA, stated the cost of care facilities is $9k per month. Mr . Beier further answered the question by stating home care, which fluctuates from eight to fifteen hours per week, costs $2k to $3k per month.

It also allows caregiver designations by persons with legal authority . MOTION: Rep. Blanksma made a motion to introduce RS 30397. Motion carried by voice vote. H 161: Rep. Kevin Andrus , District 35, presented H 161 . There are 26k able-bodied Idaho adults receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. Of those, 15k have no dependents. This legislation requires SNAP participants to be working, volunteering, in training, or in school. Mr . Scott Centurino , Senior Fellow , Foundation for Government Accountability , V isiting Fellow , Opportunity Solutions Project, provided national context for H 161 . This legislation is designed to create a true statewide requirement for SNAP enrolled able-bodied adults who can and should be working. Under federal law there are two SNAP work requirements, able-bodied adults, under fifty years of age, without dependents (ABA WD) and general work requirements. For the ABA WD geographic waivers, legislative approval will now be required. The current federal no-good-cause exemption for up to 12% of the ABA WD has developed a stockpile during the Public Health Emergency . Considering it would allow over ten months of exemptions, stipulation is made for the stockpile's non use. The general work requirement for specific SNAP able-bodied adults is thirty hours a week or participation in an employment training program. Since training programs are federally mandated, H 161 codifies the current practice. Kristin Matthews , Bureau Chief, Self-reliance Programs, Department of Health and W elfare (DHW), was invited to answer committee questions. She said the requirement for legislative approval could result in the loss of federal funding and the suspension of the plan when changes occur outside of the legislature's session. There is no geographic waiver currently in ef fect. Participants are screened for SNAP benefits upon application and at six-month intervals. Referrals are made to the contracted training program provider . Participants who do not comply are sanctioned for up to six months. In closing, Rep. Andrus stated the DHW has a lot of latitude to exempt enrollees based on unforeseen situations. This legislation helps individuals to get on their feet and working. MOTION: Rep. Wheeler made a motion to send H 161 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Motion carried by voice vote. Reps. Roberts, Rubel, and Chew requested they be recorded as voting NA Y . Rep. Andrus will sponsor the bill on the floor . H 153: Rep. Josh Wheeler , District 35, presented H 153 directing the Idaho Board of Medicine (BOM) to create a one-year bridge license for medical students who have not matched with a residency program. These graduates have completed steps one and two of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE). The BOM can charge up to $300 to cover any administrative burden.

Redman will sponsor the bill on the floor . Mike Sandvig , President Emeritus, National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), presented information regarding its origin, mission, local af filiates, and statewide support groups. He stated mental illness is a medical condition which can occur before fourteen years of age. The average delay between the onset of symptoms and treatment is eleven years. With identification and treatment there is a hope for recovery . With af fordable mental health (MH) coverage a vital component, he requested a Medicaid expansion replacement be approved before any repeal of the current program.

She said they now have employees, not volunteers, answering the hotlines. The calls are routed through a national line. Between the greeting and option tree it takes at least a minute for a caller to be connected. This is a continued issue and discussion point for all of the states. A missing piece for higher risk support is the ability to refer callers under eighteen years of age to juvenile crisis centers. W ork continues on expanding their memorandums of understanding (MOU) to all of the jails and including staf f.

Motion carried by voice vote. H 61: Rep. Julianne Y oung , District 30, presented H 61 to address a critical lack of mental and behavioral health care in Idaho. She shared a personal experience when seeking mental health care for a family member . With in-state counselor shortages, families are forced to go to other states, which can lead to less frequent help. W aived during the pandemic, the use of telehealth has addressed this shortage and allowed the use of counselors from other states. Stipulation is made regarding providers being subject to Idaho rules and regulations, including prescription management program participation. Practice privileges can be revoked for non-compliance and the provider can be reported to their state board. V ice Chairman Erickson turned the gavel over to Chairman V ander W oude . Answering committee questions, Rep. Y oung emphasized this is not a carte blanche opportunity . This opens the door for specialized counselors who otherwise might not be available to Idaho citizens. Next session she would be able to bring legislation addressing any terminology changes. Participants must be licensed in a state with similar requirements and they must be in good standing. Most individuals would prefer in-person providers, if they were available. MOTION: Rep. Redman made a motion to send H 61 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Kate Haas , Kestral W est, representing Cisero Action, testified in support of H 61 . As a mental health combating tool, H 61 helps Idahoans meet their needs without diluting in-state providers. It addresses the mobility of our population and helps individuals moving into Idaho maintain their original provider relationships. Lupe W issel , AARP , testified in support of H 61 . T elehealth makes a positive impact on the lives of older Idahoans and their families. This legislation expands the services available and changes the way we view healthcare, putting the control in the hands of the individual. Not only rural areas can benefit, but also caregivers who cannot take time away from their loved ones to care for themselves.

Y oung will sponsor the bill on the floor . H 82: Rep. Jacyn Gallagher , District 9, presented H 82 . This legislation amends T itle 37 with a new chapter called the Idaho Supplementary Act and cements current regulations which were enacted in 2022. She shared information on a variety of studies and the impact of supplements on the health of individuals. MOTION: Rep. Dixon (24) made a motion to send H 82 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Responding to questions, Rep. Gallagher said safety measures already exist for new supplements and vitamins. A federal ban on a vitamin or supplement made in Idaho would not cease its sale within our state. Greg Ferch , Chiropractor , testified in support of H 82 . Some supplements appeared to be very ef fective during the Pandemic. This legislation helps Idahoans continue access to healthcare products during times when there might be a federal plan to limit access to those products. A committee member expressed concern with a potential conflict with the federal Supremacy Clause and the cost of a lawsuit. SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep.

This legislation is for an education payback incentive to attract new nurses to work in specified locations. Nursing shortages are anticipated in the near future due to an aging nursing population and the growing need for specialized care. Of the 775 annual nursing program graduates, only 80% remain in Idaho. This program is expected to increase that percentage. She explained the graduated costs of the five-year program.

Chairman V ander W oude called the meeting to order at 9:00 a.m. S 1005: Sen. Scott Herndon , District 1, presented S 1005 , to require licensed day-care facilities communicate immunization requirements and exemptions to parents, mirroring what is required for the schools. This impacts licensed facilities with seven or more children. The Department of Health and W elfare (DHW) is asked to transmit the information to the facilities when licenses are renewed. Answering questions, Sen. Herndon said local licensing entities must follow the state-level licensing requirements. There are no stipulations regarding the communication method. MOTION: Rep. Roberts made a motion to send S 1005 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Sara Clendenon , representing Health Freedom Idaho, testified in support of S 1005 . This ensures parents are told the same for schools and daycare. This assures transparency and a fully-informed consent. VOTE ON MOTION: Chairman V ander W oude called for a vote on the motion to send S 1005 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Motion carried by voice vote. Rep. Redman will sponsor the bill on the floor . H 216: Rep. Brooke Green , District 18, presented H 216 , to address a lack of law and codify best practices for the use of gestational carriers. Without any laws, an open question exists whether the surrogacy contracts are enforceable. The legal definition of a mother includes the birth mother , who would be the surrogate. Without any statute guidance, the current practice requires the surrogate and biological mother appear in court where the surrogate must relinquish her rights to the child and the biological mother must adopt the child. Additionally , this legislation will prevent abuse of the system in a variety of ways. Sideboards assure everyone experiences the agreed upon expectations. Rep. Dori Healey , District 15, further presented H 216 . The Gestational Carrier Agreement acknowledges enforceable contracts for surrogates, parents, and infants. It gives parents authority over the child at birth without amending the birth record. It provides assurance the biological parents will be recognized and establishes oversight for an unregulated industry . It also stipulates there are no receipts of federal or state funds allowed during surrogacy . Shaylyn Pease, , Maureen ennyson, Melissa Sherman, Crystal Kulack, and Connie Aceves , testified in support or H 216 . They shared their stories of health issues, use of a surrogate, and their children. They also shared the emotional turmoil experienced as either surrogates or biological mothers when they had to appear in court and prove their parental rights to adopt their biological child. Husbands signed a paper and were automatically the legal or non-legal fathers. The process was spelled out clearly in legal and medical paperwork. It was a disconnect to then be treated contrary to the contracts after the birth. In closing comments Rep. Green said annually there are surrogacy services used by approximately ten Idaho residents and 100 non-Idaho residents. This legislation addresses the fundamental right to reproduce and provides a smooth transition into parenthood while assuring babies are going home to their families. MOTION: Rep. Wheeler made a motion to HOLD H 216 in committee. Motion carried by voice vote. RS 30545: Chairman V ander W oude brought RS 30545 before the committee, stating it is a replacement for H 216 .

MOTION: Rep. Blanksma made a motion to introduce RS 30537. Motion carried by voice vote. H 212: Rep. Marco Erickson , District 33, presented H 212 , with changes to assure the daycare licensing rules apply to facilities for children under four years of age.

Erickson will sponsor the bill on the floor . H 193: Rep. Julianne Y oung , District 30, presented H 193 . This legislation clarifies the definition of essential caregivers in a variety of health care facilities. It also provides for the inclusion of family members, guardians, or some other type of custodian, as in the case of minors. T oni Lawson , V ice President, Idaho Hospital Association, testified in opposition to H 193 . The changes are too complex and can cause confusion. There are appropriate instances when limited visitation is for the safety and well-being of the patient and other nearby patients. Hospitals need the flexibility to assure patient safety issues are addressed. She asked the committee to hold H 193 so a simpler solution can be presented next session. Answering questions, Ms. Lawson explained the patient-designated caregiver language allows any visitor to be designated. When considering visitation, the hospitals also consider the patient's condition, the family dynamics, and the care unit protocol. This legislation may conflict with federal oversight rules and regulations. In closing, Rep. Y oung said a facility can place reasonable restrictions on caregivers. The non-limitation expectation of the existing statute did not transpire. Caregivers for minor children were not previously included. The concept and language of patient designees was agreed to by the facilities last year . MOTION: Rep. Mitchell made a motion to send H 193 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation.

Healey made a motion to send H 215 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Marcus Hurst , testified in support of H 215 . T o circumvent this law , the PBMs have adjusted contracts and the terms of service as well as redefined what is being enforced. Enforcing penalties will cause their compliance. Further steps are still needed. Robert Broulim , President, Broulim Supermarkets, testified in support of H 215 . The low PBM reimbursements do not reflect fair trade. Pharmacies need our help to stay in business. T yler Higgins , testified in support of H 215 . The PBM fight is becoming very dif ficult and pharmacy managers are being lost. Rob Geddes , Albertson's Companies, testified in support of H 215 , which addresses the lack of accountability enforcement. He expressed concern regarding the growth of pharmacy deserts caused by pharmacies going out of business. Answering a question regarding a conflict of interest when PBMs own pharmacies, he said it is called vertical integration with all supply chain levels owned by the same company . PBMs who own mail order or brick and mortar pharmacies use incentives to steer patients away from other pharmacies. Other states have prohibited patient steering, allowing patients to select their own pharmacies. Pam Eaton , President, Idaho Retailers' Association, testified in support of H 215 . She reiterated the importance of addressing the PBM issue and helping pharmacists who are struggling to survive. Rep. Rod Furniss , District 31, testified in support of H 215 , expressing his concern regarding PBM reimbursements below sales prices and pharmacies being forced to take PBM contracts. Rural pharmacies are important for customers needing medication to survive. Pharmacists love their customers and employees. They want to stay in business. Corey Crider , Self, testified in support of H 215 . This PBM bill is a big step in addressing closing pharmacies and patient steering. Patient care is important. There is a need to stop the alarming rate of pharmacy closures. VOTE ON MOTION: Chairman V ander W oude called for a vote on the motion to send H 215 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Motion carried by voice vote. Rep. Redman will sponsor the bill on the floor . UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST : On behalf of the sponsor , Chairman V ander W oude made a unanimous consent request to HOLD H 270 in committee. There being no objection, the request was granted.

Chairman V ander W oude called the meeting to order at 9:00 a.m. MOTION: Rep. Dixon (24) made a motion to approve the minutes of the February 28 and March 1, 2023, meetings. Motion carried by voice vote. H 200: Rep. Jordan Redman , District 3, presented H 200 to appropriate funding for the development of a managed care program to stabilize the Medicaid Expansion program. It could provide a replacement or secondary program for the existing value-care program. The Department of Health and W elfare (DHW) would develop the program, focusing on the best option for Idaho's adult population's cost controlled care. Responding to questions, Rep. Redman stated this is a collaborative ef fort between the DHW and stakeholders. The $1.5M initial cost is based on information from other states. It may take time to achieve the nine to eleven percent savings. The current program's reverse roll out of the most dif ficult populations first may not have been the best approach. Brian Whitlock , Idaho Hospital Association, testified in opposition to H 200 . He shared the history of the 2020 move to value-based reimbursements and value-care organizations. Major changes will detrimentally impact the health care provider system. Given more time with the current system, providers believe the goals will be accomplished and costs will be cut. He noted the target per-member per-month (PMPM) cost has lowered in the second performance year . He requested the committee hold H 200 . Answering questions, he said investments have been made to protect rural providers. He expressed concern regarding some rural areas not fitting into the managed care organizations' model. Christine Pisani , Executive Director , Idaho Council on Development Disabilities (DD), testified in opposition to H 200 . She expressed unease regarding managed care being able to meet the complex health needs of seniors and individuals with disabilities, especially in rural areas. Healthy outcomes need to hold equal footing to cost savings. Dr . Kelly McGrath , Family Medicine, testified in opposition to H 200 , which would add bureaucratic burdens, stifle the value-care organizations, and undermine any progress to provide higher quality care at a lower cost. The current program delivers the right care in the right place for the best outcomes in rural Idaho. In response to questions, Dr . McGrath explained the challenges of rural care dispensing. The new PMPM cost target is a chance to find creative avenues to reach out to patients. With managed care there may be an increased administrative burden for care organizations. David Lehman , Bingham Memorial Hospital, Life Flight Network, testified in opposition to H 200 . The managed care programs have neither lowered the Medicaid budget nor improved access. Let the existing programs work and put resources in other areas to help Idahoans. Brian W indau , President, Primary Health Medical Group, testified in opposition to H 200 . It takes time to understand the savings provided by the current program. Changing programs this soon is not the ultimate way to achieve any savings. Patricia Richesin , Self, former President, Kootenai Care Network, testified in opposition to H 200 . The managed care program does not need replacing. The current program is and needs to be an Idaho Medicaid solution. Providers may see this as a bait and switch with unexpected expenses. Hannah Liedke , President CEO, Opportunities Unlimited, testified in opposition to H 200 . The current system contains costs to keep DD individuals in their homes and communities while minimizing higher emergency costs. The best way to get state agencies and stakeholders together is to include a state legislator in the discussion. MOTION: Rep. Blanksma made a motion to HOLD H 200 in committee. She suggested a concurrent resolution for a task force might be a better approach. Peyton Nunes , representing AmeriHealth Caritas, testified in support of H 200 , stating a discussion and possible replacement through the suggested concurrent resolution would be a better step forward. VOTE ON MOTION: Chairman V ander W oude called for a vote on the motion to HOLD H 200 in committee. Motion carried by voice vote.

Chairman V ander W oude called the meeting to order at 9:00 a.m. H 270: Rep. Jordan Redman , District 3, presented H 270 , legislation addressing the auditing pharmacy records and the overreach of Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs). He declared Rule 80, stating a possible conflict of interest. Pam Eaton , Idaho Retailers Association, Idaho Pharmacy Association, further presented H 270 . She explained RS 30624 is the same legislation with the addition of negotiated changes to clarify audit exceptions, requirements, and provide oversight for conformity . Direction is made regarding contracts, notices, audit procedures, reporting findings, fines, and appeals. Responding to questions, Ms. Eaton explained should the specifying language for clerical errors be insuf ficient, future legislation can be brought forward. Clerical error fines was the top complaint by the pharmacies. Stipulation is made for equality between pharmacies, including PBM-owned pharmacies. Douglas Fuchs , Pharmacy Owner , testified in support of H 270 . Audits should be random and include lower priced drugs. His last audit reviewed only drugs costing $100 or more, which is a small percentage of their overall sales. If an audit of this type is lost the resulting revenue loss could be over $20k. T yler Higgins , Idaho State Pharmacy Association, Pharmacy Owner , testified in support of H 270 . He shared his opinion the on-site audit costs are paid from expected fines. Similar legislation in another state has cleaned up the audit process and eliminated on-site audits. Donald Smith , Pharmacist, Pharmacy Owner , testified in support of H 270 . He said a recent audit of fifty prescriptions included twenty high-cost insulin prescriptions. Rob Geddes , Albertson's Companies, Pharmacist, testified in support of H 270 . He explained the PBM audits calculate patient usage dif ferently than the pharmacies. This results in a reported clerical error and an audit exception. Large pharmacies have teams dedicated to dispute the audit findings. Independent pharmacy owners do not have that support. This legislation assures a healthy market. Jason Reading , Pharmacy Owner , testified in support of H 270 . Currently the PBM can recoup the total cost of the prescription when there is a minor clerical error , even when it was handled as requested by the physician. Records must be kept in a variety of ways to address audits by dif ferent PBMs. This legislation will keep it fair for all involved. Marcus Hurst , testified in support of H 270 . He helped the oldest pharmacy in Idaho close its doors on December 1, 2022, due to the losses from negative reimbursements and excessive PBM audits. PBM contracts do not allow pharmacists to reach out to insurance companies. Brian Stewart , Independent Community Pharmacist, testified in support of H 270 . He said the PBM audits focus on expensive medications under the guise of patient safety . Almost all audit discrepancies can be corrected in thirty seconds through electronic re-billing and have no impact on patient care or safety . MOTION: Rep. Healey made a motion to HOLD H 270 in committee. Motion carried by voice vote. MOTION: Rep. Healey made a motion to introduce RS 30624 and recommend it be sent directly to the Second Reading Calendar . Motion carried by voice vote. Rep. Redman will sponsor the bill on the floor . H 224: Rep. Brooke Green , District 18, presented H 224 to codify the best practices for pelvic exams for unconscious individuals. One existing practice, which is not used in Idaho, allows a medical student to conduct a physician supervised pelvic exam for educational purposes. Specification is made to caveats and holding physicians accountable. MOTION: Rep. Healey made a motion to send H 224 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Motion carried by voice vote. Rep. Green will sponsor the bill on the floor . H 244: Rep. Julianne Y oung , District 30, presented H 244 . This legislation replaces H 64 and addresses concerns raised during the previous hearing. The change stipulates facilities cannot implement precautions more stringent than required of their staf f. Residents have the ability and protection to decide who visits and if they are vaccinated. MOTION: Rep. Redman made a motion to send H 244 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. A committee member stated support for in-person visitation but expressed concern regarding statute limitations which may hinder the health of these fragile individuals during a time of genuine need.

RS 30643: Rep. Jordan Redman , District 3, presented RS 30643 to develop a task force, including stakeholders, to determine the best way to address the rising Medicaid program costs. In answer to a question, he said this proposed legislation has been shared with many of the providers and hospitals. MOTION: Rep. Mitchell made a motion to introduce RS 30643 and recommend it be sent directly to the Second Reading Calendar . Motion carried by voice vote. Reps. Roberts and Chew requested they be recorded as voting NA Y . Rep. Redman will sponsor the bill on the floor . T im Kilgallon , CEO, Ideal Option, presented information to the committee on their nine Idaho addiction treatment clinics. He described the historic changes in the types of addictive substances, the epidemic wave theory , and the new synthetic drugs. With multiple ingredients in the drugs, patients are often unaware of what they are consuming. The cartel drugs are cheaper , more available, more deadly , come in a legitimate looking format, and are incredibly profitable. Most are not detectable by standard diagnostics, although specialized equipment exists. Patients, ranging in age, come from all walks of life and have typically had a substance use disorder for four to five years before seeking treatment. He described the downward spiral experienced by patients. A real-time early warning system is simple to develop using existing data because outcomes are easily measured and published regularly by treatment centers. V erifiable savings exist with reductions in emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and criminal justice usage. The existing informational system in Idaho relies on confiscated product and forensic labs. Mr . Kilgallon described the use of buprenorphine and other medications in their outpatient treatment approach to help patients get back their lives. Once on maintenance, medication is prescribed and handled through telemedicine. The data shows a fairly linear recovery path. T o address the epidemic, he recommends Idaho deploy an early warning system, expand measurement-based treatment, and review tracking data to evaluate outcomes and savings. Responding to questions, Mr . Kilgallon said the deceptive forms of opioids found at gas stations are being added to several other state schedules. He described the specialty equipment which measures a molecule's weight to identify a substance's presence. Regular patient testing assures their patients are taking the prescribed medication. Due to time constraints, the Idaho Caregiver Alliance presentation will be scheduled for the W ednesday , March 15, 2023, meeting.

Chairman V ander W oude called the meeting to order at 9:00 a.m. MOTION: Rep. Dixon (24) made a motion to approve the minutes of the March 2, 8, 9, and 10, 2023, meetings. Motion carried by voice vote. Marilyn Sword , Coordinator , Idaho Caregiver Alliance (ICA), presented an informational update on the ICA. Established through grants in 2013, ICA provides a voice for family caregivers while connecting them to sources for information and support. She shared examples of the decisions caregivers are facing, the financial assistance received during the pandemic, issues faced with employing outside help, and concerns as the pandemic assistance comes to an end. ICA convenes stakeholders to review services and programs, such as the Boise State University family caregiver navigator , which has helped 378 family caregivers. ICA continues to reach out to ethnic communities to understand and assist with their family caregiver needs. The goal is to assure healthy , independent families while using resources wisely and ef ficiently . Enormous savings occur when individuals are not placed in facilities and do not frequent emergency rooms. The ICA funding comes from the Commission on Aging, Administration on Community Living, as well as other partnerships. The primary grant funding ends in September and they are looking for other support partners. Answering questions, Ms. Sword said spouses are considered legally responsible partners which impedes their ability to be paid caregivers. Changing this exemption would require both Medicaid and legislative action. They would like to work with employers to develop caring environments for all family caregivers. There is an increasing wave of caregiving needs for the aging baby boomer population. Additionally , better medical outcomes are providing special needs children the ability to live longer and with their families. Other state coalitions are administered by either the Medicaid agency , aging agency , or other agency determined by that state's governor . V ery few of the coalitions have existed beyond the grants. Chairman V ander W oude commented the Director of the Department of Health and W elfare expects an extension for the pandemic assistance to carry it beyond the May , 2023, expiration date. He is also submitting a waiver to continue spousal care assistance. Continuing the parental child care assistance is more dif ficult and the Director was unsure if a waiver or change in the Medicaid State Plan is required for approval. The pandemic changes highlighted the benefit of spousal and child caregivers. Changing the Medicaid State Plan or applying for the waivers will not require the legislature.

Kevin Cook , District 32, presented S 1097 to create an account and fund for the appropriations covering the Department of Health and W elfare's (DHW) Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) installation, which will cost over $100M. He explained what data the system will contain, the reason for its high cost, federal implementation requirements, cost dif ferences in other states, inability to purchase an established system, purchase of trimmed modules, and designated milestones. A requirement is made for annual reporting to JF AC and reviews of any missed milestones. The account funds cannot be spent until the milestones are completed and accepted. He emphasized this legislation creates the account and is not the funding mechanism. Answering questions, Sen. Cook explained if this legislation does not pass there would be no place to hold the funds, making them null and void. An expected trailer bill will place the funds into the account. The existing system's data will be migrated to the new warehouse. MOTION: V ice Chairman Erickson made a motion to send S 1097 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Fred Birnbaum , Idaho Freedom Foundation, testified in opposition to S 1097 . The funding of this new system has increased considerably from last year . There is no project manager listed for project accountability . Sen. Cook , in response, said the project manager , Kevin Nelson , is not listed on this legislation. Project accountability is a part of the completion of milestones. He reminded the committee this legislation only creates an account to harbor appropriated funds for this eight-year project.

Lisa Anderson , Public Policy Director , Alzheimer's Association of Greater Idaho, further presented S 1096 . More than 20k Idahoans are now living with ADRD. This number is expected to increase by 22% over the next few years. Nearly one quarter of ADRD hospitalizations are preventable. Ninety-five percent of persons living with ADRD have at least one additional chronic condition. These individuals and their caregivers face emotional, physical, and financial dif ficulties. Interventions and strong public health responses can mitigate ADRD for a better quality of life and reduced associated costs. She shared the impact of the Of fice of Performance Evaluation report recommendations and the development of the ADRD steering committee, which put together the alliance. The ADRDA has developed the Idaho 2023-2027 ADRD Strategic Plan for a system of collaboration and cooperation between families, government, and organizations. MOTION: Rep.

This legislation expands law to provide freedom of religious rights for medical workers by stating no healthcare professional shall be required to provide any service in violation of their religious beliefs. Answering committee questions, Rep. W isniewski said further abortion stipulation protects those carved out in the existing law . As technology progresses more areas present ethical concerns, such as gene modification and removal of functioning body parts. This is a statement to medical professionals showing Idaho cares about their moral or religious beliefs and wants to make them welcome. It is another avenue for addressing the healthcare professional shortage. The legislation states employers cannot discriminate based on a worker's dissent and how such situations are handled. This also applies when an organization is purchased or merged. This strengthens protection for doctors going out into small businesses and rural areas. MOTION: Rep. Healey made a motion to HOLD H 308 in committee. Chad Y ates , Idaho Counselor Association, testified in opposition to H 308 , which weakens existing code and thereby weakens the protection of the public. When conflicts arise, he has learned to confer with colleagues or get more training. Sheila W eaver , Clinical Social W orker , Idaho Chapter , National Association of Social W orkers, testified in opposition to H 308 . Denying services could hurt families when help is needed the most, especially in rural areas with limited resources. Cindy Thorngren , President, Southwest Chapter , National Organization for W omen, testified in opposition to H 308 . She shared concern regarding the lack of communication or disclosure requirements. T oni Lawson , Idaho Hospital Association, testified in opposition to H 308 , which is confusing, complicated, and only opens the door for more litigation. Elizabeth Criner , Idaho State Dental Association, testified in opposition to H 308 . Small dental clinics do not always have employees who can fill in when an employee denies to give any service. The \"moral conscience\" definition is very broad. This legislation would repeal Idaho Code 18-61 1 which is an excellent provision already addressing this issue. The $25k statutory guaranteed damages removes the requirement for any proof in a court case. Suzie Keller , Idaho Medical Association, testified in opposition to H 308 . The current statute is good and requires advance written notice to protect the patient, facility , employer , and provider . It also conflicts with licensing requirements. Rowen Astra , Self, testified in opposition to H 308 . Providers have protection under statute and federal laws. This will further inhibit access to timely care and open the door to conscience protections in other fields. In closing remarks, Rep. W isniewski stated Idaho Code 18-61 1 is specifically geared towards abortion. This legislation expands the intent interpretation in a court of law . SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep. Redman made a substitute motion to send H 308 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. ROLL CALL VOTE: Rep. Gallagher requested a roll call vote on the substitute motion. Motion failed by a vote of 3 A YE, 7 NA Y and 3 Absent/Excused. V oting in favor of the motion: Reps. Kingsley , Gallagher , Redman. V oting in to motion: Reps.
