Clients who are dealing with [infertility](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/infertility)may experience conflict and communication problems. It's not unusual for shame, blame, and guilt to arise in cases of infertility, whether the source of the problem is one partner or both. This means that clients are upset and pulling away from their partner just when they need them the most. Some clients may find it difficult to spend time around friends and family who are pregnant. Friends and family can also make hurtful comments that increase tension during this time. How does therapy for infertility issues work? The therapist will begin by gathering information about the client or couple and make a treatment plan for their specific concerns. In addition to addressing common mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression, and trauma reactions or [PTSD](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder), therapists can help clients improve their decision-making and deal with stressors unique to infertility. Some examples include coping with the \"two-week wait\" before a pregnancy test, the distress associated with a failed attempt or [miscarriage](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/miscarriage), and the shame and blame sometimes associated with reproductive concerns. What type of therapy is best for infertility issues? Many therapists offer psychotherapy for individuals and couples who are dealing with infertility issues. Some helpful therapeutic approaches include [cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/cognitive-behavioral-therapy)), which can aid clients in reframing negative thoughts about their situation. Expressive writing and art therapy can help clients process difficult feelings. Clients might also benefit from [group therapy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/therapy/what-is-group-counseling)to experience support from others who are dealing with the same problems. How long does therapy for infertility issues take? There is no set length for therapy that addresses infertility or reproductive concerns. Some clients might find it helpful to continue [therapy during their pregnancy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/pregnancy)to have healthy ways to cope with any associated stress, anxiety, depression, or trauma. Some clients who decide not to pursue fertility treatments might benefit from the support of a therapist. The duration of therapy varies depending on the individual client's specific needs and goals.
