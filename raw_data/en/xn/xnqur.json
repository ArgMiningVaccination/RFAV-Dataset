This week we'll be exploring two different types of healing that work with two of the senses to bring health into balance: aromatherapy and sound healing. Aromatherapy is the practice of using the natural oils extracted from flowers, bark, stems, leaves, roots or other parts of a plant to enhance psychological and physical well-being. The inhaled aroma from these \"essential\" oils is widely believed to stimulate brain function. Aromatherapy is used for a variety of applications, including pain relief, mood enhancement and increased cognitive function. Sound Healing, through various techniques and technologies, is the educated and conscious use of the energy of sound to promote wellness in the human system - including the expansion of consciousness. Sound Healing is founded on the premise that all matter is vibrating at specific frequencies. There are a wide range of techniques that utilize sound as a tool for change. The most common and basic use of sound is for meditation and relaxation. Chanting, toning and overtone singing are some of the most powerful methods for resonating sound throughout the body. The use of nature sounds and natural instruments, such as crystal bowls and tuning forks, have specific healing frequencies and harmonics. Listening to one's own root frequency enables an individual to create a more centered and grounded awareness within their life. Sandy Bachman is an intuitive and heart-centered healer.
