Hear me out I had my 2nd child mid-2020. Finished construction and moved to our new office. Nursed on demand for a year, wifed, and ran what is a pretty successful multi-disciplinary [#chiropractic](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fchiropractic&trk=public_post-text) office. Also, somehow I managed not just to avoid drowning in all of it, but coming back and feeling better than ever almost 3 years later. It felt hard at that time while the world was changing so quickly. Like really hard. My husband and I decided to take a trip recently without the munchkins which takes a lot of coordinating if you have littles. Our goal? Come back feeling deeply RESTED. I knew that if we went to a resort, had endless cocktails and ate at restaurants and did touring and kept busy, we would likely come back tired & need a 'vacation from vacation'. Ya feel me? Enter, the @sivanandabahamas in the Bahamas. This was my third time going for an extended weekend to this [#ashram](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fashram&trk=public_post-text) and the first time, my husband joined me! Five days of scheduled rest, 4 hours of [#yoga](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fyoga&trk=public_post-text) & [#meditation](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fmeditation&trk=public_post-text) a day, walks on [#Paradise](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fparadise&trk=public_post-text) island and [#nutritious](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fnutritious&trk=public_post-text) foods. Lots of downtime to read, chill, and regulate our nervous systems so we could come back feeling deeply rested! An ashram is certainly NOT a yoga [#retreat](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fretreat&trk=public_post-text), but certainly a bucket list visit if you want to try real, deep, purposeful rest.
