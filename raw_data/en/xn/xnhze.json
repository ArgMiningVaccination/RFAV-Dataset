I reflect back on 2021, and the unique challenges and suffering caused by the CO VID-19 pandemic, climate-related crises, and the deep health disparities these have revealed, I remain committed to our center's vision and mission\u2014which at its core, emphasizes the role of 'integration' and interconnectedness at all levels of health. As is highlighted in our updated 2021 Five-year Strategic Plan: We are committed to advancing a model of health that recognizes the interconnections of the body, mind and spirit to enhance resilience and promote health and healing in individuals and communities. Strong scientific evidence supports interconnected and interdependence for all dimensions of health, and why the whole is more than the sum of its parts. Mind-body research has shown that what and how we think and feel\u2014the levels of stress or happiness, social connection or isolation that we experience\u2014deeply impact e very aspect of our physiology, including the health of our heart and brain, our ability to cope with pain, and even how long we live. Conversely, even modest changes in lifestyle, exercise, diet, exposure to nature and practices that enhance mindfulness, not only impact health and our reliance on medication, but also impact how we inter act with others, and the demands we make on the healthcare system and our environment. It's all connected! Leveraging our 'center without walls', we continue to bring members of our community together to work synergistically towards our shared goals of healthy individuals and communities. In this 2021 Annual Report, we highlight how our Grand Rounds and other educational initiatives have convened experts across Integrative Medicine and Health to share insights, spark synergy, and train the next generation of health care providers, researchers, and leaders. We provide an update on how our pilot research grants program, which to date has disbursed more than 1.1 million dollars, continues to seed new collaborations, ranging from studies evaluating the impact of stress reduction on inflammation and atherosclerosis to novel brain health programs to prevent age-related cognitive decline. In combination with the collaborative studies being led by our research directors, we are proud to share how our research is generating evidence to inform clinical care and new models of healing that target the whole person, body, mind and spirit. As always, my team and I remain immensely grateful to the Osher Foundation as well as other foundations and philanthropic partners for their vision and generous support, and their trust in us to make a difference in the health of today's and future generations.

Through a series of coordinated retreats and focus groups, the Osher Center leadership team, in collaboration with its advisory teams and stakeholders across Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), Harvard Medical School (HMS) and collaborating institutions, renewed the vision and mission of the Osher Center, and created a roadmap to guide the center over the next five years. The plan is designed as a \"living document\" and is expected to grow and evolve as the Center moves forward, and as it adapts to meet new challenges and opportunities in medicine and healthcare. An executive summary of this plan is accessible on the Osher Center website: www.oshercenter.org. Mission The mission of the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine is to advance leadingedge research, education and clinical care to promote an integrative model of health, healing and wellbeing. Vision The Osher Center for Integrative Medicine envisions a systemsbased, integrative model of health that recognizes and leverages interconnections of body, mind, and spirit to enhance resilience and promote health, healing and wellbeing in individuals and their communities.

However, less progress has been made in understanding how individuals transition from a state of disease back to health. Fundamentally, health is more than the simple absence of disease. The siloed nature of medicine today, organized around medical specialties (e.g., cardiology, neurology), has hindered our ability to 'see' and treat the whole person. Integrative approaches appreciate the complex multi-system dynamics that underlie health and disease \u2014 including body, mind and spirit \u2014 in both prevention and rehabilitation. It values and inte- grates the technological successes of disease curing along with the patient-centered exploration of healing. At the Osher Center, we strive to integrate medicine, health and healthcare on many levels. We recognize, seek to understand, and embrace the complexity inherent within and across all levels of health, healing, and well-being, from molecular and phys- iological systems to individuals and communities. Through rigorous and innovative research, we strive to be thought leaders bridging a variety of healthcare professions and paradigms. Our educational programs advance this knowledge through the training of the next generation of researchers, healthcare professionals, and leaders in the field of integrative medicine. Our Osher Clinical Center aims to provide the highest quality, transdisciplinary patient-centered care through a health equity lens. Our Integrative Medicine Network Forums, Grand Rounds and conferences convene scientists, practitioners and the public together to exchange ideas, advance research and best practices, and inform policy. 6 7 Osher Center For Integrative Medicine 2021 Annual Report Osher Center For Integrative Medicine 2021 Annual Report Migraine headaches affect approximately 15% of the US popu- lation and are among the top five causes of lifetime disability. Although medications are often used as first-line treatments for migraine, these treatments may have intolerable side effects and are not effective for all patients. Over 75% of migraine patients report neck pain and muscle tension, suggesting that treatments that target musculoskeletal complaints may be effective in managing migraine. A study led by Drs. Pamela Rist (Osher Core Leader of Clinical Trials, Epidemiology and Biostatistics) and Peter Wayne (Center Director), along with Osher Clinical Center (OCC) providers, Drs. Kowalski and Bernstein, evaluated the benefits of a multimodal chiropractic intervention in combination with migraine education, compared to migraine education alone. Both groups also received usual medical care. The study found that, compared with the control group, 10 sessions of chiro- practic care delivered over 14 weeks led to greater reductions in migraine days along with decreases in self-reported migraine disability. The study was published in the journal Cephalalgia.1 A parallel qualitative study led by research intern Julie Connors, highlighted patients' appreciation for the integrative and team- based approach to migraine care offered through the Osher Clinical Center, which included patient encounters with both a chiropractors and neurologist.2 The research was funded by generous grants from the NCMIC Foundation, the Inter-Insti-tutional Network for Chiropractic Research through Palmer College Foundation, and the Crimson Lion Foundation. The team has submitted an NIH grant in partnership with colleagues from VA Connecticut Health Care System and Yale University that aims to confirm and expand these findings to a larger sample including men and women veterans. Understanding the effect of open-label placebo in irritable bowel syndromeCreatively adapting to the challenges posed by COVID-19, core Osher Research faculty and their teams maintained a robust portfolio of studies including 24 funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and an additional 12 funded by foundations or philanthropy. Here we highlight the findings from three lines of research that came to fruition in 2021. Multimodal chiropractic care for episodic migraine in women Since Henry Beecher's landmark article in 1955, \"The Power - ful Placebo,\" the conventional belief is that patients must be blinded to treatment assignment and placebos concealed in order for them to be effective. In earlier work, members of the Osher Center reported in a pilot study the positive effects of non-concealed, \"open-label\" placebo (OLP) as treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that challenged this widely-held assumption. Most recently, the team including Osher's Director of Basic and Translational Research, Dr. Kathryn Hall, conducted an innovative and provocative NIH-funded extension of the earlier research. Patients with moderately-severe stable IBS (N=262) were randomized to receive OLP pill, no pill placebo, or double-blind placebo.3 At the end of six weeks, IBS symptom severity was significantly improved in those who received OLP compared to no pill placebo, and similar to those who received double-blind placebo. The study suggested that OLP could play a role in the management of symptoms in patients with IBS and that blinding may not be necessary for placebos to be effective. As the largest OLP clinical trial to date and the first to directly compare the effects of OLP and double-blind placebo, this landmark study significantly advances our understanding of the therapeutic encounter and contextual effects in medicine. 1.

Unfortunately, implementation and maintenance of exercise in these populations is a great challenge. Physical activity and exercise have long been a part of guideline recommendations for chronic cardiopulmonary conditions such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Unfortunately, implementation and maintenance of exercise in these populations is a great challenge. Two companion studies led by Dr. Gloria Yeh (Director of Clinical Research), together with Peter Wayne (Center Director), have examined how mind-body movement therapies can be utilized to support self-efficacy, physical activity, and positive behavior change in patients with cardiopulmonary disease. One study in patients with COPD provides preliminary support for tai chi and improved quality of life, emotional health, fatigue, and dyspnea after 12 weeks.4 Continuing tai chi beyond 12 weeks may further affect self-efficacy, exercise capacity, and lower body strength. In qualitative narratives, patients reported increases in overall body awareness, self-care knowledge/skills, behavior-relat - ed neurocognitive processes, physical function, and psychological well-being.5 In another COPD study, tai chi was examined as an exercise main - tenance strategy after patients engaged in conventional pulmonary rehabilitation.6 More individuals who participated in tai chi improved their exercise capacity compared to controls. In qualitative inter - views, patients described how tai chi promoted physical and mental wellbeing by diminishing fear and embarrassment associated with breathlessness, facilitating continued physical activity and thus improvement in quality of life.7 These findings highlight the interdependence of mind and body in a holistic, biopsychosocial manner and the promise of mind-body exercise for long-term behavior change. Collectively, these studies have led to several NIH grant submissions to further study inte - grated mind-body movement approaches to improve outcomes in cardiopulmonary populations. 4.

Respir Med. 2021 RESEARCH 10 11 Osher Center For Integrative Medicine 2021 Annual Report Osher Center For Integrative Medicine 2021 Annual ReportMounting evidence points to the tremendous levels of stress experienced by health care providers and researchers. The COVID-19 pandemic and underlying systemic inequities continue to exacerbate stress levels. Without the provision of tools to mitigate and me- diate these impacts, providers and researchers will continue to experience high levels of anxiety, suicide and burnout. In 2021 the Osher Center continued to build on and develop new programs to care for medical trainees and professionals. This included (1) adapting and continuing the HMS required course in resilience, (2) developing a new program for students graduating from the Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) program, (3) leading virtual meditation sessions for the hospital community across Mass General Brigham and (4) establishing TedxMGH. Harvard Medical School Resiliency Course (BRDG) The Building Resiliency, Depth and Grit in Medicine program (BRDG) is a required resiliency training course for all first-year students at Harvard Medical School. Developed in 2019 by Dr. Darshan Mehta, Osher Center's Education Director, the course continues to be taken by all 180 first year medical students each year. Adding some SMART to STEM In 2021, the Osher Center piloted an eight- week resiliency training program based on the Stress Management and Resiliency Training (SMART) program developed at Harvard Medical School. The curriculum was tailored to the needs of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) doctoral and master's students. The results from this pilot study, which suggest marked changes in many domains of well-being, are being leveraged to seek funding for a national demonstration project in 2022. Virtual Meditations for hospital community With the onset of the pandemic, Dr. Darshan Mehta was asked to lead virtual meditation sessions. In 2021, these sessions became a regular offering for the MGB community\u2014 available to all employees. In addition, the sessions expanded to include guest leaders from the MGB community\u2014fostering diversity and inclusivity amidst the sessions. TEDxMGH In 2021, Dr. Darshan Mehta built out a new Tedx speaker series, showcasing inspirational stories from the Mass General community, including how people have handled challenges through innovation, resilience, vulnerability, and connection. EDUCATION Education remains one of the three pillars of our Center's mission. In addition to providing education through our Grand Rounds, Network Forums, and scientific and public presentations delivered by our leadership, we are also committed to training the next generation of clinicians and researchers in integrative medicine. In 2021, we continued our successful National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded HMS Research Fellowship in Integrative Medicine (T32) into its 22nd consecutive year and initiated novel programs to train healthcare providers and researchers with life-long resiliency skills. Training the Next Generation in Integrative Medicine Research and Leadership WREN BURTON, DC, is one of our newest fellows supported by a generous gift from the NCMIC Foundation. Dr. Burton's research focuses on the relationship between chronic musculoskeletal pain, mobility and fall risk, and the potential use of chiropractic care for fall prevention.

JAMES DOORLEY, PHD, is a 1st year T32 year fellow. His research focuses on mind-body and psychologically-informed physical therapy for chronic pain, and developing web-based mind-body interventions for pain to increase access in diverse, under- served populations. JACKLYN FOLEY, PHD, is a 2nd year T32 Fellow. Her research evaluates mindfulness and cardiovascular health among people living with HIV. Her work is supported by a Harvard University Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) Developmental Award. She was also awarded an Innovative Early Career Pilot Award in Aging and Palliative Care at the Massachusetts General Hospital to study cognitive behavioral therapy-based group interventions to reduce inflammation in older people with HIV. EUNMEE YANG, PHD, MPH, MS, LICAC, is a 3rd year T32 Fellow. Her research focuses on under- standing the biophysical proper- ties of acupoints, using sophisti- cated measures of blood flow, skin temperature and pressure sensitivity, within the context of inflammatory bowel disease. YAN MA, PHD, graduated from the fellowship in 2021 and is now a junior faculty member at the Osher Center. Her research explores the use of non-linear physiological markers of heart and brain wave dynamics to characterize sleep quality, and how bedtime mind-body practices can improve sleep onset and quality in patients with insomnia. DENNIS MUNOZ-VERGARA, VMD, PHD, MPH, graduated from the fellowship in 2021. He studies the impact of yoga-like stretching in both animal models and humans to understand the effect of mechanical forces on tissue remodeling, inflammation and its resolution. KRISTEN KRAEMER, PHD, graduated from the T32 program in 2020 and joined Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center as a Harvard faculty member. She was awarded a K23 career development award from the National Institutes of Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) to study components of mind-body exercise for physical activity engagement in metabolic syndrome.

Osher post-doctoral research fellows and faculty visiting the HMS Arnold Arboretum as part of a forest bathing workshop RESEARCH FELLOWS\"This course has revolutionized my world view- that seems like a strong statement, but I have truly learned so much about managing my stress and anxiety. I think these tools are ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL to navigating a high stress academic environment. I always believed that lowering stress meant lowering productivity, but this class taught me just the opposite. - STEM PARTICIPANT Our NIH-funded post-doctoral research fellowship continues to thrive. It is the longest standing training program in integrative medicine research in the United States. Our four current fellows-in-training are tackling leading edge research topics ranging from brain responses to meditation in patients with chronic pain to the scientific basis for acupuncture points. Their work has led to multiple peer reviewed publications and awards. Recent graduates have joined Harvard faculty, and earlier graduates of the Fellowship continue to have an important presence in integrative medicine leadership roles nationally. In addition, in 2021, we secured funding from NCMIC Foundation to support training for our first chiropractic research fellow.

Well done! The pace, quantity and quality of information and demonstrations in the workshop were all perfect. Thank you so much!\" - PROGRAM PARTICIPANTManaging chronic neck pain for nurses: A clinical research study The high stress experienced by nurses not only impacts mental health, but also takes a toll on the physical body. An estimated 30-40% of nurses report chronic neck pain, which impacts all aspects of daily function, quality of life and their ability to deliver quality care. Supported by grants from multiple funders including the Inter-Institutional Network for Chiropractic Research through Palmer College Foundation and the Van Sloun Foundation, in 2021 the OCC was able to provide BWH nurses experiencing chronic neck pain a coordinated regimen of tai chi and chiropractic care at no cost. Outcomes of this program are being used to inform the design of a future study. Initial qualitative interviews indicate positive benefits experienced by participating nurses. OCC Practice and providers recognized for quality care Dr. Levy was named in Boston Magazine's \"Best Doctors\" 2021 for his 14th consecutive year! Dr. Kowalski received the MGB 2021 Pillars of Excellence Award in recog- nition of outstanding performance and commitment to excellence. Dr. Kowalski was also identified as a Top Performer in Patient Experience at BWH, ranking above the 90th percentile nationally. \"[Dr.] Matt Kowalski] is a professional with broad knowledge of how to handle individual issues. His ability to connect with patients is phenomenal. I always look forward to my visits and know I will feel a hundred times better after my treatment.\" - OCC PATIENT \"This is a great session by Dr. Wayne, he is well prepared and very patient in teaching and answering questions throughout the class. I definitely learned a lot about tai chi.\" - PROGRAM PARTICIPANTA combination of the introduction of new programs, optimizing our service provider availability and providing co-locating space helped boost the clinic's financial growth in 2021. The measures taken to build provider capacity and engage our patient community are listed below and the above graph shows the patient flow trends over recent years, including the bounce back after 2020 pandemic impacts. Optimizing provider availability All integrative health practitioner schedules booked consistently over 95%; most at 100%; Growing waiting list. Increased current acupuncturist's schedule by 50%. Extra session per month added to craniosacral therapist's schedule on patients' request. Two additional sessions added to junior chiropractor's schedule. Engaging OCC community Increased sessions for MBSR and Tai Chi programs. Introduced new Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy program. Relaunched OCC newsletter for patient base. Building our team Two additional acupuncturists credentialled and integrated into team. One massage therapist, with movement-based therapy training, and new chiropractic research fellow undergoing credentialling. Started search for a second craniosacral therapist.Increased patient traffic despite COVID-19 challenges Caring for our caregivers during COVIDCLINICAL We are proud to share some of the notable achievements of the Osher Clinical Center (OCC) in 2021. These include professional and public recognition of our providers, considerable financial growth, despite the COVID 19 pandemic, and expanded and new clinical programming. New grant funding allowed the clinic to establish resiliency programs for Mass General Brigham (MGB) employees and their families and new resiliency-based public classes were also made available for the public. We optimized provider schedules in order to see more patients and took steps to recruit new providers to expand our team. Finally, as a pillar of our current financial model, the clinic continued to provide co-locating space to other MGB departments and services, such as neurology and pulmonary. The above combination of novel program- ming and logistical optimization contributed to healthy and sustained financial growth of the clinic in 2021.Subsidizing wellness resiliency classes for MGB employees Our clinical team values being able to provide resources to care provid- ers across MGB to fortify their resil- ience and protect against burnout. Towards this end, we successfully competed for a cross-institutional grant that supported delivery of a variety of self-care mind-body courses for employees and their families at no cost. The resulting $22.5k MGB Wellness Grant allowed us to deliver Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and tai chi training to over 100 employees and their families. Success of these programs led to a larger renewal grant in 2022 that will allow us to expand and extend the program's reach. 14 15 Osher Center For Integrative Medicine 2021 Annual Report Osher Center For Integrative Medicine 2021 Annual ReportNETWORK BUILDING As a 'Center Without Walls,' one of our primary aims is to connect and strengthen the integrative medicine community across Harvard Medical School\u2014and beyond. We did this in a myriad of ways throughout 2021 despite the limitations on in-person gathering that the COVID-19 pandemic presented. We continued to support innovative research through our signature Osher Pilot Research Grants and provide opportunities for learning and connection through our monthly Grand Rounds, co-sponsored events, and online presence. Strengthening and Stewarding the IM Community through Our Center Without Walls Pilot Research Grants Since the Osher Pilot Research Grant program was launched in 2015, we have distributed over $1 million in seed funding to the HMS community. The program supports innovative, cross-disciplinary and collaborative projects in integrative medicine that are consistent with the research domains within our Strategic Plan: The Science of Mind-Body Connections; Clinical Effectiveness of Multimodal Integrative Interventions; Systems and Translational Biology in Integrative Medicine; and Placebo and the Science of Human Connections. We provide discretionary and competitive awards. To date, over 50% of funds have supported competitive grant applicants. All projects are scored against strategic and scientific merit, with competitive applications undergoing an additional formal peer-review process. Each year we award $100,000 in competitive grants, generally across three projects. Studies are followed for up to three years post-award to determine outcomes beyond the initial research results, such as lever- aged new research funds, publications, scientific presentations and new collaborations.Notable outcomes from past Pilot Project Awards Olivia Okereke, MD (2017: BWH) Relation of DNA methylation and molecular markers to health and well-being in aging Publication: T ransl.

Dr. I-Min Lee presented the inaugural lecture, \"Why Should I Bother Being Physically Active?\"Online presence We reach our online integrative medicine community through our Osher- Center.org website, monthly e-newsletter, YouTube Channel, and social media postings. We support the connectivity of our community with video resources, research publications, access to clinical providers and news and event updates. Interactive Network Maps We further support connectivity across the Harvard integrative medicine research community with our Research integrative Medicine network map on our website. The interactive map, which automatically updates on a monthly basis, is searchable by publication authors and integrative medicine modality. This functionality can help researchers identify potential cross-institutional and interdisciplinary research collaboration opportunities. There are currently 733 authors of integrative medicine articles in the Harvard research community, responsible for 1,348 publications.NETWORK BUILDING Our monthly Integrative Medicine Grand Rounds have been running since 2015 and have inspired other integrative medicine centers to create similar programs. Attendance remains double that of prior years since switching to a fully virtual format in 2020 in response to the pandemic. In 2021, we hosted successive leaders from their respective fields including Joseph Loscalzo, JoAnn Manson, Jun Mao and I-Min Lee. Research and clinical case presentations included a diverse range of topics from diet and nutrition, cardiovascular health, healthy aging, integrative oncology and delivering integrative care during COVID-19. Integrative Medicine Grand Rounds \"Jack always understood the importance of exercise, and his lifelong passion for running started on a cross country team in high school. When health challenges began making it more difficult for him to continue his running routine and medications were not able to compensate, he began looking at how integrative therapies offered by the Osher Center might help him. Therapeutic massage and tai chi both contributed to Jack's balance, patience and better understanding of how to deal with the limitations of his neurological disease. \" Mary Corneille Osher Mailing List Activity 2017 2018 Subscribers sessions Jack Cogan and Mary Corneille Science of mind-body connections Clinical effectiveness of multimodal and integrative interventions Systems and translational biology of integrative medicine Placebo and the science of human connection SCIENCE OF MIND-BODY CONNECTIONS CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF MULTIMODAL AND INTEGRATIVE INTERVENTIONS SYSTEMS AND TRANSLATIONAL BIOLOGY OF INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE PLACEBO AND THE SCIENCE OF HUMAN CONNECTION SCIENCE OF MIND-BODY CONNECTIONS CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF MULTIMODAL AND INTEGRATIVE INTERVENTIONS SYSTEMS AND TRANSLATIONAL BIOLOGY OF INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE PLACEBO AND THE SCIENCE OF HUMAN CONNECTION SCIENCE OF MIND-BODY CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS SYSTEMS & TRANSLATIONAL BIOLOGY PLACEBO & THE SCIENCE OF HUMAN CONNECTION SCIENCE OF MIND-BODY CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS SYSTEMS & TRANSLATIONAL BIOLOGY PLACEBO & THE SCIENCE OF HUMAN CONNECTION 20151200 1000 800 600 400 200 0 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021Integrative Medicine Grand Rounds annual attendance (2015-2021) 2021 Grand Rounds Registered: 1,800 Attended Live: 1,100 YouTube 3,130 18 19 Osher Center For Integrative Medicine 2021 Report Osher Center For Integrative Medicine 2021 Annual ReportKathryn T .
