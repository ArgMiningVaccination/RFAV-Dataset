They have been in use for thousands of years. Let' s uncover why they have been around for so long and how they are used to help manage pain, stress or other symptoms.D id you know? What is Aromatherapy? oA romatherapy is the use of essential oils from plants (flowers, herbs, or trees) as an integrative health approach to medical treatment. oT he essential oils are most often used by breathing them in or by rubbing a diluted form to the skin. It is the promotion and harmonization of emotional, physical and spiritual health through the application of these extracts.What is an Essential Oil? oEssential oils are extracted from flowers, fruits, leaves or seeds to capture the aromatic \"essence\" of the plant. oT hese oils are obtained through mechanical pressing or distillation (steam process). oT hey are concentrated plant extracts that retain the natural smell and flavor of their source. oT he result is a super -concentrated oil that can be breathed in, massaged in, or diluted and added to lotions or bath water. Case Scenario 1 T wo older adults seek arthritis pain relief Meet M r. T hompson M r. T hompson is a gardener by trade. H e recently retired and set out to landscape his own home after many years of working for others. U nfortunately, after a few months of working with his hands, his Rheumatoid A rthritis became too painful to continue. M r. T hompson has been going to the same clinic for years to receive routine care, massage and attend patient support groups. A t his recent appointment, his doctor mentioned adding aromatherapy to his weekly hand massage treatment as it could potentially lower pain and help improve his activity level. Meet Mrs. Leary M rs. L eary is a retired kindergarten teacher. She loves to be outside by taking her dog for walks, visiting with other retirees, and shopping at the local mall. L ately, she has had to cut back on her walking because her O steoarthritis has been causing her knees to ache. M rs. L eary attends the same Clinic as M r. T hompson and her doctor also recommends aromatherapy. H e says it could help her with staying active and may reduce her pain. What the Research Says What the research says: Can it help with pain management? oL avender is associated with reduced pain when used before or during routine shots, IV insertions and trigger point injections. oA romatherapy massage with essential oils (lavender, juniper, ylang ylang, rose) has shown a reduction in pain and fatigue for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. oPost-operative knee replacement patients had reduced pain and blood pressure with inhalation of eucalyptus oils.What the research says: Can it help with pain management? oFor labor and delivery pain specifically, research has identified the benefit of many types of essential oils in reducing pain intensity during early labor pain. oT here is promising evidence in pain reduction for patients using aromatherapy essential oils with conventional medication therapy for renal colic (kidney stones), hemodialysis and neck pain. What the research says: Can it help with stres anxiety or sleep ? oEssential oils may be promising to use before medical procedures that cause stress and anxiety. oIn a study of intensive care unit patients, stress was reduced with the use of lavender essential oil, as was heart rate and blood pressure, signs that it may be a useful tool for relaxation and calming. What the research says: Can it help with stres anxiety or sleep ? oL abor and delivery patients using multiple oils have experienced reduced anxiety during the early stages of labor. oL avender improved sleep quality for patients in intensive care when inhaled prior to sleep times. Applications for Essential OiInhalant Inhalers, often called aromasticks, are plastic tubes that contain fabric already soaked in the es s ent ial oils . The lips t ick -sized container has a cap that needs to be unscrewed before you inhale t he oils . Advantages: personal inhalers are very low cost and are long -lasting. Disadvantages: personal inhalers are easily misplaced and the product requires some manual skill to use. For example, opening c be difficult for patients with arthritis. Aromatherapy Tab/Patch A roma tabs/patches are small single use adhesive squares designed to adhere to the skin or clothing. Each square has a small pouch, which contains several drops of either a single essential oil or a blend. Patches are applied generally on the upper chest, so that vapors will rise and be inhaled. Advantages: easy application and removal; essential oils do not touch the skin Disadvantages: possible skin irritation from the adhesive, and cost of the device. Each patch is single use only and lasts up to 6 -8 hours. Skin Application T he application of properly diluted (no greater concentration than 3 -5%) essential oils on the skin is practiced in massage therapy. It can be diluted in an appropriate cream, lotion or salve for the oil chosen, and then applied to the skin Advantages: stress and anxiety reduction, pain relief, decreased swelling, helping maintain skin quality, and improved muscle tone and joint mob Disadvantages : full-body massage may be limited by time or physical conditions Diffuser T he most common method to actively diffuse essential oils is by use of an ultrasonic diffuser, a device with a container to hold water and the oils that produces a fine mist. T here are also options that do not use water. Advantages: ability to quickly fill a room with scent Disadvantages: affecting others nearby who may be sensitive to smell, potential for bacteria growth if not refilled and cleaned properly and potential for electric shock if water is spilled on the cord Image: Tisserand InstituteCommon Varieties and Purpose/Use Tea and viral infections Peppermint (Mentha piperita)Headaches, fever, nausea, and fatigue Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia)Minor burns, insomn pain relief, and woun care German chamomile (Matricaria recutita)Inflammatory skin problems Bergamot (Citrus bergamia)Mild antidepressant and tonic Myrrh ( Commiphora O l h lth Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinali )Stimulant and anti - infective agent Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus Eucalyptus radiata, Eucalyptus smithii and inflammation Lemongrass citratus )Fungal infections Mandarin Stomach upset and tl *University of Minnesota Center for Spirituality and HealingSafe Use of Essential Oils oA lways talk to your regular health care provider before using essential oils. Certain medical conditions are not safe to mix with aromatherapy. A lways read every label carefully to ensure safe use of a product. oDo not eat essential oils. Some oils may cause serious health effects if they are consumed, such as Wintergreen or Clove oil in children. So food grade extracts and oils may be safe to consume. The Food and Administration maintains a list of food grade extracts and oils genera recognized as safe for food additives when cooking, such as pepper and vanilla. If in doubt, always ask your health care provider.Safe Use of Essential Oils oSensitivity to smells. If you are smell sensitive and dislike an oil you try use a rubbing alcohol wipe to quickly remove the odor safely.oAllergies are a possibility. Always test a small patch first if applying a dilution to your skin to test any unwanted reactions before applying t larger areas of the body.oEssential oils should never be put directly on the skin. A carrier oil (avocado, olive, grapeseed) must be used when applying to the bod Many essential oils (single/blends) often recommend a dilution of 1-5% Additional Considerations Asthma: Essential oil use should not be considered for people with asthma. There is research that shows it could lead to poor health ef Condition of the skin you are applying oils to : Damaged, diseased, or inflamed skin may absorb more essential oils than normal and the s may be more sensitive to reactions such as itching, redness, etc. Be applying to a large area of skin, place on a very small area of skin to for sensitivity.Additional Considerations Age:young children and older adults can be more sensitive to essenti It is important to use a more diluted blend to avoid reactions. Remem store essential oils out of reach of young children to avoid a potentia harmful exposure. Sun exposure: can cause phototoxicity (severe burns or skin cancer) if is exposure to natural sunlight or sun -bed radiation following oil applicatio to the skin, especially citrus oils. Let's Return to Mr. Thompson T he therapist used an ointment containing L avender & Spearmint essential oils for his hand massage. M r. T hompson likes the relaxing smell and warmth the oils gave to his tired, sore hands. O nce finished, M r. T hompson was given the remainder of the ointment and instructed to use 2 -3 t imes daily. U pon his return, for a 4 -week follow -up, M r. T hompson said after using the L avender & Spearmint essential oil ointment daily, he felt it was more helpful than massage alone. H e' s happy to report he' s now finished his front flowerbeds and will be starting on his backyard soon. and Mrs. Leary T he therapist used an ointment of black seed oil and 2.5% each of G inger & R osemary essential oils. A fter treatm ent, M rs. L eary w as instructed to use the ointment 3 times per week. U pon her return for a follow -up v isit, M rs. L eary stated that use of the ointment was more beneficial than simply massage alone. M rs. L eary stated she couldn't believe how much further she can comfortably walk since starting the G inger & R osemary essential oil regimen. How Do I Safely Buy Oils? Considerations for evaluating oils Review the label: It should include the Latin name of the plant, information on purity or other ingredients added to it, and the country in which the plant was grown. Be wary of false claims that an oil is \"pure, therapeutic or aromatherapy -grade\" as there is no regulating body verifying these claims. Look at the company details: Review the information about the company to see how many years they have been in business and what credentials or certifications they hold to qualify them to understand and sell oils responsibly. Container type: Preferred companies package oils in small brown or blue glass bottles to protect the quality. Plastic can break down over time and light can break down and evaporate the oils Considerations for evaluating oils Choose oils not fragrances: Fragrance or perfume oils are made from essential oils combined with chemicals or entirely from chemicals. They're not suitable for aromatherapy \u2014instead, look for bottles that contain 100% of a single essential oil rather than a blend. Pricing: Essential oils range in price based on how much plant matter it takes to produce the oil. There should be a wide variety of prices \u2014rose absolute or sandalwood oils will be more expensive, while sweet orange oil will be on the less expensive end. Companies with a flat cost are likely selling oils containing additives. When shopping online, consider companies that can provide a batch analysis from an independent lab to verify quality. This analysis is called a GC/MS and helps show how pure an oil is or if it contains other s bstances Discussion and Questions Have you ever used aromatherapy before? Did you find any specific benefits when using essential oils? Do you see yourself exploring this topic further? Would you feel comfortable asking your health care provider about aromatherapy?Thank you! pami.emergency.med.jax.ufl.edu 904-244-4986 pami@jax.ufl.edu Search us on social using @ufpamiReferences A roma W eb.
