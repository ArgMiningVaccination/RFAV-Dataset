An article in yesterday's Women to Watch report incorrectly referred to him as a former president of NTT. (WSJ November 21, 2006) GENENTECH INC. has received eight new regulatory approvals for new and existing drugs this year. A Nov. 20 article incorrectly said the company had nearly a half-dozen such approvals. (WSJ Dec. 15, 2006) 2. Indra Nooyi President and Chief Executive PEPSICO IN HER FIRST public appearance as PepsiCo Inc.'s new chief executive last month, Indra Nooyi wasted little time taking the vision that won her the post and spinning it into the future. \"I don't see any need presently to change a strategy that is working,\" she said at the start of a daylong meeting in New York with industry analysts. Ms. Nooyi, after all, was a key force behind the strategy that has transformed the company over the past decade into a convenience-food powerhouse, from a company that had been known for lackluster financial results as it struggled to compete with Coca-Cola Co. Ms. Nooyi helped spin off PepsiCo's restaurant and bottling businesses and engineer the 1998 acquisition of juice maker Tropicana. That deal accelerated PepsiCo's expansion into healthier drinks and snacks, a segment she identified as a source of future growth shortly after arriving at the company in 1994. She also was the lead negotiator on a $13.8 billion acquisition of Quaker Oats Co. in 2001. Her skills as a strategist are a big reason why PepsiCo's board awarded Ms. Nooyi, 51 years old, the post of CEO even though she has never held a position at the company overseeing operations, normally a prerequisite for the top job. As chief executive, Ms. Nooyi is expected to continue PepsiCo's push to expand its foothold in international markets, long dominated on the beverage side by Coca-Cola. The company also plans to spend some $500 million a year on small acquisitions that help fill in market gaps. -- Betsy McKay 3. Irene Rosenfeld Chief Executive KRAFT FOODS PROBABLY NO OTHER chief executive has more impact on the stomachs of millions of Americans than Irene Rosenfeld. That's because she heads the nation's largest food company, Kraft Foods Inc., maker of Oscar Mayer meats, Chips Ahoy! cookies and that staple of kids' diets everywhere, Kraft Macaroni & Cheese. But Kraft has been squeezed lately, pressed on one side by competition from cheaper private labels and on the other by a lack of innovative ideas for new products. So Ms. Rosenfeld, 53, who joined the company as CEO in June, has wasted little time in trying to turn things around. In September she announced a new executive team, and last month, in her first full conference call with analysts, she identified underperforming product lines. Chief among them were Kraft's ready-to-drink beverages, such as Fruit20, its pourable salad dressings and its heavily promoted personal coffee maker, Tassimo. She did not disclose plans for those brands. A big question mark involves Kraft's corporate parent, Altria Group Inc. Altria owns about 88% of Kraft's stock. But last month, Altria's board said it intends to finalize at a regularly scheduled meeting on Jan. 31 its plans for the distribution of all Kraft shares the company owns to Altria shareholders. Such a spinoff would free up Ms. Rosenfeld to take Kraft in the direction she sees fit. Ms. Rosenfeld, who holds a Ph.D. in business administration, is a big believer in direct, clear communication. \"My favorite feedback came from a boss who once said to me, `You're so good, I didn't realize you were a woman.' \" -- Joseph T. Hallinan 4. Patricia A. Woertz President and Chief Executive ARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND WHETHER THE U.S. can break its addiction to foreign oil anytime soon depends in large measure on Patricia A. Woertz. Ms. Woertz, a former Chevron Corp. executive, started in May at Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., the largest U.S. producer of corn-derived ethanol fuel. The new CEO has pledged to make the grain processor the \"global leader in bioenergy.\" Already in control of 20% of U.S. ethanol production, ADM plans to build two giant plants in the Midwest that would increase its annual capacity by nearly half, to 1.6 billion gallons by 2008. ADM also is building plants that turn soybeans and canola into biodiesel. And it's interested in using Brazilian sugar and Indonesian palm oil to make fuel. Ms. Woertz, 53 years old, is walking a tightrope, though. While she wants ADM to capitalize on forecasts that demand for ethanol could easily double, it is a very volatile business. The rapid expansion of the ethanol industry and falling petroleum prices in recent months punctured the record-high ethanol prices of the summer, and with it, cooled interest in the highflying stock. At the same time, Ms. Woertz risks alienating the food-company executives who buy their ingredients from ADM. They worry that the diversion of crops for making fuel will create shortages and greatly increase their costs. But Ms. Woertz is optimistic that demands for both can be satisfied profitably by ADM. \"I believe it is an `and' world,\" she says. -- Scott Kilman 5. Andrea Jung Chairman and Chief Executive AVON PRODUCTS THE NEXT YEAR is likely to be a make-or-break one for Andrea Jung, the chairman and CEO of Avon Products Inc. Nearly through the first year of a massive multiyear plan to revamp the world's largest direct seller, Ms. Jung must continue to keep investors and some five million sales representatives around the globe confident in her leadership. Though Avon's earnings are down more than 50% so far this year, there are signs that Ms. Jung's ambitious turnaround plan is gaining ground. Steps to re-energize U.S. sales representatives are taking hold. Sales in foreign markets -- from China to Latin America to Turkey -- are proving strong. And Wall Street is getting increasingly bullish. For years, Ms. Jung, a graduate of Princeton University, has landed on the short list of candidates to lead bigger companies. But the 48-year-old Ms. Jung, Avon's CEO since 1999, has maintained that she is committed to seeing Avon through its turnaround. Already famed for bringing innovation and style to Avon's products, packaging and image, Ms. Jung continues to charge forward with more ways to keep the company a nimble competitor against beauty-industry titans Procter & Gamble Co. and L'Oreal SA. -- Ellen Byron 6. Neelie Kroes EU Antitrust Commissioner EUROPEAN UNION COMMISSION HER YEARS of service on Dutch corporate boards nearly toppled Neelie Kroes's appointment as the European Union's top antitrust cop in 2004. But by playing hardball with Microsoft Corp., the 65-year-old former Dutch transportation minister has dispelled concerns she'd be too cozy with big business. Taking over a long-running case against Microsoft, Ms. Kroes at first tried to negotiate a solution with Chief Executive Steve Ballmer. But she was also determined to uphold a 2004 EU ruling that found Microsoft had illegally used its Windows operating system to muscle aside software competitors. When Microsoft failed to comply to her satisfaction with an order to produce a kind of how-to manual for rival companies trying to make software work with Windows, Ms. Kroes fined the company 280.5 million euros ($359 million) in July. \"I don't buy Microsoft's line that they didn't know what was being asked of them,\" she said then. The result: Microsoft has produced a new format for its programming manual that even the U.S. Department of Justice has adopted in enforcing its 2002 antitrust settlement with the company. And in response to Ms. Kroes's warnings, Microsoft last month announced it had altered its next generation of Windows, named Vista, to address antitrust concerns raised by competitors in the Internet-search and computer-security fields. Known in the Netherlands as \"Nickel Neelie,\" in part for her tough negotiating skills, Ms. Kroes worked in her father's transportation business in bustling Rotterdam, launched her political career in 1969 on the Rotterdam city council, and later served in the Dutch Parliament. She is a past president of Nyenrode University, a Dutch business school. Ms. Kroes and her staff are also trying to scale back government subsidies to European businesses and break down barriers to a single European market in financial services and energy. \"It's an uphill battle,\" she says of trying to persuade EU nations to stop blocking mergers in important industries. -- Mary Jacoby 7. Patricia Russo Chairman and Chief Executive LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES AFTER THE TECH crash, Patricia Russo brought Lucent Technologies Inc. back from the brink by shrinking the company to half its former size. Then, when growth proved elusive in the crowded field of telecom equipment, she completed a merger agreement with Alcatel SA of France-a deal that had foundered years before. Ms. Russo is poised to lead the Paris-based combined company, although Lucent is the smaller partner and she speaks little French. With the companies expecting to close the merger on Nov. 30, she is preparing for such challenges as shaving $1.8 billion in annual costs by cutting overlapping product lines and eliminating 9,000 jobs from the combined work force of 88,000. The 54-year-old Ms. Russo is no stranger to adversity-or to corporate change. After eight years in sales and marketing at International Business Machines Corp., she joined AT&T Corp. in 1981, where she turned around a unit that was losing $500 million a year selling internal phone systems to corporations. She went to Lucent after it split off from AT&T in 1996, then left in August 2000 just before its accounting and sales problems became public. She next became president and chief operating officer of Eastman Kodak Co., then in the throes of transition from film to digital photography. And finally, after less than a year at Kodak, she was offered the chance to return to Lucent and turn it around as its new chief executive. Now Ms. Russo knows much of Wall Street expects her to lead Alcatel Lucent only long enough to see through the cuts. But she insists she will call the shots at the new company. \"These kinds of things always have significant challenges,\" Ms. Russo said in an interview after the deal was announced. \"I'm not naive about that.\" -- Sara Silver 8. Clara Furse Chief Executive LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE THE FIRST FIVE years of Clara Furse's tenure atop London Stock Exchange PLC have not lacked drama. This no-nonsense chief executive, the first female chief in the LSE's 300-year history, has rebuffed four takeover attempts and faces a potential fifth. Meantime, she has proved an effective champion of London's challenge to New York as a global financial center. Under her stewardship -- helped by a toughened U.S. regulatory atmosphere -- the LSE has stolen New York's crown as the place of choice for non-U.S. companies to list initial public offerings. LSE's share price also has more than tripled to around GBP 12 ($23) recently from 348 pence when it listed in July 2001. Now she faces what may be her toughest challenge. Nasdaq Stock Market Inc., whose overtures LSE already rejected once this year, has bought a 25.3% stake in the exchange -- a move that most observers see as a precursor to a second attempt by the New York-based market to buy Europe's largest equity market. Until now, the 49-year-old Ms. Furse, a Canadian born to Dutch parents, has enjoyed the support of large institutional shareholders. Many, however, have sold their LSE holdings, and in their place are hedge funds that tend to be more keen on a quick sale than long-term strategy. Nasdaq's overture comes as stock exchanges globally are looking to consolidate. And some critics in the industry say Ms. Furse should have positioned LSE as a hunter, not the hunted. In 2001, she tried unsuccessfully to buy the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange. Instead, Amsterdam-based Euronext NV won Liffe, and LSE has been fighting off takeover attempts since. Ms. Furse argued the terms of the Liffe deal were not right for LSE. Investors who have sat across a conference table from Ms. Furse say that her ability to argue convincingly has been one of her chief virtues. -- Alistair MacDonald 9. Anne Mulcahy Chairman and Chief Executive XEROX THE CEO and chairman of copier giant Xerox Corp. has gotten a lot of favorable publicity as a turnaround artist, but she sometimes laments the role that gender plays in making her reputation. \"I yearn for the day when . . . the word woman is not an unofficial part of my title . . . for the day when there is no need nor interest in a list of most powerful women in business,\" Anne Mulcahy said recently while receiving an award. The 54-year-old Ms. Mulcahy, who since taking the helm in 2001 has guided Xerox through a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and a financial restructuring that skirted bankruptcy, prefers that Xerox be admired for its slew of new products, such as digital color presses and multifunction devices. She continues to predict those products and the company's growing services business will make Xerox a growth company again, as the impact of declining revenue from old-style copiers steadily diminishes. Xerox's turnaround continued in the past year as improving liquidity led it to start a stock-buyback programand earned it an investment-grade credit rating from Fitch Ratings, the smallest of the credit-rating services. But sales growth has remained elusive. And despite improving earnings, Xerox stock has remained in the mid-teens -- four times its 2000 low, but little changed over the past two years. -- William M. Bulkeley 10. Margaret C. Whitman President and Chief Executive EBAY THROUGH EBAY Inc.'s first decade of blistering growth, Margaret C. Whitman offered a confident, stable hand at the helm of the Internet auctioneer. Now, she presents the same assurances even as revenue and profit increases slow and other challenges emerge. Since a March 2005 dalliance with the top job at Walt Disney Co., many investors and employees have feared the 50-year-old president and chief executive might leave the company. But Ms. Whitman recently vowed to stay put. She said in an interview earlier this year that she has \"no plans\" to leave. \"I'm very committed to this company,\" she said. Ms. Whitman, who joined eBay as CEO in 1998, has some tough work ahead. The San Jose, Calif., company is trying to reverse slowing growth on its flagship auction Web site. It's also competing with resurgent local competitors in overseas markets such as China and South Korea. Plus, investors are still waiting for acquisitions like Internet calling company Skype, which eBay bought for $2.5 billion last year, to pay off. Ms. Whitman isn't standing still. She has unleashed initiatives such as eBay Express, a Web site that sells new, fixed-price goods. EBay is busy testing and implementing new partnerships with Yahoo Inc. and Google Inc. to sell ads on eBay sites. Through those partnerships, eBay also hopes to attract more users. She is also busy fostering the company's next generation of leaders. After the departure of some top executives, she has both promoted executives internally and brought in outside talent. \"Despite some bumps, 2006 is exactly the evolutionary year we thought it would be,\" Ms. Whitman said on the company's last earnings call in October. -- Mylene Mangalindan 11. Zoe Cruz Co-President MORGAN STANLEY OVER THE PAST year, Zoe Cruz has solidified her position at Morgan Stanley. She served as acting president of Morgan Stanley after the return of John Mack as CEO in mid-2005 settled a bitter dispute over leadership of the securities firm. Then Mr. Mack ended uncertainty over her status by removing the \"acting\" designation in February, naming her co-president alongside veteran investment banker Robert Scully. Ms. Cruz, age 51, kept authority over the firm's largest business -- institutional securities -- as well as its brokers who serve individual investors. Ms. Cruz, a veteran of the foreign-exchange and fixed-income divisions, must now steer the firm through an era of greater risk taking, mixing more trading with the firm's own capital with an increasingly global client business. In her first year in this role, Morgan Stanley's assets rose 25% to break the $1 trillion mark for the first time as of May 31. Mr. Mack calls Ms. Cruz \"a first-class risk manager.\" Before one market downturn last spring, he says, \"she came to me literally a week before and said, `You know, I've grown up in the currency markets, I see this trading, I'm getting concerned.' \" She wanted to speak with her traders, Mr. Mack recalls, and \"cut some of our positions back.\" \"She has an intuitive feel,\" he says. -- Randall Smith 12. Naina Lal Kidwai Group General Manager and Country Head, India HSBC HOLDINGS THIS YEAR marked the long-anticipated promotion of Naina Lal Kidwai to group general manager and country head of HSBC Holdings PLC's Indian operations. The promotion from deputy CEO puts Ms. Kidwai in charge of HSBC's growing family of more than 22,000 employees in India. After becoming India's first female graduate from Harvard Business School in 1982, she has climbed the corporate ladder at foreign companies in India, including Morgan Stanley and ANZ Grindlays. Along the way, Ms. Kidwai has witnessed and helped guide some of the most important financial reforms in the country, which have freed up Indian companies to raise billions of dollars abroad and foreign investors to bring billions into India. Today, the 49-year-old is spearheading HSBC's expansion plans aimed at reaching more of India's increasingly affluent middle class. With millions of Indians getting credit cards, car loans and mortgages for the first time, HSBC -- which was a pioneer for many of these retail products in India -- is sitting in the sweet spot of the Indian economy. Though she has often been offered positions in the international financial centers of London and New York, Ms. Kidwai says she has chosen to stay in India because it gives her an opportunity to shape policy and improve her country through industry and government committees. And Indian operations are becoming increasingly important for HSBC. After seeing its profit surge 53% in the year ended in March, HSBC India is the 10th largest contributor to HSBC Holdings' profit. Only a year earlier India was ranked 16th. -- Eric Bellman 13. Ana Patricia Botin Executive Chairman BANCO ESPANOL DE CREDITO ONE OF SPAIN'S highest-profile executives, Ana Patricia Botin, executive chairman of Banco Espanol de Credito, is poised to move higher -- though perhaps not at Banesto, a midtier bank in Spain. The 46-year-old Ms. Botin is likely heiress to the family dynasty at Grupo Santander, one of the world's top 10 banks by market capitalization. The current chairman, her father, 72-year-old Emilio Botin, transformed the banking company from a once-provincial Spanish bank into one of the largest banks in Latin America, and, thanks to the 2004 acquisition of Abbey National Bank, a leading player in Britain. Last year, Santander landed in the U.S. as well, with the purchase of a stake in Sovereign Bancorp. Santander was a Botin family affair for much of the 20th century: A Botin first became chairman in 1909, and a Botin has led the bank continuously since 1950. The family owns just over 1% of the bank's shares. Ms. Botin, who is on the management committee at Santander and the boards of Italian insurer Generali and Mexican media group Televisa, spent the early part of her career in New York and Latin America in corporate and investment banking. She started out with J.P. Morgan and later switched to the Santander group. In 1999, when Banco Santander merged with local rival Banco Central Hispano, she left the bank and started a private-equity fund and technology consultancy, before returning to retail banking at Banesto, a Santander unit, in 2002. Ms. Botin's work at Banesto has burnished her credentials as the likely successor to her father. Since her arrival four years ago, the once-troubled bank has cut costs, regained market share, reduced nonperforming loans and boosted profits. -- Keith Johnson 14. Maureen Chiquet Global Chief Executive-Designate CHANEL CASUAL JEANS and tweed Chanel jackets are a regular look for Maureen Chiquet, who on Jan. 1 will step into the newly created position of global chief executive of Chanel. Striking a similar balance of traditional and modern at Chanel itself will be her challenge. Privately owned Chanel has had to battle in recent years to stay competitive with the biggest names in high-end fashion. While Louis Vuitton, Prada and Gucci, for example, have surged internationally, Chanel's decentralized structure has resulted in less-focused efforts. In some countries, it markets its perfume more heavily than its fashion, which some industry insiders say weakens a high-end image. In her new job, the 43-year-old Ms. Chiquet will be in a position to better coordinate Chanel's global efforts, which until recently were led by a board comprising five regional managers, including Ms. Chiquet, who has run the U.S. business for the past two years, and three product chiefs. The board now will be overseen by Ms. Chiquet, who in turn will report directly to Chanel Chairman Alain Wertheimer. Ms. Chiquet has shown she can make disparate parts of the business work more closely together. As head of U.S. operations, she combined the fashion and beauty public-relations teams. Her approach to merchandising may help persuade store managers around the world to stock a more complete range of the French fashion house's products. Her professional background is more jeans than tweed. She worked at Gap Inc. for 15 years, helping make Old Navy a destination for inexpensive casual basics, then becoming president at Banana Republic. A self-professed Francophile, the Yale alumna studied in France and returned after graduation to work for L'Oreal. More recently, she spent a year with Chanel in Paris learning about the company before returning to New York to head U.S. operations. -- Christina Passariello 15. Marjorie Scardino Chief Executive PEARSON A LOT OF PEOPLE weren't convinced when Marjorie Scardino decided early in her tenure that Pearson PLC should become the world's largest textbook publisher and testing company. This year, the company's higher-education business grew faster than the industry overall for the sixth year in a row. Born in Arizona and raised in Texas, Mrs. Scardino began her career in journalism and spent time as a newspaper and magazine publisher. With her husband, she launched Savannah's Georgia Gazette in 1978. It folded in 1985, despite having won a Pulitzer Prize. After that she became the North American head of operations for the Economist, just as the British magazine was trying to expand its U.S. readership. Under her watch, U.S. circulation increased strongly, propelling her into the job of chief executive of Economist Group in London in 1992. When Mrs. Scardino was named CEO of Pearson in 1997, the former journalist became the first woman to head a top-100 U.K. company. At the time, Pearson was a conglomerate of ill-fitting businesses, including part of the Lazard investment bank and Madame Tussauds wax museums. Wanting to concentrate on publishing and education, Mrs. Scardino sold some assets, and acquired Simon & Schuster's educational business in 1998 for $4.6 billion. Two years later, she spent $2.5 billion to purchase the Minnesota-based testing company National Computer Systems. The investments weren't the immediate successes Pearson had hoped for, though. And there were other problems. Among them: The company's Financial Times newspaper had lost money for several years, and shareholders called for it to be sold. Two years ago, some articles in the British press wondered if Mrs. Scardino was going to lose her job. Today, the 59-year-old is in a much stronger position. The Financial Times is profitable. And Pearson's investment in textbooks and testing is bearing fruit. Pearson now leads its competitors in the sale of textbooks to U.S. education authorities. Its Penguin book division also recently pulled off a coup, buying the autobiography of former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. -- Aaron O. Patrick 16. Ursula M. Burns President, Business Group Operations XEROX AS THE NO. 2 executive at Xerox Corp., Ursula M. Burns has responsibility for all of the copier giant's production, distribution, supply chain and product development. In fact, she runs all operating groups except for professional services and the sales force. This year, Ms. Burns -- who started her Xerox career as an engineer in research in 1980 before earning a master's degree in mechanical engineering at Columbia University -- was handed responsibility for Xerox's famed research lab as well. The 48-year-old says that with the latest addition to her portfolio, it feels like coming \"full circle.\" But Ms. Burns aims to make sure the lab's vaunted research skills are applied to profitable products, rather than being a place that invents products that others go on to develop and profit from -- like the Xerox-invented computer mouse in the 1980s. Ms. Burns says she began to see how executives worked when she was tapped as a special assistant by former chief executive Paul Allaire. In 2001, with Xerox edging toward a possible bankruptcy filing, she was given the task of convincing the unions that the company's only chance of survival was cutting costs by outsourcing manufacturing. Ms. Burns, who has a reputation for directness, says she wouldn't let negotiations drift away from the choices of slashing wages or laying off workers. \"We knew raising prices wasn't an option,\" she says. Still, \"the separation of a lot of employees,\" Ms. Burns says, was \"the toughest personal thing\" she has done at Xerox. She lives in Rochester, N.Y., Xerox's headquarters city, where many manufacturing workers live. Ms. Burns, who grew up in public housing in New York City, says that Xerox has an unusually diverse upper-management team because it has been recruiting broadly for at least 25 years. -- William M. Bulkeley 17. Linda Chatman Thomsen Director of Enforcement SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION IN HER FIRST YEAR as chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement division, Linda Chatman Thomsen has had her mettle seriously tested. Known for maintaining an optimistic outlook while refusing to compromise her values in investigations, Ms. Thomsen has had to adjust to a new SEC chairman. She faced criticism from Congress on the effectiveness of the SEC's insider-trading program. And she had to deal with a Government Accountability Office probe of the division's policies and practices, which grew out of a complaint from an ex-employee. If that weren't enough, the 52-year-old former federal prosecutor found herself in the public spotlight after her staff sent subpoenas to journalists while investigating possible market manipulation. SEC Chairman Christopher Cox, Ms. Thomsen's boss, issued a statement that was widely seen as a public rebuke of the division. Ms. Thomsen took responsibility for the subpoenas, evoking the support of her staff. Ms. Thomsen has split her time in private practice and in the public sector, first as a federal prosecutor before she joined the SEC in 1995. There, she was selected to handle complex cases, including Enron. In May 2005, she became the first woman to lead the division. In the coming year, her challenge will be to manage the burgeoning stock-options backdating scandal and decide which executives to formally charge. Ms. Thomsen says focusing on frauds aimed at the elderly and individual investors will be a priority in the coming year, because \"when something goes wrong, the impact is magnified.\" She also vows to keep a vigilant eye on hedge funds, which now manage more than $1 trillion in assets. \"We still have to cover the waterfront,\" she says. \"If we learned nothing from Enron, we've learned that. We've got to be everywhere.\" -- Kara Scannell 18. Susan Whiting Chief Executive NIELSEN MEDIA RESEARCH FOR MOST of the 1990s, VNU NV's Nielsen Media Research coasted along as its methods for measuring TV viewing grew increasingly outdated. Then Susan Whiting took over. Named CEO in 2002, Ms. Whiting immediately charted an aggressive modernization to meet the demands of some unhappy clients and prepare the company for the coming onslaught of digital video. Among other steps, she spent $200 million developing and rolling out new set-top meters in key markets to do a better job collecting data on local-station performance. \"The media business moves extremely quickly,\" Ms. Whiting says. \"To ensure our future, we have to change even faster.\" Advertisers placed some $58 billion in TV advertising based on Nielsen statistics in 2005. Forcing Nielsen's gears to grind in a different direction wasn't easy. Ms. Whiting, 50 years old, faced internal resistance from managers, and she had to fight a bruising public-relations war with News Corp., which questioned parts of the new data as flawed. (She stood firm, and News Corp. eventually quieted down.) Earlier this year, Ms. Whiting announced an even more radical shake-up. She plans to eradicate by 2011 Nielsen's famous system of relying on viewers to keep diaries to record the shows they watch -- replacing it with heavier use of electronic set-top meters. She also plans to measure viewing on the Internet and to introduce new equipment to measure viewing in bars, hotels and offices. Ms. Whiting says Nielsen's clients set her agenda. \"They said `Follow the video,' and that's what we're doing.\" -- Brooks Barnes 19. Mary Ma Senior Vice President And Chief Financial Officer LENOVO GROUP AFTER HELPING to guide Lenovo Group's landmark acquisition last year of International Business Machines Corp.'s PC unit, Mary Ma is now helping the company try to make the deal a success. The acquisition made the Chinese company the world's third-largest PC-maker -- and a flag-bearer for the group of ambitious Chinese companies looking to become global players. It wasn't a simple marriage, however. In the wake of the deal, the combined company actually lost market share. But analysts say Lenovo appears to have reached a turning point, recently posting above-average revenue and unit-sales gains. Ms. Ma is expected to remain a major force at Lenovo as the company plans for listing on the New York Stock Exchange in a few years. As CFO, Ms. Ma is credited with setting up a system of revenue collecting and monitoring that has allowed Lenovo to sell its goods effectively across China -- no small achievement in a market where even big brands tend to be regional rather than national. Ms. Ma, 53, graduated with an arts degree from Beijing's Capital Normal University. She later studied at King's College of the University of London. She went on to work at the government-run Chinese Academy of Sciences. She also worked as a translator for VIPs such as then Communist Party leader Deng Xiaoping. During one of her translation jobs, she met Lenovo co-founder Liu Chuanzhi. Ms. Ma says she was so impressed by his vision that she later applied for a job at the company. She started off as an office assistant. -- Mei Fong 20. Mary Schapiro Chairman and Chief Executive NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SECURITIES DEALERS SHE MADE her career as a tough cop on Wall Street. But in September, Mary Schapiro took over as chairman and chief executive of the National Association of Securities Dealers, just as the enforcement winds were changing. After years of pressure for heftier fines, investor disputes in arbitration at the NASD have been declining, along with Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement actions. Defendants are winning some securities cases. Companies concerned about the tough rules implemented in recent years are starting to bypass U.S. markets. The new post, and climate, give Ms. Schapiro a chance to make critical investor-protection decisions 10 years after she arrived at the industry-funded regulator of brokers and exchanges. Among her priorities: handling surveillance more efficiently and using technology to identify areas where investors may be at most risk of getting harmed. \"The pace of new regulation is ebbing,\" says Ms. Schapiro, who is 51 years old. The Washington-based NASD is looking over past rules to make sure they're working, and in September clarified that penalties should take into account a firm's size. The NASD, which sets and enforces rules for 5,200 brokerage firms, also has been discussing a merger of some brokerage-firm regulatory operations with the New York Stock Exchange. In coming years, Ms. Schapiro plans to use NASD's $600 million annual budget in large part to protect and educate the growing number of retirees investing. NASD is also focusing on investment-like insurance products, low-priced \"penny\" stocks and energy scams. A former Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman and SEC commissioner, Ms. Schapiro says she decided to get into regulation as a law student when she saw silver prices surging amid alleged manipulation. In her first few months in her new job, to increase transparency, Ms. Schapiro has given more than half a dozen speeches. \"I kind of overdid it,\" she says. -- Aaron Lucchetti 21. Silvia Lagnado Vice President for Savory, Chilled And Frozen Foods UNILEVER CONSUMER-GOODS giant Unilever is hoping Silvia Lagnado, the woman behind Dove's successful Real Beauty ad campaign, can work the same magic on its troubled food business. With 2005 sales of 2.3 billion euros ($2.9 billion), Dove -- which has grown from a simple bar soap into everything from firming lotions to facial cleansing wipes -- is the model of what Chief Executive Patrick Cescau would like to see elsewhere at Unilever. When Ms. Lagnado, 43 years old, took over as global brand director for Dove in 2001, she found that local Unilever country managers were taking the brand in different directions, with no fewer than 77 different projects world-wide. So she took a page from rival Procter & Gamble Co. and formed a seven-person board that slashed the projects to just a handful of the strongest ideas that could work across whole regions. She soon extended Dove into shampoos, lotions and tanning creams. She then created a single advertising theme that would speak to women around the world. The result: The Real Beauty ad series that shows women of different backgrounds proudly flaunting their beauty flaws -- be it gray hair, flabby thighs or unsightly scars. Now, Ms. Lagnado is heading up a large part of Unilever's food business, including billion-dollar brands such as Knorr soup and Bertolli tomato sauces and pasta. The move is part of Mr. Cescau's shake-up of Unilever's top ranks. Over the past year, he has replaced scores of executives and created a group of four vice presidents -- Ms. Lagnado among them -- who have more power over global innovations and ad campaigns. Ms. Lagnado has her work cut out for her. Since Unilever acquired Bestfoods in 2000, the company has struggled to make its food business grow. Under pressure to prove his new strategy will work, Mr. Cescau is counting on Ms. Lagnado to start closing the gap with faster-growing rivals like Nestle and Groupe Danone. -- Deborah Ball 22. Deb Henretta President, ASEAN, Australasia and India Markets PROCTER & GAMBLE AS THE FIRST woman and mother to lead Procter & Gamble Co.'s baby-care operation, Deb Henretta transformed the then-sleepy Pampers business. She turned it into a powerful lifestyle brand and made it P&G's most successful line, with annual sales reaching $7 billion. In September of last year, she took on an even bigger challenge -- overseeing the company's crucial Southeast Asia, Australia and India markets, which represent the largest block of consumers in the world. P&G's current CEO, A.G. Lafley, also held senior posts in Asia, leading some to believe 45-year-old Ms. Henretta has the potential to take the reins of the consumer-products giant one day. Ms. Henretta will face intense scrutiny as she tries to maintain P&G's fast growth rate in the region while integrating the company's $57 billion acquisition of Gillette. She must also push a big company objective: catering to lower-income consumers, particularly in India and Indonesia. A summa cum laude graduate of St. Bonaventure University, Ms. Henretta has been with P&G for 21 years. She also sits on the board of Sprint. Ms. Henretta joins a handful of other rising female stars at P&G, including vice chairman Susan Arnold, the most senior woman at the company and leader of the beauty business, its primary strategic focus. Melanie Healey, who last year became the first woman to lead P&G's feminine-care division, drew notice after leading a dramatic turnaround of that business in North America over the past three years. -- Ellen Byron 23. Ellen Kullman Executive Vice President DUPONT LAST SUMMER, when Ellen Kullman was elevated to the helm of the two most important divisions to DuPont Co.'s bottom line, some analysts put her on the short list of possible in-house successors to company Chairman and CEO Charles O. Holliday Jr. Ms. Kullman, 50 years old, already headed the Wilmington, Del., company's safety and protection division; with the promotion, Mr. Holliday added DuPont's coatings and color technologies division to her portfolio. Together, the two divisions accounted for 63% of DuPont's pretax operating income for the third quarter of 2006. Mr. Holliday, 58 years old, hasn't announced any plans to step down. But Ms. Kullman's elevation comes amid an enormous transformation at DuPont, which Mr. Holliday is attempting to steer toward more reliance on biologically produced and fewer oil-based products. Ms. Kullman says her approach has been to stay focused on DuPont's markets, \"bringing more functionality to the product, and marrying it up with our science.\" The chemical industry as a whole has been under pressure in recent years as its feedstock costs rise, but customers resist product price increases. And analysts expect Ms. Kullman's safety and protection division to be key to DuPont's profits into the next decade. -- Steve LeVine 24. Debra L. Lee Chairman and Chief Executive BLACK ENTERTAINMENT TELEVISION THE NATION'S capital wasn't wired for cable television when Debra L. Lee joined Washington-based Black Entertainment Television as its general counsel in 1986, and few people living in the city had ever heard of the network. But Ms. Lee had been impressed by the network's charismatic founder, Robert Johnson, and leapt at the chance to work in the media field. She quickly established herself as one of the company's key executives and played a central role in its initial public offering in 1991. \"As general counsel,\" she says, \"I was able to cross departmental lines, and I saw a lot of the deals.\" A graduate of Harvard University, Ms. Lee was promoted to chief operating officer in 1995. She was named CEO last year, but didn't take full control until Mr. Johnson retired this year. In its early days, BET reached about 10 million subscribers, and its programming was focused on music videos and talk shows. Today, the network, which sees its target audience as 18- to 34-year-olds, is increasingly producing its own shows. Viacom Inc. acquired the network in 2001. So far, though, it has resisted the temptation to fold BET -- which now has about 83 million subscribers -- into MTV Networks. The 52-year-old Ms. Lee says it's important that BET remain apart from Viacom's other operations in order to retain its \"unique voice.\" Her vision for BET is to build its presence both internationally and on other platforms, including the Internet and mobile phones. -- Matthew Karnitschnig 25. Mary Sammons Chief Executive RITE AID WHEN MARY Sammons joined Rite Aid Corp. in 1999, as its president and chief operating officer, she arrived with a familiar team of colleagues from Fred Meyer Inc., where she had spent 26 years and served as chief executive of the company's food and drug chain, Fred Meyer Stores. But she was entering uncharted territory. \"I knew there were issues, but I didn't really know the full extent of them,\" Ms. Sammons says. She could tell that certain merchandise was out of stock and morale was low. Chief Executive Martin L. Grass had recently been fired. (He later went to prison for accounting fraud.) What Ms. Sammons couldn't see were cash-flow and accounting problems that were even worse than she expected. Entrusted with turning around operations, Ms. Sammons won the support of suppliers, some of which had stopped shipping merchandise. She visited store employees and established a statement of values for the company. Ms. Sammons was promoted to chief executive in 2003. But as Rite Aid cleaned up its house, rivals Walgreen Co. and CVS Corp. were opening stores rapidly. With Rite Aid well behind in the No. 3 position, Ms. Sammons thought her company needed to leap forward. In August, Rite Aid announced it would acquire the Brooks and Eckerd drugstore chains from Jean Coutu Group (PJC) Inc., for about $3.4 billion. The deal adds 1,800 stores to Rite Aid's 3,300 locations. Integrating the chains will be an enormous task, but the 60-year-old Ms. Sammons says converting the stores to a common set of systems -- and avoiding what she calls a \"Big Bang approach\" of changing too much at once -- will improve the odds of success. -- Amy Merrick 26. Laura Desmond Chief Executive STARCOM MEDIAVEST THE AMERICAS IN OCTOBER, Laura Desmond was named chief executive of media-buying titan Starcom MediaVest the Americas, making her a key player on Madison Avenue as the industry grapples with a rapidly evolving digital world. Starcom, a unit of Paris-based Publicis Groupe, buys about $18 billion a year in media time for big-spending marketers such as Procter & Gamble and General Motors. Aside from negotiating prices for ad placement, the firm must figure out which media are best for marketers to use. That task gets harder by the day as digital advances multiply the ways marketers can reach consumers. Choices today include search engines, email marketing, social-networking sites such as MySpace.com and Second Life, and video sites such as YouTube.com. Not to mention the traditional media: television, newspapers and magazines. So what keeps Ms. Desmond up at night? \"Reinventing our business for the digital world and having a dominant share of talent to do it,\" she says. Wooing that talent isn't easy. The soaring demand for online marketing has created a shortage of ad talent with digital-media experience. Ms. Desmond assembled a 50-person digital team at MediaVest, the unit she previously headed. Now, she is trying to immerse all 2,500 Starcom MediaVest employees in the digital universe. As part of the process, the firm has installed a state-of-the-art media lab that houses the latest digital gadgets. Ms. Desmond was born in Iowa and graduated from the University of Iowa. She first joined the agency, which was then part of Leo Burnett, in 1987 as a media associate. During her time leading MediaVest, she helped revitalize the firm by winning a slew of new accounts such as Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and MasterFoods. The 41-year-old Ms. Desmond is determined to keep her finger on the pulse of her firm. To that end, she has started a \"Dinner With the CEO\" ritual, and recently took a 25-year-old supervisor out to dinner at the Palm, a famous New York steakhouse. -- Suzanne Vranica 27. Jane Friedman President and Chief Executive HARPERCOLLINS PUBLISHERS WORLDWIDE LEMONY SNICKET'S series about unlucky orphans and John Grogan's \"Marley & Me\" have been big hits at the publishing empire led by Jane Friedman, president and CEO of HarperCollins Publishers Worldwide, a unit of News Corp. But these are uncertain times for book publishers: While star authors and big publicity campaigns are still capable of producing home runs, overall book sales in the U.S. are sluggish. Looking for new growth, Ms. Friedman has turned to China and India. The company has a deal with People's Literature Publishing House that includes the publication of certain Chinese works in the U.S. and the recent launch of Cidian.cn, an online English-Chinese dictionary aimed at some 350 million Chinese learning English. In India, meanwhile, the company plans to focus on publishing international best sellers in local languages. Ms. Friedman's blueprint for the future also includes a costly plan to digitize all of her company's books. \"The digital age complements traditional publishing,\" says the 61-year-old Ms. Friedman. HarperCollins is the first publisher to adopt a search-inside-the-book function for some titles on its Web site -- a feature that could prove useful if the site ever sells books directly to consumers. More than three decades after starting out in publishing as a Dictaphone typist in the foreign-rights department of Alfred A. Knopf, Ms. Friedman joined HarperCollins in 1997, a time when the publisher was floundering. Four years later, she signed up Michael Crichton, a former Knopf writer. On Nov. 28, HarperCollins will publish two million copies of Mr. Crichton's 15th novel, \"Next,\" which takes a look at the dark side of genetics. Any worries that digital technology will one day wreak havoc on the book business? \"None,\" Ms. Friedman says. \"As a marketer, I think it's a perfect tool.\" -- Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg 28. Christina Gold Chief Executive WESTERN UNION AS CEO of the newly public Western Union Co., Christina Gold not only must oversee a global money-transfer network. She also must deal with her company's new and unwelcome status as a lightning rod in the debate over illegal immigration. Ms. Gold, who was born in the Netherlands and raised in Montreal, spent the bulk of her career at Avon Products Inc. before joining Western Union as president in 2002. She became CEO in September, when Western Union's spinoff from First Data Corp. was completed. Last month, Western Union said third-quarter profit grew 7% to $258 million from $242 million a year ago. Ms. Gold, 59 years old, says Western Union is well positioned to continue capitalizing on global migration and the accompanying demand for cross-border money transfers. In particular, she sees India and China, where Western Union has a combined 60,000 outlets, as long-term growth markets. \"There is a lot of competition, but we feel strongly about the extensiveness of our network and our ethnic marketing skills,\" she says. Western Union's transfers from the U.S. to Mexico have drawn scrutiny in Arizona, which wants to block electronic payments to traffickers in illegal aliens. In September, the state obtained warrants to seize certain Western Union transfers of at least $500 going to the Mexican state of Sonora, just south of the Arizona border. A judge allowed a stay of the warrants while Arizona and Western Union try to work out a settlement. \"It's a challenge for us, and for the state of Arizona,\" Ms. Gold says. \"I think we'll resolve it.\" -- Ann Carrns 29. Charlene Begley Chief Executive and President of GE Plastics GENERAL ELECTRIC A SENIOR VICE president at General Electric Co., Charlene Begley faces the major challenge of leading the conglomerate's struggling plastics business. Hired into GE's famed financial-management program in 1988, Ms. Begley, a graduate of the University of Vermont, served as chief financial officer of GE's rail business and headed up finance for the plastics unit in Europe before serving as vice president of GE's corporate audit staff. She took her first major operating post in 2001 as head of GE's factory-automation division before moving to run the rail business. There, Ms. Begley secured large locomotive contracts with railroads in China and Kazakhstan. In 1998, she became GE's youngest corporate officer at the age of 32. These days, the 40-year-old runs the $6.6 billion plastics business, which makes plastic sheets and other plastic products used in everything from automobiles and airplanes to computers and cellphones. Ms. Begley was named to the job in the summer of 2005 just as the price of oil and other raw materials skyrocketed. Competition in the plastics business is steep, and Ms. Begley is struggling to find ways to raise prices without losing sales. Through this year's first nine months, revenue rose 1% to $5 billion, but operating profit fell 13% to $560 million. She's trying to move the unit away from commodity-type products, such as plastic used in CDs, into more specialized products for aviation and health care. The plastics division has been under review, and parts of it could eventually be sold, company officials acknowledge. -- Kathryn Kranhold 30. Wei Christianson China Chief Executive MORGAN STANLEY CHINA DEAL maker Wei Christianson has proved her loyalty to Morgan Stanley's chief executive officer, John Mack. Now she has to prove her mettle to the Wall Street firm. The Beijing native followed Mr. Mack from Morgan Stanley to Credit Suisse in 2002 and left days after Mr. Mack was pushed out of the Swiss bank in 2004. She rejoined her mentor at Morgan Stanley earlier this year, leaving Citigroup, where she had been head of investment banking in China. Her move back to Morgan Stanley spurred the departure of several longtime China bankers at the company who weren't happy with her return. Still, Ms. Christianson -- who has impressed fans and detractors alike with her toughness and tenacity in getting deals done -- has been undeterred in her mission to build a long-term presence for Morgan Stanley in the world's fourth-largest economy across all the firm's products and services. It's a task she describes as \"very challenging.\" One hurdle Ms. Christianson faces: finding a way to access the domestic equities market. Although Morgan Stanley owns a 34% stake in domestic investment bank China International Capital Corp., it cannot underwrite or trade domestic stocks on its own. As the government pushes to develop local markets, Morgan Stanley, like other Wall Street firms, is pushing for greater access. The firm recently bought a bank license that will permit it to sell fixed-income and derivative products. Ms. Christianson likes to break through barriers. In 1983, she was the first student from China to graduate from Amherst College, which then awarded her a full scholarship to attend Columbia University's law school. After working for a law firm for two years in New York, she moved to Hong Kong to work for the city's securities watchdog. From there, she moved into banking. -- Kate Linebaugh 31. Amy Woods Brinkley Global Risk Executive BANK OF AMERICA BANKING GIANT Bank of America Corp. named Amy Wood Brinkley its global risk executive at a pivotal time -- in the months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks left financial networks shaken and as accounting scandals at Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc. shattered confidence in corporate-governance practices. And Bank of America suffered its own scandal early in her tenure when its asset-management fund was accused of allowing special trading privileges to a wealthy investor. Ms. Brinkley says that mutual-fund debacle shows how renegade employees, left unchecked, can damage the entire operations and reputation of a company. \"Issues will occur,\" she says. \"What's really important is how the company responds.\" Bank of America now evaluates its 200,000 employees on whether they take the appropriate level of risk and how specifically they go about it, based on a tightened code of ethics she helped write. Ms. Brinkley, 50 years old, oversees risk to Bank of America's $1.5 trillion in assets, from managing interest-rate bets to deciding how to guard against a natural disaster or terrorist attack. She also oversees the legal division and the implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley corporate-governance requirements. Bank of America has doubled in market value in the past five years. So not only have the company and its exposure to risk grown, she says, but the pace of change has accelerated rapidly with technology and the globalization of markets. Ms. Brinkley began her career as a management trainee in 1978 at then North Carolina National Bank, the Charlotte, N.C., predecessor of what is now Bank of America. She has previously overseen the marketing division and consumer products such as credit cards and mortgages, in keeping with the bank's desire to cross-train its executives. Ms. Brinkley says her goal has been to change employees' perception of risk management from a dull but mandatory requirement to a competitive advantage. -- Valerie Bauerlein 32. Ann Livermore Executive Vice President HEWLETT-PACKARD IN 1999, Hewlett-Packard Co.'s board selected Carly Fiorina over H-P insider Ann Livermore to be chief executive of the giant printer and computer maker. But while Ms. Fiorina was ousted from the Palo Alto, Calif., company in 2005, Ms. Livermore is still going strong at H-P. Today, the 48-year-old runs H-P's technology solutions group, which, with $33 billion in annual revenue, is the company's largest business unit. The group, which encompasses servers, software, storage and services, is arguably the most crucial -- and the most challenged -- within H-P, as the information-technology needs of customers world-wide become increasingly complicated, even as the customers' budgets increase very little. Ms. Livermore has led her group to bigger profits in the face of a mature server market. The group increased its revenue 3% to $8.3 billion in H-P's fiscal third quarter ended July 31, but some areas are troubled. Services, which account for nearly half of the group's revenue, increased sales only 1% in the July 31 quarter. H-P's services chief, Steve Smith, subsequently resigned for personal reasons. A Greensboro, N.C., native, Ms. Livermore attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on scholarship. She later earned an M.B.A. at Stanford University while running a snack bar on campus. Her colleagues describe her as contemplative and level-headed. People who work with her say that during the group's monthly meetings, she mostly listens to how business is going before setting the agenda for the next month. Still, she can be curt if her staff doesn't meet her expectations, says Scott Stallard, head of enterprise storage and servers at H-P, who reports to Ms. Livermore. \"That's when you know you're busted,\" he says. -- Christopher Lawton 33. Vivienne Cox Executive Vice President, Gas, Power and Trading BP IT'S BEEN a tough year for BP PLC as well as for Vivienne Cox, its most senior woman executive. As head of the company's wildly profitable trading operations, she's been thrown into the spotlight over a spate of compliance woes in the U.S. Federal authorities allege that BP traders manipulated propane markets in 2004, and investigators are probing trading in other energy markets. BP denies the manipulation charges and says it is cooperating with all investigations. Ms. Cox, 47, hasn't been implicated in any of the alleged schemes, but it falls to the Oxford University graduate to navigate the various investigations and clean up the mess. Ms. Cox keeps a low profile. She has declined several requests for interviews by this newspaper over the past three years. BP says she wasn't available to comment for this story. If she survives the regulatory scrutiny, Ms. Cox could emerge as a strong candidate to succeed BP Chief Executive John Browne, who will step down in two years. Though she's part of Lord Browne's small circle of lieutenants, she remains a dark horse for the top job. In addition to heading up trading, Ms. Cox is CEO of BP's gas, power and renewable-energy business. Last year, the company unveiled a 10-year, $8 billion investment plan for alternative energy and put Ms. Cox in charge. -- Chip Cummins 34. Mary Minnick Executive Vice President/President of Marketing, Strategy and Innovation COCA-COLA AT COCA-COLA Co., Mary Minnick has survived years of management turmoil and last year rose to one of the company's most powerful jobs: directing global marketing, innovation and strategy. Ms. Minnick, 46, started out at Coke 23 years ago in U.S. sales and at one time led its Asia division. She recently helped craft the company's new ad campaign, \"The Coke Side of Life,\" which harkens back to the imagery and optimistic feel of classic campaigns such as \"It's the Real Thing.\" But she says mainstream TV advertising has become diluted with the proliferation of other outlets. So she favors such measures as sponsoring poker tournaments on late-night cable to reach energy-drink fans and experimenting with online rewards programs for young consumers. Meanwhile, Ms. Minnick is continuing her decade-long drive to expand Coke's portfolio of bottled coffees, teas and other noncarbonated drinks -- an area where Coke has fallen particularly far behind PepsiCo Inc. and smaller rivals. The October launch of the Enviga green-tea-based drink showcased her desire to market to women, particularly those intrigued by a product touted as a calorie burner. She talks often about the 17 \"need states\" or motivations for drinking beverages, from thirst and comfort to nutrition and taste. She argues that Coke can tap needed veins of growth if it delves more deeply into \"the underlying psychology of beverages.\" Coke has struggled to stay nimble and growing, especially in the decade since the death of legendary Chief Executive Roberto Goizueta. Ms. Minnick spent much of that time leading Coke's pivotal Japan business and eventually its entire Asia division, where she says she learned to bring dozens of new teas and vitamin drinks to market and quickly home in on the ones that consumers were buying. Still, Ms. Minnick, who relishes a reputation for being blunt, says the company's polite Atlanta traditions can inhibit confrontation and change. She apologized to investors last year for being \"uncharacteristically tactful\" in describing the company's blunders in the marketing of ready-to-drink coffee. She followed up by saying Coke hadn't recognized that consumers buy coffee in single-serve packages as a treat, not at the end of a supermarket aisle. It was a mistake she said would not be made twice. -- Valerie Bauerlein 35. Christine Poon Vice Chairman JOHNSON & JOHNSON REMAKING Johnson & Johnson is keeping Christine Poon busy. With responsibility for J&J's over-the-counter and prescription drug businesses, Ms. Poon, 54 years old, manages such household names as Tylenol, as well as cutting-edge medicines to treat cancer and schizophrenia. By the end of the year, Ms. Poon expects J&J to close its $16.6 billion deal for Pfizer Inc.'s consumer-health business, including such iconic brands as Listerine mouthwash and Visine eyedrops. The addition will make J&J the largest seller of over-the-counter medicines in the world, she says, and will help the company capitalize on a world-wide \"trend toward self-medication and consumers being more involved in their own health.\" In the past year, Ms. Poon -- who joined J&J in 2000 as head of pharmaceuticals after a 15-year run at Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. -- has orchestrated the realignment of the company's sprawling pharmaceuticals division into three self-contained businesses: biotech drugs, antiviral medicines, and treatments for conditions ranging from mental illness to pain. The move is another example of J&J's bias toward decentralization and should better align research and marketing, she says. J&J, like most rivals, has struggled to find new medicines. Over the past decade, most new drugs have come \"from the pipelines of the companies we've bought or partnered with,\" Ms. Poon says. She aims to keep up licensing and acquisition but also looks to boost contributions from the company's own labs. -- Scott Hensley 36. Susan Desmond-Hellmann Chief of Product Development GENENTECH BIOTECHNOLOGY PIONEER Genentech Inc. has been on a tear for several years, having won marketing approval to use new and existing drugs in a variety of new ways. Managing the company's hectic growth is a task that falls to Susan Desmond-Hellmann, chief of product development and the second-highest-ranking official at the company. So far this year, Genentech has received nearly a half-dozen new regulatory approvals from the Food and Drug Administration, and has two more pending at the agency. It has expanded use of its blockbuster cancer drug Avastin to lung cancer as well as colon cancer; reinvented an older cancer drug, Rituxan, as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis; and won approval for a new drug, Lucentis, for use against a form of vision loss known as macular degeneration. For Dr. Desmond-Hellmann, 49, oversight of compiling and submitting regulatory submissions is almost challenge enough. While many things have gone right, there have been some glitches. A few months ago, the FDA asked for a re-evaluation of data supporting the use of Avastin in breast cancer, a rare instance in which the agency has second-guessed the biotech giant. Dr. Desmond-Hellmann must also ensure that new drugs are entering Genentech's research pipeline at a pace that can guarantee future growth. That's no easy challenge, given that many of the most promising drug candidates are still at an early stage of development. -- David P. Hamilton 37. Cynthia Carroll Chief Executive-Designate ANGLO AMERICAN AS AN INCOMING freshman at Skidmore College, Cynthia Carroll took the advice of a campus tour guide and signed up for geology to fulfill the school's science requirement. \"I said, `OK, I'm just going to get it over with,' \" she recalls thinking. She ended up majoring in the subject, earning a master's, and going on to look for oil and natural gas as a petroleum geologist for Amoco Corp. in the Rocky Mountains. Now, Ms. Carroll, a 49-year-old American, is set to take over as chief executive of Anglo American PLC, one of the world's biggest mining companies. When she takes the job in March, she will also become the highest-profile woman executive in the male-dominated mining industry, and only the third woman at the top of a company listed in the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index. (Marjorie Scardino, CEO of publisher Pearson PLC, and Dorothy Thompson of Drax Group PLC, a power company, are the other two.) Ms. Carroll takes the reins amid a big restructuring at the London-based company. It's spinning off its paper business and selling down an equity stake in a big gold producer. Anglo is frequently mentioned as a potential takeover target, and Ms. Carroll will have to convince investors that the company can boost growth significantly on its own to fend off hostile suitors. Financial analysts greeted her appointment with skepticism: She hasn't led a company before. She's also thin on mining experience, having worked for most of her career at Canadian aluminum giant Alcan Inc. But Anglo Chairman Sir Mark Moody-Stuart says the board needed someone to steamroll through the company's restructuring. Ms. Carroll offered \"a clear track record in that kind of transformational change,\" Sir Mark says. -- Chip Cummins 38. Angela Ahrendts Chief Executive BURBERRY GROUP AS THE NEW CEO of fashion company Burberry Group PLC, Angela Ahrendts faces the task of sustaining Burberry's fashion appeal -- the U.K. company has changed in recent years from a dowdy raincoat maker into one of the world's hottest fashion brands -- while expanding its product mix and geographic reach. For the first half of the year, Ms. Ahrendts got to know Burberry from an office next to that of her predecessor, Rose Marie Bravo, and met with store managers and suppliers around the world. Within a week of taking the top job in July, Ms. Ahrendts -- clad in Burberry from her stiletto heels to her rectangular glasses -- announced she would continue Ms. Bravo's course of trying to sell more products through company-owned stores, rather than department stores. She also hopes to strengthen Burberry's business with accessories like handbags and shoes. One success so far is the best-selling Manor bag, which costs $1,680 and was flaunted by supermodel Kate Moss in a Burberry ad campaign. Ms. Ahrendts also wants to expand in the U.S., especially in areas such as the Midwest, which are often overlooked by European fashion labels. She once worked for designer Donna Karan and spent seven years at apparel giant Liz Claiborne. In her last job there, as executive vice president, she managed 22 women's and men's apparel brands accounting for about 40% of the company's total revenue. During her time at Liz Claiborne, the corporation grew to 41 brands from 10, and sales nearly doubled to $4.6 billion from $2.5 billion. Now 46 years old, Ms. Ahrendts moved to London with her husband and three kids. She was drawn to the Burberry job because of the brand's appeal to both young and older people, and its reach across several product categories, she says. A further lure, she says, was the label's positioning as \"affordable luxury,\" with prices slightly lower than those of brands such as Gucci or Louis Vuitton. But along with her ambitious agenda, Ms. Ahrendts faces a host of challenges. Among them: reconciling Burberry's upmarket flair, fueled by fashion shows in Milan, with the loss of exclusivity that comes with stores in Indiana and Oklahoma. And she must preserve the brand's heritage, especially its trademark plaid pattern, while establishing new brand symbols in consumers' minds. -- Cecilie Rohwedder 39. Jerri DeVard Senior Vice President, Marketing and Brand Management VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS THROUGHOUT HER career, Jerri DeVard, a senior vice president of brand management and marketing communications at Verizon Communications Inc., has always focused on reaching customers. \"I was always in marketing,\" she says, \"creating demand for products and differentiating them from others.\" As a top telecom executive at Verizon, Ms. DeVard is in charge of making sure that Verizon is the provider of choice. She heads the national marketing and communications strategies for consumer and small-business segments as well as brand management, market research and online market strategy. Today, Ms. DeVard says she is reaching out to existing and prospective customers, giving them information on Verizon's broadband service via TV, radio and online advertisements as well as direct mail. She also is leading local marketing campaigns, such as Verizon's \"Richer. Deeper. Broader\" Campaign to help convert customers from dial-up to broadband services. Ms. DeVard, 48 years old, has a bachelor's degree in economics from Spelman College and an M.B.A. from Clark Atlanta University's business school. Before joining Verizon in 2003, she served as chief marketing officer at Citigroup Inc., where she was responsible for the company's e-Consumer line. Prior to that, she was vice president of marketing for color cosmetics at Revlon Inc., vice president of marketing for Harrah's Entertainment in New Orleans, and held several brand-management positions at Pillsbury Co. in Minneapolis. She also headed up the private suites marketing of the Minnesota Vikings. Ms. DeVard's reputation goes beyond her position at Verizon. She was named as one of Black Enterprise magazine's 75 most powerful African-Americans in corporate America in February 2005. -- Sarmad Ali 40. Patricia A. Curran Executive Vice President, Store Operations WAL-MART STORES FOR PAT CURRAN, it's always the tough jobs. This daughter of a military officer worked her way up from selling pets at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to senior executive at the world's largest retailer. Now the 42-year-old is managing a massive overhaul designed to make Wal-Mart stores easier to shop and relevant to a wider audience. Wal-Mart, of Bentonville, Ark., is facing rising energy and overhead costs, as well as slowing sales gains. The problems are hitting the whole company, but chiefly its $210 billion Wal-Mart Stores division. After starting the year with a healthy 4% increase in comparable-store sales, the division's November sales are forecast to be flat compared with a year earlier. As head of operations for the division, Ms. Curran has launched big changes designed to cut overhead and improve the appearance and service at more than 3,000 locations. Employee schedules have been changed, for instance, to ensure there are enough workers on hand at busy times. And stores are retooling their offerings based on customer demographics. Ms. Curran, who was raised in Germany and the U.S., got her start at Wal-Mart working in the pet department. Her career got a big boost when she righted a troubled Marlin, Texas, store after several other managers had flubbed the job. \"I just got into the business, and it grabbed hold of me,\" she says. Ms. Curran's current efforts have been met with resistance. The overhaul of store employees' schedules triggered a walkout at one Florida store and angered employees elsewhere. But Wal-Mart Chief Executive H. Lee Scott Jr. calls Ms. Curran \"absolutely the best person that we have for that position.\" -- Gary McWilliams 41. Mary Dillon Executive Vice President and Global Chief Marketing Officer MCDONALD'S AS THE TOP marketing executive for McDonald's Corp., Mary Dillon controls one of the most powerful advertising machines in the world. How she shapes McDonald's message next year will be critical for the company. Ms. Dillon will spend the year shifting more marketing spending toward digital media, including online ads and text messages, to capture tech-savvy customers as TV ads lose their effectiveness. She'll map McDonald's marketing for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. And she'll sharpen the company's focus on convincing mothers that McDonald's sells quality food. The 45-year-old Chicago native joined McDonald's last year after serving as president of PepsiCo Inc.'s Quaker Foods division. Since then she's tried to make McDonald's marketing more relevant to consumers. She created a Global Moms Panel, an advisory group made up of women who provide feedback on McDonald's-related issues, like nutrition, that are important to them. She also launched an online casting call to solicit customers to appear on McDonald's packaging. She says one of next year's greatest challenges will be quantifying McDonald's return on its investment in new digital marketing campaigns. Ms. Dillon says her own experiences as a mother of four and an athlete -- she competed in her first triathlon this year -- prompted her to promote McDonald's food quality to moms. \"For somebody who grew up in marketing,\" she says, \"it's a dream job.\" -- Anne-Marie Idrac President SNCF WHEN ANNE-MARIE Idrac, a onetime junior transportation minister, was tapped last July to take charge of the French national railway, SNCF, critics complained that what the railroad needed was a business executive, not a politician. Ms. Idrac's job is to transform an old state-owned monopoly, which employs 168,000 people and transports close to a billion passengers a year, into a market-driven company. She has to boost productivity and cut costs, and she doesn't have much time. The European Union Commission has ruled that in 2010, all EU passenger rail routes will be opened up to competition through auctions of rights to private-sector railway companies. SNCF posted a profit of about $480 million for 2005. To get ready for 2010, however, the new president is preparing to overhaul benefits long taken for granted by state employees. Particularly, the pension plan. Feisty railway unions have promised to put up a fight. But Ms. Idrac may be their match. She recently said the social climate at SNCF hasn't evolved since the fall of the Berlin Wall. She also comes straight from four years at the helm of the Parisian public-transportation system, where she was instrumental in obtaining a union guarantee of at least limited service during strikes. The 55-year-old Ms. Idrac, a graduate of France's elite Ecole Nationale D'Administration, also is said to have the firm, cool-minded temperament necessary to tackle any interventionist reflex from the French government. -- Marie Valla 43. Frida Giannini Creative Director GUCCI WHEN DESIGNER Frida Giannini became Gucci's creative director earlier this year, the job came with a clear challenge: The 34-year-old Ms. Giannini will play a major role in Gucci's drive to boost its annual sales to 3 billion euros ($3.8 billion) by 2011 from 1.8 billion euros last year. Ms. Giannini's aesthetic has invigorated sales of the Italian brand's accessories. But Gucci apparel sales are minuscule and its watch business is in tatters -- two divisions she needs to spark if Gucci is to meet the growth target set by Gucci Group Chief Executive Robert Polet. Ms. Giannini is the first designer to have creative control over the entire Gucci brand since the former creative chief Tom Ford quit in 2004. She started at Gucci in 2002 as a handbag designer, then was chosen by French retail group PPR SA, Gucci's owner, as part of the design triumvirate that replaced Mr. Ford. Ms. Giannini was named the brand's accessories chief, with others taking charge of menswear and women's apparel. When Gucci management saw what a hit her colorful Flora collection of handbags, shoes and scarves was, they put her in charge of women's apparel as well. She then took on men's clothing, and was named Gucci's creative director, when the menswear designer resigned in February. Ms. Giannini already has had some success in her expanded role. Sales of women's clothing have risen 26% since the beginning of this year. The next big challenge for her is Gucci's watch business, which struggles with low growth in a booming product segment. -- Christina Passariello 44. Akiko Ide Senior Vice President NTT DOCOMO IN JUNE, Akiko Ide became NTT DoCoMo Inc.'s first female board member after 29 years with the company. She is also the first woman to become a board member among Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp.'s five major business units. NTT is Japan's largest telephone company, and DoCoMo is its mobile unit. The 51-year-old Ms. Ide was handpicked early as a potential future executive, and became manager of DoCoMo's key branch in Tokyo in 2001. Former NTT President Koji Oboshi, who promoted her, says he recalls her skills in motivating her staff. He says she ranked No. 1 among DoCoMo managers on cost reduction, customer relations and other skills. Ms. Ide, who spent many years out of the spotlight, including running DoCoMo customer call centers, says her strength lies in making a steady effort without taking shortcuts. \"If you do a job for many years, the time would come when you feel you've grown substantially,\" says Ms. Ide. \"It's like Chinese herb medicine that works its way slowly.\" Because she had no female role models, she had to develop her own managing style. To support younger women at the company, she started a networking group for female employees. Ms. Ide, a mother of two, recently advised 200 women DoCoMo workers on how to balance career and family in Japan, where companies still demand long hours as a sign of commitment to the job. -- Miho Inada 45. Helene Gayle President and Chief Executive CARE IN A TRIO of firsts, Helene Gayle is the first woman, the first minority and the first physician to lead CARE, the 60-year-old humanitarian relief organization that made CARE packages a household word six decades ago. With 20 years of prior work at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and five years at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation focusing on AIDS, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases, Dr. Gayle aims to make CARE more results-oriented in its mission of providing disaster relief, health care, education, economic development, and water and sanitation assistance. Being CEO of CARE gives the 51-year-old Dr. Gayle a chance to mount a joint attack on disease and poverty. \"Poor health is both a cause and a consequence of poverty,\" she says. \"If you strengthen health, you can improve economies.\" And she doesn't shrink from controversy. In congressional testimony this fall, Dr. Gayle critiqued Washington's abstinence-centered AIDS grants as impeding life-saving programs. An able diplomat, she honed mediation skills while refereeing often-bitter battles between AIDS activists and scientists. Nor does she avoid turmoil. On recent rounds of CARE sites, she visited a mosque in Afghanistan to discuss hot issues like female literacy and the drug trade. A graduate of Barnard College, Dr. Gayle earned her medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania and a master's in public health from Johns Hopkins University. -- Marilyn Chase 46. Susan Lyne Chief Executive MARTHA STEWART LIVING OMNIMEDIA SOME SIZZLE is finally returning to Martha Stewart's media and merchandising empire. And investors have Susan Lyne to thank. When Ms. Lyne took over as CEO of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. in 2004, Ms. Stewart was serving a prison sentence after being convicted of lying in connection with a personal stock sale. The outlook appeared grim: With advertisers fleeing Ms. Stewart's magazines and her TV business in tatters, Wall Street thought Martha Stewart Living was toast. Ms. Lyne, formerly president of entertainment at Walt Disney Co.'s ABC, took a calm and steady approach to rebuilding the empire. But the 56-year-old keeps a low profile and is reluctant to take credit for accomplishments -- a style that has allowed her to flourish under Ms. Stewart, who remains the public face of the company. Ad revenue from magazines jumped 75% in the third quarter. \"Martha: The Martha Stewart Show,\" has been renewed for a third season. Ms. Lyne also signed merchandising deals with Kodak, Lowe's stores, and KB Home. She also has been quietly redesigning the company's Web site to allow users to post recipes, photos of craft projects and more -- a major push to do for the domestic-arts set what MySpace did for teens. \"With 90 million women online and deeply underserved in the lifestyle arena,\" she says, \"this company is extraordinarily well positioned.\" -- Brooks Barnes 47. Susan Decker Chief Financial Officer YAHOO LAST MONTH, Yahoo Inc. Chief Financial Officer Susan Decker told a story about \"true north\" to staff assembled before her and watching from offices around the world, say people familiar with the matter. Ms. Decker, 44, had just presented Yahoo's quarterly earnings, which included a nearly 40% drop in third-quarter profit from a year earlier. Ms. Decker, these people say, told employees that her father, when teaching her to sail as a girl, explained that \"true north\" is a constant direction to steer by, while \"magnetic north\" changes depending on where you are. Ms. Decker counseled Yahoo staff to stick to their true north, their unchanging core values, as the company found itself tested. The people familiar with the matter describe Ms. Decker's comments as a milestone in her role at the company, whose shares are down about 30% for the year amid slowing growth in some online ad sales and a delay in rolling out a new system for Internet advertisers. While the longtime financial analyst and Warren Buffett fan has always gone beyond the traditional finance functions of a CFO, her responsibilities for operations have expanded significantly in the past year. Her role in crafting strategy and rallying Yahoo staff has, at the least, become more visible. Through a spokeswoman, Ms. Decker declined to comment. Ms. Decker led Yahoo's talks with eBay Inc., in which Yahoo beat out Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp. for a pact to serve ads on eBay's auction site and marketplace in the U.S. this year. As part of a reorganization announced in September, she oversees a new unit that includes classifieds, dating, jobs, real estate, travel, autos, shopping and auctions. People inside and outside the company speculate that Ms. Decker, who joined Yahoo in 2000 and was named to Intel Corp.'s board last week, is being groomed as a potential successor to CEO Terry Semel upon his eventual retirement. -- Kevin J. Delaney 48. Anne Sweeney President DISNEY-ABC TELEVISION GROUP IT'S BEEN a busy year for Anne Sweeney, president of Walt Disney Co.'s Disney-ABC Television Group. Last fall, she shook up the TV business with the decision to sell episodes of TV shows on Apple's iTunes store. Later, she led the field by streaming shows on ABC's Web site. And in recent weeks, new seasons of hits like \"Grey's Anatomy\" and newcomers including \"Ugly Betty\" have powered the once-troubled network to the top of the ratings. A onetime ABC page, Ms. Sweeney was elevated just over two years ago to the role of co-chairman of Disney's TV business, including oversight of ABC, the Disney Channel and the Touchstone TV studio. The television group is Disney's biggest division, with almost $15 billion of revenue in fiscal 2006. Ms. Sweeney, 49, says she has focused on \"creating an environment that's all about risk-taking where mistakes are valued and criticism is constructive.\" She says her goals remain creating programming \"that people are dying to see\"; aggressively exploiting new technologies and platforms; expanding internationally; and building franchises that touch all parts of Disney, like the Disney Channel's \"High School Musical.\" -- Merissa Marr 49. Liz Vanzura Global Marketing Director CADILLAC IT DIDN'T TAKE long for Liz Vanzura to shake things up at Cadillac. Shortly after arriving as global marketing director of the General Motors Corp. division in January, she saw flaws in the approach of Cadillac's longtime ad agency, the Leo Burnett unit of Publicis Groupe SA. Her solution: give Cadillac's account to Boston-based Modernista, which had created ads for GM's Hummer brand. The 42-year-old Ms. Vanzura had been the head of Hummer's advertising for five years before joining Cadillac. The result is a new Cadillac campaign that aims to move the brand beyond its bling image with the theme, \"Life. Liberty. And the Pursuit.\" Her decision to switch agencies came as a surprise to many in the industry, but to those who have followed Ms. Vanzura's career, it was a typical move. At Hummer, she made the behemoth SUV a vehicle that women could love and made the H3 model a hit with an ad depicting a monster falling in love with the smallest Hummer. And at Volkswagen in the 1990s, she launched the new Beetle with memorable ads featuring indie rock that brought a new generation of youths to the brand. Her biggest challenge, she says, is to keep her team focused on the long-term vision while balancing that with the need to hit short-term sales and profit objectives. An example of that challenge: For the first 10 months of this year, Cadillac sales were down 5.4% from the same period last year, according to Autodata Corp. -- Gina Chon 50. Michelle Kristula-Green President LEO BURNETT ASIA-PACIFIC SHE'S ALREADY the most powerful woman in Asian advertising. Now, as Madison Avenue looks to the East for growth, the question is whether Michelle Kristula-Green's savvy at working across cultures can help her build client relationships with Asian companies poised to become global brands. Ms. Kristula-Green was born in the U.S. but has lived two-thirds of her life abroad. She first proved herself in the old-boys club of Japan's huge ad industry, second only to the U.S. industry in revenue, where she was one of few women -- and fewer foreigners -- allowed in the clubhouse. As president of Beacon Communications, a joint venture between Japan's behemoth agency Dentsu Inc. and Leo Burnett, Ms. Kristula-Green built the agency into one of the very few successful foreign ad firms in Japan. \"The industry in Japan is built on very tight relationships. It is a tremendous challenge . . . for a Western company to be able to develop relationships with Japanese companies. It is about taking an incredibly long-term view,\" she says. On her watch, Beacon created a quirky campaign for Japanese consumer-loan firm Aiful Corp. that featured a Chihuahua and sparked a pet craze in Japan. When Burnett, a Publicis Groupe unit, promoted Ms. Kristula-Green to run the agency across all of Asia-Pacific in 2004, she took on even bigger challenges: China and India. In both, she expanded the business by over 15% in 2005, and nurtured local clients such as Air Deccan, a low-cost Indian airline, and Chinese shoe brand Li Ning, which recently hired Shaquille O'Neal as a spokesman. She speaks both Japanese and Mandarin Chinese, the latter learned in college at the University of Chicago. Her father, who was a Foreign Service officer, told her Chinese was the language of the future, she says. Ms. Kristula-Green sharpened those skills as a tour guide in China in 1979, where she took some of the first foreign tour groups into certain Chinese cities. That experience, she says, has given her a perspective on what's going on in China today. \"Everyone was in blue or green Mao suits and riding bicycles,\" she says. \"I could never have imagined how China would change in 25 years. That is the reason I have always been energized by Asia.\" That force of change is also her biggest challenge. \"Everything is changing so quickly,\" she says. \"Just when you think everything is going OK, you have to jump ahead.\" -- Geoffrey A.
