Impact of GST on medicines Medicines fall under Chapter 30 and are liable for excise duty at 6% on 65% of MRP when supplied by a pharmaceutical company. Some medicines were exempt from excise duty. Certain area-based excise duty exemptions were also available. The inputs required for manufacturing attracted 12.5% excise duty. Due to this inverted duty structure, there was an accumulation of CENVAT credit. Additionally, VAT at 4% was charged on the sale of medicines by producers and pharmacies. The table below illustrates the change in the price of medicines pre and post GST: Particulars Pre-GST (Rs) Post GST (Rs) Cost of manufacturing of one pack of XYZ tablets (A) 100 100 Excise duty at 6% on 65% of MRP (B) [((A)*65%)/106]*6% 3.9 \u2014 VAT at 4% (On A+B) 4.16 \u2014 GST at 12% \u2014 5/12 Final sale price 108.06 105/112 The average price of medicine remains almost the same in comparing scenarios before GST and upon implementing GST. Some of the other impacts on the price of medicines post implementation of GST are: Reduction in the overall cost of technology - Under the previous regime, the healthcare sector's machinery was very costly. Also, the duty charged on the same was not allowed as a tax credit. However, under GST, the IGST component will be allowed as a tax credit. Improvisation of operational efficiency - Previously, the pharmaceutical industry attracted eight different types of taxes. But, GST has merged all these taxes into one, thereby removing the cascading impact of many taxes. GST will also rationalise the supply chain, thereby improving operational efficiency. What is the value of supply to compute GST on medicines? As per GST, the transaction value is the value of supply. The transaction value is the price paid or payable for the supply of goods or services or both, where the supplier and the recipient are not related parties, and the price is the sole consideration for the supply. Discounts - As per Section 15(3) of the CGST Act, 2017, the discount can be deducted from the value of supply if given before or at the time of the supply if such discount has been recorded in the invoice of such supply. Distribution of free samples - The input tax credit on these samples should be reversed as no tax is paid at the time of distributing such samples to the physician. GST on the import of pharmaceuticals The import of medicines attracts IGST and customs duty. The following is the bifurcation of taxes applicable: Basic customs duty - 10% on assessable value for customs duty Social welfare surcharge - 10% on BCD IGST - 5%/12%/18% on the value after adding both the assessable value for customs duty and the basic customs duty and social welfare surcharge GST on expired medicines or the return of drugs If medicines reach the expiry date without being sold, then the same is returned to the manufacturer via the supply chain. Here, the retailer or wholesaler can opt for any of the two options below: Treating the returned goods as a fresh supply - In this case, the wholesaler will destroy the expired goods, and the return of expired goods will be recorded as purchases by the wholesaler. ITC availed on such goods will be reversed by the manufacturer because no ITC will be available on such goods as they are finally destroyed. Issue of a credit note for the returned goods - The supplier can adjust the tax liability only if ITC has not been availed by the person returning the expired medicines. In case ITC has been availed, the same will have to be reversed. Place of supply with regard to certain medical services With effect from 1 October 2019, the place of supply of services shall be the location of the recipient of services, for the export of research and development services by a person in the taxable territory to a non-taxable territory under contract, related to the pharmaceutical sector of the following: Integrated discovery and development Integrated development Evaluation of the efficacy of new chemical/ biological entities in animal models of disease Evaluation of biological activity of novel chemical/ biological entities in in-vitro assays Drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics of new chemical entities Safety Assessment/ Toxicology Stability Studies Bioequivalence and Bioavailability Studies Clinical trials Bio analytical studies Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How to calculate GST on medicines?
