Supported by [SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-sponsor) IT IS INDIFFERENT to beauty, this ragged tree that disdains soil and grows among the rocks, under bald sun and lashing winds, feeding on difficulty. Short as trees go, it has a hunkered-down look, its branches starting low to the ground and crooking and knotting as they rise. The most prized species make their home in the gullies and wadis of Dhofar in southern Oman and Hadhramaut in war-torn eastern Yemen, and along the cliffs and scarps of the Cal Madow mountains in [Somaliland](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/20/when-is-a-nation-not-a-nation-somalilands-dream-of-independence), whose 1991 declaration of independence from Somalia has gone unrecognized by the rest of the world. The Indigenous people of these regions brave snakes and scorpions to climb the trees and press a knife to the papery bark, just enough to break through the green skin beneath. Wounded, the tree begins to ooze, trying to heal itself, its viscous tears hardening into a resin that has been sought after and suffered over for nearly 5,000 years. [T's Beauty & Luxury Issue](https://www.nytimes.com/issue/t-magazine/2021/05/07/ts-may-16-beauty-luxury-issue) A history of modern beauty in [four chapters](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/10/t-magazine/beauty-transforming-self.html). Chapter 1: On the rise of [strong \"oriental\" fragrances](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/10/t-magazine/fragrance-perfume-orientalism.html) that reflected the political and cultural landscapes of their time, the 1980s. Chapter 2: On '90s-era advances in weaves, wigs and other [Black hairstyles](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/10/t-magazine/black-hair-weaves-wigs.html) that ushered in a new age of self-expression. Chapter 3: On [botanical oils](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/10/t-magazine/essential-oils-skin-care.html), a simple fact of life in much of the world that, here in the West, began to take on an almost religious aura in the 2000s. Chapter 4: On men wearing [makeup](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/10/t-magazine/men-makeup-gender-norms.html), a practice with a long history, but one that has really taken off in the last decade. The resin has a number of local names, among them luban, from the classical Arabic for milky whiteness, later adapted into Middle English as olibanum. But in the West we know it best as frankincense, after the Old French \"franc encens,\" or \"superior incense,\" and as a biblical relic, laid alongside its peers, gold and myrrh, at the feet of the newborn Jesus. Once frankincense was \"the most economically valuable and most widely disseminated plant product on the globe,\" the Lebanese-American ethnobotanist Gary Paul Nabhan writes in \" [Cumin, Camels and Caravans: A Spice Odyssey](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520379244/cumin-camels-and-caravans)\" (2014), esteemed as both fragrance and medicine, when there was little distinction between them. To sate the needs of the Roman Empire, camels hauled some 3,000 tons of it a year across the desolation of Arabia's [Rub' al Khali](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/28/science/ruins-in-yemeni-desert-mark-route-of-frankincense-trade.html), or Empty Quarter, the largest unbroken sweep of sand on earth. Over time, it was burned at temples from Karnak in Egypt to just north of modern Shanghai, and strewn over funeral pyres of the rich and powerful, giving off a dark scent with a warm halo, invoking must and musk, black pepper and sun-baked lemons, fallen pine needles and the fugitive sweetness of scorched wood. Frankincense persists in the holy smoke of churches, wafting from filigreed brass burners that priests swing on long chains as they stalk the pews. But until recently it had otherwise receded from modern life, with the bulk of the harvest winding up in Saudi Arabia, where the wealthy kept great knobs of it and broke off pieces as chewing gum. Then, in the past decade, it began to appear in Western media, hailed as the latest magic ingredient in skin care, capable of soothing and smoothing, brightening and tightening, all while quieting a troubled mind. The key was its form: Instead of glassy beads in an open brazier, a public spectacle, it was offered as an oil, intimate and discreet, for an audience of one. The oil is distilled from crushed resin via steaming and condensation, and often mixed with other precious oils, then daubed on the foreheads of believers \u2014 in this case, not the religious faithful but those seeking a more earthly kind of grace. For frankincense is just one of many botanical oils to find new devotees in the West after millenniums of use in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Among them are argan, from a thorned tree that grows in southwestern Morocco whose hard fruits are peeled to get at the even harder nut within, which is cracked, ground with stones and then squeezed by hand; neroli, requiring a pound of bitter orange blossoms to yield one drop of oil; sandalwood, for which fully grown trees are dug up whole, roots and all; and jasmine, bergamot, moringa, buriti, lavender, chamomile, marula, sea buckthorn, camellia, tamanu, evening primrose and more, each with its own folklore and hours of labor devoted to its extraction. To our ancestors, these were simply materials plucked from their surroundings. Now, they are being recast for our urban, atomized era as romantic and mystical: the primal essences of an endangered natural world, called forth to make us beautiful. BEFORE THE 20TH century, there was no global beauty industry, no direct path between the forager in the Horn of Africa, mounting a tree with bandaged feet to scrape off precious resin, and the customer in a penthouse in New York City preparing to moisturize a parched face, rubbing palms together to warm the drops of a facial oil that costs more per ounce than a vintage Krug. \"The origins of beauty products lie primarily in local knowledge of the scents and healing properties of plants, flowers and herbs, whose uses were bound by age-old religious and cultural beliefs,\" the Harvard business historian Geoffrey Jones writes in \" [Beauty Imagined: A History of the Global Beauty Industry](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/beauty-imagined-9780199556496?cc=us&lang=en&)\" (2010). Cosmetics were the realm of alchemists and folk healers, apothecarists and home cooks, who gathered herbs and flowers, bruised and boiled them, then strained out the oils through linen \u2014 until colonialism opened up supply chains around the world. Although men of means had always dabbled in powders and perfumes (Napoleon doused himself daily, emptying up to 60 flasks of rosemary-scented eau de cologne per month), historically it was women who were scorned for obsessing over their appearances, even as they were expected to be beautiful for the sake of decorum, or to broker a marriage on which the fate of their families might depend. \"The act of beautifying, though it seems enticing and freely chosen, is really compulsory work,\" the American historian Kathy Peiss notes in \" [Hope in a Jar: The Making of America's Beauty Culture](https://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/1149.html)\" (1998). Early Christians deemed face paint suspect, a mark of duplicity, and for centuries unadorned beauty was prized. Clarity of complexion supposedly testified to an equally spotless soul, although this, too, was often achievable only through the careful application of cosmetics, from rinsing with sour milk to slathering on peach-kernel oil \"to cure a red face,\" as one 18th-century British cooking manual advised. No longer is a shiny face a crisis, calling for blotting paper; now, it broadcasts health, inner radiance and even authenticity. The rules were a little different for European aristocrats, who had more leeway, sometimes to their detriment: In the 16th century, high-born Italian women covered their faces in a paste of white lead (risking muscle paralysis) and, for a touch of sheen, gave themselves a spritz of egg white, which when dried \"made it virtually impossible to express emotion,\" the British cultural scholar Susan Stewart writes in \" [Painted Faces: A Colourful History of Cosmetics](https://bookshop.org/books/painted-faces-a-colourful-history-of-cosmetics/9781445653990)\" (2017). But periodic surges of piety, religious or revolutionary, kept more \"honest\" faces the standard for the masses, prioritizing the cultivation of good skin over the trickery of disguise. Only in the 20th century, with the proliferation of artificial lighting and the dawn of Hollywood, did makeup become not just socially acceptable but nigh mandatory for all \u2014 even more so when, in the '60s, postmodernism gave us free rein with identity, allowing us to believe that \"the self is just a set of surfaces and performances, and we can be whoever we want to be,\" says the Australian cultural theorist [Ruth Barcan](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/us/ruth-barcan-marcus-philosopher-logician-dies-at-90.html). Still, where does skin care end and makeup begin? The word \"cosmetics\" can be traced back to the Greek \"kosmos,\" or \"order\": We arrange our skin to meet the world, through adornments both visible and invisible. The Vietnamese-Canadian makeup artist Hung Vanngo recalls that [in the '90s a matte complexion was the ideal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miu0NHPr8T4), a shield of velvet foundation and powder that permitted no hint of flaw beneath. But armor and perfection have fallen out of fashion, supplanted by shine \u2014 or gwang, in the lingo of now globally ascendant Korean beauty products, from mul-gwang, a wet sheen, to kkul-gwang, as glossy as honey \u2014 seemingly spontaneous and carefree, recalling Marilyn Monroe's [Vaseline-primed cheeks](https://www.southernliving.com/news/marilyn-monroe-skincare-vaseline) from the '50s, playing up every angle of light, and equally suggestive of dewy innocence and dance hall sweat. No longer is a shiny face a crisis, calling for blotting paper; now, it broadcasts health, inner radiance and even authenticity. \"It's more inclusive \u2014 celebrating individuality and the unique qualities of your skin,\" says Alison Carroll, 34, of Wonder Valley in California's Mojave Desert, who [makes cold-pressed extra-virgin olive oil](https://welcometowondervalley.com/collections/all/products/olive-oil) for cooking that she also blends into face and body oils. This idea has taken hold in part because lustrous skin is difficult to engineer with makeup alone. \"You get the glow from within,\" Vanngo says. \"Sounds cheesy, but it's true.\" Pat on the right blend of oils and it's like the sun's woken up. You surprise yourself in mirrors. EVEN IN OUR secular age, beauty is read as virtue. You are beautiful because you deny yourself. In the West in the last quarter of the 20th century, much of the language of beauty was the language of war: to fight and kill pimples and blemishes, whose stubborn recurrence was often blamed on our bodies producing too much oil. In other words, we were doing it to ourselves, failing our skin from within, victims of our own bad habits and indulgences \u2014 for what was oil but fat, and fat, we were told, was forbidden, in food and beauty alike. So oil was the enemy of the face. (Ironically, the anti-fat campaign just [ended up making Americans fatter](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2014/03/28/295332576/why-we-got-fatter-during-the-fat-free-food-boom), and many scientists have since [cast sugar as the villain](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/magazine/mag-17Sugar-t.html).) The proffered solution was to dry everything up with chemicals or purge the skin as if in exorcism, make it peel and flake, then emerge red and raw in hopes of beginning anew. (Only later were we informed that stripping the skin causes the sebaceous glands to generate even more oil in compensation, whereas putting certain oils on your face can trick the skin into slowing down sebum production.) Skin care was policing and panic, a game of whack-a-mole, or else just drudgery, a technical exercise in fending off the inevitable. No wonder makeup, which hid sins instead of trying to eliminate them, long dominated the market in the United States and Europe. \"Makeup was fun; skin care was boring,\" says Victoria Tsai, 42, who founded the line [Tatcha](https://www.tatcha.com/), which highlights Japanese camellia oil, in San Francisco in 2009. But some consumers were recoiling from synthetic ingredients in cosmetics, whether out of fear of toxins, concern for the environment, anti-corporate sentiment or nostalgia for some distant pastoral era when we were at one with our surroundings. The few skin-care companies to embrace a more natural approach flirted with mysticism, like [Weleda](https://www.weleda.com/), established in Switzerland in 1921 as an offshoot of the Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner's idiosyncratic spiritualism (which included some troubling theories on racial hierarchy), and [Dr. Bronner's](https://www.drbronner.com/) liquid soaps, concocted in Los Angeles in 1948 by the German-born itinerant preacher Emanuel Bronner, who printed labels with sermons and the slogan \"In all we do, let us be generous, fair & loving to Spaceship Earth and all its inhabitants.\" By the late '70s, mysticism had gone mainstream as the remnants of '60s counterculturalism morphed into New Age philosophies, and the [Body Shop](https://www.thebodyshop.com/), founded by the activist Anita Roddick in Brighton, England, was parlaying sales of tea tree oil and other natural ingredients into an empire, with the rest of the industry soon to follow. This was not a move forward, but a retreat. In early cultures, beauty was magic, ornamenting the body as a way \" [to invoke 'otherworldly' powers](https://www.academia.edu/24291692/Cosmetics_Identity_and_Consciousness),\" as the British anthropologist Camilla Power has written. Natural materials \u2014 feathers, shells, ocher, oil \u2014 were talismans to help ward off ills. In the new market niche of clean or green beauty lay a similar promise: to regain our connection not only to a larger world but to our older and, we imagined, wiser selves. Then, in 2007, two fledgling American beauty companies made oil their focus. In Los Angeles, the then-29-year-old model Josie Maran developed [a namesake line of cosmetics around argan oil](https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/19/face-time-josie-maran/), which was still a relatively obscure ingredient in the United States. At the same time, in New York, the fashion stylist Linda Rodin, then in her late 50s, was [tinkering at home](https://fashionista.com/2011/01/linda-rodin-makes-no-ridiculous-claims-about-what-her-oils-do) with neroli, jasmine and other oils bought from a health food store, and sharing the resultant elixir with models and fashion editors. Whereas Maran positioned her products as eco-friendly, socially conscious and accessible, Rodin's compound, Rodin Olio Lusso, had little back story beyond the kooky-cool charisma of its creator, with her tousled silver chignon. It was a fashion insider's exclusive accessory, and Rodin personally attended to every batch. (Est\u00e9e Lauder acquired Rodin Olio Lusso in 2014, but will cease production of it later this year.) Up to that point, botanical oils had gone fairly unheralded in mainstream Western beauty products, tucked into the small print of ingredient lists if used at all, and otherwise remained the stock of food co-ops and alternative medicine clinics, as aids in therapeutic massage and palliative care, their scents inhaled to ease anxiety and pain. They were treated as remedies, not fancy commodities, which made them prime for a resurgence as the border between health and beauty blurred. With rates of chronic illness rising in the United States \u2014 driven in part by a diet newly dependent on high-fructose corn syrup, introduced in 1967 and ubiquitous by the 1980s \u2014 and access to health care precarious and increasingly cost prohibitive, the idea of wellness entered the American vernacular: a desire to achieve not just physical but mental and spiritual health, beyond narrow medical definitions. In this holistic approach, the external was inseparable from the internal, and so the beauty industry began to crib from the New Age lexicon, shifting its pitch from warfare to self-care, from concealing imperfections to healing and nourishment. (Meanwhile, wellness has grown into its own industry, [estimated to be worth around $4.5 trillion globally](https://globalwellnessinstitute.org/press-room/statistics-and-facts/).) Oils fit the message. Derived from plants via labor-intensive methods that have gone largely unchanged for centuries, they are totems of a time when life unfolded more slowly and products were singular in character, not mass-produced. The strongest of them are called essential oils, after the medieval alchemist's notion of quinta essentia, a fifth essence of heavenly origin \u2014 a life force \u2014 to be extracted from terrestrial materials. \"You're capturing all this plant intelligence,\" says April Gargiulo, 47, a former winemaker who launched [Vintner's Daughter](https://vintnersdaughter.com/) in California's Napa Valley in 2014 with a lone product, a face serum that fuses the potencies of 22 plants, including frankincense, hazelnut, cypress and turmeric, coaxed out over three weeks of steeping and brewing. She adds wryly, \"That might sound a little woo-woo.\" But scientific studies attest to the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties of certain essential oils, which are derived from biologically active chemical components of a plant. The molecules in a single drop can number in the quintillions, and their small mass makes the oils volatile, quick to evaporate at room temperature. Highly powerful, the essential oils are often mixed with mellower carrier oils like coconut or avocado, or jojoba, a liquid wax from a shrub indigenous to the American Southwest, long used by Native American tribes but rediscovered in the late 20th century as an additive for automatic car transmission fluid. Today, an oil might be offered solo in a stand-alone bottle, for D.I.Y. experimentation, or swirled into golden formulas that smell of flowers. New companies are giving these Old World botanicals a high-tech spin, like the Silicon Valley start-up [Symbiome](https://www.symbiome.com/), which ferments vitamin-rich buriti oil from an Amazonian palm to recalibrate imbalances in the human microbiome. Even the luxury brand La Mer \u2014 whose name is nearly synonymous with its heavy, kelp-packed cream \u2014 released [a face oil](https://www.cremedelamer.com/product/20657/36221/collections/specialists/the-renewal-oil/anti-aging-face-oil) in 2015, followed by a corresponding [body oil balm](https://www.cremedelamer.com/product/5819/67537/body/the-renewal-body-oil-balm-/best-body-oil). Slippery in texture, oils take longer to sink into the skin than conventional creams, allowing for more \"playtime,\" as people in the beauty industry put it. Still, the science may be secondary to their appeal. \"You smell as you breathe, to feed your soul,\" says Catherine Corcoran, the international training manager at [Darphin](https://www.darphin.com/) in Paris, whose products are a legacy of the 20th-century French botanist and kinesiotherapist Pierre Darphin. Initiates are directed to gently push oils into the skin with hands shaped as if in prayer. To the secular mind, this may be just a moment to pause, but the gesture has the historical freight of religious sacrament, a ritual built to mediate between the earthly and the divine, tethering eternity to our fixed and finite existence. If this, too, sounds a little woo-woo, consider that the word \"messiah,\" a transliteration from the Hebrew, means \"anointed one.\" To put oil on one's skin is to anoint oneself, as prophets once anointed kings, and as priests anoint the sick and the dying, to bring them back from the brink. THE SUDDEN popularity and prestige of oils in skin care comes as something of a surprise to people who have been using them all along. \"It's always been a part of who I am,\" says Anit Hora, 41, who was born in Mumbai, India, and grew up in New York, where she started [M.S Skincare](https://msskincare.co/) in 2012. In her family, \"even babies got massages,\" she says, with different oils from Ayurvedic tradition depending on the season \u2014 sunflower in summer, to cool, and sesame in winter, to warm \u2014 and everyone was attuned to the curative properties of scent, whether in the form of perfume or food. When she first set up her stall at a Brooklyn farmers' market to sell tinctures and salves based on Ayurveda, the 5,000-year-old Indian system of medicine, \"no one could pronounce it,\" she says. (In a [1989 trademark infringement case](https://casetext.com/case/aveda-corp-v-evita-marketing-inc) involving the Ayurveda-inspired American brand Aveda, a man who claimed to have helped coin the company's name reportedly testified that the Sanskrit word did not sound pleasant in English.) But Rodin Olio Lusso had recently come on the market, and the public was newly intrigued by essential oils. \"People sometimes discount these things, until someone from the West does it,\" Hora says. In much of the world outside the West, oil is simply a fact of life \u2014 part of a daily practice. Since the 18th century, Japanese geisha have protected their skin from the constant duty of wearing heavy makeup by covering their faces first with bintsuke abura, a solid oil from the hazenoki tree that is applied like wax (and is also obligatory for sumo wrestlers, to finesse their topknots). At the end of the night, to wash off their makeup \u2014 a thick white paste called oshiroi \u2014 they use camellia oil, from a flower that blooms in the winter on the island of Izu Oshima, harvested by women farmers known for their long, cascading hair and luminous skin, says Tsai, of Tatcha. Cleansing with oil works because \"like dissolves like,\" she explains: The natural oils produced by the skin cling to the cleansing oil, bringing with them the accumulated pigments and dirt of the day, all of which melts off with a splash of water. In 1967, the Japanese makeup artist Shu Uemura created a camellia-based cleansing oil, the first product in what would become a cult line, eventually subsumed into L'Or\u00e9al. Yet when Tsai wanted to introduce her own camellia-oil cleanser in 2009, retailers warned her against it. \"I was told very explicitly, 'It's too exotic,'\" she says. \"[As if] the idea of beauty from Eastern cultures [had no] relevance or desirability in the Western world.\" (In the old colonial model of the beauty business, \"the resources and labor of Africans and Asians were put to service in an industry [that] would progressively assert the supposedly superior beauty of Western features and fashion,\" Jones, the business historian, writes.) But within a decade, Asian beauty had conquered the West, with a deluge of Korean products \u2014 cleansing oils, snail-slime masks, bee-venom creams \u2014 that turned skin care into entertainment and the fastest-growing segment of the beauty industry. In African history as in Asian, oils are an abiding tradition, still honored by members of the Black American diaspora, for whom \"oils are as central to grooming habits \u2014 not style, just basic grooming \u2014 as soap and water,\" says [Noliwe Rooks](https://africana.cornell.edu/noliwe-rooks), 58, the director of American Studies at Cornell University. \"Oiling regularly is part of being respectable and showing you are cared for or care about yourself.\" In America, this has always been a point of cultural distinction with whites, even in the very language. \"Ashiness\" is the word Black people have long used to describe dry skin, a condition universal to all races but more pronounced in appearance on darker complexions, with chalky patches that tend to manifest on the body's corners and hinges: elbows, knees, heels. But the term didn't gain traction in mainstream medicine until the past few decades, as the journalist Andrea Plaid [has recently written](https://www.vogue.com/article/more-than-just-dry-skin-the-cultural-significance-of-ashiness), and the condition was often shrugged off as just a matter of patting on a little moisturizer every now and then. Black hair, too, requires special ministrations \u2014 not simply because it tends to be texturally dense, with tight coils, but because of its historical status as a social signifier. In 15th-century West Africa, just before the dawn of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, hairstyles were a code, with strategically placed tufts and oiled braids announcing everything from tribal membership to age and wealth to a warrior's readiness for battle, as Ayana D. Byrd and Lori L. Tharps chronicle in \" [Hair Story: Untangling the Roots of Black Hair in America](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250046574)\" (2001). Untidy hair was interpreted as a disruption of the natural order, a sign of mourning or mental illness. With bondage came the shaving of heads and an erasure of identity, and in America, without access to Africa's bounty of indigenous oils, new, thrifty methods had to be improvised: kerosene to rub the scalp, goose grease to soften the strands. In the early 20th century, [Sarah Breedlove](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/how-business-executive-madam-c-j-walker-became-powerful-influencer-early-20th-century-180971628/), a washerwoman and descendant of enslaved people, adopted the name Madam C.J. Walker and reaped more than a million dollars selling sulfur-and-coconut-oil hair tonics, while recipes for home remedies made the rounds, including [one from the same period](https://nmaahc.si.edu/object/nmaahc_2011.170.7), handwritten on notepaper and enshrined at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., calling for a mixture of Vaseline, geranium oil and ox marrow. \"People sometimes discount these things, until someone from the West does it,\" says Anit Hora, the founder of M.S Skincare. Oil was not a luxury but a necessity. In the United States, shea butter was sold in big, practical tubs, for use on both body and hair, and coconut oil could be \"all things to all people,\" Rooks says, applied from head to toe or sloshed in a frying pan. The American hairstylist [Felicia Leatherwood](http://www.felicialeatherwood.com/), 52, recalls an oil from her youth that \"smelled like tires.\" Sometimes, oil was just straight-up medicine: \"If we had a fever, my mother would rub some oil on our foreheads,\" says the 50-year-old Ghanaian-British hairstylist featherweight, mineral-rich oil from manketti trees in Namibia. Then, in the '90s, the American market for Black beauty products began to boom, with the rise of Brooklyn entrepreneurs like Lisa Price of [Carol's Daughter](https://www.carolsdaughter.com/) and later the hairstylist sisters Miko and Titi Branch of [Miss Jessie's](https://missjessies.com/), whose products included lush melds of almond, coconut, avocado and macadamia nut oils. While in the civil rights era embracing Black beauty had been a repudiation of white ideals, the emphasis had by then shifted to \"Black self-love,\" Rooks says. \"You were constantly hearing, 'Be who you are; embrace yourself; do these fearless moral inventories.'\" This was not the mantra of self-care and restorative indulgence now championed by the beauty industry at large. \"For a people who were not considered attractive and who were highly surveilled \u2014 there's politics,\" Rooks says. Beauty \u2014 beautifying yourself \u2014 was a matter of carving out a space for yourself in the world, and of self-preservation. IS THERE SOMETHING to be said for indulgence? In an age that demands ever more productivity, it can be defiant, even anticapitalist, to assert a right to idle joy; to insist on existing for no reason but pleasure, if only for a moment. Still, the beauty industry wants to have it both ways, promising pampering and productivity at once. Wellness lends a pious aura to certain kinds of shopping, and these sanctified prescriptions, glittering in their immaculate bottles, lull us into believing that we control our destiny. \"This new religion of the body is not part of a revolutionary consciousness,\" the British writer Ros Coward warns in \"The Whole Truth: The Myth of Alternative Health\" (1989). Instead of fighting against the inequities and inadequacies of a system that allows toxins into our diets and pollutants into the air, denies us affordable health care and keeps us frantically paddling our rat wheels to stay financially afloat, we sometimes find it easier to just turn inward, peer at the mirror and scold ourselves. Which is not to say we are powerless. Consumer choices \u2014 like buying skin-care products made with natural ingredients \u2014 are often framed as a way to change the world, by putting pressure on the companies that run so much of it. But as Barcan, the cultural theorist, points out, skyrocketing demand for \"the natural\" exacts environmental and human costs that are often ignored in the romantic narratives of returning to the wellspring of nature and reviving ancient traditions. To produce rosewood oil, for example, which purportedly calms inflammation and helps erase scars, whole trunks of Brazilian pau rosa (Aniba rosaeodora) are reduced to a rubble of chips, then steamed, yielding sometimes less than a hundredth of oil per each tree's weight; since 2010, pau rosa has been classified as endangered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna. In India, where the government has attempted to control the harvesting and sale of sandalwood (Santalum album) to save the plant from extinction, a 50-year-old tree might be toppled for less than a liter of oil by poachers who regularly raid forests. The less available the oils are, the more expensive and coveted they become; rarity is ever chic. (Low prices usually indicate adulteration.) Sales of argan oil are projected to reach more than $500 million by 2027, even as the Berber women who grind the argan kernels into oil \u2014 a process that takes about 16 hours for one liter \u2014 may make [as little as $4 a day](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-07-25/cosmetics-hot-elixir-argan-oil-from-morocco). Frankincense is difficult to get, too: Oman restricts its output and exports mostly already distilled oil, while Yemen's devastating civil war makes the country a no-go zone for international trade. So most of the world's supply comes from Somaliland, where tapping frankincense trees and sorting the nubs of resin are jobs \"for the poorest of the poor,\" says Anjanette DeCarlo, 51, a Vermont-based environmental scientist, anthropologist and the founder of the [Save Frankincense](https://www.savefrankincense.org/) initiative. Once the resin was harvested only twice a year in the Cal Madow, following the guidelines of the Xeer, Somali laws first codified in the seventh century. Now, the trees accumulate notches and scars by the dozens, giving and giving. No one knows how many trees are left or how much more they can take, DeCarlo says. The region is unstable, and there are no reliable institutions to regulate production. Indeed, every oil comes with a story, which is marketing but can also be truth. The women of [Izu Oshima](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/travel/viewing-mount-fuji-from-a-nearby-isle.html) island in Japan still harvest camellia in the winter: The flowers are essential to the local economy, and the trees that bear them act as a windbreak, protecting crops from the bitter breezes rolling off the sea. Stories like these, however incomplete, are as essential as the oils themselves, reminding us that the bottles sitting so prettily on our shelves are the work of someone's hands and part of a larger cultural inheritance. DeCarlo doesn't want to halt the trade in frankincense, which would deprive many Somalis of a livelihood. \"Use it with reverence and respect,\" she says: Recognize that it's a limited resource and invest in the places where it's harvested by directly funding worker cooperatives and planting nurseries. Public demands for sustainability can have an effect, as a number of companies are seeking ways to monitor the supply chain for frankincense, as well as oils from other overexploited species, such as tracking resin in real time through blockchain (a technology that has its own environmental costs) or, as has been done in India, implanting microchips in trees. \"We're living in an interconnected world,\" DeCarlo says. \"The impoverishing of others to make ourselves beautiful is making us all ugly.\" Nature will not be our redemption so long as we see it as at once separate from and subservient to us, ours to take but pure only if untouched \u2014 as if these botanical ingredients we prize so much had never been axed, plucked or pulverized by human hand, or borne across land and sea by the power of capital, en route to our bathroom cabinets. As Barcan has written, we no longer gather our magical ingredients from the fields but from shops. Or at least most of us: From a decade of trips to Somaliland, up into the mountains in rattling trucks, eluding gunfire, counting trees and listening to elders, DeCarlo has brought back some frankincense of her own, pale rugged hunks that to the untrained eye might look like New Age crystals. It is a private stash, hers alone. Sometimes, she says, she crushes a little resin in a cup, adds hot water and drinks it straight. She smiles as she says it, and as she does, you can see it in her face: the glow. Model: Jada Shropshire at Next Management. Hair: Ro Morgan at the Wall Group using Design Essentials.
