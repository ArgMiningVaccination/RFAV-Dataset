I don't remember much from that time but I do know that Dr. Ellenbogebn saved my life. Thank you - I've had Chiari Malformation for 5 years and no doctor could figure out what was wrong until I went to my eye doctor for my eye shaking constantly. I was referred to Dr. Ellenbogen, he met with me as soon as he could and got me scheduled for the surgery. I'm still in ICU and getting moved to a room today but I already feel a huge difference in pain in my head. Everyone that has worked with me at Harbor View has been excellent and very helpful. I am very thankful for all of them! - Dr. E is the best of the best. He is not just a master of surgery, but dedicated to caring for his patients with love and compassion. He has taken care of my son Max for 14 years and multiple surgeries. He is always there for us whenever we need him, without hesitation, and with genuine love for my son. Just having him in our lives gives our family peace. - Dr. Ellenbogen is a very compassionate and amazing doctor. He performed my decompression surgery for chiari 1.5 malformation. One of the best doctors I've ever met. I highly recommend him. - I was having a huge amount of headaches again. I called my neurosurgeon from a 2008 Chiari decompression. Needless to say, he didn't have even a moment of time to talk with me. He referred me to a pain specialist that wouldn't even take my United Healthcare Insurance. Dr. Ellenbogen ACTUALLY called me. I had never talked or met him. I heard he was the best & had talked to his assistant. I assumed I would possibly get a call from his nurse. I was so SHOCKED! He is a lovely man, EXTREMELY knowledgeable & fantastic beside manner. I would highly recommend him!! - Dr. Ellenbogen, Fifteen years ago today you and a splendid team at Seattle Children's Hospital made all the difference in our son Trey's life. He was a 9-month old with Sagittal Synostosis. Through your knowledge, skill and caring you gave him a chance at a normal life. I want you to know he is not 'normal.' He is a brilliant young man with an incredibly bright future. He plays the cello, is an exceptional student, and was recently invited by Buzz Aldrin and other notables to a Harvard summer program as a high school sophomore. Our younger son, Eric, had the same unbelievable diagnosis (arrgh) but was also treated at Children's and has a future at least as bright as his older brother. We can never thank you enough and will always feel blessed by the modern miracle you performed. Humbly, gratefully, Ted and Eileen Ulmer - February 2, 2015 will be the 16-year anniversary of our son Jack's surgery by Dr. Ellenbogen. When Jack was 1 1/2 years old, he started stumbling and falling down. An MRI at a local hospital ended up with an ambulance ride to Children's and a diagnosis of a pilocytic astrocytoma on Jack's cerebellum. By luck of the draw, Dr. Ellenbogen became our doctor, changed our lives and saved our son. Two surgeries, countless MRIs and 16 years later, Jack is an honor student, varsity soccer player and accomplished musician. We are not only grateful to Dr. Ellenbogen for his skill, but most especially for his bedside manner. Dr. Ellenbogen knew how to treat the entire family, continually seeking out my husband to reassure him. For all these years, he has talked directly to Jack, answered his questions, and gave him a normal life. We are forever indebted. - What can I say about Dr. Ellenbogen and Seattle Children's Hospital that no one else has said already........but here is our story. Born prematurely and VP shunted at 6 months old, our daughter was sick for 20 years, before discovering a Chiari Malformation 1.5 with a size of 25mm going to her C2 WOW. We were to be sent to Anchorage with a surgery scheduled, but my daughter, and her investigation found Dr. Ellenbogen through the UW website and found whom she wanted to met and do her surgery. At that time Dr. Ellenbogen had a mustache, but when our child met him he didn't and that is what she first noticed , and said you look different and that he \"was the man in charge\", instant friendship and kindness she will never forget. Her first surgery didn't go that well with both lungs collapasing, so we tried again a few months later. Our daughter was a different person the minute she came out of surgery---no pain, no pressure and no headache. Dr. Ellenbogen was there from the first minute to the last during our stay at the hospital. We still talk of Dr. Ellenbogen to our friends in our community that are suffering with the same illness and we always tell them to go see Ellenbogen, to this day we have three friends that have gone to see Dr. Ellenbogen and never will forget his kindness. Our family is celebrating the one year anniversary of this decompression surgery today, and it may me think of Dr. Ellenbogen and his staff and will be forever grateful. - My 9 year old son has been a patient of Dr. Ellenbogen for over 5 years now and not only is he the most knowledgeable doctor I've ever met, but as my son has grown up and had his own questions, Dr. Ellenbogen never shy's away from answering them in a way that I can't even explain. Everything he does is professional, respectful and deliberate. I would highly recommend Dr. Ellenbogen. He is a wonderful man and incredible doctor. - Just after Labor Day 2012, our daughter was referred to Dr. E when the mild concussion she suffered at residential soccer camp in July turned out to not be a concussion but a chiari malformation 1 along with an abnormally large syrinx. What started as an MRI to determine severity of a concussion turned into an MRI with contrast to a referral to neurology to hmm maybe we should look at surgery in late October. Flash forward a week and suddenly it became surgery in a week. Through it all Dr. E and his team were top notch. But it's Dr. E that sets the bar, beyond high, and the tone, he is the teen whisperer for sure. Unfortunately, Children's was over booked and the surgery took place at Harborview. A top notch facility to be sure, but not necessarily the bright, cheery place of Children's. The surgery went as planned and he kept us informed every step of the way. She made great progress and was able to return home after 5-nights. Four nights home and there was an issue and back to the hospital she went. Again Dr. E and his team treated her as is she were his only patient and kept us duly informed. While there were complications not resulting from the original surgery to deal with the malformation and syrinx, Dr. E stayed on top of everything, being appropriately cautious and conservative and assuring my daughter she would be back on the soccer field in the Spring. He is a busy and in demand man and yet you would not know it. When one of the complications turned out to be an undiagnosed infection, Dr. E stopped by the hospital to check-in on her on his way home from Sea-Tac where he had just flown in from a conference, it was after Midnight, he was exhausted and there he was, checking on her. His bedside manner and dedication to his talents is what all should strive towards. Any time he walked into her PICU room, her blood pressure immediately lowered and her confidence was restored. Needless to say, what we expected to be a week long hospital stay and another two weeks recuperating at home turned into just over a month in the hospital and almost 10 weeks at home recuperating. An entire semester of high school missed and such. Regardless, we have absolute faith in Dr. E and could go on and on and on. We recommend Dr. E and his team to the nth degree. Dr. E rocks! Or as our daughter says, Dr. E is just. AWESOME. - I have been seeing Dr. Ellenbogen for 16 years, and I would definitely recommend him to everyone who has a chiari because he has a lot of expertise in helping people with this disorder, he has never pressured me into anything, and he only makes recommendations based on what he thinks will help me the most. I just met with him recently because my chiari was getting worse. Based on that and my MRI results, he thought that surgical intervention would help me the most. My surgery is scheduled for this comming Tuesday, and I definitely trust him to take good care of me and do a good job on my surgery because he is very kind, has excellent bedside manners, he has been helping people like me since before I was born, and he does about 100 chiari surgeries per year. I would definitely recommend him without a doubt. - When you meet Dr. Ellenbogen, you know immediately that he has your child's best interest at heart. My daughter Amelia was born in 2001 with Spina Bifida, and proved to be very complicated. Dr. Ellenbogen not only took outstanding surgical and medical care of her, but was sincere in his dedication to listening to the family. He included us as a part of the team, and as a part of the decision-making process, without even being asked. He was honest, attentive, and amazingly skilled. I would recommend him without hesitation, and am thankful for his care. - - Award Name Award Description Awarded By Award Date SEATTLE TOP DOCTOR - 2022 Seattle Magazine 2022 Seattle Top Doctor - 2019 Seattle Magazine 2019 SEATTLE'S TOP DOCTOR -
