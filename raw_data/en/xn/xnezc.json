Thanks for sharing your story with us Dr. Carter. So, let's start at the beginning and we can move on from there. In undergrad at Texas Woman's University, I studied food nutrition and got interested in anatomy and how the body works. I decided I wanted to further my education and do a career that was hands on, holistic, and would help people. I had some great mentors along the way that encouraged me to go ahead and open up my practice. Now I feel that becoming a Chiropractor was the best decision Ive ever made. Has it been a smooth road? Going through school with a small child at home was very difficult. I had to spend endless amounts of hours studying and preparing for exams, national boards and completing projects. I feel that it truly prepared me for being a business owner. I am just as busy now as I was when I was in school. Setting goals for myself was key in getting me to where I needed to be. Even if I did not reach every goal I set for myself I was glad I had something to be working towards. It kept me going and striving each day. So let's switch gears a bit and go into the Infinite Energy Chiropractic & Wellness story. Tell us more about the business. I am the owner of Infinite Energy Chiropractic & Wellness. We specialize in chiropractic care and general health and wellness. We specialize in personal injury and car accident cases. We have been open for one year and I am extremely proud of the growth. The overwhelming support I have gotten from the surrounding community has been amazing. We are such a fun practice to be a part of. My patients truly love the care they are given and constantly refer their friend and family. Before the end of the year, we will be adding a nurse practitioner to our practice so we can cater to our patients even more. We are a one stop shop for health and wellness needs. How do you think the industry will change over the next decade? People have started to take more control of their health. Herbal supplements, essential oils, natural childbirth, clean eating and chiropractic care have seen a huge increase in the last few years. I feel that chiropractic care allows people to become more in tune with their bodies by being aligned and having a fully functioning nervous system. Science hasn't even caught up with the full benefits chiropractic care can bring to a patient. Some of the transformations I've seen in my office can only be described as miracles.
