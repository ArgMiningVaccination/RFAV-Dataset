A total of 933 volunteers were involved. The adverse reactions post herbal and orthodox vaccinations were compared in order to ascertain which of the two regimes best suited the volunteers. Two sample sizes were estimated. One was based on the expected frequency of at least one local side effect between 48.9 and 85.8%. The second was based on the expected frequency of at least one systemic side effect between 52.6 and 70.5%. T-test calculated was far higher than the values tabulated at 99% confidence limits when the two independent population means of both volunteers that were administered with orthodox vaccine and those who received the local Joseleen lipids mixtures (JOHVIR) were compared. In other words, t-cal. 34.6> t -tab. 3.17 at P <0.01, Case fertility rates for the post orthodox vaccine administration was 14% in all the area councils unisex and across all age groups while no fatality cases were recorded post herbal lipids mixture administration to volunteers. This study provides novel evidence that there was high significant difference (P<0.01) in serious adverse reactions post orthodox vaccine administration and far milder and lesser adverse reactions post Local Joseleen Herbal Lipids mixture (Johvir) across all the ages tested.
