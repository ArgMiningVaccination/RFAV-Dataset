Everyone Should Clean Your Hands Often - Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. - If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry. - Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid Close Contact - Stay home if you are sick. - Avoid close contact with people who are sick. - Put distance between yourself and other people. - Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus. - This is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick. Cover Your Mouth and Nose With a Cloth Face Cover When Around Others - You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick. - Dallas College recommends masks to be worn at any of our locations. Cover Coughs and Sneezes - Remember to always cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow. - Throw used tissues in the trash. - Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
