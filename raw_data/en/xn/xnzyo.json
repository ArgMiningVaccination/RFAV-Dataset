Stelara\u00ae is an immune suppressant that reduces the effects of inflammatory proteins within the body. This is the first time BFI-751 will be given to humans. The primary purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics (the study of what the body does to the drug, referring to the movement of any drug going into, through, and out of the body) by checking to see if the blood levels of 751-BFI are comparable with US-Stelara\u00ae and EU-Stelara\u00ae following a single injection under the skin. The secondary purposes of this study are: - - to assess the safety of BFI-751, - study how well the healthy volunteers tolerate it and. - - to also assess the immune response to it in healthy volunteers. Recruitment Criteria | Accepts Healthy Volunteers | Healthy volunteers are participants who do not have a disease or condition, or related conditions or symptoms |Yes| | Study Type | An interventional clinical study is where participants are assigned to receive one or more interventions (or no intervention) so that researchers can evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes. An observational clinical study is where participants identified as belonging to study groups are assessed for biomedical or health outcomes. Searching Both is inclusive of interventional and observational studies. |Interventional| |Eligible Ages||18 Years - 50 Years| |Gender||All| Inclusion Criteria: - - Healthy volunteers will be included in the study if they meet all of the following criteria at screening, and after check-in on Day -1, prior to dose administration: 1. Exclusion Criteria: - - Healthy volunteers will be excluded from the study if there is evidence of any of the following at screening or after check-in on Day -1, prior to dose administration: 1. Trial Details | Trial ID: | This trial id was obtained from ClinicalTrials.gov, a service of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, providing information on publicly and privately supported clinical studies of human participants with locations in all 50 States and in 196 countries. | | Phase 1: Studies that emphasize safety and how the drug is metabolized and excreted in humans. Phase 2: Studies that gather preliminary data on effectiveness (whether the drug works in people who have a certain disease or condition) and additional safety data. Phase 3: Studies that gather more information about safety and effectiveness by studying different populations and different dosages and by using the drug in combination with other drugs. Phase 4: Studies occurring after FDA has approved a drug for marketing, efficacy, or optimal use. The sponsor is the organization or person who oversees the clinical study and is responsible for analyzing the study data. The person who is responsible for the scientific and technical direction of the entire clinical study. Category of organization(s) involved as sponsor (and collaborator) supporting the trial. The disease, disorder, syndrome, illness, or injury that is being studied. This is a two centre, bioequivalence, randomized, double-blind, 3 parallel group Phase 1 study of BFI-751 compared with EU-Stelara \u00ae and US-Stelara \u00ae in healthy adult volunteers. Within 28 days of screening, eligible participants will commence a confinement period on Day -1. The participants will receive a 45mg dose of either BFI-751, Stelara-US \u00ae or Stelara-EU\u00ae in a blinded manner on Day 1 and will remain in the clinic until Day 2. Participants will then return to the clinic as outpatients on Days 3, 5, 8, 11, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43,57, 71 and 85 for safety assessments. A total of up to 228 eligible participants will be enrolled and randomised in a 1:1:1 On Day 1, participants will be randomised to receive a single SC dose of 45 mg/0.5mL BFI-751 Active Comparator: Arm B: EU-STELARA\u00ae On Day 1, participants will be randomised to receive a single SC dose of 45 mg/0.5mL EU- STELARA\u00ae Active Comparator: Arm C: US-STELARA\u00ae. On Day 1, participants will be randomised to receive a single SC dose of 45 mg/0.5mL US- STELARA\u00ae Interventions Drug: - Single Drug: - US-STELARA\u00ae Pre-filled syringe, solution Contact a Trial Team If you are interested in learning more about this trial, find the trial site nearest to your location and contact the site coordinator via email or phone.
