Visitor Letters 81 3 Director's Statement Dear IMBS Colleagues and appropriate administrators, It is time to again review the activities of our IMBS members, and the IMBS, over the past academic year. A crude measure of the activity over the year is that IMBS members were on grants (some multiyear and multi-participants) involving over $78,000,000. During the year our members published over 180 papers (which includes some books), and they gave over 175 invited presentations. (For more specific information about individual activities, please see the Appendices of this report.) Clearly, this has been, again, an active year! The strength of the IMBS derives directly from our members and their contributions. As such, let me recommend that in reading this report you start in Section II-D, Summaries of Significant Findings , which provides a sample of wide variety of results that have been discovered over the last year by our colleagues. As an illustration, in this section you will find how research within the institute ranges from the practical, such as Keller's exploration of complexity in making decisions, Brueckner's analysis of airport congestion (which all of us have suffered!), Branch's analysis of bubbles and crashes (again, something that has concerned all of us!), Small's study of demand for travel and energy policy, Noymer's work on the spread of diseases (leading to comments about the current worry of H1N1), to the more theoretical such as Xin's and Zhao's mathematical approaches toward hearing, vision and other issues, Frank's analysis of dynamics and information in issues of natural selection, the work of Jameson, Komarova, and Narens on the analysis of color categorization, and on and on. You will also discover how current IMBS research, such as Luce's analysis of individual risk and Hoffman's work on perception probably will force fundamental reexaminations of assumptions and experiments. And, this is just a sample of what you will discover. Each year the IMBS puts on widely recognized conference/workshops. (Videos of the talks can be found on the conference link of http://www.imbs.uci.edu .) The first of the two major conferences of the 2008-09 academic year took place in January ( Adaptive Systems and Mechanism Design ) and in March ( Human and Machine Learning). The theme of this first conference is the topic that was recognized by the Nobel Prizes in Economics in 2007 (and two laureates, Kenneth Arrow and Eric Maskin gave major talks during this conference). As the presentations at this conference proved, the notion of combining concepts from game theory with the design organizations (to achieve desired outcomes) now is moving from economics to political science, computer science, and even social networks\u2014these are all areas represented within the IMBS. The second conference addressed another topic of strength within the IMBS and UCI\u2014 learning theory. Here ideas by experts from computer science, statistics, cognitive sciences, psychology, and even from representatives from industry were explored. Other conferences include the two we put on each year for graduate students. The one during fall term is devoted toward describing IMBS supported research that was carried out over the past summer, while the one in the spring provides a platform for our students to present their ideas to fellow students and faculty; over the day of the conference, about 75 people attended. 4 As I have described in previous reports, the goal of our graduate program extends beyond those students who are actually enrolled in our program to provide a home for any UCI graduate student who has an interest in combining mathematics with puzzles coming from the social and behavioral sciences. The effects of this outreach can be seen from the list of speakers at our graduate student conference (Section III B) and the participation of students from many different disciplines that enroll in our graduate research seminar. In addition to our active colloquia series (see Section IV E), our subgroups, Social Dynamics and Complexity has a weekly series (that involves several other universities), the Social Networks Research Group has weekly discussion meetings as does the newly formed Evolution of Signaling Systems group. Information about their activities can be found in the report. In summary, 2008-09 was a successful year for the IMBS. Success must be measured by how the institute helps our members advance their research programs. This means we need your continual support, participation, and, of particular importance, ideas and suggestions! Success also must be measured in terms of how IMBS helps promote interdisciplinary research and discussions across campus, how it helps develop the talents of our graduate students. As the report demonstrates, we are doing a strong job, but we always welcome suggestions about what else we could be doing. Although the financial difficulties were beginning to emerge during the 2008-09 academic year, the IMBS enjoyed a full, active year, and we expect to do the same during 2009-10; indeed, at least four conferences are being planned. As this report proves, the cost of the institute is very modest, particularly considering the impact we have in terms of funding, helping to develop and promote new approaches, our work with graduate students, and the impact the IMBS has been having on a variety of fronts as outlined in this report. While it is not clear what will be possible to do during the new academic year, we are hoping for the best. To conclude, I wish to salute a person who always plays a key and important role for the success of the IMBS: Janet Phelps . My warm and deep thanks to Janet for everything she continually does to make the IMBS run so smoothly! Sincerely, Donald G. Saari Director, IMBS 5I. ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION A.

Their awards and achievements for this year can be found in Appendix E. D. Summaries of Significant Findings An important aspect of the Institute is the research conclusions developed by its members. What follows is a sample of what has happened this year. 7Measurement Theory, Foundational Issues, and Scaling Models Louis Narens My research during the past year has been related to three grants on which I am PI or Co- PI. For one of these, a psychophysical grant from NSF with R. Duncan Luce and Ragnar Steingrimsson, my research has consisted in the development of theory and the design of experiments. For the second, an evolutionary game theory grant from NSF with Kimberly Jameson, Natalia Komarova, and Ragnar Steingrimsson, my research has been primarily a revision of an article about the philosophical implications of our research. And for the third, a mathematical logic and foundations of probability grant from AFOSR with Brian Skyrms, my research during the past year has been devoted to writing a new book, Intuitionistic Probability Theory with Applications to Decisions and Strategic Game Theory . Also during the past year, Brian Skyrms and I have been involved in integrating the evolutionary game theory research at Irvine involving the evolution of shared concepts, knowledge, and values. This include Jeff Barrett, Simon Huttegger, and Brian Skyrms from the Department of Logic and the Philosophy of Science, Louis Narens and Ragnar Steingrimsson from the Department of Cognitive Science, Natalia Komarova and Don Saari from the Department of Mathematics, Kimberly Jameson from Mathematical Behavioral Sciences, and graduate students from several departments. Skyrms, Narens, and Jameson have been actively involved in seeking extramural funding for this enterprise, including large scale grants to support this research and funding for a conference to put on at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. Statistical Modeling Jeff Barrett I have been thinking about how language and theory might coevolve in the context of cooperative action. As a basic model, I have been running computer simulations of Skyrms-Lewis sender-receiver games. In short, simple signaling languages and simple predictive dispositions can coevolve from random signaling and predicting for agents equipped with only the most basic reenforcement learning. Decision-Making Robin Keller L. Robin Keller, Craig W. Kirkwood (Arizona State University), and Nancy S. Jones, (Baltimore Metropolitan Council). Forthcoming 2009, \"Assessing Stakeholder Evaluation Concerns: An Application to the Central Arizona Water Resources System,\" Systems Engineering . (Expected in Volume 12 (3)), accepted for publication on 8/20/08. Received 7 March 2008; Revised 13 June 2008; Accepted 20 August 2008, published online in advance of printing on Wiley InterScience ( www.interscience.wiley.com ) DOI 10.1002/sys.20132 Keller et al. (2009) present an approach for efficiently assessing stakeholder evaluation concerns in the first stage of problem structuring for decisions involving complex systems. They used a web survey to assess the appropriateness of a set of evaluation concerns for evaluating 8Central Arizona water resources system policies and to gather information on stakeholder priorities. The resulting set of concerns brings a \"decision focus\" to the modeling efforts of the NSF-funded Decision Center for a Desert City at Arizona State University. This problem structuring approach, the set of evaluation concerns, and the analysis of variations among stakeholder group priorities can serve as a starting point for other similar policy settings. Vladimir Lefebvre During the last year I kept developing the theory of reflexive games. This theory considers a subject with a hierarchy of images of himself and others. I am working now on a book describing this theory. R. Duncan Luce 1) The first project follows up on the decision making insight of Luce (2009a) that there must be three types of people vis-\u00e1-vis risk, and which provides an empirically simple behavioral criterion for determining a person's type. This raises the question whether the experiments that various people have carried out testing the several invariance properties that theorists have posited actually need to be redone, carefully separating respondents by type. This project is described in the submitted article Luce (2009c). In brief, although some invariance properties are unaffected by respondent type, the more elaborat e ones that rest upon links between the structure of joint receipts and that of uncertain alternatives are so affected, and therefore need to be redone. This is a fairly major experimental program. 2) Ragnar Steingrimsson and I have carried out auditory experiments on the so-called time-order phenomenon, namely that when identical signals are presented successively they do not seem equally loud. Using my global psychophysical theory (Luce, 2004, 2008) in the Psychological Review , we arrived at tests of the accuracy of the model. A simple qualitative property shows that when one establishes the match using two interval forced-choice procedures the model seems on average vaguely like the representation, but just how well varies by respondent in none too clear ways. Using an up-down free-adjustment matching procedure the theory accounts very well for all 6 respondents provided we admit that each respondent has an option: Is it that the varied signal maters, in which case certain curves must agree? Or is it the signal that is presented second that matters, in which case the slopes must be of opposite signs. This means the average plot is totally misleading. A joint paper \"Evaluation of Time-Order Error Predictions from a Model of Global Psychophysics\" is nearing completion and we expect to submit it later in the summer of 2009. Additional brightness studies are underway that use visual equipment purchased under a supplementary grant to the main one. 3) Based on an initial idea of Louis Narens (1996), which I showed also to follow readily from the global psychophysical representation mentioned in (ii), we have begun to collect data. The prediction is that a form of commutativity must be exhibited when scaling data form a ratio scale. In particular, suppose that the respondent reports that \"signal z is p times as loud as x,\" and then reports \"u is q times as loud as z.\" Then do it with q first and p second leading to u'. Commutativity asserts that u = u'. Luce, Narens, and Steingrimsson are testing this property for loudness and, in a second experiment, for brightness. Assuming that these tests work out, we will next ask the empirical question: Does the evidence support the hypothesis that subjective 9intensity is really the same scale for both loudness and brightness? If so, matching loudness to brightness makes sense. If that is sustained, does it apply to other domains? For example, Linda Bartoshuk (in an invited address at the 2009 Sa n Francisco meeting of the Association of Psychological Science) proposed replacing the quite unsatisfactory 10-point category scale of subjective pain - widely used in hospitals to evaluate pain level to decide on medications - by having people match loudness of comparable subjective intensity to their experienced pain. Her proposal currently lacks good scientific justification; we hope to be able to provide one. Padhraic Smyth In joint work with IMBS member Mark Steyvers (Cognitive Sciences), we have developed a new statistical text modeling appro ach that can learn language models using both large corpora of text data as well as prior human knowledge in the form of taxonomies or concepts. This builds on our earlier work in statistical text mining, where documents are represented as mixture distributions over topics, and topics are multinomial distributions over words. These techniques have been very successful at unsupervised learning of interpretable concepts from large sets of documents - however, these algorithms are purely data-driven and ignore significant aspects of prior human knowledge. In our new approach, we show how to gain the best of both worlds: models that use both human knowledge and data have better predictive power (not surprisingly) than models that rely on either alone. This new framework promises to be a useful starting point as a general fram ework for addressing a number of problems in computational text analysis, including quantitative evaluation and integration of ontologies and automated tagging with human concepts of large volumes of unlabeled text data. Perception and Psychophysics Mike Braunstein There has been considerable interest recently in the role of the ground plane in the perception of the layout of objects in 3-D scenes. Our current research has been concerned with changes in perception that occur at the horizon. We have found that perceptions of relative size, speed and motion path are altered as objects move above the horizon. When the horizon is not explicitly present in a scene, a \"perceptual horizon\" is determined by a combination of the vanishing point of converging lines in the s cene and the height at which the visible ground surface terminates. Mike D'Zmura The rhythmic structure of imagined speech production can be detected in non-invasive brain recordings, providing a step toward the development of an EEG-based system for communicating imagined speech. 10Donald Hoffman A goal of perception is to estimate true properties of the world. A goal of categorization is to classify its structure. Aeons of evolution have shaped our senses to this end. These three assumptions motivate much work on human perception. In my paper \"The interface theory of perception\" I argue, on evolutionary grounds, that all three assumptions are false. Instead, our perceptions constitute a species-speci c user interface that guides behavior in a niche. Just as the icons of a PC's interface hide the complexity of the computer, so our perceptions usefully hide the complexity of the world, and guide adaptive behavior. This interface theory of perception oers a framework, motivated by evolution, to gui de research in object categorization. This framework informs a new class of evolutionary games, called interface games, in which pithy perceptions often drive true perceptions to extinction. A. Kimball Romney Research with Chuan-Chin Chiao on a color appearance model has the potential to revolutionize color vision theory. The derivation of the model and a description of the four basic equations that constitute the model are presented in, \"Functional computational model for optimal color coding\" (PNAS 2009, 106:10376-10381). The model calculates an orthornormal projection matrix from the cone photoreceptors that is used to transform any surface reflectance spectra into a linear combination of the photoreceptors. An estimate of the color appearance structure is obtained by multiplying the reflectance spectra of 1269 Munsell color chips by the projection matrix and representing the result in a three dimensional Euclidean space. The resulting structure is almost the same as the CIE L*a*b* color system, the internationally recognized gold standard. Our model has the advantage that it provides a functional explanation of why the additive colors of red, green, and blue constitute the prime or ideal colors used universally in industry to produce color monitors, high definition color TV, etc. In a second paper Romney demonstrates that virtually all color information contained in the physical reflectance spectra is passed through the projection matrix which transforms spectra into a linear combination of the cone photoreceptors. The variance accounted for when using the model result to predict the actual spectra of 640 color chips is 0.9988. In a third paper Romney and Chiao show how the model applies to any variant genetic photoreceptor types of observers including those with only two spectrally distinct photopigments. Color appearance for such observers has not been precisely modeled in the past. Since the model makes very strong quantitative predictions that can be easily confirmed or disconfirmed we are hoping for an early test of the validity of the model. Jack Xin Main Findings: (1) Develop soft-constrained dynamic iterative method for blind source separation, study its stability and convergence; (2) Design a class of Nonlocally Weighted Soft-Constrained Natural Gradient Algorithm and B lind Separation of Reverberant Speech Mixtures; (3) Successfully separated recorded sound mixtures in strongly reverberant room conditions, and achieved higher signal-to-interference ratio than existing methods in the literature; (4) Authored an invited Springer book entitled \" An Introduction to Fronts in Random Media, Surveys and Tutorials in the Applied Math Sciences, Vol. 5, Springer, July, 2009 . (1)-(3) are research advances towards solving the \"cocktail party problem\" in hearing science via the so called Blind signal processing. \"Blind\" refers to no a priori knowledge of 11environments of sound mixing. The methods deve loped in fact apply to a broad range of problems related to the sensing, imaging, recognition and learning processes in the brain. (4) is a first introductory user-friendly entry-level graduate tutorial book on dynamics of interfaces (flames, shocks, moving boundaries) in random environment. A real-world example is forest fire or turbulent combustion in rockets and auto turbines. Hong-kai Zhao We developed the following theory and computational algorithms: (1) classification, segmentation and visualization of point clouds using principal component analysis. (2) for photon propagation in tissue based on radiative transfer equation and for molecur imaging using visible or near infared light. (3) for moving interface and free boundary problem. (4) for optimal control and Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Social and Economic Phenomena (a) Economics and Game Theory William Branch The conventional view of financial markets holds that stock prices should reflect all publicly available information and that the efficient operation of markets will lead a stock's price to equal the present value of expected future dividends. Two noteworthy empirical facts cast doubt on this hypothesis: stock market returns are often predictable and stock prices exhibit recurrent bubbles and crashes. In two recent papers, I employ models of bounded rationality and learning to explain how bubbles and crashes might arise in a conventional model of stock prices and to generate predictable stock market returns. Jan Brueckner My recent work on different approaches to airport congestion management showed the superiority of quantity-based over price-based approaches. Under congestion pricing, airlines must be charged different congestion tolls dependi ng on their flight share at an airport. The reason is that large airlines internalize (take into account) a greater share of the congestion they create than do small airlines, a consequence of th e fact that most of the congestion is self- imposed. As a result, the congestion toll (which charges for uninternalized congestion) can be relatively small for a large airline, with small airlines paying larger tolls. Unfortunately, this asymmetric structure would be politically unpopular, and a more politically palatable uniform toll will distort the traffic levels of the carriers away from the optimum. However, a quantity-based approach, either a slot auction or a trading system with free distribution of slots to the airlines, overcomes these drawbacks (slots confer landing rights at a congested airport). Mathematically, the source of the difference is that, with the total quantity of slots (and thus flights) announced head of time, each carrier views total airport congestion as fixed. As a result, despite use of a uniform price under the auction or trading schemes, traffic is allocated correctly across the 12carriers. The remaining challenge, though, is to choose the total slot quantity correctly, so as to maximize social welfare. Steve Frank a). Biology, information flows from the environment to the genome by the process of natural selection. However, it has not been clear precisely what sort of information metric properly describes natural selection. Here, I show that Fisher information arises as the intrinsic metric of natural selection and evolutionary dynamics. Maximizing the amount of Fisher information about the environment captured by the population leads to Fishers fundamental theorem of natural selection, the most profound statement about how natural selection influences evolutionary dynamics. I also show a relation between Fisher information and Shannon information (entropy) that may help to unify the correspondence between information and dynamics. Finally, I discuss possible connections between the fundamental role of Fisher information in statistics, biology and other fields of science. One interesting aspect of this concerns the relation between dynamics and information. For example, one can think of natural selection as a force, and the resulting change (dynamics) of a population as accumulation of information. People have long recognized this relation, but there has never been a clear formal understanding of this basic issue. Fisher information turns out to be the key, because it relates a force (in statistics a parameter) to an acceleration (in statistics, a second derivative describing the change in a probability distribution). This force-acceleration relation can also be related to dynamics. One can consider three aspects of dynamics: initial condition, outcome, and rules (forces) that determine the change. Classically, one takes the initial conditions and rules as given and deduces the outcome. But one can also take the initial condition and outcome as given, and induce the underlying force--that is, one can take the observed patterns (measured as acceleration) and obtain information about the unobserved force. For more information, see the paper: http://stevefrank.org/abstracts/09JEBftns.html . b). We typically observe large-scale outcomes that arise from the interactions of many hidden, small-scale processes. Examples include age of disease onset, rates of amino acid substitutions, and composition of ecological communities. The macroscopic patterns in each problem often vary around a characteristic shape that can be generated by neutral processes. A neutral generative model assumes that each microscopic process follows unbiased or random stochastic fluctuations: random connections of network nodes; amino acid substitutions with no effect on fitness; species that arise or disappear from communities randomly. These neutral generative models often match common patterns of nature. In this paper, I present the theoretical background by which we can understand why these neutral generative models are so successful. I show where the classic patterns come from, such as the Poisson pattern, the normal or Gaussian pattern, and many others. Each classic pattern was often discovered by a simple neutral generative model. The neutral patterns share a special characteristic: they describe the patterns of nature that follow from simple constraints on information. For example, any aggregation of processes that preserves information only about the mean and variance attracts to the Gaussian pattern; any aggregation that preserves information only about the mean attracts to the exponential pattern; any aggregation that preserves information only about the geometric mean attracts to the power law pattern. I present a simple and consistent informational framework of the common patterns of nature based on the method of maximum entropy. This framework 13shows that each neutral generative model is a special case that helps to discover a particular set of informational constraints; those informational constraints define a much wider domain of non- neutral generative processes that attract to the same neutral pattern. Natalia Komarova With my IMBS colleague K. Jameson I have continued to work on problems of color categorization. We have investigated how realistically-modeled abnormal observers impact population color categorization. We showed that even a small fraction of abnormal observers leads to a strong anchoring of color category boundaries to a subset of locations in the color space. I also worked on mathematical modeling of eavesdropping in nature, and its possible impact on the evolution of language (or animal signaling systems). I also continued to work on mathematical modeling of cancer, focusing in particular on spatial modeling of cellular competition and cooperation, and the role of motility and cooperation in evolution. Another topic of my research has been cross-resistance in leukemia drug treatments. Igor Kopylov Ideas: I have formulated a model that explains why people may be willing to pay for flexibility that they do not plan to use afterwards. For example, there is ample evidence in the literature that people often pay high annual gym membership fees, but then choose not to go to the gym or go very rarely. I argue that such behavior can be rationalized if it is mentally costly for the decision maker to reject a menu that contains a very appealing normative option even if she knows that she will not choose this option because of future temptations. This mental cost can arise because of various emotions, such as guilt, anger, shame etc. In another research paper (joint with Jawwad Noor), I use menus framework to model self-deception that is driven by cravings for future consumption, but also requires a fa\u00e7ade of rationality to disguise itself. One implication of our model is that people may benefit from casino zoning laws and ABC liquor regulation because it can be harder for them to practice self-deception when the vice products (i.e. gambling or liquor) are available, but are provided separately from `innocent' goods (i.e. shows, restaurants, or groceries). Michael McBride With Stergios Skaperdas, I completed a study of an under-explored reason for conflict, namely that conflict arises in the present when it can significantly enhance the bargaining position of the winner. We developed a formal theoretical model of our argument and then conducted a laboratory experiment to test the main predictions of the model. Consistent with our predictions but contrary to standard intuitions, we found that conflict is more likely as likelihood of future periods increases. We plan to build on this in the future. Dale Poirier 14Hal White's 1980 Econometrica paper is the paper most cited by others in peer-reviewed economics literature since 1970. Despite this popularity, its rationale from the Bayesian perspective has been unclear. My paper \"Bayesian Interpretations of Heteroskedastic Consistent Covariance Estimators Using the Informed Bayesian Bootstrap\" aims to fill this noticeable void. Donald Saari Several advances were made. A continuing theme is to extend my earlier results about social choice (i.e., the mathematics of understanding group decision processes such as voting) to other disciplines. As an example, Kenneth Arrow discovered an influential result over 50 years ago showing that it is impossible to create a voting system that satisfies some generally accepted properties. Arrow's result strongly depends on the structure of individual preferences. I discovered how to drop that restriction; as such, the new result is applicable to a wide range of issues in the social and behavioral sciences, engineering, and even physics. (Indeed, these results inspired an approach to examine the question of dark matter; a paper on this topic is currently under review.) Another advance is that I discovered a way to decompose profiles for n-candidate elections into component parts. To explain, for over two centuries, the area of voting theory has discovered all sorts of mysteries and paradoxes. The approach I am creating should completely explain a sizeable portion of these mysteries. Kenneth Small Work with graduate student Kent Hymel and former faculty colleague Kurt Van Dender has disentangled two distinct ways that expanded infrastructure can alter people's amount of motor vehicle travel. One is by giving them more destinations by extending a transportation network; the other is by reducing the congestion they encounter. We have measured both, and shown how the second is a facet of the well-known elasticity of demand for travel, which expresses how responsive travelers are to the cost of travel. Furthermore, we show that all three effects can be measured consistently within a single multi-equation framework. Earlier work with Kurt Van Dender on the \"rebound effect\" in energy policy has played a significant role in guiding the US federal government in setting new fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks. The National Highway Tra ffic Safety Administration issued its proposed rules governing model years 2011-2014, and discussed at length the problem of the \"rebound effect\", namely that by making it cheaper to drive, the new rules may create more travel and thereby undermine some of the energy savings and also create congestion or other adverse spillover effects. However, the empirical findings by Small and Van Dender that the rebound effect is small and declining with income were singled out for special attention, providing an important supporting empirical basis for the regul ations. \"NHTSA tentatively attaches greater significance to studies that allow the rebound effect to vary .... NHTSA also tentatively attaches greater significance to the recent study by Small and Van Dender (2005), which finds that the rebound effect tends to decline...\" (US Federal Register 73(86), p. 24409). 15(b) Public Choice Bernard Grofman Political party competition is a key element of democracy, but how do we measure the competitiveness of an election? The standard answer to this question is to look at the difference between the winner and the loser, with the idea being that smaller this difference the more competitive is the election. That works fine if there is only one position to be filled, but what about contests, such as those in multi-seat proportional representation systems, where multiple candidates are elected at the same time? Previously, the winner versus loser difference was generalized by comparing the vote share of the lowest scoring winner with the vote share of the highest scoring loser, but that solution has a num ber of problems. In a forthcoming paper in Electoral Studies, my co-author and I offer a way to better measure of political competitiveness that satisfies a number of desirable normative properties, including being identical to the standard measure when there is only one seat to be filled. Anthony McGann In articles published this year, I demonstrate that the liberal conception of political equality (treating all individual voters equally) logically implies proportional representation in legislative elections. Thus the case for proportional representation does not rest on any idea of group fairness, but rather on the far more fundame ntal idea that individuals be treated equally. This contradicts the basis for at least one significant US Supreme Court finding (Vieth vs. Jubilirer 2004). (c) Social Networks Andrew Noymer I work on the area where two complex systems interface: Epidemiology. While work on the spread of diseases is now a well-elaborated sub-field of mathematical biology, the complex social system also affects who gets diseas es, when, and with what severity. As a sociologist/demographer, I work mostly on social and historical epidemiology, though some of my work straddles this area and methodological and modeling concerns. I continue to do much work on influenza pandemics, the subject of my PhD dissertation (2006). The impact of pandemics is socially-mediated: in 1918, my work shows that the subsequent epidemiology of tuberculosis was affected by the pandemic. This points to a disproportionate impact on the tuberculous (disproportionately, then as now, a poor group) by the influenza pandemic. It remains to be seen if the current influenza pandemic (SO-A/H1N1) will show a similar pattern, a question to which I am paying close attention as this pandemic unfolds in real time. Douglas White In a series of articles in kinship groups and organizations over time, and at the historical dynamics of monetized commodity exchange, cities, states and empires, the empirical data on dynamics points to distinct types of metastable dynamics in the various systems based pon monetized commodity exchange, i.e., characterized by partially coordinated tendencies (not 16states) in which individual coordinating elements are neither completely independent of each other (locally segregated) nor fully linked in a fixed mutual relationship (globally integrated). These are characterized by fluctuations of vary ing periodicities, depending on scale. Our recent publications on economic networks (Science, SFI Working paper) start to show how our group is studying these phenomena dynamically. Without monetized commodity exchange social dynamics often has different dynamical tendencies. E. Research Seminars and Activities The research activities of the Institute members often result in graduate research seminars. Among those this year were: Mathematical Models of Cognitive Processes [Batchelder] Stochastic Processes BCIs [Grofman] Mind-body problem [Hoffman] Face Perception [Hoffman] Introduction to Game Theory [Kaminski] Public Choice I [Kaminski] Decision Theory [Keller] Decision Analysis [Keller] Experimental Learning class, (technical advisor), FTMBA field study team with Hoag Hospital for Business Plan for Mary and Dick Allen Diabetes Center [Keller] Probability Seminar [Komarova] Bayesian Cognitive Modeling Narens, and Models [Saari, Narens] Signaling Seminar, Stanford [Skyrms] Colloquium in Transportation Science [Small] Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning [Smyth] Human Social Complexity [White] Equisalience Function Analysis [Wright] EVOLUTION OF SIGNALING SYSTEMS Kimberly Jameson (Project Scientist, IMBS), Natalia Komarova (Mathematics), Louis Narens (Cognitive Sciences), and Ragnar Steingrimsson (Project Scientist, IMBS) formed a group doing research in the evolution of psychological categories, with special emphasis on the evolution of color naming (signaling) systems from the point of view of culture, cognition, and artificial intelligence. In Fall 2007 this subgroup received a $410,000 grant from NSF (Komarova, PI) to fund this research. The primary aims of this research are summarized as follows: A longstanding issue in the humanities and sciences is distinguishing aspects of human behavior that are primarily biological from those that are primarily social or cultural. One issue with a long history 17of scientific investigation involving the fields of physiology, linguistics, psychology, anthropology, and more recently genetics, is color categorization and naming. In this area the issue is whether universal tendencies exist in the ways different linguistic societies categorize and name perceptual color experiences. The most popular view in the empirical literature on color categorization and naming is that the commonalities of color categorization across individuals and cultures are largely explained by two factors: (i) physiological features of human perceptual color processing, and (ii) universal features of individual psychological processing believed to underlie color experience. The established position in the area is a strong form of this universalist view that asserts that the pan-human uniformity in human visual processing gives rise to a regular, if not uniform, pan-human phenomenological color experience, and that this regularity is the basis for the empirically observed regularity in color categorization across cultures. The extreme form of the alternative view to this established position in the literature is a relativist one that asserts that very little in the way of \"universal tendencies\" exist, and that most of the \"universalist\" findings in the literature are more attributable to constraints imposed by the empirical assessment of the phenomena than they are to actual features of color categorization phenomena. And of course there are other positions that blend the universalist and relativist ones. Various languages have different color naming systems. In a few of these, i.e., those with a long tradition of writing, the evolution of a color naming system can be traced through historical, linguistic, and anthropological analyses, for example the evolution of color terms from Homeric Greek (which had only color words only for black, white, a red-purple color, and a green-yellow color) to modern Greek. The data for such analyses is obviously weak compared to experimental data where a individuals from a populations is asked to name, as in the World Color Survey of 110 non-industrialized ethnolingusitic societies, about 400 carefully chosen color chips, and for each name to produce a chip that best exemplifies that name. However, such experimental data only shows the current state of a long evolutionary process of a given language, and across languages, the states along the evolutionary trajectory may differ. Drs. Komarova, Jameson, Steingrimsson, and Narens saw that they could apply evolutionary game theory to explain the regularities observed in color naming across the societies in the World Color Survey, as well as provide an evolutionary theory -- supported by mathematical theory and computer simulations -- explaining why these regularities came about. Unlike the established position regarding color categorization and nami ng, Drs. Komarova, Jameson, Steingrimsson, and Narens approach emphasizes individual differences in color perception, pragmatic influences, and efficiency of communication, instead of universal color perception determined by a pan--human biology, and their research involves a formal mathematical presentation of their ideas with theorems and simulations to validate their conclusions. The ultimate goal of their research is to explain experimental regularities found in over 100 years of experimental cross-cultural studies of color naming. The described research has also been enriched by conferences and seminars on evolutionary game theory sponsored by the Institute, Drs. Komarova of Mathematics, Jameson and Steingrimsson of IMBS, and Narens of Cognitive Sciences. This NSF funded research project has also given rise to a new IMBS Cognition and Color Critical Science Reading Group that focuses on the presentation and discussion of cutting-edge research in the area of, and areas directly related to, the NSF funded research. The group consists of a 18regular contingent of attendees comprised of Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences Faculty, Emeritus Social Sciences Faculty, Cognitive Sciences Faculty; Logic and Philosophy of Science Faculty; Faculty from the Philosophy Department at Cal State University Long Beach; and several UC Irvine graduate student attendees. This reading group has thus far been the source of numerous research presentations relevant to the research project, and has generally contributed to a broader understanding of modeling and empirical challenges relevant to the area. The group meetings have also fostered the general dissemination of research in the area, and have served as a regular educational resource for this research topic that is not otherwise locally available. The group's websites containing content used during the funding period are available online. New seminar schedules for the 2008-2009 funding period are found at: Spring 2009: http://aris.ss.uci.edu/~kjameson/ColorCog.html Winter 2009: http://aris.ss.uci.edu/~kjameson/ColorCogWINTER2009.html Fall 2008: http://aris.ss.uci.edu/~kjameson/ColorCogFALL2008.html SOCIAL NETWORKS RESEARCH GROUP The objective of the UCI Social Network Research Group is to: provide an informal setting for discussion of current and ongoing network-related research at UCI (and elsewhere); facilitate the exchange of information regarding new techniques, tools, data sources, and research findings; support graduate student training in the network field; and encourage collaboration among faculty and students on network-related topics. The Social Network Research Group is organized and run by IMBS member Carter Butts, with participation by a number of other IMBS faculty (John Boyd, Katie Faust, Lin Freeman, Kim Romney, Doug White, and Andrew Noymer). During the 2008-2009 academic year the group met weekly to discuss ongoing research on wide range of topics related to modeling complex relational data structures and processes. In addition to open discussions, the following research presentations were given this year: Focused Discussion: Time Scales in Relational Processes Political Community and Mutual Trust Between EU Nations [Ryan Acton] Relational Event Models for Email Networks [Chris DuBois] Patterns of Coordination: Brokerage Roles in the Immediate Wake of Hurricane Katrina [Emma Spiro] Relational Aspects of Time Use Data [Chris Marcum] Update on Triad Research [Katie Faust] The Responder Improvisation Data Set - A First Look [Lorien Jasny] Large-scale Spatially Embedded Networks from GIS Data [Carter Butts, Ryan Acton, and John Hipp] Brokerage in the Wake of Hurricane Katrina [Emma Spiro] 19 A Sneak Peek at the Spatial Networks Project [Carter Butts and John Hipp] Networks of Trust [Stewart Gordon] Dynamic Modeling of Organizational Coordination over the Course of the Katrina Disaster [Zack Almquist] Geography and Meeting Co-Attendance [Adam Boessen] Residential Settlement Models [Miruna Petrescu-Prahova] Cigarette Smoking Among Adolescents: Social Networks, the Neighborhood, and the Role of Social Support [Cynthia Lakon] Previews of presentations for the Sunbelt Conference Almquist, Samantha Acton] ERG Parameterization from Potential Games [Carter Butts] The Intellectual History of SNA [Lin Freeman] New Methods for Studying Core-Periphery Structure [John Boyd] Entailment Relations in Political Participation [Lorien Brokerage as Process Rather than Structure [David Obstfeld] Sunbelt Abstract Presentations - abstracts presented for discussion by the group! The Mentorship Tie: Sources and Implicati ons for Economic Life [Denis Trapido] SOCIAL DYNAMICS AND COMPLEXITY RESEARCH GROUP GOALS. The disciplinary goals of SD&C are eclectic, that is transdisciplinary, with an aim to (a) expand the anthropological sciences, network economics, political economy, network sociology, and historical dynamics, (b) reconfigure comparative social science within the context of modern network autocorrelation and autoregressive studies, (c) continue helping to introduce complexity sciences, dynamics and network sciences into the social science disciplines generally. The educational goals are to spawn a variety of new open source open data open instruction modules for the types of work done within our network of scientific collaborators as a publically available means of instruction in theoretical and methodological advances in the social sciences. The research goals are to continue to advance along these interdisciplinary frontiers. These goals are advanced with cost-free open access eJournals and ePublication wikiMedia in which we have pioneered. These also allow young scientists access to peer review publication and allow all contributors to benefit, including learning facilities for the retooling of skill sets, software usage, and improvement of data sets (e.g., through imputation of missing data). UC-WIDE FACULTY AFFILIATES in Anthropology except for Maoz (Political Science). In addition to our UCI members and affiliates, our intercampus affiliates serve as editors for our journals and mediawikis, suggest speakers, and provide vital linkages to programs on other campuses with similar goals. Especially important in this regard is our long-term linkage and collaboration with the UCLA Human Complex Systems instructional and research programs headed by Professor Dwight Read. Our broader-range affiliates include European and Asian networks and complexity centers and researchers. 20ACTIVITIES. In the current year, core members of our faculty have contributed articles to the Sage Handbook of Social Networks, Blackwell Companion to Cognitive Anthropology, Springer Encyclopedia of Complexity and Systems Science, Springer Methodos Series, and Science Magazine \"Perspectives.\" Members of the program have submitted a new NSF grant (Bell and White), produced two and sponsored three other eJournal issues in the UC eScholarship Repository, the latter a new eJournal supervised under SD&C/IMBS auspices. Doug White completed a 3-year ANR (French NSF) grant with a final conference at the new Branly Museum of Anthropology, and published datasets in the new British KINSOURCE eRepository for network data resulting from this project. Douglas White and Katie Faust joined other UC faculty (Davis, San Diego, Irvine, Berkeley) in submitting to UCOP a proposal for an intercampus center for Network Sciences. White participated in the founding of a Network Sciences center at Central European University, Budapest, and helped found their new networks and complexity emphasis and summer school in the School of Public Policy and Administration, Xi'an Jiaotong University. A survey of all members and our affiliates would show a wide variety of other contributions. One collaboration in particular, anthropologist Bonnie Na rdi in Computer Science, with her Bren ICS student Yong Ming Kow, did a study of MODDing behavior in the gaming user community (i.e., modification of game options) that inspired the name one of our new projects this year, EduModd. EduMODD is our newest experimental site to be unveiled in July 2009 as an enhanced and reedited subset of InterSciWiki. Doug White and his students discovered in live and computer interactive courses using InterSciWiki instructions that students could easily do complex analyses using open source R software with internal url links to our on-line datasets. They could follow and MODDify prototypes (see MODDing above) to get new scientific results for quantitative models and visualizations. Examples including fitting complex functions to distributions, analysis, display and simulation with kinship or social networks, autoregressive analysis comparative data in spreadsheet formats for R along with network matrices of real-world interdependencies, and a host of other problems (see items 1-13 above and consult the wiki for faculty and student contributors). We have sent a modding site experiment to our Chinese colleagues at Xi'an Jiaotong technical university for their use with their graduate students. Papers by our own students using these approaches will appear as academic research publications in one of our eJournals following our review and revision processes. Special funding from a non-profit corporation pr ovided financial support for the following four programs: SD&C grad student training, intercampus videoconference seminars and our two eJournals, and also for faculty and student research travel. Support monies, however, go a very long way compared to normal university expenditures because most of our implementations use open and publically available resources and low demands for labor (e.g., proof editing), supplies, equipment, and administration. More money goes directly into student training. Next year additional funding will go into EduModd documentation and 5-minute Educational YouTube editing by Career Center undergraduates.

GRADUATE TRAINING A. Ph.D. and M.A. Students Louis Narens is the Director of the MBS graduate program. Others on the graduate committee who assist Professor Narens are Professors Marek Kaminski and Michael McBride. Working with the faculty of the Institute are 50 Ph.D. students, 16 of whom have advanced to candidacy during the year. They are listed in Appendix F. Of these, the following students were enrolled in the Ph.D. program in Mathematical Behavioral Sciences during the current academic year: Kalin Agrawal Matthew Feldman Dan Jessie Ray Mendoza Laurent Tambayong Sam Thorpe Two new students, Thomas McIntee and Heidi Tucholski, will be entering the program in fall. Besides the students in our program, there are students who are closely affiliated with IMBS and who actively engage in our seminars, colloquia, and conferences. Some of these students are: Jay Simon and Ofer Mintz (Merag e School of Business), Rory Smead and Elliott Wagner (Logic and Philosophy of Science), Reuben Kline and Daniel Wolf (Political Science), and Matthew Zeigenfuse (Cognitive Science). 22 During the year, the Institute continued a program of recruiting graduate students via a mass e-mail describing our program to the Chairs and key faculty of the major colleges and universities in the country. Insofar as the Institute's budget allows, students in MBS as well as other students whose research relates to MBS are awarded summer stipends. Due to budget cuts, this year the IMBS awarded funds to its graduate students only. We hope to continue the tradition of awarding funds to other mbs-related students in the future. A condition of the support is that the student gives a talk during the academic year on their research. This year it was decided to host a \"poster session\" rather than a one-day conference. The idea was that faculty and students could informally view the poster and talk with the student about their research. Below is the list of the15 students who received support in summer of 2008 and the topics of their poster: 2008 Graduate Poster Session Dan Jessie - Possible new mathematical techniques in the analysis of problems in the social sciences Reuben Kline - Exploring the nature of the banks set using CyberSenate Brian Marion - Investigating issues of percepti on and the evolution of sensory and perceptual systems Ofer Mintz - Modeling the propensity to buy of online consumers Ray Mendoza - From syntax to semantics Brendan Purdy - Multinomial Tree Processing Jay Simon - Multi-attribute utility applications Rory Smead - Adaptive strategies and the social sciences Laurent Tambayong - Dynamics of network formation processes in the co-author model Sam Thorpe - \"Physiological models to explain brain dynamics Elliott Wagner - Signaling on networks Matt Zeigenfuse - Modeling individual differences in memory retention via Dirichlet process mixtures Yitong Wang - A behavioral model of consumption under anticipated health and income risks Dan Wolf - Political economy and comparative politics Sunan Zhang - Understanding human performance on bandit problems B. Graduate Advisory Council Council Members: Rory Smead - LPS Sam Thorpe - IMBS This is the fifth year since the formation of the IMBS Graduate Advisory Council. The Council's purpose is to foster interaction between graduate students in research areas similar to MBS. This past year the IMBS Graduate Council organized student meetings with colloquia speakers. This gave students an opportunity to in teract and network with professors. One of the goals of the graduate council is to gain some insight into how students perceive IMBS and how to facilitate more involvement of the social science student body. The Council also held a 23student/faculty barbeque on May 29 and cooperated with other graduate students in putting on the 7th Annual Graduate Student Conference. Below is the conference agenda: 7th ANNUAL GRADUATE STUDENT CONFERENCE (9:00am) Opening Remarks (9:15am) Ofer Mintz (with Imran S. Currim and Ivan Jeliazkov), Marketing, \"Consumer pattern of information search and propensity to buy in a field setting\" (9:45am) George Ng, Bennett Holman, Logic and Philosophy of Science, \"Controlling for Expectation in Evidence Based Medicine\" (11:00am) Jonathan Cook, Economics, \"Implementing the Best Public Health Money Can Buy\" (11:30am) Tim Rubin, Cognitive Sciences, \"Modeling Movie Choices and Ratings\" (12:00pm) Break for Lunch (1:00pm) Giorgio Gosti, Institute for Mathemati cal Behavioral Sciences, \"Solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems using an Argumentation Game Algorithm\" (1:30pm) Rueben Kline (with Bernard Grofman, James Fowler, Natalie Masuoka and Scott L.

Undergraduate Training The firm of Sanli Pastore & Hill, located in Los Angeles, has given a gift to the IMBS to support undergraduate students in Economics. The company is a business valuation, financial 24analysis and litigation consulting firm. The gift is for five years and is divided in two parts: one for a summer internship and one for a paper award in economics. The internship is for eight weeks and this year's intern will be Susan Weinfurther, an undergraduate student in Economics. Last year's intern was economics undergraduate student Patrick Banks. This year's first-place winner for the \"Excellence in Economics Writing\" award was James Bono and he received $500. The title of his paper was, \"Coral Games and the Core of Cores\". Second and third place winners were Hao Jia, whose paper was titled. \"An Empirical Study of Contest Success and functions: Evidence from the NBA\", and Vivek Pai, \"On the Factors that Affect Airline Flight Frequency and aircraft Size\". IV. COMMUNICATION A. Conferences The IMBS held conferences on various topics. Below are the conference agendas.
