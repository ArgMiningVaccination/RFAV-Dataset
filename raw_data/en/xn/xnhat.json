Spiritual care can address spiritual or religious needs during treatment. Spiritual needs may include unresolved life questions, such as how a patient should make sense of their mental health situation or how they define good and bad. Or, a person may be looking for the continued sense of hope and community offered by their religion, which spiritual care can offer. While in our care, patients have access to the following resources, depending on their treatment goals, program, and medical status, and location: - Spiritual care reflection groups - One-on-one consultations with a chaplain - Chapel, including a spiritual resource library (West Allis, Brown Deer, and chapel coming soon to Oconomowoc) - On site ecumenical worship services (Ash Wednesday, Good Friday, Easter, Christmas) - Transportation to churches for worship (in selected programs and not occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic) - On site one-on-one sessions with community clergy (not occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic) Each member of the spiritual care team has advanced training, preparing them to use an inclusive approach in meeting patients, wherever that may be, on their spiritual path. Our spiritual care department is funded entirely by the [Rogers Behavioral Health Foundation](https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Frogershospitalfoundation.org%2F&data=02%7C01%7CHaley.Kloss%40rogersbh.org%7C1b429661aadc46b6201f08d7e08b846b%7Cd2ad4f331a7a4f81b69f497f7b3e308b%7C0%7C0%7C637224762132980021&sdata=OQDmLGXW2rQO3q7aJXjxcJ6amMT4qss1DSQjhMhJU4o%3D&reserved=0).
