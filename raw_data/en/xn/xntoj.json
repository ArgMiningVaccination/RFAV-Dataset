They are used as a highly efficient vaccine platform to enhance immunogenicity and effectively stimulate the innate and adaptive immune response. Compared with traditional vaccines, phage-based vaccines offer thermodynamic stability, biocompatibility, homogeneity, high carrying capacity, self-assembly, scalability, and low toxicity. This review summarizes recent research on phage-based vaccines in virus prevention. In addition, the expression systems of filamentous phage-based virus vaccines and their application principles are discussed. Moreover, the prospect of the prevention of emerging infectious diseases, such as coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), is also discussed. - This article is part of the themed "}
