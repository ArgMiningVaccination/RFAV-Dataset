It can be a natural but effective alternative to prescription medications. It is best to consult a naturopathic physician for advice on taking herbal medicines in combination with prescription medications because of herb-drug interactions. We help many of our patients wean off their prescriptions safely using herbs so they can minimize the number of pills they have to take. This appeals to so many of our patients because it dramatically lessens the side effects they are experiencing and decreases the threat of damage to the liver and kidneys. It is estimated that 80% of people worldwide rely on herbal medicine as part of their primary healthcare. It can be used for many common health conditions. In fact, one herb can have multiple benefits for the body and herbs used in combinations are powerful. We have in our dispensary a variety of herbal medicines such as teas, tinctures, liquid plant extracts, powders, herbal capsules and topical treatments for the skin. "}
