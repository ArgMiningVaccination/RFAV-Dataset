[[1]] Many religions have [narratives](/wiki/Mythology), [symbols](/wiki/Symbol), [traditions](/wiki/Tradition) and [sacred histories](/wiki/Sacred_history) that are intended to give [meaning to life](/wiki/Meaning_of_life) or to explain the [origin of life](/wiki/Origin_of_life) or the universe. They tend to derive [morality](/wiki/Morality), [ethics](/wiki/Ethics), [religious laws](/wiki/Religious_law), or a preferred [lifestyle](/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)) from their ideas about the [cosmos](/wiki/Cosmos) and [human nature](/wiki/Human_nature). According to some estimates, there are roughly 4,200 religions, churches, denominations, religious bodies, faith groups, [tribes](/wiki/Tribe), [cultures](/wiki/Culture), movements, ultimate concerns, which at some point in the future will be countless. [[2]](#cite_note-2) The word religion is sometimes used interchangeably with the words \" [faith](/wiki/Faith)\" or \"belief system\", but religion differs from private belief in that it has a public aspect. Most religions have organized [behaviours](/wiki/Religious_behaviour), including [clerical hierarchies](/wiki/Clergy), a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership, [congregations](/wiki/Church_(congregation)) of [laity](/wiki/Laity), regular meetings or services for the purposes of [veneration](/wiki/Veneration) of a [deity](/wiki/Deity) or for [prayer](/wiki/Prayer), [holy places](/wiki/Shrine) (either natural or architectural) or [religious texts](/wiki/Religious_text). Certain religions also have a [sacred language](/wiki/Sacred_language) often used in [liturgical](/wiki/Liturgy) services. The practice of a religion may also include [sermons](/wiki/Sermon), commemoration of the activities of a aspects of human culture. Religious beliefs have also been used to explain [parapsychological](/wiki/Parapsychology) [phenomena](/wiki/Phenomena) such as [out-of-body experiences](/wiki/Out-of-body_experience), [near-death experiences. [[3]](#cite_note-3) [[4]](#cite_note-4) Some academics [studying the have divided religions into three broad categories: [world religions](/wiki/Major_religious_groups), a term which refers to [transcultural](/wiki/Transculturation), international [Indigenous religions](/wiki/Ethnic_religion), which refers to nation-specific religious groups; and [new religious movements](/wiki/New_religious_movement), which refers to recently developed faiths. [[5]](#cite_note-5) One modern academic theory of religion, [social constructionism](/wiki/Social_constructionism), says that religion is a modern concept that suggests all [spiritual](/wiki/Spirituality) practice and [worship](/wiki/Worship) follows a model similar to the [Abrahamic religions](/wiki/Abrahamic_religions) as an orientation system that helps to interpret reality and define human beings, [[6]](#cite_note-6) and thus believes that religion, as a concept, has been [applied inappropriately](/wiki/Reification_(fallacy)) to non-Western cultures that are not based upon such systems, or in which these systems are a substantially simpler construct.
