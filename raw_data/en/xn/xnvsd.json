The clinic, which CAMH hopes to hold on a regular basis, was a collaborative effort. [Adult Neurodevelopment Services](/en/your-care/programs-and-services/adult-neurodevelopmental-services) clinicians knew that existing hospital and community-based clinics would not be accessible for some of their clients, and [Azrieli Adult Neurodevelopmental Centre](/en/science-and-research/institutes-and-centres/azrieli-adult-neurodevelopmental-centre) researchers had been studying and developing resources to support accessible vaccinations for this often forgotten group. When the provincial government included adults with developmental disabilities in the high-risk category for phase two of the vaccine rollout, CAMH put the gears in motion, initiating a plan that included proactively reaching out to Adult Neurodevelopmental Services clients and their caregivers.
