PRELUDE: My players encountered an Aboleth and one has been infected with the disease. This disease requires a Heal spell or an equivalent of 6th level or higher to cure. They will need to climb out of the dungeon ( I looked at the heal spell and it has no component costs. Finding a sufficiently potent cleric in this city won't be hard (arguably not every member of the clergy will be a cleric, but still), and coming up with a reason not to heal a party of adventurers providing a public service cleaning out this dungeon. So, I can force the cost of the temple service to be Spell_Level\u00b2*10 (360 gold in this case), but they will inevitably argue that they're performing good works and such. My first argument would be that maintaining the temples and such requires money and this is one avenue for that. The adventures went in under their own volition and the cleric is not responsible for restoring diseases-afflicted or wound-inflicted adventurers. This seems short-sighted. Not having adventurers constantly harrying these forces and exploring dangerous places would cause civilization to contract a bit. 2nd argument would simply be economics. The supply of clerics at this potency is limited and they are constantly taxed to the limit. However, this would cause those organizations to be [SWIMMING](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15pyN4Xa14njQ7NjQWOTfwtl4kEOKjkLrqu6BfJKDhdQ/edit?usp=sharing)1 in money. If I said there is a wait list. This implies that the cleric's 6th level slots are scheduled for X amount of days. Each day,even if I only take the minimum possible of 1 spell slot at 6th level and no higher, that cleric would be making an absurd amount of money either for themself or for the religion. This has the secondary effect of incentivizing every cleric over the level of 4 in a party to just set up shop in a sufficiently large town/city. This setup seems ludicrous. Only the incredibly rich could afford these luxuries, and their needs wouldn't tap all the potential clerics. Supply would be greater than demand, and prices would fall. 3rd argument is quid pro quo. \"Go get me a special herb to brew in my tea and I'll heal you.\" I'm not against this, but not for this adventure, and they could simply walk down the street to find another healer. So, I need some advice here. I could hand wave and say \"well... clerics are very rare and only 1 in 100 (pick any number really) staff in a religion are clerics.\" This feels disingenuous to the setting. Religion is D&D isn't so much belief or faith based as evidence based. So, powerful religions would have lots of demonstrations of power. While perhaps magic isn't high, it's certainly not low. D&D is lousy with magic. This is simply my own opinion, not backed up by extensive lore knowledge. MEAT: Alright now, all that to get to this: It costs only spell slots to cast cure wounds, lesser restoration, purify food and drink, create food and water, etc. (Now that I look through the cleric spells, many of them do not consume components). Why aren't the do-gooder clerics running around doing this all the time? -Poor/hungry/famine problem? Create Food and Drink. -Plague? Probably can use lesser restoration (not all the time). Purify food and drink (this is a ritual without any real cost aside from time). -Drought? Create water (a lot, admittedly, but it would keep a township from passing) or a spell I recently gained some appreciation for Control Water. Certainly, neutral or evil clerics wouldn't necessarily have the incentives to run around dropping regenerate on people, but I can make an argument that good publicity for an evil cleric is still furthering is end goals. Look at any public figure. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS: I'm not factoring in ANY of the other spell casters. The main reason is clerics are generally seen as the \"help people\" profession. Other classes are equipped to handle some of these issues, but don't generally have the organizations in place to do so. TL;DR: Why don't clerics walk around healing people for free or very low cost? It costs them spells slots and time. GOOD alignment is fundamentally selfless and pro-society. 1 A quick spreadsheet to see how much they could earn, super simple. Didn't consider component cost, only level of spell. Recommended services cost is Spell_Level\u00b2*10+2*Consume_Comp_Cost+0.1*Fixed_Comp_Cost EDIT1: The major argument presented seems to distill into how rare are clerics and how rare are high level clerics. There are some tangentially associated arguments of \"why would they hand around temples\", but this seems handwavey to me. Why would they leave? If you argument is \"because deity told them to leave\", mine is "}
