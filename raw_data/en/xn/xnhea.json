And then in late September she promptly changed her mind. \"I wasn't going to get it and then one of my friends caught COVID-19 and they had a really bad time ... they still have symptoms months later,\" she said. \"Then I found out people who aren't vaccinated can't go out, and, I thought, that's it. I'll have to pull the plug.\" In the end, the 26 year-old from Prairiewood, in Sydney's south-west, said it was \"pretty exciting\" to receive her first Pfizer dose. \"I thought it was probably best... I live with my 87-year-old grandmother. So I know I am also protecting her.\" NSW needs to convince about 84,000 more people to come forward for a COVID-19 vaccine to hit its 95 per cent inoculation target. COVID-19 vaccination coverage in people aged 16 and over in NSW was at 93.7 per cent first dose and 88.7 per cent second dose by the end of Tuesday. About 412,000 people aged 16 and over in NSW were yet to receive their first dose. For the state to hit 95 per cent vaccination coverage, that number needs to drop to about 328,000 people - provided everyone who has a first dose has a second. On Wednesday, high-vis wearing attendants outnumbered the slow stream of people arriving for their jab at Sydney Olympic Park. It was in stark contrast to the four-hour queues and scarce appointments in August when the hub was vaccinating thousands each day. Anna Brazier, 24, said she held out because of illness during pregnancy and the few COVID-19 cases in Cherrybrook in the highly vaccinated Hills District where she lives meant she was \"less exposed\". \"I'm not anti-vax ... I just felt I wasn't going out to work, I was staying at home and I didn't live in areas that had really high cases ... so I waited.\" Vaccination with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines is strongly recommended during pregnancy due to the severity of COVID-19 for pregnant women. Administrative hurdles, difficulty using booking systems and health concerns prevented Lianggang Lou, 61, a temporary visa-holder, from having her jab earlier. \"It is just a relief to finally get it done,\" she said as she arrived at the vaccine hub before receiving her first Moderna shot. Each weekday, between 4000 and 5000 people aged 16 and over in NSW receive a first dose. In Sydney's south-west, thousands received first shots last week as health authorities urged recovered cases to not delay their vaccine, even though they would be [exempt from mandates for six months](/link/follow-20170101-p58ugc). There were more than 1500 first doses administered in the Canterbury-Bankstown local government area, about 960 in Cumberland and more than 880 in Liverpool. More than 900 residents of the City of Sydney, which has the city's lowest reported rate, had their first vaccine last week. Vaccination rates in people aged in their 20s continue to lag the rest of the state's adult population. By Tuesday, fewer than 87 per cent of people in the age group had received a first shot. Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said she wanted to make sure no one was \"left behind\" in the vaccine rollout. \"There is a significant group of the population that is still yet to be afforded the protection of vaccines,\" she said. In her Glebe practice, NSW chair of the Royal Australian College of GPs Charlotte Hespe's conversations with hesitant patients are much the same as those in July, but there is an additional element - pride. \"Over time they've been convinced the safety of the vaccine is OK, plus the majority have had access to whichever vaccine they want,\" Dr Hespe said. \"But for some people it's just being able to move off that 'I'm not going to' attitude - it's a pride thing, if you've made a big deal of not getting it.\" Although routine childhood vaccination rates in NSW have reached 95 per cent, experts said the reasons adults were resistant to getting COVID-19 vaccines were often different to those of anti-vaccination parents. \"There are lots of common denominators: perceptions of risk, perceptions of safety, concerns around side effects,\" said Associate Professor Holly Seale, a vaccine communications researcher at UNSW. However, while vaccine-resistant parents may express concern about combination shots and their child's immune system being \"overloaded\", for people who are hesitant to get the COVID-19 vaccine, the immunity argument takes a different form: a belief they have a good enough immune system to \"fight\" the virus. \"That is something we hear when the influenza shot comes around each year, too,\" Dr Seale said noting, conversely, for young healthy adults one of the strongest drivers to receive a flu or COVID-19 vaccine was protecting people more vulnerable than themselves. Julie Leask, a University of Sydney professor and adviser to the World Health Organisation on vaccination uptake, said both childhood and COVID-19 vaccine refusal were somewhat matters of personal ideology, although childhood shots, seen as traditional and a rite of passage, were less politicised. Professor Leask said the boundary between people hesitant and those refusing vaccination was \"definitely blurred\". \"With a new vaccine, these categories do not depict how people will be for life - people can change their views,\" she said, expressing optimism the state could hit 95 per cent coverage. Dr Seale agreed, noting she was still encountering people who [incorrectly believed all vaccines came with blood clot risks](/link/follow-20170101-p58ju9), or that pregnant women could not get any available shot. Although the state's reopening targets have been tied to the 16 and over population, there is concern about stalling numbers in the 12- to 15-year-old age group, where 79.6 per cent of children have received a first dose. \"Stubbornly we are seeing this taper off around that 80 per cent first dose level,\" Dr Chant warned. Data released by the federal government last week showed that while [some areas of Sydney have first-dose vaccination coverage of more than 90 per cent](/link/follow-20170101-p593z8) in the younger age group, others were fewer than two-thirds.
