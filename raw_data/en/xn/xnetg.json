Screening With the Papanicolaou (Pap) Test: Benefits Based on solid evidence, regular screening for cervical cancer with the Pap test in an appropriate population of women reduces mortality from cervical cancer. The benefits of screening women younger than 21 years are small because of the low prevalence of lesions that will progress to invasive cancer. Screening is not beneficial in women older than 65 years if they have had a recent history of negative test results.[ Magnitude of Effect: Regular Pap screening decreases cervix cancer incidence and mortality by at least 80%. Pap Test: Harms Based on solid evidence, regular screening with the Pap test leads to additional diagnostic procedures (e.g., colposcopy) and possible overtreatment for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs). These harms are greatest for younger women, who have a higher prevalence of LSILs, lesions that often regress without treatment. Harms are also increased in younger women because they have a higher rate of false-positive results. Excisional procedures to treat preinvasive disease has been associated with increased risk of long-term consequences for fertility and pregnancy.[ Magnitude of Effect: Additional diagnostic procedures were performed in 50% of women undergoing regular Pap testing. Approximately 5% were treated for LSILs. The number of women with impaired fertility and pregnancy complications is unknown. |Study Design: Evidence obtained (HPV) DNA Test: Benefits Based on solid evidence, screening with an HPV DNA or HPV RNA test detects high-grade cervical dysplasia, a precursor lesion for cervical cancer. Additional clinical trials show that HPV testing is superior to other cervical cancer screening strategies. In April 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved an HPV DNA test that can be used alone for the primary screening of cervical cancer risk in women aged 25 years and older.[ Magnitude of Effect: In one prospective, clustered, randomized trial, HPV testing was superior to other strategies for preventing cervical cancer mortality.[ |Study Test: Harms Based on solid evidence, HPV testing identifies numerous infections that will not lead to cervical dysplasia or cervical cancer. This is especially true in women younger than 30 years, in whom rates of HPV infection may be higher. Magnitude of Effect: In one study, 86.7% of women with a positive HPV test did not develop cervical cancer or related premalignant disease after more than a decade of Test and the HPV DNA Test (Cotesting): Benefits Based on solid evidence, screening every 5 years with the Pap test and the HPV DNA test (cotesting) in women aged 30 years and older is more sensitive in detecting cervical abnormalities, compared with the Pap test alone. Screening with the Pap test and HPV DNA test reduces the incidence of cervical cancer.[ Magnitude of Effect: HPV-based screening provides 60% to 70% greater protection against Test and the HPV DNA Test (Cotesting): Harms Based on solid evidence, HPV and Pap cotesting is associated with more false-positives than is the Pap test alone. Abnormal test results can lead to more frequent testing and invasive diagnostic procedures.[ Magnitude of Effect: The percentage of U.S. women undergoing cotesting who will have a normal cytology test result and a positive HPV test result (and who will therefore require additional testing) ranges from 11% among women aged 30 to 34 years to 2.6% among women aged 60 Without a Cervix Based on solid evidence, screening is not helpful in women who do not have a cervix as a result of a hysterectomy for a benign condition. Magnitude of Effect: Among women without cervices, fewer than 1 per 1,000 had abnormal Pap test results. |Study Design: Evidence obtained from States in 2023, it is estimated that 13,960 cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed and that 4,310 women will die of the disease.[ Invasive squamous carcinoma of the cervix results from the progression of preinvasive precursor lesions called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), or dysplasia. CIN is histologically graded into mild dysplasia (CIN 1), moderate dysplasia (CIN 2), or severe dysplasia (CIN 3). Not all of these lesions progress to invasive cancer; many mild and moderate lesions regress. A further categorization, the Bethesda system, is based on cytologic findings: atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs), squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs), primarily CIN 2-3 plus carcinoma in situ.[ The rate at which invasive cancer develops from CIN is usually slow, measured in years and perhaps decades.[ Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an oncogenic virus and the etiologic agent of cervical cancer and related premalignant disease. HPV is transmitted by sexual contact. Sexually inactive women rarely develop cervical cancer, while sexual activity at an early age with multiple sexual partners is a strong risk factor.[ Although cervical cancer mortality increases with age,[ Historically, cervical cancer mortality rates were substantially higher (twice as high or more) in Black women than in White women younger than 50 years; however, recent (2016-2020) rates have been only modestly (12%) higher in Black women than in White women in this age group. Among women older than 60 years, cervical cancer mortality rates have historically been up to three times as high for Black women than for White women; recent (2016-2020) rates are still almost twice as high in Black women than in White women.[ References: The Papanicolaou (Pap) test has never been examined in a randomized controlled trial. A large body of consistent observational data, however, supports its effectiveness in reducing mortality from cervical cancer. Both incidence and mortality from cervical cancer have sharply decreased in a number of large populations after the introduction of well-run screening programs.[ Case-control studies have found that the risk of developing invasive cervical cancer is three to ten times higher in women who have not been screened.[ References: Ideally, determining the sensitivity and specificity of a screening test would involve a study that applies a gold standard test (such as colposcopy with appropriate biopsy) to all participants (whether the screening test results are positive or negative). Sensitivity (the percentage of true-positive cases that are detected by the screening test) and specificity (the percentage of true-negative cases that are negative by the screening test) could be calculated. Such studies have rarely been done for any screening test for cervical cancer. Studies that compare the Pap test with repeat Pap testing have found that the sensitivity of any abnormality on a single test for detecting high-grade lesions is 55% to 80%.[ To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Pap smear, both a test threshold (i.e., the point at which the test will be considered to be positive) and a reference-standard threshold (i.e., the point at which the reference standard is considered to be positive) must be defined. In practice, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) are often used as the test threshold, and CIN 1 is often used as the reference threshold. This combination gives a sensitivity of about 68% and a specificity of about 75%. A more appropriate test threshold may be LSIL, with a reference threshold of CIN 2-3. This combination gives a sensitivity of 70% to 80%, with a specificity of about 95%.[ One important factor in the accuracy of the Pap test is the adequacy of the specimen obtained. Adequate training and using techniques such as the cytobrush may improve sensitivity.[ References: Newer techniques that employ liquid-based cytology (LBC) (e.g., ThinPrep) have been developed to improve the sensitivity of screening. In 1996, the ThinPrep\u00ae Papanicolaou (Pap) test became the first LBC approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.[ The evidence is also mixed about whether liquid-based techniques improve rates of test adequacy.[ References: Women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix for benign disease rarely have important abnormalities found on Pap testing. Several studies have shown that the rate of high-grade vaginal lesions or vaginal cancer is less than 1 in 1,000 tests;[ References: Because cervical cancer is slow growing, there is considerable uncertainty about the optimal screening interval. The most direct evidence about this issue comes from a prospective cohort analysis of a randomized controlled trial.[ A large study that included data from the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program together with modeling found little further mortality reduction from cervical cancer for screening every year as compared with screening every 3 years.[ References: Noninvasive cervical squamous cell abnormalities are graded histologically as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) mild dysplasia (CIN 1), moderate dysplasia (CIN 2), or severe dysplasia (CIN 3), according to the severity of the cell changes and the percent of the epithelium replaced by abnormal cell growth. CIN 3 is a reasonably reproducible diagnosis and, if untreated, has an approximate 30% risk of developing into invasive cancer over many years.[ Approximately 15 cancer-associated (high-risk or carcinogenic) HPV genotypes cause virtually all cases of cervical cancer and precursor lesions of CIN 2 and CIN 3. However, carcinogenic HPV infections are very common, particularly in young women, and most infections clear on their own within 1 to 2 years. Therefore, the challenge of incorporating HPV testing in cervical screening programs is to balance sensitivity for detection of CIN 2 or CIN 2+ and to minimize the over-referral of women with transient HPV infections and cervical changes that are destined to regress. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved several HPV tests. Most of these tests are based on the detection of DNA from one or more oncogenic types of HPV. One test detects HPV RNA. HPV testing is approved for use in two contexts: (1) as a second (i.e., triage) test after an equivocal cytology result of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS); and (2) for primary screening in conjunction with cervical cytology for women aged 30 years and older.[ Triage A large randomized clinical trial, the ASCUS/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) Triage Study (ALTS), demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of using HPV testing to clarify the risk of an ASCUS Pap result.[ HPV DNA testing is generally not appropriate or clinically useful after cytology results of LSIL, which is more severe than ASCUS, and most of these women (84%-96%) are carcinogenic HPV DNA positive.[ Primary HPV Screening Testing for HPV DNA as a primary screening test is an option for women aged 30 years and older. Women who are negative by cytology and HPV testing are at extremely low risk of CIN 3+ and therefore may be screened less frequently. A prospective cohort study of nearly 332,000 U.S. women aged 30 years and older undergoing HPV DNA and cervical cytology cotesting every 3 years found that the cumulative incidence of CIN 3+ in women with negative results for both tests at baseline was 0.047% at 3 years and 0.16% at 5 years.[ Numerous studies have demonstrated that, compared with cytology, HPV DNA testing is more sensitive for identifying women who have CIN 2+ (range of sensitivities, 84%-97%).[ The lower specificity of HPV DNA testing compared with cytology is a consideration. Among women older than 30 years, cytology had a specificity of 97% compared with 94% for HPV testing.[ An Italian population-based, randomized, controlled trial of HPV DNA testing versus cervical cytology performed at 3-year intervals in approximately 94,000 women aged 25 to 60 years found a statistically significant decrease in the number of invasive cervical cancer cases diagnosed in the HPV DNA arm at the second round of screening (0 cases vs. 9 cases; P = .004). However, about 48% of individuals in the HPV DNA arm also received conventional cytology testing at the first screening round, making it impossible to discern whether the observed difference resulted from the use of a combined testing strategy or HPV DNA testing alone. Of note, many more women in the HPV DNA arm than in the cytology-alone arm were referred to colposcopy for abnormal findings (4,436 women vs. 1,416 women), prompting the authors to conclude that if the HPV DNA test is used as a primary screening strategy, women with positive test results should be triaged by cytology before referral.[ A study using data from a population-based randomized trial of cervical cancer screening among women aged 32 to 38 years compared 11 different screening strategies using HPV DNA testing and cytology. The strategy of initial screening with an HPV DNA test and a triage of HPV-positive results with cytology, and subsequent repeat HPV DNA testing after 1 year for women who were HPV positive but cytology negative, increased the sensitivity for detection of CIN 3+ by 30% compared with cytology alone, and increased the total number of screening tests performed by only 12%.[ Cytology can be used to triage after primary HPV screening. Triage with cytology can be improved with concomitant detection of p16 and Ki-67 in the same cell (p16/Ki-67 dual stain [DS]). DS can be assessed manually through immunostaining cervical cytology slides. Additionally, artificial intelligence-based deep learning algorithms are currently being investigated and applied to aid in automated identification of p16/Ki-67 dual-stained slides. This approach has been shown to improve specificity without sacrificing sensitivity over manual DS assessment,[ References: Cervical cancer mortality, usually in unscreened women, increases with age, with the maximum mortality for White women between the ages of 45 years and 70 years, and for Black women in their 70s.[ Screening by Pap testing with associated diagnostic testing and treatment is effective in reducing the incidence of all histologies and stages of invasive cervical cancer.[ Women aged 20 years and younger are more likely to have Pap abnormalities leading to further testing and treatment, so forgoing Pap testing in these women may improve the benefit-risk balance for this intervention. For more information, see the Evidence of Harm section. Women in this age group have a very low risk of cervical cancer and a high likelihood that cervical cell abnormalities will go away on their own.[ High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions are rare among women older than 65 years who have been previously screened. For women with a negative Pap test at age 60 years and older, the likelihood of having a new diagnosis of CIN 3+ on repeat screening is less than 1 in 1,000 (in some studies, as few as 2-6 in 10,000).[ References: Choice in methods of screening for cervical cancer in resource-limited countries or underserved populations has prompted the evaluation of alternative methods, including self-collected human papillomavirus (HPV) tests and one-time screen-and-treat approaches. Visual Inspection of the Cervix With Acetic Acid (VIA) A clustered, randomized, controlled trial in rural India evaluated the impact of one-time visual VIA and immediate colposcopy, directed biopsy, and cryotherapy (where indicated) on cervical cancer incidence and mortality in healthy women aged 30 to 59 years.[ A second cluster-randomized trial of VIA screening in low socioeconomic areas of urban Mumbai, India, similarly demonstrated its efficacy in reducing cervical cancer mortality. In this trial, primary community health workers (as opposed to medical personnel) were trained to provide biennial VIA screening to 75,360 women aged 35 to 64 years. Women with positive screening results were referred to a central hospital for free diagnostic confirmation (including Pap smear, colposcopy, and biopsy, if indicated) and treatment\u2014where warranted\u2014according to hospital protocol. A control group (n = 76,178) received general cancer education. After 12 years, the relative risk (RR) of dying from cervical cancer was reduced by 31% in the screening arm (rate ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54-0.88), corresponding to about 5 fewer deaths per 100,000 woman-years. Compliance with treatment was about 15% lower for those in the control arm, which may have inflated the observed mortality benefit somewhat.[ A demonstration project in Kolkata, India, enrolled 39,740 women aged 30 to 60 years who underwent screening with VIA and Hybrid Capture II HPV DNA testing with colposcopy referral for a positive test, followed by biopsy and treatment if indicated. Estimated test performance for detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) severe dysplasia (CIN 3+), corrected for verification bias, demonstrated that VIA achieved a sensitivity of 59.9% (95% CI, 49.9%-69.1%) and a specificity of 93.2% (95% CI, 92.9%-93.4%) compared with HPV testing, which resulted in a sensitivity of 91.2% (95% CI, 85.4%-95.7%) and a specificity of 96.9% (95% CI, 96.7%-97.0%). HPV testing identified an additional 32 CIN 3+ cases and 7 invasive cancer cases missed by VIA.[ A randomized trial in South Africa evaluated the impact on diagnosis of CIN moderate dysplasia (CIN 2+) at 6 months with a screen-and-treat approach with VIA and HPV versus delayed evaluation.[ While VIA is practical in resource-limited settings, the accuracy and reproducibility are low. Advances in machine deep learning may help improve these metrics. A supervised, deep learning-based approach to predicting cervical precancers and cancers was investigated in a retrospective data set of 9,406 women who underwent cervical cancer screening using photographic images of the cervix. The archived digitized cervical images, taken with a fixed-focus camera (cervicography), were used for training and validation of the deep learning-based algorithm. The automated algorithm achieved better accuracy in predicting precancer and cancer compared with the original physician readers who interpreted the cervicography; it also compared favorably to conventional Pap smear cytology. This automated visual evaluation method needs to be transferred from digitized cervigrams (now obsolete) to contemporary digital cameras.[ A study of the feasibility of single-visit management of high-grade cervical lesions was conducted among a predominantly Latina population in California.[ Self-Collection of HPV Tests Self-collected HPV testing may be an alternative method for primary cervical screening. Incorporating self-collection of samples for HPV testing may improve access to cervical cancer screening, especially in communities with limited access to health care providers. A pooled analysis of cervical screening studies conducted in China compared the sensitivity and specificity of self-collected cervical specimens for HPV DNA testing, physician-collected specimens for HPV testing, liquid-based cytology (LBC), and VIA. The study included 13,004 participants in the analysis. Women underwent screening with all three sampling methods; in one study included in the pooled analysis, all women had colposcopy and biopsy. The women were instructed in the self-collection methodology by physicians, which likely affected the quality of specimen collection and thus the accuracy of the test in these studies. HPV DNA testing on physician-collected specimens had the highest sensitivity, 97.0% for CIN 2+ (95% CI, 95.2%-98.3%) and 97.8% 3+ (95% 95.3%-99.2%). The results of HPV DNA testing on self-collected specimens had moderate agreement with that of physician-collected specimens (kappa statistic, 0.67). Pooled sensitivity for self-collected HPV testing was 86.2% for 86.1% HPV and 79.5% 74.1%-84.8%) for CIN 3+. The specificity of HPV testing was lowest of all screening modalities. Whereas pooled sensitivity was highest for physician-collected HPV testing, it was lowest for the VIA screening methods\u201450.3% for CIN 2+ and 55.7% for CIN 3+. Pooled specificity was highest for LBC\u201494.0% for CIN 2+ and 92.8% for CIN 3+.[ A randomized noninferiority trial conducted in the Netherlands found that there was no difference in the CIN 2+ sensitivity or specificity of HPV testing between self-sampling based on written instructions and clinician-based sampling (relative sensitivity, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.90-1.03]; relative specificity, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.99-1.01]).[ A randomized trial within the U.S. Kaiser Permanente health care system evaluated the effectiveness of mailed HPV self-sampling kits versus usual-care reminders for in-clinic screening to increase the uptake of cervical cancer screening and the detection of CIN 2+. A total of 19,851 women who were overdue for screening were randomly assigned to either the self-sampling intervention or the usual-care control group. Screening uptake was higher in the intervention group (26.3%) than in the control group (17.4%) (RR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.43-1.60). In the intervention group, 12 participants with CIN 2+ were detected compared with 8 participants in the control group (RR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.61-3.64), and 12 patients were treated compared with 7 of those in the control group (RR, 1.70; 95% CI, 0.67-4.32).[ A study including underscreened ethnic minority groups and immigrant populations in South Florida evaluated the effectiveness of HPV self-sampling by randomizing women to self-collection via a mailed self-sampling kit or through an in-person visit by a community health worker.[ References: Annually in the United States, an estimated 65 million women undergo cervical cancer screening;[ The major potential harm of screening for cervical cancer lies in the screening detection of many cytologic abnormalities such as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs), the majority of which would never progress to cervical cancer. Women with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive ASCUS or LSILs on Pap testing are usually referred for colposcopy. Histological CIN 2+ is treated with cryotherapy or loop electrosurgical excision procedure. These procedures permanently alter the cervix and have consequences on fertility and pregnancy.[ On the basis of an analysis of screening records from nearly 350,000 women in Bristol, England, investigators projected that 1,000 women would need to be screened for cervical cancer for 35 years to prevent one death from the disease. For each death prevented, the authors estimated that more than 150 women have an abnormal result, more than 80 women are referred for investigation, and more than 50 women have treatment.[ References: The PDQ cancer information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as new information becomes available.
