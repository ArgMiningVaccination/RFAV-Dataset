I - .. .' , PREFACE The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research was established under the National Research Act (P.L. 93-348) to develop ethica1 guidelines for the conduct of research ir.volving human subjects and to make recommendation!3 for the application of such guide\u00ad lines to research conducted or supported by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (DHEW). The legislative mandate also directs the Commission to make recoll1Tlendations to Congress regarding the protection of human,subjects<' in research not\u00b7 subject to regulation by DHEW. Particular classes of subjects that must receive the Commission's attention include children, prisoners and the institutionalized mentally infirm. The duties of the Conmission with regard to research involving prisoners are specifically set forth in section 202(a)(2) of the National Research Act, as follows: The Commission shall identify the requirements for informed consent to participation in biomedical and behavioral research by prisoners .... Th,e Conmission shall investigate and study biomedical and behavioral research conducted or supported under programs a'Gmin\u00ad istered by the Secretary {DHEW} and involvil'1g . determine the nature of the 'consent ob\u00ad tained from such persons or their legal representatives before such persons were involved in such research; the adequacy of the information given them respecting the nature and purpose of the research, procedures to be used, risks and discomforts, anticipated benefits from the research, and' other matt~rs necessary for informed consent; and the competence and the f~eedom of the persons to make a choice for or against involve\u00ad ment in .such research. On the basis of such tnvesti\u00ad gation and study the Conmi'ssion shall make such recom\u00ad mendatinns to the Secretary as it deter\\llines appropriate to assure that biomedical and behavioral resea.rch con\u00ad ducted or supported under p.Y'ograms administered by hilll meets the requirements respecting informe.~.consent identified by the Commission. vii f? II 'I; ~ I I I I), i 'v \" C' II ?5FFUW&a b r = This responsibi1ity is broadened by the provision (section 202(a)(3\u00bb that the COl1l1lission make recommendations to Congress regarding the protection of subjects involved in research not subject to regulation by DHEW, such as research in\u00ad volving prisoners that is conducted or supported by other federal departments or agencies, as ,well as research conducted in federal prisons or involving inmates from su~h prisons. To carry out its mandate, the Commission studi~d the nature and extent of research involving prisoners, the conditions under which such research is con\u00ad ducted s and the possible grounds for continuation, restriction or termination .. of such research. Commission members and staff made site visits to four prisons and two research facilities outside prisons that use prisoners, in order to ob\u00ad tain first-hand information on the conduct of biomedical res~arch and the operation of behavioral programs in these settings. During the visits, inter\u00ad views were conducted with many inmates who have participated in research or behavioral programs as well as with nonparticipants. The COlnmission held a public hearing at which research scientists, pris\u00ad oner advocates and providers of legal services to prisoners, representatives of the pharmaceutical industry, and members of the public presented their views on research involving prisoners. This hearing was duly announced, and no re\u00ad quest to testify was denied. The National Minority Conference on Human Experi\u00ad mentation, which was convoked by the Commission in order to assure that view\u00ad points of minorities would be expressed, made recommendations to the Commission on research in prisons. In addition to papers, surveys and other materials prepared by the Commission staff, stUdies on the following topics were prepared viii under contract: (1) alternatives to the involvement of prisoners; (2) foreign practices \\>/ith respect to drug testing. (3) philosophical t sO.ciological and legal perspective~ on the involvement of prisoners in research.; (4) behavioral research involving prisoners; and (5) a survey of research review procedures, investigators and prisoners at five prisons. Finally, at pubHc meetings com\u00ad mencing in January 1976. the Commission conducted extensive deliberations and developed its recommendations on the involvement of prisoners in research. Part I of this report contains the recommendations as well as tne deliberations and conclusions of the Commission-and a summary of background materials.

The Commission recognizes , probl ems wi th employing the terms \"therapeuticll and IInonthei'apeutic\" research, notwithstanding their cOl1111on usage, because they may convey a misleading im\u00ad pression. Research refers to a class of activities designed to develop generalizable new knowledge. Such activities are often engaged in to learn something about practices designed for the therapy of the individual. Such research is often called \"therapeutic\" research; however, the research is not solely for the therapy of the individual. In order to do research, additional interventions over ana above those necessary for therapy may need to be done, ~, randomiiation, blood drawing, catheterization; these inter.ventions may not be \"therapeutic\" for the individua,l. Some of these interventions may themselves present risk to the individual--risk unrelated to the therapy of the subject. The Commission has employed the term \"research on practices which have the intent and reasonable probability of improving the health ,or well-being of the subjectll or variants of this term.

DELIBERATIONS, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Chapter 1. Deliberations and 'Conclusions. Introduction. Prior to 1940, prisoners in the United States seldom participated in biomedical research that had no reasonable expectation of im\u00ad proving the health or well-being of the research subjects. During World War II, however, large numbers of prisoners participated in voluntary research programs to develop treatment for infectious diseases that afflicted our armed forces. This involvement of prisoners was considered to be not only acceptable, but praiseworthy. Following the war, the growth of biomedical research and the imposition of requirements for testing drugs as to safety led to the increased use of prisoners. Their participation in biomedical research not relat~d to their health or well-being has continued in this country to the present time. This participation is now primarily in phase 1 drug and cosmetic testing, which is conducted or supported by pharmaceutical manufacturers in connection with applications to the Food and Drug Adminis\u00ad tration for licensing new drugs. Other research of this sort in which priS, , \\ oners participate, or have participated, includes studies of normal metaboli~m and physiology, conducted by the Public Health Service (PHS); stUdies of the prevention or treatment of infectious diseases, conducted or supported by the PHS and the Department of Defense; a study of the effects of irradiation on the male reproductive function, supported by the Atomic Energy COll11lission; and testing of the addictive prop~rties of new analgesics by giving them to prisoner~ with a history of narcotic abuse, conducted at the Addiction Re3earch Center in Lexington, Kentucky. (The involvement of federal prisoners in the , Lexi ngton program is schedul ed to be phased out. *) . * Letter dated March 1, 1976 to Honorable Robert 'W. Kaste.nmeier from Norman A. Carlson, Director, U.S. Bureau of Prisons. 1 t e f $ a ... Prisoners also participate in research on practices that have the intent ndreasonable probability of improving their health or well-being. This research includes, for example, studies (supported by various components of DHl:W and the Federal Bureau of Prisons) to develop methods to reduce the spread of infections, improve dental care, hel p the subjects stop smoking and remove tatoos. A major focus of this sort of research involving federal prisoners has been the development of nevI treatments for narcotiLaddictio~. A third type of research in which prisoners participate includes studies of tHe possible causes, effects and process of incarceration, and studies of prisons ~s inst'itutional structures or of prisoners as incarcerated persons. Components of DHEW have undertaken research of this sort for such purposes a~ learning the etiology of drug addiction and deviant or self-destructive behavior, and the factors relating to parole performance and recidivism\" Research is al so conducted on the methods of treatment or \"rehabil itat'ion\" of prisoners. The National Institute of Mental Health, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration have supported research on the experimental treatment of aggressive behavior with drugs and aversive conditioning techniques, as well as behavior modification based upon depriving inmates of basic amenities which they must then earn back as privi\u00ad leges. Rehabilitative practices have not always been based upon prior scien\u00b7, tific design and evaluation, however, despite the fact that there are few, if any, approaches to the treatment or rehabilitation of prisoners for which effectiveness has been clearly demonstrated. Outside the United States prisoners do not generally participate i~ bio- , ' , medical research. This exclusion may be ascribed in part to continuing concelf'n 2 .... over experiments that were conducted on prisoners in Nazi concentration camps. Revelations of those experi'lnents led to the enunciation of the Nuremberg Code (1946-1949), which.required that'human subjects of research ube so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice\" but did not expressly pro\u00ad hibit research involving civil prisoners. The Declaration of Helsinki, adopted by the World Medical Association in 1964 and endorsed by the American Medi(;~\\l Association in 1966, contained similar language that was subsequently deleted in 1975. Although little if any drug testing is conducted in foreiih prisons, other kinds of research have been conducted in prisons throughout the world, such as studies dealing with the incidence and implications of chromosome abnorma1ities., Since the 1960'S, the ethical propriety of participation by prisoners in research has increasingly been questioned in this~oui1try. Among the events that have focused public attention on this issue was the publication of Jessica Mitford's book, Kind and Usual Punishment, in 1973. Eignt states and the Federal Bureau of Prisons have formally moved to abandon research in prisons. The Heal,th Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare held hearings (Quality of Health Care -Human Experimentation, 197~) . on research involving,prisoners in late 1973. Those speaking against the use of prisoners cited explOitation, secrecy~ danger and the impossibility of obtaining informed conse.nt as reasons to impose a prohibition or moratorium /' on the conduct of research in prisons. The advantages of using pris~ners in research (~, opportunity for close monitoring and controlled environment) and the procedures that are employed to protect prisoner participants were also described in the' hearings. The Health Subcommittee held extensive 3 II \"~\" .. srm 1 ~earings on other areas of human experimentation as well, and reported the bill establishing this Commission with a mandate that included a directive to study and make recommendations concerning the involvement of prisoners in research. More recently, the House Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Libert~e5, and the Administration of Justice held hearings'(Prison\"Inmates in Medical Research, 1975) on a bill (H.R. 3603) to prot., :t \"medical research\" in federal prisons and prisons of states th\\~t receive certain federal support. Following th,~se hearings, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons determined that \"continued use of prisoners in any medical experimentation should not be permitted,\" and he ordered that such participation by prisoners under federal jurisdiction be phased out. Some of the more extreme behavioral programs have also raised questions. In her 1973 book, Jessica Mitford expressed concern about new approaches to \"treatment\" for offenders. Concurrently, others raised questions about the use of psychosurgery in prisons. In the early 1970's, the first challenges to behavior modification and aversive conditioning programs in prisons were argued in the courts, with mixed results. Most of the cases involved the right to refuse to particip~te in such programs, although prisoners have \\ also petitioned for 'the right to be includEd in programs designed to alter sexually aggressive behavior. Concern over behavior modification programs in prisons was expressed ! in a stUd\u00bb, Individual Rights and the Federal Role in Behavior Modification (1974), prepared by the staff of the Constitutional Rights Subcommittee of the 4 '~, ------------------- Senate Judici'ary' COll1l1ittee. The s~udy contained information on a number of such programs and suggested that this COIll11ission make use of the information in attempting to resolve the issues that they raised. It should be noted that a number of the \"treatmentll programs mentioned in the study are reported to have been discontinued. General concerns. In conducting its investigations and studies, the Commission has noted and cannot ignore serious deficiencies in living condi\u00ad tions and health care that generally prevail in prisons. Nor-can the Commission ignore the pote\"tial for, al'bitrary exercise of authorit.y by prison officials ard for unreasonable restriction of communication to and from prisoners. The Commission, although acknowledging that it has neither the expertise nor the mnndate for prison reform, nevertheless urges that unjust and inhumane condi\u00ad tions be eliminated from all prisons, whether or not research activities are' conducted or contemplated. Ethical considerations about using prisoners as research subjects. There are two basic ethical dilemmas concerning the use of prisoners as research sub\u00ad jects: (1) whether prisoners bear a fair share of the burdens and receive a fair share of the benefits of research; and (2) whether prisoners are, in the words of the Nuremberg Code, \"S0 situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice\" --that is, whether prisoners can give truly voluntary consent to participate in research. These two dilemmas relate to two basic ethical prir,ciples: the principle of justice, which requires that persons and groups be treated fairly, and the principle of respect for persons, which requires that the autonomy of persons 5 be promoted and protected. Disproportionate use of prisoners in certain kinds of research (~, phase 1 drug testing) would constitute a violation of the first principle; closed and coercive prison environments would com\u00ad pralnisethe second principle. It is within the context of a concern to im\u00ad plement these principles that the Commission has deliberated the Question of use of prisoners as research subjects. The Commission recognizes, however, that the application of these principles to the problem is not unambiguous. To respect a person is to allow that person to live in accord with his or her deliberate choices. Since the choices of prisoners in all matters except those explicitly with\u00ad drawn by law should be respected, as courts increasingly affirm, it seems at first glance that the principle of respect for persons requires that prisoners not be deprived of the opportunity to volunteer for _research. Indeed, systematic deprivation of this freedom would also violate the prin\u00ad ciple of justice, since it would arbitraFily deprive one class of persons of benefits available to others--namely, the benefits of participation in research. However, the application of the principles of respect and justice allows another interpretation, which the Commission favors. When persons seem regu\u00ad larly to engage in activities which, were they stronger or in better circum\u00ad stances, they would avoid, respect dictates that they be protected against those forces that appear to compel their choices. It has become evident to the Commission that, although prisoners who participate in research affirm that they do so freely, the conditions of social and economic deprivation in 6 li\" \" ----~-.~-~---- ---.. which they live compromise their freedom. The Commission believes, thererore, that the appropriate expression of respect consists in protection from exploitfl-\u00ad tion. Hence it calls for certain safeguards intended to reduce the elements of constraint under which prisoners give consent and suggests that certain kind~ of research would not be permitted where such safeguards cannot be assured. Further, a concern for justice raises the question whether social insti\u00ad tutions are so arranged that particular persons or groups are burdened with marked disadvantages or deprived of certain benefits for reasons unrelated to their merit, contribution, deserts or need. While this principle can be inter\u00ad preted, as above, to require that prisoners not be unjustly excluded from participation in research, it also requires attention to the possibility that prisoners as a group bear a disproportionate share of the burdens of research or bear those burdens without receiving a commensurate share of the benefits that ultimately derive from research. To the exte;nt that participation in research may be a burden, the CommTssion is concerned to ensure that this burden not be unduly visited upon prisoners simply because of their captive status and administrative availability. Thus it specifies some conditions for the selection of prisoners as a subject pool for certain. kinds of research. In so doing, the Commission is not primarily intending to protect prisoners from the risks of research; indeed, the Commission notes that the risks of research, as compared with other kinds of occupations, may be rather small. The Commissiun's concern, rather, is to ensure the equitable distribution of the burdens of research no matter how large or small those burdens may be. The Commi.ssion is concerned that the status of being a prisoner makes possible the perpetration of certain systemic injustices. For example, the availability 7 ..... --p' (', .( of a population living in conditions of social and economic deprivation makes it possible for researchers to bring to these populations types of research which persons better situated would ordinarily refuse. It also establishes an enterprise whose fair administration can be readily corrupted by prisoner control or arbitrarily ma'nipulated by prison authorities. And finally, it . . allows an inequitable distribution of burdens and benefits, in that those social classes from which pri\u00a3oners often come are seldom full beneficiaries of improvements in medical care and other benefits accruing to society from the research enterprise. Reflection upon these principles and upon the actual conditions of imprisonment in our society has led the Commission to believe that prisoners are, as ,a consequence of being prisoners, more';subject to coerced choice and more readily available for the imposition of burdens which others will n:rt willingly bear. Thus. it has inclined toward protection as the most appro\u00ad priate expression of respect for prisoners as,persons and toward redistri\u00ad bution of those burdens of risk and inconvenience which are presently con\u00ad centrated upon prisoners. At the same time, it admits that, should coercions be lessened and more equitable systems for the sharing of burdens and benefits be devised, respect for'persons and concern for justice would suggest that prisoners not be deprived of the opportunity to participate in research. Con\u00ad cern for principles of respect and justice leads the Commission to encourage those forms of inquiry that could form a basis for improvement of current c' , prison conditions and pra~ticesJ such as studies of the effects of incarcera- tion, of prisons as institutions and of prisoners as prisoners, and also to allow research on practices clearly intended to improve the health or well-being of individual prisoners. 8 I I I t ! I i The Commission has noted the concern, expressed by participants at the National Minority Conference and by others,. that minorities bear adispro\u00ad porti,onate share of the risks of research conducted in prisons. This concern is fostered, in part, by evidence that prison populations are disprop6rtionately nonwhite. Evidence presented to the Commission indicatas that where research is done in prison, those prisoners who participate tend to be predominantly ~ white, ever. in institutions where the populatiQ.n as a whole is predominantl,V nonwhite; further, those who participate in research t~nd to ~e better edu\u00ad cated and more frequently employed at better jobs than the prison population as a whole. This evidence suggests that nonwhites and poor or less educated persons in prison do not carry a greater share of the burdens of research. n: However, the evidence is inconclusive for two rea~~ns: first) 'because it does not fully satisfy questions related to the risks of research; and () -s second, because it raises questions of justice with respect to the equitable '5 distribution of benefits (as well as burdens) of research. With respect to risks, the Commission notes that different research projects carry different t'isks; it is possible, though the Commission has no evidence to this effect, that one race or another may participate in more r'ese-arch of higher risk. And of course, the ratio of nonwhites to whites I participating in research and hence bearing the burdens of research may , still be disproportionate when compared to the ratio of the populations as a whole. But the Commission also notes that those who participate in research u consider the benefits sufficient to outWeigh the burdens. Thus, the greater :\",' 9 \" '. I --------------------------------------------------~-------------------------- -participation of whites may mean that there is an inequitable distribution of benefits between racial groups. Hence the greater participation by whites does not necessarily resolve the issue of distributive justice. Similarly, the Commission notes that less r~search is conducted in women's prisons. While the reasons for tnl~ may well be the same reasons that women in general are used less frequently than men as research subjects c.~ .. ! . .9.!.' the possibil ity of pregnancy), questions of distributive justice, similar to those raised above,. may still need to be addressed with respect to participation in research by women prisoners. Di scussion. Among the 'issues discussed by the Comm; ssion are two on which no specific recommendations are made. but concerning which the considera\u00ad tion$ of th~ Commission should be expressed: (1) remuneration, and (2) alternatives to conducting research in prisons. (1) Remuneration is a sub\u00ad ject that should be analyzed by human subj,ects review cOlllJ1ittees, in consulta\u00ad tion with prison grievance cOlllJ1ittees and prison authorities. There are at least two considerations that must be balanced in the determination of appro\u00ad priate rates for participation in research not related to the subjects' health or well-being. On the one hand, the pay offered to prisoners should not be so high! compared to other opportunities for employment within the facility, as to constitute undue inducement to participate. On the other hand, those who sponsor the research should not take economic advantage of captive populations by paying significantly less than would be necessary if nonprisoner volunteers were recruited. Fair solutions to this problem are difficult to achieve. One suggestion is that those who sponsor research. pay the same rate for prisoners 10 !L _____ _ ---~-I I f ~ I [ as they pay other volunteers, but that the amount actually gOing to the. res~arch subjects be comparable to the rates of pay otherwise available within the facility. The difference between the two amounts could be paid into a general fund, either to subsidize the wages for all inmates within the prison, or for other purposes that be,~~fit the prisoners or their families. Prisoners should participate in managing such a fund and in determining allocation of the monies. Another suggestion is that the difference be held in escrow and paid to each participant at the time of release or, alternatively, that it be paid directly to the prisoner's family. A requirement related to the question of appropriate remuneration for participation in research is that prisoners should be able to obtain an ade\u00ad quate diet, the necessities of personal hygiene, medical attention and income without recourse to participation in research. (2) Some of the Commission members endorse the alternative of permitting prisoners to participate in research provided it is conducted in a clinic or hospital outside the' prison grounds, and provided also that nonprisoners parti\u00ad cipate in the same projects for the same wages. Other members of the Commission believe that such a mechanism would serve only to increase the disparity between the conditions within the prison and those within. the research unit, thereby heightening the inducement to participate in research in order to escape from the constraints of the prison setting. All of the members of the Commission endorse the suggestion that the use of alternative populations be explored and utilized more fully than is presently the case. This may be especially important to permit drugs to continue to be tested, as required by current law and regu\u00ad lations of the FDA, dUfing any period in which prisons have not satisfied,the 11 - conditions that are recommended for the conduct of such research. Increased utilization of alternative populations would have the added benefit of pro ... viding nonprisoner populations to participate in research projects along with prisoners, or in parallel with similar projects within priSons, in order to satisfy the general concern that prisoners not participate in experi\u00ad ments that nonprisoners would find unacceptabJe. The Commission also suggests that Congress and the FDA consider the advisability of undertaking a study and evaluation to determine whether present requirements for phase 1 drug testing in normal volunteers should be modified. Conclusions. In the course of its investigations and review of evidence presented to it, the Commission did not find in prisons the conditions requisite for a sufficiently high degree of voluntariness and openness, notwithstanding that prisoners currently participating in research consider, in nearly all in\u00ad stances, that they do so voluntarily and want the research to continue. The Commission recognizes the role that research involving prisoners has played. It does not consider, however, that administrative convenience or availability , of subjects is, in itself, sufficient justification for selecting prisoners as subjects. Throughout lengthy deliberations, the strong evidence of poor conditions generally prevailing in prisons and the paucity of evidence of any necessity to conduct research in prisons have been significant considerations of the Commission. An equally important consideration has been the closed nature of priscns, with the resulting potential for abuse of authority. Some of the Com\u00ad mission members, who are opposed to research not;related to the health or well being of prisoner-participants, have, however, agreed to permit it to be con- 12 , . I I I ! N --~ ~---~~---~~-~- --~--~-----------.\" ducted, but only under the fo11owing standards: adequate living conditions., separation of research participation from any appearance of parole considera\u00ad tion~ effective grievance procedures and public scrutiny at the prison where research will be conducted or from which prospective subjects will be taken; importance of the research; compelling reasons to involve prisoners; and fair\u00ad ness of such involvement. Compliance with these requirements must be certi\u00ad fied by the highest responsible federal official, assisted by a national ethical review body. The Commission has concluded that the burden of proof that all the requirements are satisfied shou.ld be on those who wish to con\u00ad duct the research. 13 r 1 --------------------::;--, Chapter 2. Recommendations. The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research makes the following recon~endations on research involving prisoners, to: (1) The Secretary, DHEW, with respect to research that is subject to his renulation, i.e., research conducted or supported under programs administered \" -::--=~~,,-,/ by him and research reported to him in fulfillment of regulatory requirements; and (ii) The Congress, except as otherwise noted, with respect to research that is not subject to regulation by the Secretary, DHEW. Recommendation (1): STUDIES OF THE POSSIBLE CAUSES, EFFECTS AND PROCESSES OF INCARCERATION AND STUDIES OF PRISONS AS INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES OR OF PRIS\u00ad ONERS AS INCARCERATED PERSONS MAY BE CONDUCTED OR SUPPORTED, PROVIDED THAT (A) THEY PRESENT MINIMAL OR NO RISK AND NO MORE THAN MERE INCONVENIENCE TO THE SUBJECTS, AND (B) THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER RECOMMENDATION (4) ARE FULFILLED. Comment: The Commission encourages the conduct of studies of prisons as institutions and prisoners as incarcerated persons. Because the inadequacies of the prisons may themselves be the object of such studies, the Commission has not set any conditions for the Ctvduct of such research other than a limitation of this category to research that presents minimal or no risk and no more than mere inconvenience, and the requirements of Recommendation (4) Studies of prisoners consisting of questionnaires, surveys, analyses of census and demographic data, psychological tests, personality inventories 14 .. and the like r~rely involve risk and are essential for proper understanding of prisons and the effects of their practices. Research designed to deter\u00ad mine the effects on general health of institutional diets and restricted acti\u00ad vity, and similar studies that do not manipulate bodily conditions (except innocuously, ~, obtaining blood samples) but mere1y mon1tor or analyze '\" such conditions, also present little physical ri~)k and are necessary to gain some knowledge of the effects of imprisonment. Such research is a necessary -, step toward understanding prison practices and altern~tives, without which. there can be no improvement. Recommendation (2): RESEARCH ON PRACTICES, BOT~ INNOVATIVE AND ACCEPTED, WHICH HAVE THE INTENT AND REASONABLE PROBABILITY OF IMPROVING THE HEALTH OR WELL-BEING OF THE INDIVIDUAL PRISONER MAY BE CONDUCTED OR SUPPORTED, PROVIDED THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER RECOMMENDATION (4) ARE FULFILLED. Comment: Research would fall under this recommendation if the practices under study are designed solely to improve the health or well-being of the , research subject by prophylactic, diagnostic or treatment methods that may depart from standard practice but hold out a reasonable expectation of success. The Commission intends that prisoners not be discriminated against with respect to research protocols in which a therapeutic result might be realized for the individual subject. The committees that review all research involving prisoners should analyze carefully any claims that research projects are designed to im\u00ad prove the health or well-being of subjects and shouldpe particularly cautious with regard to research in which the principal purpose of the practice under study is to enforce conformity with behavioral norms establiShed by prison officials or even by society. Such conformity cannot be assumed to improve 15 the condition of the individual prisoner. If the review committee does not consider such claims to be sufficiently substantiated, the research should not be conducted unless it conforms to the requirements of Recommendation {3}. Recommendation (3): EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN RECOMMENDATION (l) AND (2), RESEARCH INVOLVING PRISONERS SHOULD NOT BE CONDUCTED OR SUPPORTED, AND REPORTS : OF SUCH RtSEARCH SHOULD NOT BE ACCEPTED BY THE SECRETARY, DHEW, IN FULFILLMENT OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS! UNLESS THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER RECOMMENDATION (4) ARE FULFILLED AND THE 'HEAD OF THE RESPONSIBLE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OR AGENCY HAS CERTIFIED, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH A NATIONAL ETHICAL REVIEW BODY, THAT THE FOLLOWING THREE REQUIREMENTS ARE SATISFIED: (A) THE TYPE OF RESEARCH FULFILLS AN IMPORTANT SOCIAL AND SCIENTIFIC NEED, AND THE REASONS FOR INVOLVING PRISONERS IN THE TYPE OF RESEARCH ARE COMPELLING; (B) THE INVOLVEMENT OF PRISONERS IN THE TYPE OF RESEARCH SATISFIES CONDITIONS OF EQUITY; AND (C) A HIGH DEGREE OF VOLUNTARINESS ON THE PART OF THE PROSPECTIVE PARTICIPANTS ,AND OF OPENNESS ON THE ~ART OF THE INSTITUTION(S) TO BE INVOLVED WOULD CHARACTERIZE THE CONDUCT OF THE RESEARCH; MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR SUCH VOLUNTARINESS AND OPENNESS INCLUDE ADEQUATE LIVING CONDITIONS, PROVISIONS FOR EFFECTIVE REDRESS OF GRIEVANCES, SEPARATION OF RESEARCH PARTICIPATION FROM PAROLE CONSIDERATIONS, AND PUBLIC srRUTINY. Comment: Detailed standards expressing the intent of the Commission with respect to Requirement (C) of this Recommendation are as follows: 16 (i) Public scrutw..t. Prisoners should be able to conmunicate. without . censorship, with persons outside the prison and, on a privileged, confidential basi,s$ with attorneys, legal organizations which assist prisoners, the accred\u00ad iting office which assists the certifying federal official or national ethical review body, the grievance committee referred to in paragraph (ii) below, and the human subjects review committee or institutional review board referred to in Recommendation (4). Each of such persons or organizations with whom pris\u00ad oners should be able to communicate on a privileged, confidential basis should be able to conduct private interviews with any prisoner who so desires. The accrediting office, grievance committee and human subjects review committee or institutional review board should be allowed \"free access to the prison. (ii) Grievance procedur~. There should exist a grievance committee composed of elected prisoner representatives, prisoner advocates and repre\u00ad sentatives of the community. The committee should ~nable prisoners to obtain effective redress of their grievances and should facilitate inspections and monitoring by the accrediting office to assure continuing compliance with re\u00ad qui rement (C). (iii) Standard of living. Living conditions in the prison in which research wi 11 be conducted or from which subjects will be recruited should be adequate, as evidenced by compliance. with all of the following standards: (1) The prison population does not exceed designed capacity, and each prisoner has an adequate amount of living space; (2) There are si.ngle occupancy cells available for those who desire them; 17 _ (f (3) There is segregation of offenders by age, degree of violence, prior criminal record, and physical and mental health require\u00ad ments; (4) There are operable cell doors, emergency exists and fire extin\u00ad guishers~ and compliance with state and local fire and safety codes is certified; (5) There are operable toilets and wash basins in cells; (6) There is regular access to clean and working showers; (7) Articles of personal care ~nd clean linen are regularly issued; (8) There are adequate recreation faciliti~s, and each prisoner is allowed an adequate amount of recreation; (9} There are good quality medical facilities in the prison, ade\u00ad quate1y staffed and equipped, and approved by an outside medical accrediting organization such as the Joint Commission on Accredita\u00ad tion of Hospitals or a state medical society; (10) There are adequate mental health services and professional staff; (11) There is adequate opportunity for prisoners who so desire to work for remuneration comparab1 e to that received fot~ partici\u00ad pation in research; (12) There is adequate opportunity for prisoners who so desire to receive education and vocational training; (13) Prisoners are afforded opportunity to communicate privately with their visitors, and are permitted frequent visits; (14) There is a sufficiently large and well-trained staff to provide assurance of prisoners' safety; 18 I ~ OS} The-racial composition of the staff is reasonably concordant w/lth that of the prisoners; (16) To the extent that it is consistent with the security needs of the p~ison, there should be an opportunity for inmates to lock their own cells; and (17) Conditions in the prison satisfy basic institutional environ\u00ad mental health, food service and nutritional standards. (iv) Parole. There should be effective procedures assuring that parole - . boards cannot take into account prisoners' participation in research and that . prisoners are clearly informed that there is absolutely no relationship between research partcipatt~n ano determinations by their parole boards. If an investigator wishes to present evidence of the importance and fair\u00ad ness of conducting a type of research on a prison population (requirements (A) ,\" and (B}) and proposes that the conditions of voluntariness and openness would be satisfied at a particular prison (requirement (e\u00bb, the case should be presented to the Secretary~ DHEW (or the head of any other department or agency under whose authority the research would be conducted). Such official should seek the advice uf an existing or newly created advisory body (such as the Ethical Advisory Board established within the Public Health Service) in deter\u00ad mining whether to approve the type of research at the specific institution. Such official or advisory body should be assisted by an accrediting office, which makes inspections, certifies compliance with requirement (e), and moni\u00ad tors continuing compliance of any prison involved in research. In determining such compliance, the accrediting office should be guided by the above descrip\u00ad tion of the Commission's intent in recommending --------, _a._I _______________ ,~_\" ________________________________________________ __ Recommendation (4): (A) THE HEAD OF THE RESPONSI3LE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OR AGENCY SHOULD DETERMINE THAT THE COMPETENCE OF THE INVESTIGATORS AND THE ADEQUACY OF THE RESEARCH FACILITIES INVOLVED ARE SUFFICIENT FOR THE CONDUCT OF ANY RESEARCH PROJECT IN WHICH PRISONERS ARE TO BE INVOLVED. (B) ALL RESEARCH INVOLVING PRISONERS SHOULD BE RtVIEWED BY AT LEAST ONE HUMAN SUBJECTS REVIEW COMMITTEE OR INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD COM\u00ad PRISED OF MEN AND WOMEN OF DIVERSE RACIAL AND CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS THAT IN\u00ad CLUDES AMONG ITS MEMBERS PRISONERS OR PRISONER ADVOCATES AND SUCH OTHER PER\u00ad SONS AS COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES, CLERGY, BEHAVIORAL SCIENTISTS AND ~1EDICAL PERSONNEL NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONDUCT OF THE RESEARCH ,OR THE PENALINSTI- TUTION; IN REVIEWING PROPOSED RESEARCH, THE COMMITTEE OR BOARD SHOULD CONSIDER AT LEAST THE FOLLOWING: THE RISKS INVOLVED, PROVISIONS FOR OBTAINING INFORMED CONSENT, SAfEGUARDS TO PROTECT INDIVIDUAL DIGNITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY, PRO\u00ad CEDURES FOR THE SELECTION OF SUBJECTS, AND PROVISIONS FOR PROVIDING COMPEN\u00ad SATION FOR RESEARCH-RELATED INJURY. Comment: The risks involved in research involving prisoners should be commensurate with risks that would be accepted by nonprisoner volunteers. If it is questionable whether a particular project is offered to prisoners because of the risk involved, the review committee might require that non\u00ad prisoners be included in the same project. In negotiations regarding consent, it should be determined that the written or verbal comprehensibility of the information presented is appro\u00ad priate to the subject population. 20 Procedures for the selection of subjects within the prison should be fair and immune from arbitrary intervention by authorities or prisoners. Compensation and treatment for research-related injury should be pro-. vided,.and the procedures for requesting such compensation Q\u00b7nd treatment should be described fully on consent forms retained by the subjects. ,. Prisoners who are minors$ mentally disabled or retarded should not be included as subjects unless the research is related to their particular condition and comp1 i'es with the standards for research involving those groups as well as those for prisoners. (Recommendations concerning research parti\u00ad cipation of children and the institutional ized mentally infirm will here\u00ad after be made by the Commission.) There should be effective procedures assuring that parole boards cannot take into account prisoners I participation in research, and that prisoners are made certain that there is absolutely no relationship between research participation and determinations by their parole boards. Recommendation (5): IN THE ABSENCE OF CERTIFICATION THAT THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER RECOMMENDATION (3) ARE SATISFIED, RESEARCH PROJECTS COVERED BY THAT RECOMMENDATION THAT ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE SECRETARY, DHEW, AND ARE CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO CONTINUE NOT LONGER THAN ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE FEDERAL R,EGISTER OR UNTIL COMPLETED\" WHICHEVER IS EARLIER. 21 -----~~-~-~--------------------------~-~- ::'1 ,-------------------.--- .. -~--i : . 3. Nature of Research'Involving Pri2Pners Research'activities involving prisoners may be divided into four broad categories: biomedical research not rel ated to the hea ,\";) or well-being of the subject, biomedical research on practices intended to improve the health or well-being of the subject, social research, and behavioral research on practi ces intended to improve the he'a 1 th or we 11-be i ng of the subj ect. The first category of research using prisoners mainly involves phase 1 testing of new drugs and testing of vaccines as to efficacy. B'iomedica 1 and beh.avioral research related to the health or well-being of the prisoner-participants generally inVOlves the study of conditions associated with prisoners or prisons. In addition, innovative pr,+'ctices in prisons, intended to rehabilitate or'treat prisoners, often have many attributes of behavioral research but are seldom introduced as such. The major controversy over participation of prisoners surrounds their use as subjects of biomedical research not related to their he:al th or well-being and their unwi 11 ing invol vement in experimental treatment or rehabilitative programs. Biomedical research unrelated to the health pr well-being of pr1soner .. participants was conducted in the United States only in isolated instances prior to the establishment in 1934 of a program at Leavenworth Prison to assess the abuse potential of narcotic analgesics; such:-research is now conducted at the Addiction Research Center in Lexington, K~ntucky, although it was announced recently that the program will be terminated by the end of 1976. The. current involvement of prisoners in biomedical researcn unrelated to their health or 23 PllCed,ing page blank ..... jiI:IIL tl. well-being can be traced to threle sources. First, during World War II, pris\u00ad oners volunteered in large numbers for studies, such as those to develop effective anti-malarial drugs, which were viewed as contributing to the national interest. Reviews of these pris.on research activities by ;several state conmis\u00ad sions resulted in their endorsement. In fact, prisoner participation in re\u00ad search was felt to be such a sallutary experience that the American Medical Association formally opposed al]owing persons convicted of particularly serious crimes to have the privilege of participating in scientific experiments. Second, the enthusiastic support of biGmedical research by the government and the public following the war brought an enormous growth to research enterprises, and pris\u00ad oners served as subjects in many of these new endeavors. Third, the thalidomide experience was followed by passage in 1962 of the Kefauver-Harris amendments to the Food and Drug Act, which established additional requirements for testing the safety and efficacy of all drugs to be sold in interstate commerce and thereby encouraged the continued use of prisoners in research. The phase 1 testing requirements established under these amendments required evaluation of the safety of new drugs in normal volunteers under controlled conditions, and pris- ~,oners became the population on which much of this testing was perfo~med. Innovative prison practices are often difficult to distinguish from what might be termed behavioral research on practices intended to improve the health or well~being of prisoner-participants. Since the early 1900\u00b7s, innovations 5uch as flexible sentences, indeterminate sentences, behavioral therapies ! during imprisonment, and parole and probation based on evidence of rehabili\u00ad tation have been introduced into the prison system., These innovations have not generally included prOVisions for design, review and evaluation as research. 24 Frequently, though, the behavioral programs have had many characteristics of behavior modification research. Examples range from use of \"therapeutic community\" and reinforcement techniques in prison, to use of aversive condi\u00ad tioning (employing electric shock or drugs with unpleasant effects) in treating sex offenders or uncontrollably violent prisoners, to use of a structured tier system (token economy) in which a prisoner progresses from living conditions of severe deprivation to relative freedom and comfort as a reward for socially acceptable behavior. At the extreme of research or treatment designed to change behavior were castration for sexual offenders and psychosurgery for'uncontrolla\u00ad ble violence. The peak of enthusiasm for the application of behavior mod;'fication techniques in the prison system waS marked by the establishment of the Special Treatment and Rehabil itation Training (START) program in the Feder'al Bureau of Prisons, and the planning of a new federal prison at Butner, North Carolina, with research in applying behavioral modification throughout a prison as its primary purpose. The START program was abandoned, after l~ years of operation, under considerab1e criticism and after some challenges in court. Similar acti\u00ad vities led to a reevaluation of the programs planned for Butner, which opened in May 1976. It now offers a variety of vocational and academic courses as well as general counseling. Participation in these programs is voluntary, and changes in the program content will be introduc~d only with the approval of both the inmates and the staff. Social research and psychological testing are also conducted in pris\u00ad ons. Projects include studies of the factors which may contribute to criminal 25 * behavior (such as cytogenetic anomalies or socioeconomic and psychological stress)~ comparison of effectivenes~ of various rehabilitative programs i~ reducing recidivism, psychological assessment of criminals as compared with noncr.iminal counterparts, tracking the outcome of judgments concerning IIdan\u00ad gerousness,\" and evaluating standards for determining competency to stand trial. Examples of biomedical research on practices intended to improve the health or well-being of subjects in prisons are stUdies to reduce the spread of infections in crowded environments or to develop new methods of treating drug addiction. Other research, which mayor may not be intended to bene\u00ad fit subjects, includes investigations to increase understanding of the nature and caUses of narcotic or alcohol abuse and a~diction. ~~search conducted or supported by DHEW. Information was made available to the Commission by the Public Health Service (PHS) regarding all biomedical research projects involving prisoners that were conducted or supported since January 1, 1970. In addition, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) provided information on all behavioral research with prisoners that was con\u00ad ducted or supported since July 1, 1971. A summary of this information follows. Biomedical research with prisoners was conducted or supported by five of the six PHS agencies, the exception being the Health Resources Administration. The Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration (ADAMHA) reported conducting over 40 intramural research projects in its testing facility at the Addiction Research Center in Lexington, Kentucky. These studies involved a wide range of activities, such as developing methods for detecting drugs of 26 .. abuse through urinalysis, studies of various properties of morphine and other narcotics, evaluations of methadone~ studies of the effects of amphetamines, analysis of interactions of various drugs with narcotics, and.assessment of the addictive or abuse potential and psychoactive effects of neW drugs. ADAMHA also supported nine extramural studies involving prisoners, including studies of the XVY chromosome anomaly, assessment of clinical methods to predict epi\u00ad sodic violence, study of the use of narcotic antagonists to treat addict in~ mates in a' prison and in a work release program, and study of behavioral and biological correlates of alcoholism. The Center for Disease Control reported three studies with prisoners; these involved vaccines and skin test studies for a parasitic disease. FDA conducted five studies with prisoners, all of which~nvolved oral ad~inistra\u00ad tion of a standard dose of a commercially available antibiotic (Penicillin or Tetracycline). FDA also supported three studies with prisoners (two evaluating skin sensitization by irritants and one studying cyclamates). In the Health Services Administration~ research involving prisoners was conducted by physi\u00ad cians at one PHS hospital (13 studies of metabolic responses to prolonged bed rest) and by physiCians and behavioral scientists at the Research Division, Bureau of Prisons (33 studies involving a wide range of activities, such as dental care, weight reduction and tattoo removal; many ware behavioral and rehabil itative rather thaF11 biomedicii 1 in focus). Seven institutes of the National Institutes of Hea.lth reported support of a total of 19 research pro- grams involving prisoners. This research included studies of vaccines (rubella. rubeola, cholera toxoid, influenza and other respiratory viruses, streptococcus' testicular cell function, treatment of sunwinduced skin conditions, responses 27 :lb. 11 . t , 111 u g to infectious diseases (colds. cholera), pathogenesis of acne, and the effect of diet on blood pressure and lipids. 1 Behavioral research with prisoners conducted or sup~orted by NIMH in- cluded psychological and social research studies of crime and delinquency, individual violence, institutionalization, and law-mental health interactions. Participation of prisoners as subjects in 'these studies was ess~ntial due to the nature of the inquiries. A small number of intramural studies conducted at St. Elizabeths Hospital were related to analysis of procedures used to determine compet~lIcy to stand trial or assess dangerousness of criminally I' insane patients. Support was provided for 19 extramural studies, some of which had biomedical as well as behavioral components. This research included studies (1) to identify sources and patterns of criminal and delinquent be\u00ad havior (the XVV syndrome, attitudes toward criminal behavior); (2) to develop, test or evaluate models for the prevention, treatment or remediation of crimi\u00ad nal behaviors (prediction of v\"iolence, 1 ithium treatment for aggressive behavior, impact of imprisonment on the families of black prisoners, perceptions of the minority prison community, effects of prison environment stress on physical and mental health of inmates and staff); and (3) to define and analyze critical I issues in law and mental health interactions (due process in determination of criminal insanity, assessment of adequacy of treatment for offenders committed to mental institutions, release of dangerous mental patients, the impact of a \"dangerousness\" standard as the sole criterion for involuntary commitment). In addition, NIMH has been directed by Congress 'to study the factors contri\u00ad buting to homosexual rape in prisons. 28 fhapter 4. Extent of Research. Involving PrisOners. The Commission obtained information from all fifty states and the Federal Bureau of Prisons on the policies of each toward research involving prisoners and whether or not research, if permitted, is being conducted. Also, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association surveyed i',s members to assess the extent of pharmaceutical research involving prisoners. These surveys do not document what is generally considered to be a significant amount of social and behavioral research conducted by scholars and by the prison system itself. Research in state and federal prisons. To ascertain the status of state laws, regulations and policies governing research involving prisoners, and to determine where such research is being conducted, state correctional agencies and the Federal Bureau of Prisons were surveyed during the sUlTJTler of 1975. The fo'llowing infor'maMan is based on the reports received at the time from the state-wide agencies and the Bureau of Prisons. It should be noted that the policies and research activities of county and municipal jails were not surveyed. 1. Of the 21 states that permit biomedical research and the 23 states that permit behavioral research in prisons, studies are being con\u00ad ducted in the state prisons of only seven and five states, respectively. 2. Of the seven states in which biomedical research is conducted, , all of the programs are unrelated to the health or well ... being of the ~ubjects and primarily involve drug and cosmetic testing . . 29 1\" __ !OJ, J ( (J.jII: 3. Of the five states in which behavioral research is conducted, all of the programs are characterized \u00ab5 therapeutic in four states, and both thera\u00ad peutic and nontherapeutic research (so characterized) in one state. No state reported conducting research programs involving behavior modification. 4. Eight states prohibit biomedical research: one by legislation, six by departmental policy, and one by moratorium; twenty-two have no specific policy. 5. Five states prohibit behavioral research: one by legislation, three by departmental policy, and one by moratorium; twenty-~hree have no specific policy. 6. Research i~ being conducted only in states that have specific legislation or departmental policies permitting and regulating it. 7. Information provided by the Federal Bureau of Prisons indicated that both b10medical and behavioral research are permitted by departmental policy. Biomedical research (limited to addiction research at Lexington) and behavioral research projects are being conducted.* ~lq~Eation of prJsoners in pharmaceutical testina. The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association conducted a survey of its members to ascertain the extent to which they ~sed prisoner volunteers as subjects for drug testing in 1975. with the focus primarily on phase 1 studies. Fifty-one companies, repre\u00ad senting three-fourths of the members' annual expenditures for re~earch and developmentt responded to the survey. Sixteen of the 51 used prisoners as sub\u00ad jects. * In March 1976, the Director of the Federal BurE\u00a51u of Prisons announced that all biomedical research in federal prisons would be discontil'lued. 30 I ~ ---~~~~------------~~l Of these 16 companies, 14 conducted phase 1 drug research with pris\u00ad oners, employing a total of nearly 3600 prisoners in 100 protocols studying 71 substances. For nine companies, phase 1 testing represented their only use of prisoners as subjects. The percentage of phase 1 testing subjects who were prisoners ranged from 100% (one company) to 2%, with a median of 50% (an average could not be calculated from the data given). The companies listed a total of eight state and six county or municipal prisons as research sites. Ten companies used only minimum security prisons. No companies used detainees in their research. Other categories of volunteer subjects which \" the companies reported using in phase 1 studies included college students, medical students, company employees, residents of foreign countries, mili\u00ad tary personnel, members of fraternal organizations, medical personnel, and the general population. Thirty-three of the 51 companies indicated that they had insurance policies or other mechanisms for compensating subjects who might be injured in research. (There was no determination of the extent to which such poli\u00ad cies or other mechanisms would provide compensation in the absence of legal liability.) 31 .. I i I ! ! ------------------._------------ PART III. ACTIVITIES OF THE tOMMISSION Chapter 5. Site ViSits to Prisons - The Commission made a site visit to the State Prison of Southern Michigan at Jackson on November 14. 1975. In addition, groups of Commission members visited Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla~ the Michigan Intensive Program Center at Marquette, and the California Medical Facility at Vacaville. Prior to the visits, COIIlJlission members were briefed by a fonner prison admin\u00ad istrator, a former prisoner, and a director of research from a pharmaceutical manufacturing firm, regarding conditions to look for and questions that might be asked. The State Prisqn of Southern Michigan at Jackson is the largest peniten\u00ad tiary in the United States, housing overSOOO residents. It is also the site of one of the largest nontherapeutic biomedical research operations, with special buildings on the grounds constructed by two pharmaceutical manufacturers (Parke-Davis and Upjohn) specifically to conduct phase 1 drug studies. Commission members toured the prison facilities, including regular and honor cellblocks, prison industries, the prison infirmary, and the research buildings. They discussed prison procedures with the deputy warden, and research procedures with the vice-chairman of the committee that reviews each research protocol and with members of the research teams. Most of their visit was devoted to discussion of prison conditions and the research program with prisoners. 33 Preceding page blank '., fRM' 7.11 According to materials made available to the Commission, the research conducted at Jackson is primarily phase 1 drug testing, although some phase 2 studies and device testing are also performed. Research protocols must be reviewed and approved by the Protocol Review and Protection Committee (com\u00ad posed of five physicians in the community and at Michigan medical schools, two lawyers and a third lay member) and by the Director of the Department of Corrections. Annual reports of research performed are made to the Review and Protection Committee and the Department; any adverse reactions that occur are reported to the Committee immediately. Infor'mation about the research program is included in the packet of infor\u00ad mation an inmate receives upon entering the prison; there is no additional re\u00ad cruitment or contact with the prisoners by the research personnel unless he requests information about participation. Then the program is described to him in a group meeting, and if he wishes to be considered for research he undergoes a phys'ical examination and laboratory screening tests. Eligibility is contin\u00ad gent upon approval of the prison authorities and passing the screening tests; in addition, subjects must have an IQ of at least 70. Those who qualify enter a common subject pool maintained for the two com\u00ad panies on a card file. When a new protocol is initiated, prisoners' cards are pulled from the front of the file, and the specific protocol is described to them. If they decline to enter the study, they reenter the pool. The studies are about equally divided between inpatient and outpatient trials. Pay is biased on the procedures invol ved, accordi ng to a schedul e devi sed by the PY'O\u00ad tection Committee and approved by the Department of Corrections, and is compara\u00ad ble to pay received in prison industries. Of the 5200 prisoners at Jack,i!Jon, 34 .. approximately 800 are in the research subject pool. The Commission was ad\u00ad vised that medical supervision is close, that a physician is present or on call in the itmlediate vicdnity at all times, that a t,risoner can discontinue' participation in a project at any time,* and that no notation of his partici\u00ad pation in research is made in his official prison recm'd, so that the parole board is' not advised of it. Commission members talked with a representative sample of 80 prisoners both individually and in groups. The sample was selected by Commission staff from the master list of all prison residents, and included both 'research parti\u00ad cipants and'nonparticipants who responded to an invitation to meet with the Commission. In addition, prisoners suggested\u00b7 by other inmates were .interviewed in a group setting. Overall impressions from .this experience were that pris\u00ad oner-participants valued the research opportunity. In general, they felt that they were free to volunteer for or withdraw from the program at will and were given adequate information about research protocols. Nonparticipants expressed various reasons why research was not for them~ but did not object to its being available for others. Participants gave many reasons for volunteering for research, including better living conditions~ need for a good medical evaluation, and desire to perform a worthwhile service to others, but it was clear that the overfiding motivation was the money they received for participating. In fact, their strongest objection was that the pay for participation in research was held * A consent form provided as a sample for review contained a contl'ary implica\u00ad tion. The drug company representatives readily acknowledged that this was a mistake, however, and they gave assurances that the form would be corrected. 35 ___ -!----------------~------------------w--p----------------------------------- down to levels comparable to prison industries. Other complaints focused on limitations to participation rather than on research excesses: if a prisoner stayed on an inpatient study for more than a week, he would lose his prison job seniority; prison officials were said to exclude certain prisoners arbi\u00ad trarily; some prisoners did not seem to get called to participate in research as often as others. They generally rejected the notion that they were coerced into participating in research, and stat$d that they knew their pat'ticipation would not be revealed to the parole board. The major complaints of the participants were directed toward the prison system, not the research program. When asked if research in prisons should be stopped, the prisoners interviewed unanimously said no. They urged correction of what they viewed as inequities (~, that pay be increased, that authorities be for'jjidden arbitrarily to withhold permission to participate), but asked that biomedical research programs in prisons be allowed to continue. As a ,follow-up to the visit to Jackson, the Commission staff compared the characteristics of the 792 men in the drug-testing pool on November 27, 1975 with a randomly selected control sample of similar size. Data came from a computer print-out of the prison's daily roster. Subjects were disproportionately white; although blacks comprise almost 68% of the nonsubject prison population, they are only about 31% of the subject pool. (Data furnished to the Commission by Dr. William Woodward of the University of Maryland showed a similar inverted racial pattern in the biomedical research program'at the Maryland House of Corrections at Jessup.) At Jackson, subjects tended to be older than nonsubjects, to have been in prison much longer (an average of almost two years, compared to one year for nonsubjects), and to have been sentenced to Jackson more times {2.1 36 .. ); times compared to 1.8 times for nonsubjects). There was also a striking over\u00ad representa t i on among the su bj ec ts of men housed in the pr'i son l s two honor blocks. * * * * * In order to observe behavioral programs operating in a prison setting~ groups of Commission members visited a unit of the Washington State Peniten\u00ad tiary at Walla Walla and the Michigan Intensive Program Center at Marquette. Neither program is conducted as research, and the Corrmission is not aware of a behavior modification program in a state or federal prison that is so conducted at present. The program at ~Jalla Walla utilized a therapeutic corrrnunity approach, and dealt with the state's most difficult-to-manage prisoners, who were sent to the unit generally because of unacceptable conduct in the regular system. The unit is operated almo:;t entirely by the prisoners themselves, who serve as the therapeutic community, establishing and enforcing rules of conduct. On entering the program, a prisoner is placed in an isolation cell. His only contacts are visits by the director and other prisoners on the u.nit, who explain the rules to him and urge him to conduct himself in such a way as to be able to join them. When he is willing to conform, he is released from his cell to the open ward. There, the main emphasis becomes retraining in appropriate patterns of s'ocial interaction, using such mechanisms as group discussions of current events, rec\u00ad reational programs, and group therapy. Swearing\" :use of jargon, and fighting are among the numerous forbidden behaviors; violations are punished by a return to the isolation cellI' ;:;(\"ith the group serving as enforcer of the rules and deter\u00ad mining when the violator can return to the ward. 37 1.11 n .\"-II! .... \" 'F F. IiUU\", The primary purpose of the Walla Walla program is to encourage learning of socially acceptable behavior rather than specifically to prepare the pris- oners for return to the outside world or the regular prison system. Most men remain on the unit for long terms. Those who have been released outside the prison are said to have done remarkably well, with recidivism a rare event (fo11ow-up records are apparently not maintained). Return to the regular prison system would be dangerous,' since those in the program gain reputations as informers. Interviews with prisoners in the program yielded only the highest praise for it. Prisoners admitted initial resentment of the isolation treatment, but claimed that it w~s the only way they had ever been made to think seriously about them\u00ad selves and their behavior, ar'i that it provided the necessary impetus for their behavior change. The Michigan Intensive Program Cente;\" {MIPe) at Marguette is a maximum security facility housing difficuit-to-manage prisoners who have been trans- ferred from other facilities in the stat.e. The behavioral program there is based on a six-level token economy_ Privileges and comforts increase as a resident earns enough tokens to progress from the lower to the higher levels. Tokens are earned for correct behavior (making the bed, cleaning the cell, attending educational activities. not fighting, etc.) and are awarded at frequent intervals throughout the day. The purpose of the program is to improve the prisoner's behavior suffi\u00ad ciently to enable him to return to the regular prison system and be manageable there. Interviews with prisoners at the MIPC indicated no enthusiasm for the program. The prisoners seemed to tolerate it grudgingly and submit to the process in order to get baek into regular prison life, but with the determination that nothing done 38 to them in the program was really going to change their behavior. They gener\u00ad ally viewed the program as \"just another lock-up,\" no better or worse than the segregation blocks to which they might have been assigned alternatively. Their major objection was the arbitrariness by whi.l;h the prison system could decide to send them to the MIPC. No figur~s were available on recidivism, nor was there any other means to document the effectiveness of the program. Commission members also visited the California Medical Facility at Vacaville, which houses approximately 1400 inmates. Most of the prisoners are referred to Vacaville for medical or psychiatric reasons, and one~fourth of the population is excluded from participation in research for security reasons. Those who wish to volu~teer sign a roster at the research office, and selection of subjects is made i,l) numerical order from this list. Research conducted at Vacaville includes a large program of skin-testing for hypersensitivity, as well as internal administration of experimental drugs. New volunteers begin with a skin-test study before adv3ncing to higher paying pharmaceutical studies. Other paying prison jobs are available, and at the time of the visit there were unfilled slots for reasons that were unclear but possibly had to do with disparity in Pf:lY or difficulty of the work as compared wittrparticipation in research. Legal counseling is available from law students who visit the prison weekly. Educational programs range from elementary school through a bacca\u00ad laureate degree. There is spot censorship of mail. Telephones aY\"'e availabl'e, but the inmates must pay to use them. 39 Ii , i I 1 .. 1 III n _ U L The iOOJates/ council reviews all research projects and can veto any protocol. Most of the active protocols have also been reviewed by Institu\u00ad tional Review Boards of outside institutions. Informed consent is obtained in writing. and the prisoner receives a copy of the signed fonn. Examination of a card file indicated a significant dropout rate from studies; apparently prisoners feel free to withdraw, even though they know that if they do so frequently, their chances of being invited to participate in future studies will be reduced. 40 Chapter 6. National Mi'l9Y'it!)(C6nf~rence on Human E,xperimentaticm.. In order to assure that minority viewpoints would be heard, the Commission contracted with the National Urban Coalition to organize a conference on human \\', experimentation. The conflerence was held on January 6 .. 8, 1976, at the Shet:'aton Conference Center, Reston, Virginia. Attended by over 200 representatives, it provided a format for presemtations of papers and workshop discussions from which a set of recommendations emerged. The papet's and the recommendations rele\u00ad vant to prison research are summarized below. Joyce Mitchell fook, Pt~. Or. Cook suggests that ethically acceptable research may be assured by a. principle of equality (i.e., that researchers not propose experiments which they or members of their family would not participate in). She argues that the term \"informed consent\" is ambiguous, since it wrongly places the emphasis upon process and information rather than on voluntariness. Dr. Cook adopts the position that volunteering is genuine only if the end to be pursued is one to which the 'I/o.lunteer is devoted. Because of the extraneous motives of prisoners, she concludes that they are volunteers in name only. She -recommends that behavioral rlesearch be permitted only if it directly benefits the participants and can be conducted on hospitai wards rather than in prisons. Dr. Cook conc1udes that experimentation on prisoners ought to be abolished and that the risks of experimentation should be distributed more equally among mem\u00ad bers of the free-living world. Larry r. Palmer, J.D. l~r. Palmer begins with the premise that the ethical problems posed by prison experimentation derive from racial, religious and 41 \\ conflicts and that the issues of prisoners and race are merged. He reconmends gUidelines to encourage scrutiny of: (1) the appropriateness of using prisoners in a particular protocol, (2) the societal priorities asso\u00ad ciated w'ith the research, and (3) the potsl1tial risks and procedures to mini\u00ad mize such risks. He suggests that resea~ch involving prisoners might be regu\u00ad lated by state officials. with additiona'l monitoring and scientific evaluation by professionals and some supervision of the consent process. All deci~lions and consequences reg.rlrdfng experimentat'ion in prisons should be open to public scrutiny. Mr. Palmer sees little justification for a ban on all research in prisons; rather, he advocates a \"scrutiny of values,\" through a statement of the nature, purposes and risks of each protocol in relation to the interests of the prison popu1ation. L. Alex Swan t Ph.D., LL.B. Dr. Swan argues that behavioral research is ~.Iii/_I.\"'~ \"~ ail1,~~d at quell fng d'issident prisoners who view their incarceration in pol itical and econ~mic terms. He suggests that such research ought instead to promote \"human l1berationll by exposing oppressive conditions in prison. He advocates self-determination for prisoners, particularly with regard to the goals of social and behavioral research, and challenges social and behavioral scientists to accept responsibility for the possible misuse of their research findings. Or. Swan asserts that scientific manipulation of prisoners to conform to the will Of the state is unethical, just as it is unethical to use scientific tech\u00ad niques for disciplinary or punitive purposes. He further states that experi\u00ad mentation on the brain to alter behavior violates the inmate's independence and right to free speech, that the prison system ;s so inherently coercive that in\u00ad formed and voluntary consent is impossible, that labeling of prisoners as aggres- ,.--~. 42 .. sive or violent for research purpose~ is dishonest and repressive, and that , . civil liberties are endangered by behavior modification techniques in prisons because of the closed nature of such institutions. Recommenda ti OriS' of Mi nod ty . Conference' workShOps\u00bbn . research i nvo 1 vi n.9 prisoners. Two workshops were devoted to the topic of research involving prisoners. The first of these recommended a moratorium on all nontherapeutic biomedical research in prisons until a comprehensive evaluation-of human experi\u00ad mentation has been made. This evaluation should include consideration of the purpose of research involving prisoners, criteria for selection of subjects, assessment of risks, government responsibility for regulating research in pris\u00ad ons, responsibility of professional organizations regarding such research, the role of prisoners in the supervision of the research, the fixing of financial responsibility including compensation for harm resulting from research, and access of prisoners to official bodies outside the prison. The workshop also recommended that behavioral research be redirected from a focus on the indivi\u00ad dual prisoner to the goal of understanding the nature of prisons and their effects on individual prisoners. Recommendations were not proposed regarding informed consent because of doubts that it is possible to obtain informed con\u00ad sent in our prisons. The second workshop recommended the establishment of a permanent commission to regulate human experimentation. a ban on biomedical research and psychosurgery in prisons, establishment of a human subjects review committee with prisoner representation, and the provision of technical and legal resources to prisoners who are potential subjects of human experimentation. 43 ~~aRter 7. Public Hearing On January 9, 1976, the Commission conducted a public hearing on the issue of research involving prisoners. Summaries of the presentations that were made to the Commission follow. Gabe Kaimowitz (Senior Staff Attorney, Michigan Legal Services) suggested I\" ....... that researchers assume that there is informed consent, and that they often fail to use adequate control subjects, particularly in behavioral research. Further, investigators may limit public access to information about prison research projects. He stated that they often use captive populations without considering the availabil ity of community volunteers. and too often apply medi\u00ad calor psychological models inappropriate to economic and social problems. Prisoners are in an inherently coercive environment, and their consent to re\u00ad search is always suspect. Mr, Kaimowitz is not opposed to therapeutic biomedi\u00ad calor behavioral research when the prisoners themselves request its implementa- T' .. 10n. In such situations a review committee should examine the conditions that caused the prisoners to make such a request. M.!tt,hew. ,L. ~ers (National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union Fcundation) stated that informed consent is not feasible in the prison environment. Regardless of prison policy concerning participation in research and parole, prisoners may believe that involvement contributes to early release. They may also partiCipate to escape from the routine of prison life or to earn money for necessities. Mr. Myers sa.id that most medical experimentation is conducted in medium or maximum security facilities in which conditions are 44 i \" .. oppressive, alternatives are few, and there is a potential for abuse due to the closed, isolated and coercive nature of the prisons. William R. Martin, 'M.D. (Director, Addiction Research Center, National Institute on Drug Abuse, DHEW) stated that addiction resea~ch is important and necessary both for society and for the prisoners. Limiting such research will retard development of therapy for addicts and will prohibit the evaluation of the addictive properties of new analges;c~, Research participation is bene .. I ficial to most prisoners, he said, in that it is generally a safe and construc .. tive experience, often improves health, and is a source of pride. Dr. Martin has been unable to identify any other population in which such studies can be done as validly and safely as in prisoners. He feels that prisoner partici\u00ad pation may be altruistic, and therefore society should compensate participants for their involvement and for any injuries that may occur. There is empirical evidence that prisoners can and do make informed judgments, and are equally knowledgeable about research programs as other subjects. Practical measures can be taken to minimize the seductiveness of the research setting compared to the prison environment. Theodore Francis (Occupational Drug Use Program~ New York State Office of Drug Abuse Services) urged that biomedical and behavioral research in , , prisons continue, but that more attention be paid to compensation t the level of health care provided to subjects, and review of behavioral research. Participation of prisoners should be ju~ged an ,acceptable means of earning money, and inmates should be reimbursed according to discomforts and risks incurred. Money earned should be held in escrow for prisoners until release qq, 'T or paid to their families. A national board should review all behavior modi\u00ad fication research for efficacy, validity, and risks to individua1s and to the community. This board would issue public notices in lay language, describing dates and place of the research. as well as the reimbursement provisions. Mjchael S. Lott!OOP, (Comm'ission on the Mentally Disabled, American Bar Association, and the National Association for Retarded Citizens) urged that special care be given to protecting the rights of mentally disabled prisoners. Thereafter, testifying as an individual, he opposed nontherapeutic biomedical research on prisoners which exposes them to risk 'of discomfort, pain or inca\u00ad pacity. He stated that the coercive and oppressive nature of penal institutions precludes obtaining vo :untary informed consent. Prisoner's are not physiologi\u00ad cally unique and therefore provide no information which cannot be gained from a free population. Research on prisoners benefits drug companies and researchers, he said. If research is to continue in prisons, particular care should be given to protecting the rights of mentally retarded prisoners, and an independent body should certify that each subject can and has given informed consent. Mr. Lottman is not opposed to therapeutic biomedical research in a prison , setting, provided there are proper controls and consent procedures. Joseph Stetler (President, Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association) stated that to the best of his knowledge no prisoner has died or been permanently in\u00ad jured from research sponsored by drug companies. He advocated continu~tion of drug research in prisons provided that: (1) researchers are qual ified, (2) faci\u00ad lities are adequate. (3) participation is voluntary and informed, (4) research is monitored. and (5) prisoners are compensated fairly. He stated that prisons 46 j ~ I \\ ! .. I I I , I 1 ~ ~ - ~-~-~---- are practical and safe for drug testing, and that discontinuance of such re-.. search might delay development of new drugs. He estimated that 85% nf all. phase 1 drug testing is done on prisoners, and that the rate of compensation could increase substantially and still be insignificant relative to the total cost of new drug development. Prisoner testing of cosmetics or over-the\u00ad counter drugs is minimal relative to research involving prescription medica\u00ad tions. A 1975 policy statement of PMA on the conduct of clinical research was sUl11Tlarized. Allan H. Lawson (Executive Director, Prisoners' Rights Council of Pennsyl\u00ad vania) held that prisoners should be permitted to participate in experimentation, only if the decision is absolutely voluntary. This is impossible in today's prisons, he said, because of economic pressures! forced idleness and inhuman conditions. In his view, research programs provide an excuse to prison admin\u00ad istrators to neglect responsibilities such as housing$ medical care tmdjob programs. Because of the reality of economic pressures, the Prisoners' Rights Council would permit some research in prisons provided safeguards are instituted, until other means of earning money are available. However, the Council would ban research which involves exposure to incurable diseases or is otherwise dangerous or unnecessary. Mr. Lawson urged tha~ medical care and compensation be provided for inmates injured during research. The Reverend Americus Roy (Prisoners Aid Association of Maryland, Inc.) testified against medical experimentation in prisons based on personal experience at the Maryland House of Corrections. Prisoners participate in research, he said, I because of economic deprivation and as a temporary escape from inhuman condition$~ 47 \u00b71 I I Use of prisom~rs is exploitative of the economically r,iepressed. Risks of research .shou1d be widely distributed, especially among those who are 1 ikely to benefit. 48 .. PART IV. REPORTS TO THE COMMISSION Chapter 8. Philosophical Perspectives Papers on the ethical issues involved in research with prisoners were prepared for the Commission by Roy Branson, Ph.D., Cornel Ronald West, M.A., and Marx W. Wartofsky, Ph.D. pro Branson first analyzes the ethical principles underlying the standard arguments for and against research involving prisoners, and, secondly, examines several policy alternatives. He concludes by recommending a moratorium, appeal\u00ad ing to the principles of free and informed consent and justice. In reviewing arguments for experimentation, Dr. Branson cites three justifications generally advanced in support of research involving prisoners: (1) that it contributes to the good of society, of which prisoners are members and therefore recipients of benefits; (2) that it is an appropriate way for prisoners to make reparation; and (3) that prisoners can, in fact, give free and informed consent. A varient of the third argument is that criminal con ... viction presupposes competence and responsibility; therefore, prisoners must be presumed to have the capacity to volunteer. In fact, advocates of this position point out that prisoners are permitted to choose work in hazardous industries and so should be permitted to choose work as research subjects as well. Opponents of prison research assume that experimentation is different from other occupations. A person's relationship to his body is not his re-v lationship to his goods. A person's body, in a special and real sense, is 49 ---.. --~-~--.---~- ..... -- \"N ,r .P, I Ii \",...8. U Ma .... t I II the person. In experimentation risk to bodily integrity is primary to the activity, whereas in other occupations, the risk is secondary. The two fundamental principles to which opponents of experimentation appeal are free and informed consent and justice. Those citing consent can say that prisoners cannot jn erJnciple give free consent because of the in\u00ad herent nature of prisons as coercive~ total institutions. Other opponents appeali'ng to free consent do not go so far. They claim that sufficiently free consent to experimentation cannot in f?c~ be given in American prisons. They cite not only the coercive structure of prisons, but such administrative features as limited alternative to earn money in prisons (none for equivalent rates of pay), and indeterminate release dates with nonobjective or unknown conditions for leaving the prison. Dr. Branson identifies himself with the second position, saying that empirical analyses leave a serious and reasonable doubt that inmates of American prisons can in fact give a sufficiently free consent to experimentation. Justice is the other principle to which opponents of prisoner experi\u00ad ment4tion appeal. Injustice can take the form of injury, when a person is wrongfully harmed through exploitation or negligence by others. Injustice can also result from failure to follow the basic requirement of distributive or comparative justice: that 1 ike cases are to be treated al ike and diff,~rent cases be treated differently. Since prisoners are in relevant respects equal to free persons, the burdens of risk and hank should be proportional to those of free~living citizens, which would entail a significant reduction in at least phase 1 drug trials. On the other hand, prisoners are unequal to free persons in important, respects in that they have been placed in total institutions. 50 .' Dr. Branson. citing comparative justice, says the similarities of prisoners to free persons requi res that the proportion of experimentation uti1izin~~ \" prisoners should be reduced. The differences between experimentation con~ ducted on prisoners and those conducted on free persons require that pris\u00ad oner experimentation be stopped, at least until conditions change. In applying principles to policy alternatives, Dr. Branson sees remunera\u00ad tion as a major and finally insurmountable practical obstacle to prisoner ex\u00ad perimentation. The principle of informed consent dictates that in order for prisoners to give consent that is not coerced, they should not be paid more for experimentation 'than for other prison jobs. But the principle of justice requires that rates of remuneration to prisoners should be equivalent to the rates paid to free volunteers. Schemes relying on committees of prlson,ers (or prisoners and prison officials) controlling funds created by the difference between the standard amount paid by drug companies and what an individual pris\u00ad oner received run into practical problems, for the committee itself could mani\u00ad pulate and coerce prisoners. Dr. Branson's recommendation, therefore, is that the Commission declare a moratorium on prison research and suggest that if and when conditions in American prisons have improved, then research might be resumed in those faci\u00ad lities which can meet the requirements of informed consent and justice. He;, . H would not preclude: the possibil ity of offering innovative therapy to an indi~~ vidual inmate in need of treatment,. but this. he says, should be distinguished from programs of \"therapeutic research\" which blur the distinction between ! ff individual therapy and experimentation. He suggests, in addition, that the moratorium extend to behavioral research, since new behavioral therapies may 51 III I be evaluated first on nonprisoners, but that observational research (non;n\u00ad terventional behavioral reseat'eh), as well as educational programs, be per\u00ad mitted to continue. Mr. West advocates a contractual approach to human experimentation which ~~~ requires full disc1o:sure~ written consent and choices that are rational. These requ'irements reflect the human rights to know, to choose and to be treated fairly He d'1stinglJishes between coercion (which involves threats) and bribery (which involves .manipulation of incentives). Mr. West considers requests for prisoners to participate 'in research to be bribery, not coercion; hence, choice is at 0\"-~~~{ay. The paucity of alternatives and the conditions of domination within pris\u00ad (ms, however., undermine the rational basis for such choice. Mr. \"~est concedes that u certain degree of control over pr;coners might be warranted, but only \\\\ to the extent that ba~ic human rights are not violated. The necessity for such control. he believes, suggests that prisoners are less appropriate subjects for research than are nonprisoners. Therefore, he urges that normal volunteers be recruited, instead; but he cautions 3gainst shifting the burden of research to Third \\~orld populations . Mr. ~Jest v'jews behavioral research in prisons to be nontherapeutic, inasmuch as the rehabilitative efficacy of behavior modification programs has not been demonstrated. Thus, he would restrict such research according to the same pt~inciples he applied for nontherapeutic biomedical research. Mr. West rer~ends termination of both nontherapeutic biomedical and IItherapeutic\\' 'behavioral research involving prisoners until such time as prison reform ('l'eatesthe condi1:ions necessary for their legitimate participation in 1\":'1 such research. 52 .. .. Dr. Wartofs~>v begins his essay on selling the services of one's body for research by discussing the extent to which being a subject is similar to other forms of wage-labor. He examines the natu~e of that which is being sold (and bought), and the extent to which a person has the right to offer his or her body in exchange for' money. His p~sition is that whereas one may not sell one's body, as such, nevertheless one may sell the disposition over the use of one's body for sp~cified purposes, for a specified time and under specified conditions. In other words, while one1s lif~ and liberty are inalienable rights (which cannot be separated from one's person and sold), one's services or capacities are commodities which, 'in our free-market social and economic system, are regularly exchanged for wages. Dr. Wartofsky then considers the problem of risk-taking. In general, he says, no ethical question arises concerning ~he risks inherent in dan\u00ad gerous occupations, since the workers are seen as having free choice in undertaking Qr refusing such jobs, and the risks involved are secondary to the needs of society which the occupations (~, coal mining, construction work, chemical manufacturing) are designed to meet. By contrast, the nature of risk in research is such that one is placing one's health or well-being at Y'isk not as a by-product of some other purpose, blAt c;s the primary cOlmlodity; and it is the iriltimacy of the relation between (h..~els person and one's well .. , being IIJhich makes the exchange di sturbing. With respect to motivation, Dr. Wartofsky,observes, it is generally assumed that placing oneself at risk for monetary gain is for one's own bene\u00ad fit, whereas doing it without tangible reward is more altruistic. However~ he points out that one may place oneself at risk for monetary gain and, at ... the same time, be self-sacrificing {if, for example, the purpose is to support 53 one's family or otherwise satisfy the needs of others). Whether working for the abstract \"good of societylJ is a higher motive than working for one's ~. family is a question which cannot be settled. Thus, he conclud~s, motivation should be considered (if at all) only to the extent that the seriousness of the motivation should be commensurate with the degree of risk to be undertaken. Next, he considers the extent to which prostitution is like wage-labor, involving~ as it were, th~,sale of a disposition over one's body for a certai.n purpose, at a certain rate and for a certain time. The relevance of the inquiry lies in the fact that what is being bought and sold in prostitution is (just as in participation in research) something which is \"50 intimate to one's per- son that there is something disturbing' in the notion that it is alienable, as a commodity.\" In his view, the ethical objections to prostitution, and to being a paid research subject, derive from the translation of relations which are supposed to express fundamental aspects of humanity into an economic ex\u00ad change. In the paid research context, both the investigator and the subject are reducing an essential human capacity (putting oneself at risk for. others) to a comnodity; so doing, they may dehumanize each other. K~r-e, he observes, society is faced with a dilemma: on the one hand, research with human subjects is important for the preservation and well-being of the species; on the other hand, the only means of conducting such research is ethically questionable. He sees three obvious solutions: (1) to stop paying the subjects; (2) to conduct only that research which can be carried out with unpaid volunteers; and (3) to restructure society in order to elimi\u00ad nate the economic need which induces (or coerces) the disadvantaged into making up the largest portion of paid reSearch subjects. All of these \"solutions,\" 54 ,. \" .. >\",~ however, are impractical. The pragmatic solution which he recolOOIends, there\u00ad fore, is to minimize the exploitive elements which \"col11Tlodify\" the situation. An alternative would be to follow the model proposed by Hans Jonas in which the most valuable members of society (rather than the most expendable) under\u00ad take the risks, but Dr. Wartofsky considers this also to be impractical. Finally, he proposes that both paid and unpaid research subjects be organized, educated as to their rights, and represented at all levels of review (Institu\u00ad tional Review Boards as well as state and federal commissions)., This, he be\u00ad lieves, would socialize the inter'action, reduce the alienation, and ameliorate the dehumanizing effects of the commodity relationship for both the paid sub\u00ad jects and the researchers. 55 !:f I \u00a3..fl!eter.9., .Soc101ogic:al ilnd BehaY-i,ior?l Perspec,tiv.es In order to obtain an understanding of the nature of the .social structure of a prison and its implications for the prisoner's freedom and competence to make a choice for or against involvement in research, the COll1Tlission requested papers by two sociologists: Jackwell Susman, Ph.D., Irwin, Ph.D. In addition t Martin Groder, M.D.~ prepared a paper on behavioral research aimed at rehabilitation of prisoners. These essays are summarized below. Q!!~~~n. sijggests that a determination regarding prisoners' partici\u00ad pation in biomedical or behavioral research depends on understanding their value system and how it deviates from conventional norms. He describes two sets of norms in prison society: (1) the norms which the staff and officials endorse and which support their authority, and (2) the norms of the inmates, which encourage diversity of behavior and subversion of the official system. It is generally agreed that custody involves profound attacks on the prisoner's self~image through deprivation and control. Inmates cope with the \"pains of imprisonment\" through various social structures, norms and values. From the Sociological literature on prisons and prison life, Dr. Susman identi\u00ad fies two descript'ive model s of prison \"prisoner sol idarity\" image and the \"prisoner diversity\" image. As described by Or. Susm~an, the prisoner solidarity image classifies pris\u00ad oners according to their conformity to or deviation from the inmate code which encourages cohesion and mutual support among prisoners y)s-a-vis their captors. AdhtH'Cnce to the inmate code hel ps protect the average inmate and strengthens 56 .. his dignity. A negative aspect of this social structure is the tlependence of most prisoners on the few leaders for privileges and protection. The con\u00ad vict leaders are granted special privileges by the administratio{\"' in return for maintaining order, and thus seem to have little incentive to participate in biomedical and behavioral research. The rest of the inmates may adapt differently to prison life. Some may confor~ with varying degrees of inten\u00ad sity to the demands of t.he inmate code, and might reject biomedical and be\u00ad havioral research since the code rejects conventi~nal values and cooperation. Others may deviate from the norms of the prisoners\u00b7 world and participate in research to'obtain the goods and services their outcast status denies them. still others may combine conformity and deviance to maximize their chances of leaving prison emotionally and physically unscathed; their participation in research would depend on a careful analysis of the costs and b~nefits, in terms of their life in prison and their chances of getting out. Fina11y, some may conform completely to the official norms and may volunteer for re\u00ad search for both altruistic and pragmatic reasons. The second model of p\\\"ison society, the pr'isoner diversity image, focuses on the inmates\u00b7 identification with persons or groups outside the prison. In\u00ad this view, the inmates bring subcultural norms and values with them into prison, and, thus, prison society is diverse. This model describes inmates according to three categories. First is the career criminal or professional thief, who assumes a commitment not to prison life but to criminal lifestyles. His objective is to do his time and get out, not to manipulate the prison environment. He may volunteer for research believing that it will be considered favorably by the parole board, or merely to maximize h'is comfort, until he is released. Second 57 (( is the Ilconvict,\" who is oriented primarily to prison life and seeks status by manipulating the environmentt winning special privileges and asserting influence over others. His participation in research is improbable because it might imply cooperation with the staff. The third group of inmates identify with \"legitimate\" subculture outside the prison. They have no corrmitment to the values of thieves or convicts and seek status through the means provided by the prison administration. They are usually rejected by the convict and thief subcultures; and might be expected to volunteer for research projects. Dr. Susman examines the implications of these models of prison society for the requirements of informed consent: competency~ knowledge and volun\u00ad tariness. Rejecting the ~ ....... al1zation, Dr. Susman believes that prisoners are able to maintain an identity. lie suggests that prisoners' autonomy may expand or contract depending on their circumstances. and that at least some prisoners have sufficient autonomy to give informed consent to participate in research. Providing prisoners with knowledge of the risks associated with research may be difficult, but Dr. Susman believes in principle that it can be done satisfactorily. With respect to voluntariness, both images of prison society indicate that prisoners have a great deal of power andinfluenc~ over how the prison is run. This implies that mechanisms could be developed to insulate research activities from staff and peer pressure. Or. Susnmn concludes that prisoners can have the freedom and competence to give informed tonsent .Qr~lryl~n agrees with Dr. Susman that biomedical research involvii1g pris\u00ad oners should not be categorically denied, but rather permitted under conditions 58 ~hat protect against the disparity of bargaining power between prisoners and authorities. Instead of a contract model (which assumes relatively equal bargaining power) Dr. Irwin suggests a \"rights model ,II in which minil1'.al rights are established and guaranteed agai~st abuse of power. He observes that con\u00ad ditions of degradation and coercion vary with the degree of autonomy and ;so- ! . lation under which prisons.operate, and he believes that most of the constraints (including arbitrary use of d,iscretionary powers) a.re, in fact, unnecessary and could be abandoned without interfering with effective operation of the penal system. This, he says, would make the prison environment compatible with con\u00ad ditions necessary for the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Irwin recommends, 'therefore, an accreditation process and an ongoing review mechanism, in which prisoners, their families and civil rights groups all participate, with a concomitant reduction of discretionary powers now held by prison authorities. He would also require that drug firms pay at the same rate that they PRY nonprisoner participants, but that the difference between those wages and the prevailing prison wages be placed in a fund to increase the wages for the general prison population. He would also elimi\u00ad nate any leakage of information to ?arole boards about research participation. Finally, he recommends that there be established a revieYI and grievance mecha\u00ad nism independent of the prison system in which prisoners, their families and civil rights organizations would participate. This mechanism would review all decision-making relative to prisoners I rights and perhaps consider, as well, such factors as the adequacy of the health care available to the prisoners. Dr. Groder, formerly warden-designate rf the Federal Correctional Insti\u00ad tution at Butner~ North Carolina, observes that of all research involving 59 \\) ~---- .~~==::::::::::::::::::-::~~~~ .--- prisoners, only therapeutic psychosocial research directly addresses lithe promise of rehnbl1 itation. II Unl ess society is will ing del iberately and in\u00ad tentionally to abandon its commitment to rehabilitation, he argues, research of high quality 1s essential if services are to be provided to offenders in a safe. effective and humane manner. He believes that offenders, as wi.lrds of the state, have a \"right to treatment\" that will be abridged if correctional research is aDolished or stifled through overregulation. Or. Grader accepts the likelihood that the Camnission will wish to recommend additional regulatory procedures, and suggests the following goals: (1) \"wards of the state\" should be provided an opportunity to rejoin the social mainstream; (2) the quality of consent should be audited to protect basic rights of volun\u00ad teers; (3) provision should be made for care, compensation t and possible rever\u00ad sal if a bad effect occurs; arId (4) the outcome of all research should be pub\u00ad lished. Or. Groder recommends that Congress appoint regional boards with the responsibility of achieving the four goals and ensuring prisoner rights. The boards would approve or disapprove projects, and appeals could be made to the fdderol court of appeals. The boards should sponsor studies of the correctional process and the impact of research, and make recommendations to Congress regarding pertinont legislation. Dr. Grader believes, on the basis of his experience, that therapies can be devised to enable prisoners to reenter and remain in the mainstream of society, and he t~autians that a ban or limitation on such research will ensure that no correctional innovations will be developed. Therapeutic techniques that become available in nonp~\"ison society may also be denied to prisoners, and that would pervert the desire to rehabilitate prisoners as well as i~fringe upon their right to treatment. 60 I ~ ! 1 \\ ! ( I I ! Chapter 10. Legal Perspectives The Center for Law and Health Sciences, Boston University School of Law, prepared for the Commission an analysis of the law relevant to determinino the OJ , , validity of consent by prisoners to their participation in r~search. This analysis proceeded on the assumption (consistent with the findings of the Com\u00ad mission) that quality of info~roation and ability to comprehend do not generally constitute problem areas in prison research. The key issues reviewed by the Center are whether consent can be given voluntarily in the prison environment, and whether voluntary consent to treatment' (and, by extension, to behavioral programs that might not constitute \"treatmentll) is r.eQuired. The first of these issues is discussed primarily in the context of nontherapeutic biomedical research, and the second is raised in connection with behaYior modification pro~ grams. ) Motivations of prisoners to participate in nontherapeutic research include financial reward, hope for reduction of sentence, seeking of medical or psychia~ tric help, relief from tedium, desire for better or more secure living conditions, attraction of risk-taking, altruism, etc. The conditions that give rise to these motivations may constitute duress such as would render a contract voidable and, by analogy, render it difficult if not impossible to uphold a prisoner's Ilinformed consent\" to participation in research. It has been argued, but not determined as a matter of law, that incarceration 'inherently constitutes such coercion (9r duress) that nontherapeutic research should not be conducted in prisons. In the absence of such a determination, courts will examine particular prison situation' <.\"\"\\ for evidence of duress in obtai'ning consent to participation in research. 61 Thus, as to financial reward; the questions to be asked are whether there are alternative sources of equal income and, more importantly, whether partici\u00ad pation in research is the only way prisoners can earn enough money to maintain a minimum standard of living. As to living conditions, the questions would concern the e)(tent of deprivation in the prison, and the contrast between the prison environment and conditions in the research center. These are matters aT fact that wtl)uld be examined in a particular situation to determine whether a consent was voluntary. Promise of reduction of sentence is now generally thcught tc be inherently coercive, but, at least with respect to rehabilitative treatment that may be of experimental 111ature. sentence reducticns have been tied to priscners I ccn\u00ad sent. Cases involving waiver .of rights indicate that even in a ccercive situa\u00ad tion, rights mal' be waiveq if adequate safeguards, ~, ccunsel, are provided. Medical treatment generally constitutes a battery if the patient has nct consented to it. Although one jurisdiction has not applied this rule in cases invo1ving prisoners. other jurisdicticns have held tc the effect that imprison\u00ad ment does not deprive a person .of the capacity to decide whether or not to ~on\u00ad sent to health care. The latter rule has been applied in cases dealing with physically invasive behavicr modification techniques, but there is no holding on the right to withhold consent tc noninvasive behavior mcdification techniques. Whether\u00b7or not the techniques were experimental does nct appear to have been materia1 in any of the holdings. Rather, the courts appear to have taken into account the degree .of invasiveness. State regulations and statutes dealing with experimentaticn .on priscners COVer the entire spectrum, frcm permission to total bans .of such research. 62 \" Where any sort of research involving p,r',isoners is permitted, a requirement that informed consent be obtained is explicitly set forth. Where financial or other rewards are expl icitly covered, they are generally 1 i.J1lited or pro\u00ad hibited. The recently published DHEW proposals related to research on pris\u00ad oners follow the states that permit such research by accepting the view that prisoners can consent to be subjects so long as adequate safeguards are pro\u00ad vided. The proposals published for public comment by DHEW (November 16, 1973) include such safeguards as a required certification by a review commit\u00ad tee that there are no undue inducements to participation by prisoners, taking into account the comparability of the earnings otherwise offered; a require\u00ad ment that no reduction in sentence or parole in return for participation in research be offered unless it is comparable to what is offered in return for other activities; and a provision for accreditation by DHEW of prisons in which research is to be supported or cunducted. A subsequent OHEW Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (August 23, 1974) adds a requirement that the review com\u00ad mittee also take into account whether living conditions, medical care, etc. would be better for participants than those generally available to prisoners, but deletes the provision for accreditat.ion by DHEW. The report by the Center for Law and Health Sciences concludes with the following recommendations: that provision for accreditation by DHEW should be made, to ensure that research will not be conducted under such circumstances that participation is the only way for a prisoner to obtain minimally decent living conditions; that the rewards for participation should not be such that they provide the only way for a prisoner to maintain his health and personal hygiene, or induce a person to incur great personal risks; that parole or a 63 ~\u00a3t.tl ,,1$ 1f reduction in sentence should never be offered in return for participation in research; that there should be some provision for the protective role of an independent counselor; that full information about the research should be given the prospec~ive participant, and that he should not be asked to waive his rights ag.ainst anyone for injuries that he might sustain. If these safeguards are adopted, the law generally will recognize the informed consent of a prisoner to participation in research. 64 \" Chapter 11. Alternatives and Foreign Practices \" , Alternatives employed in the United States and foreign countries to the conduct of biomedical research in prisons were examined by the Commission. A paper on alternative populations for conducting phase 1 drug studies was prepared by Or. John Arnold. Informati.on on two programs using normal volun\u00ad teers as alternatives to prisoners, one for vaccine testing and 'fne for general physiologic testing, was provided by staff reports. An additional staff report was prepared on the use of prisoners in a research program located in a hospital outside of the prison. Practices in foreign countries ~-:/;';; related to development and testing of new pharmacologic agents Wt;~~/'surveyed and reported to the Commission by Mr. C. Stewart Snoddy and Or. Marvin E. Jaffe, Clinical Research international, Merck Sharp & Oohme. The Quincy Research Cent~\u00b7 0]'..: John Arnold, Director, is an innova,tive phase 1 drug testing program using cloistered, normal volunteers. It was recently establ ished in Kansas City, Missouri. Or. Arnold, an investiga'tci\", with 29 years of experience in drug testing in prisons, highlights some of the practical and ethical problems associated with the use of such a research population, and explains the reasons he now believes that the use of prison inmates as research subjects should be phased out. He identi\u00b7fies limitations imposed by the prison system on the. optimal conduct of such studies, and his reasons for believing that the use of nonprisoner volunteers for them is pre\u00ad ferable. Cloistering., he says, is necessary to enable the researcher to strictl. control the medications received, to intensively monitor subjects for signs of , __ adverse effects, and to identify drug properties with greater confidence. In 65 I ~ I -----~ - lH 4 SIt If (b ,-, contrast with research fac11 ities designed exclusively for the cloistering ., of free-world volunteers for phase 1 studies, however, prisons are neither built nor operated around the needs of medical research. The prison environ\u00ad ment may be poorly controlled, particularly with regard to the presence of contraband drugs that may seriously influence the result of a clinical trial. Further. the dropout rate for his free-world studies has been a.bout 1.5 per\u00ad r.eni. a lower rate than he experienced in a prison setting. Dr. Arnold suggests that the behavioral problems associated with cloistering volunteers are the greatest barrier to the development of alternative populations, and' ~eqyire sensitivity wlth reg8r\"d to volunteer se1ection, adequate preparation for th(~ experience of' complete control of life .. style, and physttal faciHt'fes that are attractive and interesting. The second largest proD'lem is the cost. . . ::. While: ltidg'ing and food contribute to this expense, the single largest increment st~lJ from the oreater degree of supervision and closer medical control required for volunt(~ers in a nonprison sett'ing. Despite tho problems J Or. Arnold believes the advantages make the use of nonpr'if;Onet'l~; pr'cferabl0. (Ine advantage he cites relates to compensation for injury, which the consent form should address. While an indemnification plan simillw to those governing other occupational hazards can be arranged for non ... prisoner vo1unteers. it. cal'mot necessarily be done for prisoners. Rates for the Quincy workman's coopensat1on insurance are based on data that show the risks for parti~ipants in phose 1 drug r~search to be only slightly greater than 'the oc(~upational risks for office secretaries, one-seventh of those for windOW was.H:n~s, and one ... ninth of 'the dsks for miners. I long-term follow~up and extend~d care i because prisoners are not likely to return to prison for follow-up examinations or medical attention, is also reduced by using a free-living pop~lation. pro Arnold believes that three advantages of the free-world volunteer system will eventually lead to its exclusive use: (1) paid stipends can be comparable to wages paid for other services, (2) indemnification can be offered under plans similar to workman's compensation, and (3) volunteers may choose medical research against other forms of limited employment without any special coercive force. Or. Arnold described characteristics of the population attracte~to his nonprisoner volunteer program, based on the last 150 subjects at the Quincy Research Center. The men were 80% white, rS%black, and 5% other racial back- ground. Age group was 50% age 20-30, 40% age 30-40, and 10% age 40~55. Ninety percent were recently or seasonally unemployed, 8% steadily unemployed, and 2% were college studp.nts. Most had completed 8th grade, 60% had completed 12th grade, 2% were college students, and 0.5% were college graduates. Approximately 60% of the s~lbjects were former pri soners; 5 to 10% had been subjects in Or. Arnold's earlier stUdies in prisons. T.he Clinical R~search Center for Vaccine Oeveloement (CRCVD) was developed to provide an alternative to the Use of prisoners in, infectious disease research. It was established in 1974 under a contract with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the primary inpetus being NIAI&:3 desire to develop a dependable source of healthy, adult volunteers that would ~\\ circumvent many of th~ problems plaguing its prison-based researchajf allow 67 I I .n .. \u00b7 -------------- () infectious disease research to continue. A contract was awarded to the Uni\u00ad versity of Maryland School of Medicine to demonstrate the feasibility of recruiting adult volunteers from the community for research in which live attenuated vaccines for respiratory viruses and mycoplasma are administered to subjects to test infectious capability, symptoms produced, ability to in- 'if duce inmunity, and contag\"iosity. The CRCVD is under the direct supervision of two physician-researchers who conduct the protocols developed by NIAID. They are assisted by two part\u00ad time recruiters, a consu1ting psychologist, and support staff. The facility is part of the University of Maryland School of Medicine complex in Baltimore; its major unit is a self-contained, limited access, air-sealed isolation ward, whet'a volunteers reside for the duration of the study. Recruiting procedures have focused on attracting young, intelligent and healthy adults, to minimize problems with informed consent and adjustment to the dormitory-like setting of the isolation ward. College students were selected as ~ne free~world population most iikely to meet these requirements. Recruiters present information on the program at college campuses; interested students subsequently meet with the recruiters so that a blood sample may be drawn. Those volunteers who pass this initial screening procedure are contacted by the t'~cruiters and offered the opportunity to participate as subjects. Most of the studies conducted by the CRCVD last between 15 and 30 days. During a two-day acclimation period on the unit, there are intensive educa\u00ad tional presentations concerning vaccine develo~lent and the upcoming study, preliminary medical and psychological screening procedures are conducted; and 68 the volunteers become acquainted with the isolation ward environment and staff. The researchers reserve the right to dismiss volunteers prior to inoculation, but thereafter only the subject may choose to withdraw from a study. To supplement the consent form, an examination is administer'ed prior to inoculation, to assess and document the participant's comprehension of the research protocol. Each volunteer must pass this exam before being permitted to -participate in a study. The volunteers earn $20 per day on the isolation ward, based on what the avera:ge college student might earn in a summer job. Volunteers who withdraw from the study are paid up to the point they drop out, whether or not a public health quarantine has been imposed, requiring every subject to remain on the ward until completion of the study. The consent forms note that any medical problems that may ~,\"'ise will be treated at the CRCVD's ex- pense. As of June 1975, 70 volunteers had participated in nine studies, and the subject pool consisted of 547 people. The age range is between 18 and 50. Of the 70 people who have completed studies, there wer1 4 with less than four years of high school, 30 high school graduates, 19 college undergraduates, 12 college graduates, and 5 with advanced degrees; 84% were white~ 7% were former prisoners. The Normal Volunteer Patient Programof the Cl~.1 Center, National Ins~:itutes of HeCi lth, was establ i shed in 1954 and rt~presents one of the earliest efforts to involve members of the cOll11luni,ty in experimental studies. Volunteers participate in research designed primarily to measure the parameters 69 '\\ \\, of normal body functions. Most of the subjects are members of certain religious sects which view participation in this program as part of their public service COlMli tment (~.!.g.!., Church of the Brethren, Mennon; tes s t~ormons) and college stu\u00ad dents. While the volunteers in both categories receive little in terms of fi\u00ad nancial compensation (usually restricted to transportation and living expenses), the student volunteers t who reside at the Clinical Center for up to three months on ucareer development internships,\" are offered an opportunity to study with NIH sC'ientists in many of the research laboratories. Hence, the program appeals primarily to students interested in careers in the health sciences and related fields. Recruitment of many of the volunteers for the program is done by colleges under contract with the NIH. The contractor college or university is responsi\u00ad ble for hanq~lng all the local recruitment details, transporting the volunteers to and rromithe Clinical Center$ and providing any transportation required for follow~up procedures. In return, the contractor receives a fixed fee for each volunteer (to cover the cost of round trip air fare and ground transportation to and from the airport) plus a certain amount for each day of the volunteers' time and inconvenience. Prospective participants in the program are advised of its purposes and the restrictions in life~style they may experience during their sojourn at the Clinical Center. Studies in which they are asked to participate include, for example, studies of normal physiology (awake, asleep and during exercise), psychological studies (reaction time, attention), dietary manipulation, studies involving drugs. hormones or tracer doses or radioisotope administered either 70 1_ 17 ' .... tt ._ t~ orally or by injection, and exposure to viruses or biochemical products derived from viruses or bacteria. The Eli Lilly Company Research Uni~. located at Wishard Memorial Hospital, Indianapolis, Indiana, employs prisoner and nonprisoner normal volunteers in phase 1 drug studies. The prisoners come to the hospital unit from Pendleton State Reformatory 30 miles away; most of them have previous1y participated in pharmaceutical studies in the Lilly unit at the prison. All studies involving the initial administration of an agent to humans, use of radioisotopes, or tests requiring complex monitoring equipment are done at the hospital unit rather than at the prison unit. Prisoner volunteers, in ~rder to qualify for participation in the Lilly hospital research program, generally must meet the basic work-release require\u00ad ments: a date set for parole or for a parole hearing, and one year of good \\ behavior. In addition, specific permission froln the warden is reqtdred. These restrictions are imposed to make escape less likely. Other work-release choices, when available, generally offer better pay and more freedom of movement. A prisoner participates at the hospital only once and returns to the prison after\u00ad ward. The stay at the hospital may be as long as three months. While at the hospital, prisoners are required to remain on the research ward. They have limited recreation facilities but may have visitors daily. No special security precautions are taken, but escapes from the unit have been rare. Two hospital wings adjOining the prisoner research unit are used for phase 2 studies in patients and phase 1 studies in nonprisoner normal volun\u00ad teers. The later are generally men off the stret:!ts, chronically unemployed,' 71 2 I. a ,P ter who know of the program and request on their own~ often repeatedly, to parti\u00ad cipate in drug studies. Prisoners and nonprisoners usually are not involved in the same protocol, although the types of studies are the same. Nonprisoners are paid $7 a day; the prisoners receive $3 a day (the rate ~stablished as the maximum by the prison). Advantages of the hospital as the setting for research of this type are the availability of excellent emergency care (although no serious adverse reactions requiring it have occurred in 10 years of operation), the ease of access, of the investigator to the subjects, and surroundings that a\\\\\"e pleasant in comparison with the prison. Disadvantages are the 1 imited numbf;r of pris\u00ad oners who can qualify for the program and the boredom of the research. The main reason men drop out of a study is that they become bored and ask to return to their friends and activities at the prison. Human studies in pharmaceutical\u00b7 research and development in other:. countries. The survey* conducted on practices of foreign countries regarding use of prisoners and other groups in the development and testing of new pharma\u00ad ceutical agents included seven European nations, five English speaking countries, four Latin American nations and Japan. In all the countries surveyed, clinical pharmacology studies (pharmacokinetic and dose-ranging studies) can be conducted in normal subjects. Almost uniformly, these coun~ries do not permit such studies to be conducted in prisoners. In theory, prisoner studies could be done in the United Kingdom, but in practice no such research is conducted in prisoners ()ut- * Provided to the Commission by MarvinE. Jaffe\"M.D. and C. Stewart Snoddy, Merck Sharp & Oahme Laboratories. 72 \" ' -'--------- side the United States. In most count'v'ies volunteers, when used, are students, civil servants (military, police and f'iremen), and medical and paramedical per ... sonnel. In general, clinical pharmacologY,studies conducted abroad involve patients with the disease which the drug is intended to treat, rather than normals. The use of patients with other qiseases is not uniform1y approved, but may be per\u00ad mitted if data \"relevant to the plrimary indication can be obtained. The require\u00ad ment for specific governmental approval (IND or clinical trials certificate) to conduct clinical pharmacology studies in normal subjects or patients also varies among countries. In all the countries surveyed, human pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data are IIllelpfulli to support new drug registration. In about half the countries, such data ~re mandatory. Only France and Japan require that such data be generated in the indigenous population; other countries accept foreign data. With the exception of Italy, nO country requires long-term {l-3 months) controlled safety studies in volunteers bc'\u00a5)1t'e initiating studies in patients. For registration purposes, however, Belgium, Italy, Canada, and in some cases the United Kingdom require such data. Since prisoners are not used in those countries for such studies, 'it is assumed that such data often are generated elsewhere. In most countries, longer term studies to determine the safety of a new drug entity are done in the patient population which the drug is intended to treat. This provides a measure of how the drug may be expected to behave in clinical practice under the more usual conditions of use and when combined with the usual concomitant therapies. The subjects of such studies receive the presumed benefits of therapy with the new agent to balance its unknown risks. 73 Although prisoners have not been subjects in phase 1 drug testing in other c:,ountries, they have been subjects of nontherapeutic research. For examp1te, prisoners in a number of countY'leS, including Australia, Canada, Oenmar'k, .England, Germany, Greece; Ireland. Mexico, Poland and Japan, have been 'surveyed to determine the incidence of the XVV chromosome anomaly. ;.-, 74 Investigators' and' Pt iS6.ner~. Data on research in prisons were presented by the Survey Research Center, University of Michiga.n, in a preliminary report to the COl1lOission on a stUQY of institutional review procedures, research on human subjects~ and informed consent. Data were presented from interviews done in early 1976 with investi- j gators in 41 studies and representatives of review committees in five prisons, with 181 prisoner-subjects in four of these prisons, and with 45 prisoner-non\u00ad subjects in two of these prisons. The subjects had all partic'ipated in research since July 1,1974. No individuals or institutions were identified in the report. The research. As described ~y principal investigators in the five prisons, their research was predominantly pharmaceutical research, mostly phase 1 testing. In most of the studies~ drugs were administered orally and blood and urine sam\u00ad ples were analyzed. Very few of the experiments, according to investigators, were intended to benefit subjects~ although researchers felt that a medica1 or psychological benefit might occur in some cases. The research also entailed some medical and psychological risk according to investigators, although they estimated the probability of serious risk to be very low or nonexistent. All \\ investigators reported the existence of procedures for treating subjects who might suffer harmful effects of the research. Review procedures. The Survey Research Center found that the structure of the review process differed among the five prisons. In some places it included Institutional Review Boards (IRB's) established in compliance with DHEW regula~ tions on protection of human subjects; in others it included review committees 75 I . I appointed by the state department of corrections, by prison authorities, or by university officials. The review process at some prisons included cOlTlnit\u00ad tees created by drug companies. Biomedical and legal consultants and pris\u00ad oner representatives played a role in some review procedures. At all prisons, the review was conducted 1n stages involving different combinations of the above mechanisms. Membership on review corrmittees was reported a's being very J7 If stabia. While few proposals are rejected in the review process, it was reported that few are approved as submitted. Most frequent changes are in consent procedures. though modifications were also reported in research design. The process was said to work smoothly, at least in part because of long-standing relations between review corrrnittees and investigators, and awareness of mutual Qxpectations. Little monitoring of the actual conduct of research was reported~ altl10ugh most members of review ccmmittees were said to have visited the prison or reSearch facil ities at some time. ID~~9~ftr ~upjeq~. The interviews with prisoner subjects revealed them to be generally supportive of biomedical research in prisons. The near <) concensusof favorable attitude among subjects occurred in all four institutions where prisoners were interviewed. Practically all of these subjects said that the information they received in advance of the experiment was understandable and co~rect, that the researchers were willing to answer subjects' questions, and that participation was voluntary. About one-third of the subjects indicated that they expected the research would involve some risk. A few subjects none\u00ad theless felt that they had experienced specific difficulties as a result of the 76 .\" experiments that they did not fully expect. Subjects o(~ered a number of reasons for participating in research. the most prevalent being financial. About 90% of them said that they would be willing to participate in future experiments. Consent fotms. The Survey Research Center's analysis of consent forms provided by investigators indicated that almost all described the pur-pose of the experiment, and all described the procedures. About 85% mentioned and listed risks. An analysis of the reading ease of consent forms indicated that a large proportion were at a difficult reading level. The difficulty did not appear to be solely attributable to the use of medical and technical terminology; some of the difficulty was related to the complexity of sentence structure and the nature of many of the nontechnical terms that were employed. Reading difficulty appeared to be greater for consent forms associated with projects that investigators estimated to entail relatively higher risks. The explanations provided in the consent forms, however, were supplemented in all cases by oral explanations\" Nonsubject Rrisoners. Prisoners who have never participated in research projects, or whose participation was not recent, were less favorable, on the average, toward research in prisons than were the current subjects. Differences of opinion about research were more apparent within the group of nonsubjects than within the group of subjects. Some nonsubjects were strongly opposed to research irl prisons. Prisoners offered a n\u00a3.lmber of explanations for not parti ... cipating, including assertions that they had not aleen asked', that they feared the possibil ity of serious hat\"mfui effects, that they mistr'usted research or 77 (/ (' researchers, or that they were opposed to the idea of research in genera1. Some said that they would participate if they were asked and/or if the bene- ~ fits to themselves were more sUbstantial. Nonsubjects who were interviewed had a slightly 10wer level of formal education than did the subjects, and the former were 1ess likely to have prison jobs. Furthermore, for those in\u00ad mates who held jobst the number of hours worked per week was slightly lower ~\",I.!.99]I,!~i2!!a .. frq,!!1..r~~eondent,~,.

Some nonsubject prisoners suggested abolishing the r;:-search program. Principal investigators also offered few suggestions.
