The acupuncture treatments at our Bellevue wellness clinic include: Acupuncture A key component of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture uses the insertion of needles in the skin of specific acupuncture points of the body to balance energy flow and stimulate nerves, muscles, and connective tissue. Spiritually, acupuncture uses the body's extraordinary meridians to guide Qi energy throughout the body for a balanced yin and yang and optimal healing and wellbeing. Physically, acupuncture activates nerve fibers and muscles to boost the body's natural painkillers. Electro-acupuncture Like traditional acupuncture sessions, needles are inserted into the skin on specific acupuncture points of the body. Unlike traditional acupuncture, electrodes are then attached to the needles to stimulate the nerves and muscles evenly, safely, and quickly. Electroacupuncture activates nerve fibers and is believed to increase blood flow, triggering the body to release endorphins, which help to reduce inflammation. This may help to treat persistent or chronic pain and stress. Cupping Therapy An ancient form of alternative medicine, cupping therapy involves placing special cups on the skin to create a suction effect. This treatment expands the blood vessels and may help treat pain and inflammation and promote blood flow and relaxation. Scraping Therapy/ Gua Sha Scraping therapy involves scraping the skin with an instrument to improve blood circulation. This helps break down scar tissue and promotes a better healing environment for the soft tissue. Acupressure Acupressure is based on the healing techniques of acupuncture, but instead of needles, this technique involves a therapist placing pressure on the specific acupoints. This method can help release muscle tension and promote blood circulation. Heat Therapy/Infrared Heat Heat therapy applied to sore, tight, or injured muscles can sooth pain, increase muscle flexibility, and heal damaged tissue. Infrared waves are used to safely and effectively provide a deep, penetrating heat. Ear Acupuncture/Auricular Acupuncture This method of acupuncture focuses on the ear to provide targeted effects of acupuncture. Ear seeds Ear seed therapy involves attaching seeds to the ears on specific acupressure points, then massaging these seeds to provide an acupressure treatment. Ear seeds may stay on the ears for up to a week, allowing the patient to massage the ear seeds and continue the healing effects for several days. Moxibustion Derived from traditional Chinese medicine, moxibustion involves burning mugwort herb leaves close to the skin, applying heat to the body. "}
