We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effects of psychological 30 interventions on the ability of vaccines to protect against disease, as measured by antibody 31 responses. 32 Methods : Electronic databases (EMBASE, Medline, PsychINFO, CIN AHL) were searched from 33 their inception to 6th February 2018. 34 Results : The search yielded 9 eligible trials conducted with 1 603 participants and four broad 35 categories of intervention: meditation/mindfulness (n =3), massage (n=3), expressive writing 36 (n=2) and cognitive behavioural stress management (n=1 ). Some evidence of benefit on the 37 antibody response to vaccination was observed in 6/9 of all trials and in 4/7 of randomised 38 controlled trials. However, effects on antibody leve ls were often mixed, with only 3 of 6 39 trials showing benefit demonstrating an improvement i n all antibody outcomes and at all 40 time points assessed. Trials demonstrating benefit also provided direct or indirect evidence 41 of adequate adherence with the intervention; and in 50% of these trials, there was als o 42 evidence that the intervention was effective in changi ng the mediating psychological 43 constructs targeted by the intervention. 44 Conclusions : This literature is characterised by considerable hetero geneity in terms of 45 intervention type, vaccine type, age of participants an d the temporal relationship between 46 vaccination and intervention . We conclude that there is early evidence to suggest that 47 psychological interventions may enhance the antibody response to vaccination. However , 48 the effects are inconsistent, with the greatest like lihood of benefit seen in trials evidencing 49 adequate adherence with the intervention. Future work would benefit from rigorous 50 2 intervention development that focuses on achieving adequate adherence and large well- 51 controlled randomised trials with a focus on an agreed set of outcomes. 52 53 54 Keywords : vaccinations; antibodies; psychological interventions 55 56 3 Introduction 57 The Centres for Disease Control stated that vaccination is among the ten most 58 significant health achievements ever documented[1]; an d for many conditions they have 59 been an enormous success (e.g., smallpox). However, v accinations are not universally 60 effective, with multiple factors related to the vacci ne and the vaccine recipient known to 61 influence efficacy [2 , 3]. With regard to the latter, there are several popul ations in whom 62 the evidence for vaccine effectiveness is equivocal. These include populations with 63 underlying immune impairment due to advancing age [3 , 4] and/or the presence of co- 64 existing diseases (e.g., cancer) [5]. As a consequenc e, vaccines may be most likely to fail in 65 those they most seek to benefit [6, 7]. 66 This has prompted research into strategies to enhance the immune response to 67 vaccination, so called vaccine adjuvants. The aim of such interventions is to optimise the 68 response of the immune system to the vaccine antigen s and, in so doing, increase the 69 likelihood that the vaccine confers protection. Withi n this context, there has been a growing 70 interest in the potential for non-pharmacological factor s to act as vaccine adjuvants. This is 71 borne out of a literature which has demonstrated that psychological and behavioural factors 72 such as mood, diet and physical activity can modulate aspe cts of functional and 73 enumerative immunity [8], including responses to vacc ination [9, 10]. For example, a meta- 74 analysis of 13 studies examining the relationship betw een psychological stress and antibody 75 responses following influenza vaccination reported ev idence of a significant negative 76 relationship, such that greater levels of stress (re gardless of how it was measured) were 77 associated with lower levels of antibody [9]. Similarl y, a review of cross-sectional, 78 observational and randomised controlled studies invest igating the relationship between 79 chronic and acute exercise and immune responses to vacc ination concluded that the 80 4 immune response appears to be augmented by exercise [ 11]. Comparable evidence also 81 exists for a range of dietary factors. For example, both v itamin D and zinc have been shown 82 to modulate the functioning of the immune system [ 12, 13] . 83 This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensiv e evaluation of the effects of 84 psychological interventions on the human antibody res ponse to vaccination; with a view to 85 informing the debate as to whether they could be use d to optimise vaccine efficacy . We 86 sought to be inclusive in this review. Thus, the ter m psychological was used to capture any 87 treatment that could be broadly considered to be aiming to improve the vaccine response 88 by targeting a psychological construct or process know n to effect immunity (e.g., mood, 89 relaxation, pain, etc.), but we did not require the in tervention to draw on psychological 90 theory. This was necessary to ensure a comprehensive assessment of the relevant literature, 91 given that this is a field known to be characterised by a relative absence of theory driven 92 enquiry [ 14]. We examined the evidence from all eligible trials cond ucted with human 93 participants that measured the effects of a psychologi cal intervention on the antibody 94 response to standard dose vaccinations. 95 Furthermore, although a range of immunological outcom es have been reported in 96 the literature, we chose to focus this review on the antibody response only. Vaccines 97 contain live, attenuated, modified, or killed microorg anisms (or their toxins) and, when 98 administered, they stimulate an immune response, the nature of which depends on the type 99 of microorganism administered. However, most often th e cascade of immune activity 100 following vaccination ends with the production of ant ibodies. Thus, antibody responses can 101 be accepted as a surrogate and universal marker of an e ffective immune response to 102 vaccination . 103 5 It is worth noting that there are two classes of vacci ne that stimulate B cells to 104 produce antibodies: thymus-dependent (i.e. T cell-d ependent) or thymus-independent (i.e. 105 T cell-independent) vaccines. Psychological factors hav e been shown to influence the 106 response to both in comparable ways [ 15]. Thus, we had no apriori reason to expect that 107 the effect of the non-pharmacological interventions considered in this review would affect 108 these two classes of vaccines differently. 109 110 Systematic Review Methods 111 Search strategy and selection criteria 112 We searched electronic databases (EMBASE, Medline, Psy chINFO, and CINAHL) from 113 their inception to 6th February 2018 (see Appendix 1 for details of the sea rch strategy). Our 114 search was constructed to identify all non-pharmacologic al interventions and identified 115 three broad types of intervention: psychological, phy sical activity/exercise and 116 dietary/nutritional interventions. However, given the diversity in types of intervention 117 within and between each category, the results from th e physical activity/exercise and 118 dietary/nutritional interventions are to be the subjec t of separate manuscripts. Hereafter, 119 we u 120 manuscript: 121 No language restrictions were applied. Only primary st udies published in peer- 122 reviewed journals were considered for inclusion. Revi ew articles were excluded, but their 123 reference lists were examined for relevant papers. W e also hand-searched reference lists of 124 included papers and contacted subject experts for addit ional relevant papers. The following 125 study inclusion criteria were applied: (1) human adul t, child and infants receiving any type of 126 vaccine; (2) studies explicitly concerned with evaluat ing the therapeutic (i.e., beneficial) 127 6 effects of an intervention on the immune response t o the vaccine; (3) the intervention 128 targeted a psychological construct known to effect immu nity (e.g., mood, relaxation, etc.) 129 but was not required to explicitly draw on psychologi cal theory; (4) studies in which 130 participants received standard doses of vaccine; (5) co mparative studies (randomised and 131 non-randomised); (6) studies providing a quantitative assessment of the antibody response 132 to the vaccination and (7) examined the association betw een the intervention and the 133 antibody response. To be included, studies had to me et all 7 criteria. 134 Antibody responses are typically quantified in absolu te levels, as captured by titres, 135 or binary outcomes that capture a change in antibody leve ls: with the outcomes 136 T 137 seroresponding following vaccination is defined as a r ise in serum antibody of a particular 138 magnitude (e.g., a four-fold increase or greater). Sero conversion refers to the presence of 139 antibody specific to the vaccine antigens in the blood . All approaches to quantifying the 140 antibody response were included in this review. 141 It is usual in reviews of this kind to specify the p rimary outcome in advance. In the 142 case of the present body of work this might have incl uded a focus on a specific type of 143 antibody measure (e.g., absolute antibody levels) and a specific time-point following 144 vaccination (e.g., 4 weeks post-vaccination). However, this was not possible in this review 145 because common practice in this field has been to repo rt multiple antibody outcomes; 146 measure these on more than one occasion post-vaccinati on and not always specify the 147 primary or secondary outcomes. The absence of a consis tent approach to measuring the 148 effects of psychological interventions on the antibo dy response to vaccination led us to 149 150 - 151 7 vaccination, i.e., evidence of improvement across all o utcomes and all times post-vaccine 152 was not required. Although this approach is symptomati c of the extant literature, it does 153 increase the risk of bias. Thus, in our summary table we describe all antibody outcomes 154 reported in each trial, and in the manuscript comment on the proportion of outcomes, 155 relative to the total outcomes measured, exhibiting an improved antibody response. 156 The titles and abstracts of the papers were initially assessed against the inclusion 157 criteria by two independent reviewers who removed th ose that did not meet the criteria. 158 Full text papers were retrieved and read in full by both reviewers. Disagreements at each 159 stage of the selection process were resolved through discussion between the reviewers. For 160 example, at title and abstract review it was not always c lear if a vaccine had been 161 administered or antibodies measured. This was resolved by review of the full-text. The 162 search procedure can be seen in Figure 1. 163 164 INSERT FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE 165 166 Data extraction and assessment of risk of bias 167 Data were extracted by two reviewers directly from th e papers into tables. These 168 data included the sample size, characteristics of the p articipants, a description of the 169 intervention, type of vaccine administered, the primar y outcome, number of follow-ups and 170 a summary of the major findings. 171 Risk of bias for individual studies was assessed indepen dently by two reviewers using 172 C C [16]. The tool refers to seven items that assess: 173 method of randomisation, allocation concealment, blin ding of participants, study personnel, 174 outcome assessments, how missing data were handled an d evidence of selective reporting. 175 8 All discrepancies between reviewers were resolved th rough discussion. For example, there 176 was some discrepancy regarding what could be considere d selective reporting. Discussions 177 led to reviewers agreeing that this could only be de termined if a published protocol was 178 available containing the relevant details. All agreed rati ngs are reported in Table 1. 179 180 INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE 181 Effect Sizes 182 B H 183 using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (Version 3): Engle wood, NJ; Biostat: https://www.meta- 184 analysis.com/). These were calculated using post-vaccinat ion means, standard deviations 185 and sample size for continuous outcomes and number of e vents per group used for 186 dichotomous outcomes. In two cases [ 17, 18], where these statistics were not reported in 187 the published manuscript, effect sizes were calculated on the basis of reported inferential 188 tests assessing between group differences in changes from pre-vaccination antibody levels. 189 In the case of the Davidson et al. trial [ 17] this was because no other data were available. In 190 the case of the Vedhara et al trial [ 18], the measure presented was seroconversion and thus 191 192 For five studies, insufficient statistics of any ki nd were published to calculate effect 193 sizes. Authors of all 5 studies were contacted and two provided additional data, thus 194 allowing us to calculate effect sizes for 6/9 articles in total (see Table 2). 195 E C 196 medium= .5, large= .8 [ 19], with positive values interpreted as the interventi on having 197 enhanced antibody responses compared to controls. How ever, due to the heterogeneous 198 9 nature of the trials identified (in terms of vaccinatio ns used, intervention type, and method 199 of antibody measurement) we did not meta-analyse thes e data. 200 201 Results 202 Summary of findings 203 The search yielded nine eligible papers reporting nin e trials which covered four 204 broad categories of intervention: meditation/mindfulne ss (k=3), massage (k=3), expressive 205 writing (k=2) and cognitive behavioural stress manageme nt (k=1). We elected to include the 206 massage trials in this review of psychological interven tions for two main reasons. First, they 207 208 immunity 209 Second, we considered these interventions to be who lly different from the exercise/physical 210 activity based interventions identified in our searche s, all of which were concerned with 211 participants actively engaging in some form of physical activity. This contrasts with massage 212 where subjects are the passive recipients of some deg ree of physical manipulation. 213 Seven randomised controlled trials were identified, o ne study used matched 214 controls, and another used waiting-list controls. All s tudies provided data on at least one 215 measure of adherence or effects on a mediating mech anism. The total sample size across all 216 studies was 1603 (range: 40-413). The average age of p articipants ranged from 2 months to 217 80 years. Two trials were conducted with infants (2-6 months), five with adults (21-60 218 years), and two in older adults (75-80 years). Five tri als focussed on responses to seasonal 219 influenza vaccination, two to hepatitis B vaccinations , and two to 220 diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis (DTP) vaccination. Four t rials targeted groups who could be 221 10 considered to be at potential risk of vaccine failure: two with young infants [ 20, 21] and two 222 with older adults [ 18, 22]. The length of the interventions ranged from sing le sessions of 1 223 minute [ 20] to 3 x 1 hour sessions per week for 20 weeks [ 22]. Five trials administered their 224 vaccination post-intervention; two before or at the f irst intervention session and two during 225 the intervention. 226 Two-thirds of all trials (k=6/9), and over half of all RCTs (k=4/7), reported some 227 evidence of a statistically significant improvement i n the antibody response to vaccination 228 [17, 18, 20, 22-24]; two showed no benefit [ 21, 25] and one showed evidence of an 229 impaired antibody response in the intervention group [26]. Intervention effect sizes ranged 230 from g=-0.73 to g=1.13 (see Table 2). Trials showing evidence of an improved immune 231 response to vaccination, and in which effect sizes co uld be calculated, typically exhibited 232 moderate to large effects [ 17, 18, 24]. 233 When examining the six trials that showed some eviden ce of benefit in more detail, 234 it was clear that there was variability in both the num ber of outcomes reported (ranging 235 from 1- 25) and the proportion of these that exhibited evidence of a statistically significant 236 improvement in the antibody response. For 50% of th ese trials (k=3) all antibody outcomes 237 reported improved significantly in the intervention group compared with the control group 238 [17, 18, 24]. In contra st, the study by Hsu [20], considered 5 outcomes over 5 time points, 239 only 12 of which ( 48%) attained significance in the expected direction . Two outcomes 240 showed significantly greater antibody levels in the c ontrol arm (both at 2 months post- 241 vaccine) and the direction of the non-significant comp arisons indicated higher antibody 242 levels in the control arm for 7/11 outcomes. 243 The study by Yang [22], reported 6 between-group co mparisons, 2 of which (33%) 244 attained statistical significance in the expected direc tion. The direction of all the non- 245 11 significant between group comparisons in this study were in the expected direction (i.e., 246 greater antibody levels or protective titres observe d in the intervention arm). Finally, the 247 post-hoc analysis by Stetler [23] which showed evide nce of improved antibody responses, 248 did so for only 1 out of 3 viral strains (33%). The re sults for the other viral strains were not 249 presented in the manuscript and so we could not determ ine the direction of these non- 250 significant comparisons. 251 There appeared to be no systematic differences in in tervention effects based on the 252 nature of the vaccine (influenza, hepatitis B and DTP v accines used in trials showing 253 benefit/impairment and not); or the timing of the vac cination relative to the intervention 254 (i.e., whether vaccination occurred pre, during or po st-intervention). Trials showing no 255 benefit/impairment also did not appear to differ mark edly in their duration, from those that 256 did show benefit (median total number of interventio n days: 4 versus 6 respectively). 257 However, they did appear to differ in intensity (i. e., median number of minutes engaged in 258 formal intervention sessions): with median intensity (not including unsupervised 259 intervention practice) over the intervention period of 180 minutes for trials showing no 260 benefit/impairment versus 280 minutes for trials repo rting benefit. They also differed in 261 sample size: with trials showing no benefit/ impairme nt typically being larger than the trials 262 showing some evidence of benefit (medians n=149 and n =49 respectively). Although this 263 latter observation may be attributable, in part, to a sin gle very large trial of 413 participants 264 [21]. 265 In considering this literature in more detail, we nex t give consideration to findings 266 according to intervention type and methodology 267 Intervention Type and Methodology 268 12 No single intervention approach was examined in more t han three trials. Thus it is 269 not yet possible to consider the relative benefits o f each intervention approach in the 270 context of such a modest evidence base. However, some early patterns emerge if we 271 consider aspects of intervention methodology, relatin g in particular to (a) adherence with 272 the interventions (indicated by the number of inter vention sessions attended); (b) 273 intervention effects on purported mediating mechanism s i.e., whether it had a beneficial 274 effect on constructs targeted by the intervention (e .g., improved mood) and (c) 275 characteristics of participants at baseline (i.e., could they be considered to be at risk of 276 vaccination failure). 277 Intervention adherence: Only three trials formally reported on intervention 278 adherence [ 18, 22, 26], but it is possible to infer levels of adherence from other details (e.g., 279 degrees of freedom) presented in a further three tr ials [ 20, 23, 24]. All six of these trials 280 evidenced adequate to good adherence, as measured by participants attending >75% of 281 intervention sessions, and all but one [ 26] reported evidence of an enhanced antibody 282 response to vaccination in the intervention group co mpared with the control group. In 283 contrast, of the three trials that did not provide dat a on adherence [ 17, 21, 25], only one 284 reported evidence of an improved vaccination response . 285 Mediating mechanisms : Nearly all trials (k=8/9) reported evidence relat ing to one or 286 more hypothesised mediating mechanism: mood [ 17, 18, 23, 24, 26]; brain activity [ 17]; 287 cognitive change [ 23-25]; pain and other vaccine related adverse events [ 20, 21]. Of these, 288 three trials were characterised by the intervention hav ing no effect or an adverse effect on 289 their hypothesised mechanisms [ 21, 25, 26]; and all three showed no evidence of a 290 beneficial effect on vaccine effectiveness. In contras t, three out of the five trials reporting 291 evidence of a beneficial effect on vaccine effectiven ess showed that the purported 292 13 mechanisms had also been changed in the expected direc tion [ 17, 23, 24]. The remaining 293 two trials showing benefit observed no effect of the ir intervention on their hypothesised 294 mechanism (mood: [ 18]) or an adverse effect (pain and fever : [20]). 295 Participant characteristics: Four out of nine trials were conducted with individu als at 296 risk of vaccine failure due to their age [ 18, 20-22]. All but one of these trials [ 21] reported a 297 beneficial effect of their intervention on the antib ody response to vaccination. However, 298 evidence of an enhanced immune response to vaccination following interventions 299 conducted in healthy adults was also not uncommon, wit h three out of five of these trials 300 reporting benefit [ 23-25]. 301 302 Discussion 303 This review identified nine trials in which the effe cts of psychological interventions 304 on the antibody response to vaccination were examined. This literature was modest in size 305 and characterised by considerable heterogeneity in term s of the type of intervention, age of 306 participants, vaccine type, intervention duration and i ntensity and approaches to assessing 307 the antibody response to vaccination. When examining th e evidence according to the less 308 nhancement in one or more 309 antibody outcome at any time point post- -thirds of trials 310 reported some evidence of benefit in the antibody re sponse to vaccination, and in those 311 where an effect size could be calculated, the result s suggested evidence of a moderate to 312 large effect. However, a closer examination of these t rials suggests that caution should be 313 exercised when interpreting these findings. For exam ple, only 50% of trials reported a 314 significant improvement across all antibody outcomes and at all time points; while for the 315 14 remaining trials, evidence of improvement was seen onl y for between 33- 48% of outcomes 316 and time-points considered. 317 The weight of the evidence offers early support for the view that psychological 318 interventions may help to prevent disease through th eir ability to improve the antibody 319 response to vaccinations and thus make vaccines more ef fective. Furthermore, the data 320 suggest the effect could be generalizable across a rang e of vaccinations and at all stages of 321 the immune response: evidenced by the fact that inte rvention effects were unrelated to 322 vaccine type or the timing of the intervention relat ive to the vaccine. However, this 323 conclusion should be tempered by several caveats. 324 First, while our outcome measure (i.e., antibody res ponses) is widely used as a 325 surrogate for protection from disease [ 27], vaccine effectiveness is more accurately 326 determined in studies that report laboratory confirm ed disease [ 28]. Such trials, do 327 however, require longer follow-ups, are likely to b e more costly and thus are rarely 328 undertaken in the context of psychological interventi ons. 329 Second we wish to acknowledge that the way we determin ed if there was evidence 330 of an enhanced immune response to vaccination, and th us improved protection from 331 disease, lacked precision and could have increased the r isk of bias. We considered an 332 improvement in at least one immune outcome (not nece ssarily all immune outcomes), at 333 any time point, as evidence of an enhanced response to vaccination i.e., improvement 334 across all outcome measures and at specific times was n ot required. This was necessary 335 because of variability in the literature in the ways th at the antibody response has been 336 measured; at what time poin ts; and the failure in many trials to specify primary or 337 secondary outcomes. The former poses a particular proble m for this field because it is well 338 known that findings from different immunological metho ds and outcomes do not correlate 339 15 well [ 29, 30]. Thus, it is perhaps not reasonable, for example, to e xpect improvements in 340 absolute antibody levels to translate into improved r ates of seroprotection. Similarly, the 341 optimal timing of antibody outcomes is influenced b y whether the focus is on a primary or 342 secondary immune response (a primary response is slow er than a secondary response ) [31- 343 34]; and whether the focus is on the peak antibody respo nse or long-term persistence in 344 immunity (again the former would be measured earlier t han the latter). In addition, the 345 choice of primary outcome may also be influenced by t he nature of the vaccine itself [ 35]. 346 These considerations have contributed to capriciousne ss in outcome assessment in this 347 literature which, in turn, serves only to impede att empts to synthesise the evidence. We 348 suggest that future research in this area would bene fit from the development of an agreed 349 set of outcomes as is advocated by the COMET initiative [36]. COMET seeks to achieve 350 agreement on the minimum outcomes that should be measu red and reported in clinical 351 trials with a view to facilitating comparisons between trials and evidence synthesis. The 352 initiative is typically focussed on single disease e ntities. However, the principles of COMET 353 are of relevance to this field. In addition, we would recommend greater uptake of pre- 354 registration of trial designs and analysis plans as this would alleviate concerns regarding 355 [37] which can also lead to false-positive results. 356 The third caveat relates to the potential for the sign ificance of these findings to be 357 influenced by the file drawer effect or publication bias. This phenomenon, now widely 358 recognised in the psychological and medical sciences, refers to the likelihood of positive 359 findings being more likely to appear in the publish ed literature than null findings. Some 360 estimates of the size of the file drawer problem sugg est that there may be 3 times more 361 negative trials than those found in the published lite rature. For example, in a now classic 362 study, Smart [ 38] examined publications in psychological journals and re ported that while 363 16 studies with negative findings typically accounted fo r 9% of published papers, negative 364 findings were reported in 20.5% of abstracts of papers presented at a mainstream 365 psychological conference in a single year and 30.2% o f dissertation abstracts from the same 366 year. These findings support the view that research i s much more likely to be published if 367 the results are positive. 368 A host of factors are known to drive the file drawer e ffect [ 39], but the implications 369 for reviews like the present one are clear: it can le ad to an over-estimation of the size of the 370 treatment effect. Like many authors, we sought to mitig ate this risk by contacting known 371 authors in the field to enquire about data from unpubli shed trials (none were reported). We 372 also sought to be as inclusive as possible in our iden tification of the literature by not 373 restricting ourselves to studies in which the inter vention explicitly drew on psychological 374 theory. Indeed, we are somewhat reassured that this re view reflects the extant literature by 375 the fact that three of the nine included studies repo rted null findings or evidence in support 376 of a psychological intervention impairing the antibody response . Furthermore, while we 377 were unable to locate and include any unpublished stud ies, there is a contrasting view that 378 this could be a strength of the present work because unpublished research is not without 379 bias (e.g., due to potentially being of lower quality, not having been subjected to peer 380 review etc.). Indeed, a recent simulation study concl uded that selective publication (as 381 opposed to publishing everything) results in a more ac curate estimate of effect sizes [ 40]. 382 The debate on the file drawer effect is likely to con tinue for some time to come. But 383 in the context of this nascent field, typically charac terised by modest sample sizes, we 384 strongly encourage authors to always seek to publish t heir findings regardless of observed 385 effects so that the scientific community can arrive at an informed view on whether 386 psychological interventions represent a viable means fo r enhancing vaccine effectiveness. 387 17 Further observations arising from this review worthy of comment include, first, tha t 388 we cannot yet determine what type of intervention (e. g., mindfulness versus CBT) might be 389 most effective in enhancing vaccinations and reducing disease risk because no single 390 intervention has been examined in more than 3 studies. Second, that observation s 391 regarding intervention methodology pointed towards ef fective interventions being more 392 likely to involve treatments that were more intensi ve (reflected by the median time spent in 393 receipt of formal intervention sessions), although no t necessarily of a longer duration, and 394 where the intervention was effective in modifying th e psychological constructs being 395 targeted. We also observed some potentially interesting findings in relation to intervention 396 adherence and effects on the antibody response. For si x of the nine trials, adherence data 397 were reported (or could be inferred) and the majorit y of these (k=5/6) showed evidence of 398 both adequate adherence and an improved antibody respon se to vaccination. For the 399 remaining three trials it was not possible to determi ne if adequate adherence had been 400 achieved, but two of these failed to show evidence of benefit on the antibody response. We 401 cannot of course assume that the absence of adherence d ata is indicative of poor 402 adherence. But the findings hint at this possibility and, at the very least, highlight the need 403 for more rigorous reporting of trial methodology. 404 Third, we did not observe any clear patterns in relat ion to the age of participants and 405 the likelihood of psychological interventions enhanci ng the antibody response to 406 vaccination: with some degree of improvement reported in trials with the very young, the 407 elderly and healthy adults. 408 Fourth, we suggest that the heterogeneity evident in this literature regarding 409 intervention type and populations assessed may be a co nsequence of the absence of theory 410 driven enquiry in this field. The theoretical context for much of this work comes from the 411 18 biopsychosocial model [ 41] which proposes that health and disease are a function of not 412 only biology but the complex psychological and social influences that surround an individual. 413 Although this framework has been influential, critics argue that its lack of specificity has 414 meant that it does not make clear predictions or hypot heses that can be tested [ 14]. This 415 lack of specificity is reflected in the literature re viewed here where both the populations 416 under investigation (ranging from the very young to the very old) and the mechanisms 417 targeted by the interventions were broad (ranging from mood, cognitive change and brain 418 activity to pain). At this stage we have not achieved a clear understanding of which 419 psychological factors may be the most influential in m odifying immunity or how these 420 relationships vary according to factors such as participan t age and contextual factors such as 421 the nature and type of stressor. Greater clarity on t hese issues would enable us to focus 422 research effort on developing interventions that cou ld optimise, rather than just improve, 423 the effectiveness of vaccinations. 424 An additional consequence of the varied literature ex amined here is that it 425 necessarily precluded a meta-analysis and also impacted on the conclusions we could draw 426 in this narrative synthesis. W e also observed that studies where the intervention 427 methodology was less robust (e.g., no data on interve ntion adherence) were less likely to 428 find evidence of benefit. This makes it difficult to determine whether an absence of effect 429 was due to the interventions per se, or the rigour wit h which they were implemented. 430 Taken together, some clear directions for future re search are evident. In particular, 431 we would suggest that there is a need for more trials to examine the potential for 432 psychological interventions to prevent disease by enha ncing the effectiveness of vaccines; 433 for these trials to be larger and conducted with a foc us on an agreed set of outcomes; for 434 authors to publish trial protocols in advance and be mi ndful of the consequences of 435 19 publication bias. It would also be advantageous for thi s work to adopt a clearer theoretical 436 framework so that we can move towards a better understan ding of which psychological 437 influences on immunity are preeminent; and develop i nterventions that target these 438 specifically whilst also maximising participant adherenc e. 439 440 20 Acknowledgements : We would like to acknowledge the support of Ben Ja ckson and Lucy 441 Hackshaw who contributed to initial searches and data extr actions conducted for this paper. 442 Funding: The contribution of Dr Simon Royal was supported by th e Nottingham City Clinical 443 Commissioning Group through a Research Capability Fund ing award.
