[more](/Expert/81551901-Caroline-Blanke) AIT ( [Acupuncture](/Medical-Library/Medical-Procedures/Acupuncture)/AcuPoint Injection Therapy) also known as BioPuncture, is an integrative therapy that only AIT certified acupuncture physicians in our field can practice. Natural homeopathic or vitamin therapy substances are injected into specific areas in the body. AIT has shown to be very effective for the treatment of acute or chronic pain in the body, particularly in joint areas such as the shoulder, back, knee's, and neck. We also utilize B-12 in the application of AIT in cases where the patient may be experiencing migraines, low energy, digestive issues, poor memory, [pernicious anemia](/Medical-Library/Diseases-and-Conditions/Pernicious-anemia), IBS, nerve damage, and more. Remedies are designed to stimulate your body's natural healing ability, rather than focusing on suppressing the symptoms. AcuPoint Injection Therapy is an effective way to regulate inflammation, reduce pain, and increase range of motion in the muscles and joints. We aim to promote, maintain, and restore your health. Homeopathic remedies are used in our office for the treatment of pain and have greatly helped patients with [palliative care](/Medical-Library/Medical-Procedures/Palliative-Care) as well as disease prevention and treatment of pain. Homeopathy actively encourages the body to help itself by way of activating the body's self-healing responses. People are choosing this type of treatment for their health as it is an alternative to traditional pharmaceutical options that host many undesirable side effects. Homeopathy is a natural holistic treatment that is generally well tolerated and has no addictive effects and does not break down tissue as do some steroid based injections. The remedies basically mimic the actual illness, naturally a milder form of it. This activates the body, mobilizes the immune system, and gets the healing process underway. Examples of some of the FDA approved formulas used in our practice and their functions are as follows: - Hevert\u00ae Arnica: Treatment of muscle pain, stiffness, bruising, and swelling due to injuries and overexertion. - Hevert\u00ae CalmvaleraTM comp.: Treatment of nervous disorders such [sleep disorders](/Medical-Library/Diseases-and-Conditions/Sleep-Disorders), mild depression. - Hevert\u00ae Gelsemium comp.: Improvement of nerve conditions such as post herpetic neuralgia, [trigeminal neuralgia](/Medical-Library/Diseases-and-Conditions/Trigeminal-Neuralgia), or sciatic nerve liver and biliary system disorders. - Hevert\u00ae LymphadenTM comp.: Improvement of conditions such as swelling of the lymph nodes and lymphatic [edema](/Medical-Library/Diseases-and-Conditions/Edema). Where Will I Be Injected? This medicine can be injected into different areas of the body including pain points, trigger points, and acupuncture points. The location of the injection may be as important as the selection of the homeopathic solution. We will select the best approach for treatment of your condition during your office visit and evaluation. What To Expect? The injection stimulates self-healing. A patient may need a series of injections to achieve maximum results. We will determine your customized treatment plan based on your individual needs, your condition, and your response to treatment. It's important to understand that treatments with homeopathic injection solutions are different from conventional medicines, such as pain killers (NSAID's) or local steroid injections. Homeopathic Injection Solutions are comprised of very small doses of natural ingredients (plants and minerals), support your body's natural ability to heal, are a targeted therapy which may mean less medication is needed overall, and can be integrated with other therapies and medications (consult with your doctor). These are cost-effective treatments which are regulated by the FDA and are carefully manufactured under strict quality controls. This ensures that all injection solutions meet the highest pharmaceutical manufacturing standards. How It Works Homeopathic Injection Therapy, Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine can be an effective alternative to treatments that may require the use of invasive procedures. For example, controlling knee or [back pain](/Medical-Library/Diseases-and-Conditions/Back-Pain) with homeopathic injection or acupuncture rather than resorting to surgery, or regulating the menstrual cycle with acupuncture and herbal medicine rather than taking prescription medications. Here at Holistic Health Palm Beach, we focus on correcting the cause of the imbalances and work to bring you back to better health. How Many Treatments Will I Need? The healing qualities of AcuPoint Injection Therapy (AIT) are cumulative, meaning that more than one treatment is almost always necessary. It takes a series of injections as the body is boosted into balance. AIT can stand alone but it is most effective when combined with acupuncture, lifestyle, herbal medicine, diet, and exercise recommendations. The outcome often results in fewer treatments with quicker results. For acute conditions you can expect to need less treatments than more chronic situations, but you will usually begin to feel relief after one or two sessions. In the case of chronic conditions, it may take longer to feel a healing response, depending on the type, severity, and duration of the condition. Preventative treatments and treatments for general well-being may also be scheduled on an as-needed basis. Additional benefits of homeopathic injection therapy: they are safe for patients on multiple medications, safe for patients who have sensitivity to NSAIDS, and are effective for patients who choose not to have corticosteroid therapy.
