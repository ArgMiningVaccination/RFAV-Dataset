Thanks Homeopath, Naturopath Homeopathy is an energetic medicine where there is something that's diluted so there's no actual physical substance left. However there's still the energy of the substance so it's a very minute dosing. It's very old-tradition, while naturopathy is more of an umbrella term including homeopathy and herbal medicine. Naturopathy includes treatment with herbs, nutrition, vitamins, iridology, and may include message and flower essences. Naturopathy is a bit more all-encompassing and depends on one's preferences around what methods of treatment they would choose to give you. Agree Thanks Health Professional A meta-analysis of 110 homeopathy clinical trials compared to 110 conventional medicine clinical trials showed that the (weak) evidence for the efficacy of homeopathy could be attributed to placebo. See: Shang A et al (2005) Are the clinical effects of homoeopathy placebo effects? Comparative study of placebo-controlled trials of homoeopathy and allopathy. Lancet 366: 726-32. This means that people who purchase homeopathic products are just buying very expensive water (or a sugar pill). The conjecture that \"there's still the energy of the substance\" in a homeopathic product is not one which evidence-based biomedical professionals would agree with.
