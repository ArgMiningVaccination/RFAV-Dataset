Indeterminate/high becomes 1.30 Last Updated: Octo ber 2021 Page 2 of 11 Back to Algorithm This primary care pathway was co -developed by primary and specialty care and includes input from multidisciplinary teams. It is intended to be used in conjunction with specialty advice services, when required, to support care within the medical home. Wide adoption of primary care pathways can facilitate timely, evidence -based support to physicians and their teams who care for patients with common low -risk GI conditions and improve appropriate access to specialty care, when needed. To learn more about primar y care pathways, check out this short video . NAFLD PATHWAY PRIMER Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD ) results from liver damage due to the accumulation of fat (triglycerides) within liver cells. It is the most common liver disease in Canada, affecting approximately 25% of the general population , and is often associated with obesity, diabetes , and/or hyperlipidemia . The term NAFLD actually refers to a group of related liver conditions , including simple fatty liver ( fibrosis ( i.e. liver scarring), or fatty liver with advanced liver fibrosis/cirrhosis. o In general, steatosis is considered to be relativ ely benign, but can still progress to cirrhosis in 2 -3% of people within 1 -2 decades ( even when ALT levels are persistently normal ). o In contrast, NASH is considered a potentially progressive disease that can lead to cirrhosis in up to 20% of people within 20 years .1 The gold standard for NASH diagnosis is a liver biopsy, though this is rarely done in practice . o Increasing liver fibrosis in people with NAFLD is associated with an exponential increase in risk of liver-related mortality2, which appears to be most pronounced in people with NAFLD who have develop ed moderate to severe liver fibrosis. o NAFLD that has progressed to cirrhosis is an increasingly common indication for liver transplantation and liver cancer in North America. Therefore, it is critical to identify people with NAFLD who have developed significant liver fibrosis in order to better manage these individuals to try to prevent progressive liver fibrosis. Given the prevalence of NAFLD , specialist consultation for all patients with NAFLD is not feasible. o This clinical care pathway helps to identify people with NAFLD who are more likely to have advanced liver scarring , and , therefore , may benefit from specialist care . This pathway employs blood tests to assess a patient 's risk of significant liver scarring, based on calculating their Fibrosis -4 score (FIB -4) using the following formula: o A FIB -4 score of < 1.30 essentially rules out significant liver fibrosis. A FIB -4 score 1.30 could potentially indicate risk of liver fibrosis and warrants further evaluation. Checklist to guide in -clinic review of your patient with NAFLD Finding of fatty liver on ultrasound or abnormal ALT If ALT > 2x ULN for 6 months, order further investigations to rule out other causes of liver disease in addition to NAFLD (see algorithm Box 2). If other causes identified, treat or refer for specialist consultation 1 Rinella, M. E., & Sanyal, A. J. (2016). Management of NAFLD: a stage -based approach.

Complete baseline (see algorithm Box 4) Assess risk of liver fibrosis using the FIB -4 Index If FIB -4 score < 1.3, continue to provide care in the Patient Medical Home (see algorithm Box 6a) If FIB -4 score 1.3, consider referral to a specialist trained in management of liver disease EXPANDED DETAILS 1. Suspected NAFLD NAFLD should be considered for patients with one or more of the following: o Abnormal liver tests (persistent elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT); repeat > 6 months . In patients with NAFLD, ALT is usually < 200 U/L) . Note: Patients with NAFLD will not necessarily have elevated liver enzymes. o Ultrasound finding of fatty liver (current or past, if risk factors , such as obesity , have not changed significantly) . Note: Patients with NAFLD will not necessarily have fatty liver documented on an ultrasound report (> 30% fat infiltration is required to visualize fatty liver on ultrasound ). Risk factors for NAFLD includ e obesity, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome , and hypertension . The pathway is not designed for use with patients with significant alcohol consumption (> 2 drinks /day for males, > 1 drink /day for females) because FIB -4 has not been validated in this population. o Counsel p atients to reduce their alcohol consumption below these levels. After 6 -8 weeks, retest ALT. If it remains abnormal, use of this pathway is appropriate. 2. (If ALT > 2x U pper Limit of Normal (ULN) for 6 months) Rule out other causes of liver disease in addition to NAFLD through the following stepwise testing Medication review o When assessing whether/how medications or other products may be contributing to abnormal liver tests, consider both the relationship between initiation of the medication and the time of onset of liver problems (if known), and any improvement in liver function tests after the medication is discontinued. o Any new or recently prescribed medication, over the counter, or herbal/natural product may be implicated. Some medications and other products may also cause liver damage over a longer term of use. o Potential culprits include medications (e.g. herbal products, health supplements (e.g. green tea extract), and illicit substances (e.g. cocaine). Visit the Poison & Drug Information Services for Health Professionals page for useful resources. o Discontinue or change medication, reduce dosage, or consider dose frequency modifications. Always weigh risks and benefits of therapy changes. If changes are made, repeat liver tests after 3 - 6 months. Liver ultrasound o Order if not completed within one year. Hepatitis B and C screening o Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HbsAg) - if positive, consider referral to hepatology. Last Updated: Octo ber 2021 Page 4 of 11 Back to Algorithm o Hepatitis C antibody (anti -HCV) - if positive, see Hepatitis C pathway . Other testing o Anti-nuclear anti body (ANA), anti -actin/anti -smooth muscle antibody , and immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA) to evaluate fo r possible a utoimmune cause of liver injury . Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH): ANA (> 1:80 titer) and/or anti -smooth muscle antibody (> 1:20 titer) and elevated serum immunoglobulin levels (especially IgG) may suggest AIH and warrant consideration for a referral to hepatology. o Ferritin and iron/TIBC (done while fasting ) to assess for hemochromatosis Note: ferritin is often significantly elevated in NAFLD (as an acute phase reactant related to liver inflammation) , but transferrin satura tion is typically < 50%. These patients do not have iron overload. If fasting ferritin elevated and percentage transferrin saturation is > 50% in females or > 60% in males , consider molecular genetic testing for hemochromatosis. If genetic testing suggest s increased risk for hemochromatosis , assessment of liver fibrosis is recommended as patients with hemochromatosis and advanced liver fibrosis are at high risk of liver cancer . If genetic testing is n egative, it is highly unlikely that the patient has hereditary hemochromatosis. o Celiac disease screen - if positive, consider referral for gastroscopy to confirm diagnosis. Once under control for 6 months, repeat liver function tests . o Serum ceruloplasmin (if age < 30 years) - if positive, consider referral to hepatology. Note: In the evaluation of abnormal liver tests , abdominal MRI and/or CT are unlikely to add diagnostic benefit and should not be routinely ordered . 3. Medication and l ifestyle review Complete a medication review if not already done in Step 2. Stop or modify offending agent , if possible , then repeat liver function tests after 3 -6 months. Review and address alcohol use o Excess alcohol consumption (> 2 drinks /day for males , > 1 drink /day for femal es) may contribute to abnormal liver tests . o Counsel patients to reduce their alcohol consumption below these levels. After 6 -8 weeks, retest ALT. If it remains abnormal, elevated ALT is unlikely to be the result of alcohol consumption. 4. Baseline investiga tions ALT and AST (to assess for liver cell death or damage) ALP and GGT (to assess for impairment of bile flow) o If elevated, and extra -hepatic biliary obstruction ruled out by ultrasound, test a nti-mitochondrial antibody . Any positive titer is significant and is highly specific for primary biliary cholangitis ( which affects ~1:1000 women over the age of 40) . If positive, c onsider referral to hepatology. CBC with platelets (to assess liver function and enable FIB -4 score calculation) o Platelets are included in the FIB -4 calculation as thrombocytopenia can be an initial sign of cirrhosis. HbA1C and lipid profiles (to assess for common comorbidities) If workup suggests a non -NAFLD diagnosis, treat or consider appropriate referral to specialist. If workup is negative, NAFLD diagnosis is strongly suspected based on risk factors , elevated liver enzyme s (ALT) , and/or ultrasound findings. Last Updated: Octo ber 2021 Page 5 of 11 Back to Algorithm If cirrhosis is suspected, also test INR, bilirubin, albumin ( to assess liver function) 5. NAFLD diagnosed NAFLD is the diagnosis of exclusion if no other causes of fatty liver/elevated liver enzymes have been identified , even in the presence of normal ultrasound . Remember that 30% fat infiltration in the liver is required for it to be visualized on ultrasound. Further follow -up is dependent on the risk stratification by the FIB-4 score. 6. Assess risk of liver fibrosis risk using FIB -4 index The Fibrosis -4 (FIB-4) sc ore is a non -invasive scoring system based on several laboratory tests that help to estimate the amount of scarring in the liver. Free F IB-4 calculator a) Low risk (FIB -4 < 1.30) : Care within the Patient Medical Home Care within the Patient Medical Home Lifestyle modifications are the cornerstone of NAFLD management. Physical activity 20+ minutes of physical activity/day , aiming for 150 min/week . See the Canadian 24 -Hour Movement Guidelines . Dietary modifications and weight loss Aim to choose more high -fibre carbohydrates and less refined starches, added sugars, and saturated fats. Replace foods high in saturated fat with monounsaturated fat and omega -3 fats. Choose lean meats and plant -based proteins to preserve lean body mass while losing body fat. Referral to a Registered D ietitian can be helpful to support dietary changes. As needed, target weight loss of ~10% of body weight over 6 months. Patients may benefit from handouts on Eating Well for Weight and Health and Sample Meal Plans for Healthy Eating . Cardiac risk factor modifications Screen for T ype 2 diabetes , hypertension , and hyperlipidemia . Treat and/or optimize therapy. Statin therapy is strongly recommended in patients with increased LDL cholesterol to manage cardiac risk factors, not to specifically treat NASH. In general, statins are safe in patients with liver disease, however ALT monitoring can be considered in NASH patients. Tests should be done 3 months after starting therapy. If ALT doubles during this time, the statin should be stopped in favor of a different lipid lowering agent. Encourage smoking cessation. Provide information, treatment, or referral, as appropriate. See Patient Resources . Alcohol intake Patients with NAFLD should not consume heavy amounts of alcohol. The risk of moderate alcohol consumption for patients with NAFLD is unknown. An acceptable intake for NAFLD patients with low risk of significant liver fibrosis (i.e. \"Low Risk \" NAFLD; FIB -4 score < 1.30), is up to 4 -5 drinks/week for men and 3 -4 drinks/week for women. Abstinence is recommended for patients with cirrhosis. Immunizations The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends immunization with hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination series because patients with NAFLD are at risk of more severe disease if infection occurs. Vaccination should be completed early in the course of the disease, as the immune response to vaccine is suboptimal in advanc ed liver disease. Post- immunization serologic testing may be used to confirm hepatitis B vaccine response. Serologic testing is not recommended after receiving the hepatitis A vaccine due to the test's poor sensitivity. Last Updated: Octo ber 2021 Page 6 of 11 Back to Algorithm Other Considerations Vitamin E Evidence: Vitamin E improves liver histology in patients with biopsy proven NASH and may be considered for NAFLD patients. Place in therapy: Until further data supporting its effectiveness become available, vitamin E is not recommended to routinely treat NASH in diabetic patients, NAFLD without liver biopsy, NASH cirrhosis, or cryptogenic cirrhosis. If patients choose to trial Vitamin E, they should be counselled about weak epidemiological evidence suggesting increased cardiovascular and prostate can cer risk. Dose: 800 IU/day Omega -3 fatty acids This is not the same as OMEGA 3 -6-9. Evidence: May have an anti -inflammatory benefit for NASH patients with high serum triglycerides, but this has not been well proven in NAFLD on its own. In some studies, Omega -3 fatty acids have been shown to help decrease hepatic steatosis and triglyceride levels. Mechanism of action: Reduces hepatic production of triglyceride -rich very -low density lipoproteins. Place in therapy: Consider for tre atment of hypertriglyceridemia in patients with NAFLD, however there is insufficient evidence to recommend their use for specific treatment of NAFLD or NASH.3 Therapeutic dose : 2-4 g/day of ecosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) combine d. Patients should be encouraged to eat a diet including fatty fish (salmon, trout, sardines), however a supplement is normally required to obtain sufficient daily EPA + DHA. NOTE: Omega -3 fatty acids supplements have an anticoagulant effect in doses > 3 g/day (equivalent to a baby aspirin). Consider other medications and disease states before recommending . Monitor , as appropriate. Coffee There is inconclusive evidence that 2 -3 cups of coffee per day (preferably filtered) may be beneficial for patients with fatty liver. Ongoing monitoring Re-calculate FIB -4 score every 2 -3 years to reassess risk of significant liver fibrosis (order ALT, AST, and platelets). Continue management in the Patient Medical Home if FIB -4 score remains < 1.30. Refer to a specialist trained in the management of liver disease if FIB -4 score increases to > 1.30. Outline history and care provided to date . b) Indeterminate/high risk (FIB -4 1.30) Referral to a specialist trained in the management of liver disease. BACKGROUND About this Pathway Digestive health primary care pathways were originally developed in 2015 as part of the Calgary Zone's Specialist LINK initiative. They were co -developed by the Department of Gastroenterology and the Calgary Zone's specialty integration group, which includes medical leadership and staff from Calgary and area Primary Care Networks, the Department of Family Medicine , and Alberta Health Services. 3 DynaMed. Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). EBSCO of 11 Back to Algorithm The pathways were intended to provide evidence -based guidance to support primary care providers in caring for patients with common digestive health conditions within the patient medical home. Based on the successful adoption of the primary care pathways within the Calgary Zone, and their impact on timely access to quality care, in 2017 the Digestive Health Strategic Clinical Network (DHSCN) led an initiative to validate the applicability of the pathways for Alberta and to spread availability and foster adoption of the pathways across the province. Authors & Conflict of Interest Declaration This pathway was reviewed and revised under the auspices of the DHSCN in 2020 by a multi -disciplinary team led by family physicians and gastroenterologists. For more information, contact the DHSCN at Digestivehealth.SCN@ahs.ca . Pathway Review Process Primary care pathways undergo scheduled review every three ye ars, or earlier , if there is a clinically significant change in knowledge or practice. The next scheduled review is June 2023 . However, we welcome feedback at any time. Please email comments to Digestivehealth.SCN@ahs.ca .

It is expected that all users will seek advice of other appropriately qualified and regulated healthcare providers with any issues trans cending their specific knowledge, scope of regulated practice or professional competence. PROVIDER RESOURCES Still concerned about your patient? The primary care physician is typically the provider who is most familiar with their patient's overall health and k nows how they tend to present. Changes in normal patterns, or onset of new or worrisome symptoms , may raise suspicion for a potentially serious diagnosis , even when investigations are normal and typical alarm features are not present. There is eviden ce to support the importance of the family physician's intuition or \"gut feeling\" about patient symptoms, especially when the family physician is worried about a sinister cause such as cancer. A meta -analysis examining the predictive value of gut feelings showed that the odds of a patient being diagnosed with cancer, if a GP recorded a gut feeling, were 4.24 times higher than when no gut feeling was recorded .4 When a \"gut feeling\" persists in spite of normal investigations, and you decide to refer your pat ient for specialist consultation, document your concerns on the referral with as much detail as possible. Another option is to seek specialist advice ( see Advice Options ) to convey your concerns. 4 Friedemann Smith, C., Drew, S., Ziebland, S., & Nicholson, B. D. (2020).

You may need to keep trying other options to find what works best to manage your symptoms.What do I need to know about Non- Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease? Working through the NAFLD patient pathway can take several months or be ongoing for years: Your healthcare providers will ask you questions about your health, review medicines and other products you are taking, and ask about your alcohol use. They may suggest certain tests to look for other causes of liver disease and use blood tests to check your risk of having severe liver damage. If you are at higher risk, you may be referred to a specialist for further assessment. If you are at lower risk, you and your healthcare providers will make a plan to reduce your risk and improve your health. This plan will address your liver health and other health conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and heart disease risk that may occur at the same time. Your healthcare providers will recheck your blood tests every 2 -3 years to monitor your risk of severe liver damage. Get at least 20 minutes of physical activity daily. Aim for 150 minutes each week (e.g. walking, biking, gardening, stairs, your favourite sports). Improve your diet. Choose more high -fibre carbohydrates, less refined starches, and less added sugars. Avoid saturated fats. Choose lean meats and plant -based proteins. Lose weight, if you need to. Losing just 3 -5 kg (7 -11 lbs) can help. Limit alcohol use to no more than 4 -5 drinks/week for men and 3 -4 drinks/week for women. Drinking up to 2 -3 cups of coffee/day may be helpful.To manage your condition, try to:Seeing a specialist is only recommended if : Your blood tests suggest you have a higher risk of severe liver damage.
