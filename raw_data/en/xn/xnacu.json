The present study examined the mechanisms by which B cells regulate the host neutrophilic response upon exposure to mycobacteria and how neutrophilia may influence vaccine efficacy. To address these questions, a murine aerosol infection tuberculosis (TB) model and anintradermal (ID) ear BCG immunization mouse model, involving both the mMT strain and B cell-depleted C57BL/6 mice, were used. IL (interleukin)-17 neutralization and neutrophil depletion experiments using these systems provide evidence that B cells can regulate neutrophilia by modulating the IL-17 response during M. tuberculosis infection and BCG immunization. Exuberant neutrophilia at the site of immunization in B cell-deficient mice adversely affects dendritic cell (DC) migration tothe draining lymph nodes and attenuates the development of the vaccine-induced Th1 response. The results suggest that Bcells are required for the development of optimal protective anti-TB immunity upon BCG vaccination by regulating the IL- 17/neutrophilic response. Administration of sera derived from M. tuberculosis -infected C57BL/6 wild-type mice reverses the lung neutrophilia phenotype in tuberculous mMT mice.

Introduction It has recently been demonstrated that B cells can shape the development of the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis [1,2]. The lungs of M. tuberculosis -infected B cell-deficient mice display exacerbated inflammation, with enhanced neutrophilrecruitment [1]. Neutrophils are among the earliest cells tomigrate to the site of M. tuberculosis infection and evidence exists that these phagocytes participate in the granulomatous reaction[3,4]. Enhanced neutrophil infiltration has been associated withexcessive lung pathology and with poor bacillary control ingenetically susceptible mice [5,6]. It has been proposed thatneutrophilia is indicative of failed Th1 immunity in response toaerosol M. tuberculosis challenge [7]. There is also evidence suggesting that interaction of M. tuberculosis with neutrophils enhances DC migration to the draining lymph nodes therebypromoting the initiation of adaptive immune response in an aerogenic tuberculous infection [8]. Studies examining the significance of neutrophils in protection against M. tuberculosis have yielded conflicting results [3,5,9,10,11,12,13,14], and the role of these professional phagocytes in TB remains to be clearly defined. The cytokine IL-17 plays an important role in the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of inflammation [15,16,17,18], including the airways, during infection [19,20]. In autoimmune diseases and infection, IL-17 is produced by a variety of host cells, including myeloid cells [21], invariant natural killer (iNK) T cells [22], [23,24], cdT cells [25,26,27], a by Th17 cells can downregulate IL-10 production and subsequently drives Th1 responses [29]. BCG vaccination induces Th17 cells that populate the lungs of PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 7 | e1003472immunized mice [30]. Upon challenge with M. tuberculosis , the Th17 cells recruit Th1 cells to the site of infection to restrict mycobacterial growth [30]. IL-17 can, however, promote tissue damage during M. tuberculosis infection [17,31] and in the context of other infectious and autoimmune diseases [15,16,32,33,34]. It has been shown that repeated BCG vaccinations enhanced IL-17 production that is associated with increased neutrophil recruit-ment and exacerbated lung tissue pathology [35]. Therefore, a protective immune response against M. tuberculosis should promote Th17-mediated protection while mitigating the tissue damagingeffects. Ample evidence support the notion that B cells and the humoral immune response modulate T cell immunity [36,37], including thedevelopment of memory T cell responses during infection [36,37] and vaccine-induced protection against secondary challenge with intracellular pathogens such as Chlamydia [38] and Francisella[39]. Experimental evidence suggests that humoral immunity plays a role in regulating the Th1 response in TB [2]. Results derived from an X-linked ( xid) B cell-deficient mouse model suggest that neutrophilia may adversely affect BCG vaccine efficacy [40]. Recent studies involving the B cell-depleting agentrituximab have revealed that B cells may enhance or diminish the IL-17/Th17 response [41,42,43,44]. It has recently been reported that a subset of B cells in the blood of humans with tuberculousinfection can suppress Th17 response [45]. These observations on B cells have prompted us to examine the role of B cells in regulation of IL-17 and neutrophilic responses tomycobacteria using an acute aerosol infection model as well as an ear ID BCG immunization model. The results provide evidence that B cells regulate neutrophilia during M. tuberculosis infection and BCG immunization by modulating the IL-17 response. The study also revealed that neutrophilia at the site of immunization adversely affects the development of BCG-induced Th1 responseby diminishing DC migration to draining lymph nodes, thereby attenuating T cell immunity against M. tuberculosis . This latter observation suggests that B cells can optimize BCG-elicited Th1immunity by regulating the IL-17/neutrophilic response. Finally, the lung neutrophilia and enhanced Th17 response seen in M.tuberculosis -infected B cell-deficient mice could be reversed by passive immune serum therapy, raising the possibility thatimmunoglobulins (Igs) may contribute to the regulation of these phenotypes. Results B cell-deficiency is associated with an augmented inflammation and neutrophilic infiltration in the lungs of M. tuberculosis -infected mice during the acute phase of infection The aberrant immune response to M. tuberculosis , including excessive neutrophilia [1], has yet to be mechanistically explained. Emerging evidence suggest neutrophils play a significant role in modulating the immune response to M. tuberculosis [3,4,5,6,7,8] We initiated studies to characterize the neutrophilic response in acuteTB in the B cell-deficient mMT mouse [1]. Flow cytometric analysis of lung cells procured from M. tuberculosis -infected mMT mice revealed a neutrophilic response that was significantly higher than that observed in infected wild-type controls. At as early as 7 days post-infection (p.i.), the difference in lung neutrophiliabetween the two groups of mice was, albeit small, significant (p,0.05) (Figure 1A; Right Panel). By 21 days p.i., the absolute number of neutrophils in the lungs of mMT mice was over two fold that observed in wild-type animals (p ,0.005). The proportion of neutrophils in the total lung cell population was also higher intuberculous mMT mice relative to wild-type (Figure 1A; Left Panel & data not shown). This pulmonic neutrophilia of M. tuberculosis - infected mMT mice was also apparent histologically (Figure 1D&E), and was associated with an overall enhanced inflammatory response as assessed by histological examination of infected tissues(Figure 1B&C) and by quantifying the total number of cells infiltrating the lungs throughout the first month after infection (Figure 1F). Thus, the previously observed enhanced pulmonic neutrophil and exacerbated granulomatous inflammatory response of tuberculous mMT mice at 1 month p.i., when adaptive immunity sets in, is similarly observed in early acute TB, when the predominant anti-tuberculous response is mediated via innate immunity [1]. These data suggest that B cells can regulate the pulmonic inflammatory response, including that involving neu- trophils, in the early acute phase of TB. Neutrophilia in the lungs of B cell-deficient mice with acute TB is associated with an enhanced IL-17/Th17 response The link between IL-17 and neutrophil recruitment [15,16], as well as the observation suggesting a role for B cells and humoralimmunity in modulating Th1 response in TB [2] and Th17 response in autoimmune diseases [41,42,43,44,45] prompted us to examine whether the neutrophilia observed in the lungs of mMT mice could be due to an aberrant Th17/IL-17 response as a result of B cell-deficiency. Flow cytometric analyses of lung cells, inconjunction with intracellular staining, revealed that on day 21 p.i., the numbers of IL-17-producing lung cells were elevated in tuberculous mMT mice compared to infected wild-type controls (Figure 2A), a subset of which is CD4 cells (Figure 2B). The lung neutrophilia of tuberculous mMT mice could be significantly reversed by IL-17 neutralization (Figure 2C). Lung bacterial burden in mMT mice treated with IL-17 neutralizing antibodies (Abs) was comparable to those treated with isotype controls, excluding bacillary loads as a variable that may confound data interpretation (Figure 2D). These results suggest that IL-17,produced locally by lung cells including Th17 cells, plays aAuthor Summary Mycobacterium tuberculosis poses a serious threat to public health globally. It has been well established that T cells are critical in protection against M. tuberculosis . The role of B cells and humoral immunity in the process is less wellunderstood. We previously showed that B cells andhumoral immunity regulate the immune response against M. tuberculosis . The present study examined the mecha- nisms by which B cells regulate the host neutrophilicresponse upon exposure to mycobacteria and howneutrophilia may modulate the development of vaccine- induced protective immunity. The data reveal that B cells can regulate neutrophilia during M. tuberculosis infection and BCG vaccination by modulating the IL-17 response. Vaccination studies show that excess neutrophilia adverse- ly affects the development of BCG-elicited Th1 response.These observations suggest that B cells can optimize thedevelopment of protective immunity upon BCG vaccina- tion by regulating the IL-17/neutrophilic response. Under- standing the mechanisms by which B cells and humoralimmunity modulate the immune response during M. tuberculosis infection and BCG immunization, particularly those that regulate IL-17 levels and neutrophilia, may lead to the development of novel strategies for the control ofthe tubercle bacillus, including efficacious vaccines.B Cells Regulate Neutrophilia by Modulating IL-17 PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 2 July 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 7 | e1003472significant role in recruiting neutrophils to the lungs of B cell- deficient mMT mice in the early phase of acute M. tuberculosis infection and that B cells and humoral immunity play a role in regulating the IL-17/Th17 response in TB. B cell-depleted wild-type C57BL/6 mice also exhibit neutrophilia and augmented Th17 response in acute TB The previously reported B cell deficiency-associated pheno- types, which include lung neutrophilia at 1 month after aerogenic M. tuberculosis challenge [1], were observed in the mMT strain rendered B cell-deficient by targeted disruption of the membrane exon of the mchain gene [46]. That these observations are B cell- specific is strongly supported by reversal of the B cell deficiencyphenotypes by adoptive B cell transfer [1]. Nevertheless, to rigorously test the B cell-specificity of the Th17/IL-17/neutro-philia phenotype observed in the mMT strain in acute TB (Figures 1&2), we conducted experiments involving B celldepletion via administration of CD22-cal, an effective (Figure S1A), in C57BL/6 the results of the mMT studies, neutrophilic infiltration in the lungs of tuberculous B cell-depleted C57BL/6 mice was higher compared to that observed in undepleted controls(Figure 3A). Neutrophilia in B cell-depleted mice was apparent asearly as 7 days after aerogenic challenge, and increased steadilyover the next 2 weeks, peaking at day 21 to day 28 post-inoculation (Figure 3A). This neutrophilia was associated with an Figure 1. B cell-deficiency in mMT mice is associated with an augmented lung neutrophilic and inflammatory response in M. tuberculosis -infected mice during the acute phase of infection. Wild-type or B cell-deficient mMT mice were infected aerogenically with 200- 300 CFU of M. tuberculosis Erdman. Lungs cells were procured for cytometric analysis, in conjunction with intracellular staining, at appropriate time intervals p.i.. A, B cell-deficient mMT mice exhibited significant elevation, relative to wild-type animals, in the percentage and in the number of neutrophils (CD11b+Ly6G+) among lung cells during acute tuberculous infection. The FACS dot plot depicts the percentage of neutrophils at day 21 p.i.. (*p,0.05, **p ,0.005). The number of neutrophils infiltrating the lungs was evaluated on day 7, 14, and 21 p.i..

As in the mMT study, IL-17 neutralization reversed the phenotype B mice congruency of the B cell-depletion and mMT studies strongly support that the IL-17/Th17/neutrophila phenotype is B cell- specific, supporting a role for B cells in regulating neutrophilia in acute TB through modulation of the IL-17 response. B cell deficiency results in a diminished BCG vaccine- induced Th1 response in mice It has been suggested that neutrophilia in the B cell-deficient xid mouse may diminish anti-TB vaccine efficacy, although the B cell-specificity of the phenotypes and the mechanisms underlying the enhanced neutrophilic response was not examined [40]. This observation, together with the Th17/neutrophilia phenotypeobserved in M. tuberculosis -infected B cell-deficient mice (Figures 1-3), led us to hypothesize that B cells and humoralimmunity, by virtue of their ability to modulate the IL-17 responseand neutrophilia (Figures 1-3) upon exposure to mycobacteria, may affect the efficacy of anti-TB vaccine. To begin testing this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of B cell deficiency on the BCG- induced Th1 response in mice. The results showed that upon subcutaneous (SC) BCG immunization, B cell-deficient mice, compared to wild-type mice, developed a significantly attenuated Th1 response (Figure 4A). This attenuated Th1 response was also apparent in C57BL/6 mice treated with 5D2 (Figure 4B), a highly effective B cell-depleting anti-CD20 Ab (Figure S1B). Together, the mMT and the 5D2 vaccination studies have provided compelling evidence that B cells are required for optimal development of BCG-induced Th1 response. Characterization of the effect of B cell-deficiency on the BCG-induced Th1 response: The ID ear vaccinationmouse model A limitation of the SC BCG immunization mouse model, which involves administration of the vaccine at the scruff of the neck of Figure 2. B cell-deficiency in mMT mice is associated with an augmented lung Th17 response in tuberculous mice during the acute phase of infection: reversibility of neutrophilia by IL-17 neutralization. Wild-type or mMT mice infected aerogenically with 200-300 CFU of M. tuberculosis Erdman. Lungs cells were procured for cytometric analysis, in conjunction with intracellular staining, at appropriate time intervals p.i.. A, Compared to wild-type C57BL/6s, B cell-deficient mMT mice displayed increased in the number of IL-17A-producing lung cells and B, total number of pulmonic Th17 cells (CD3+CD4+IL-17A+) upon M. tuberculosis infection (*p ,0.05). C, Quantification of neutrophil infiltration into the lungs of B cell-deficient mMT mice following IL-17 neutralization at day 14 p.i. revealed that increased neutrophilia was reversed via treatment with a mAb specific for this cytokine (***p ,0.0005). D, this reversibility was not due to differences in bacterial burden since the total numbers of CFU in the lungs of mAb-treated and -untreated mouse groups were comparable. Data presented are representative of two to threeexperiments with three to five mice per group.doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003472.g002B Cells Regulate Neutrophilia by Modulating IL-17 PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 4 July 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 7 | e1003472the animal, is the variability in the anatomic location of the lymph nodes to which immune cells (e.g., DCs) migrate from this site ofvaccination. In addition, it is difficult to locate the precise area ofvaccination to procure immune cells for analysis. These problem-atic features of the SC immunization model complicate theanalysis of local immunological events that ensue upon immuni- zation. Consequently, we adopted an ear ID vaccination model tocircumvent this hindrance, since the anatomical location of thedraining lymph nodes of the ear (the superficial cervical lymphnodes) is well defined, and the site of immunization in the pinna Figure 3. B cell depletion results in an increased neutrophilic and Th17 response in the lungs of C57BL/6 mice with acute TB: IL-17 neutralization reverses the neutophilia phenotype. Wild-type C57BL/6 animals or mice depleted of B cells using the CD22-cal conjugated Ab were infected aerogenically with 200-300 CFU of M. tuberculosis Erdman; lung cells were prepared at appropriate time intervals after infection and subjected to intracellular staining and/or flow cytometric analysis. Administration of CD22-cal resulted in ,95% depletion of CD19 +B cells in the lungs of M. tuberculosis -infected mice at day 21 p.i. (see Figure S1A). A, The proportion and absolute number of neutrophils (CD11b+Ly6G+) among total lung cells in mice rendered B cell-deficient by CD22-cal treatment are elevated relative to those detected non-B cell-depleted animals(*p,0.05, **p ,0.005). B, CD22-cal-treated B cell-depleted mice, relative to untreated wild-type animals, exhibited a significant increase in total IL-17- producing lung cells during the acute phase of tuberculous infection (*p ,0.05). C, Neutralization of IL-17 in CD22-cal-treated mice reverses lung neutrophilia phenotype associated with cell-depletion at day 14 p.i. (*p ,0.05, **p ,0.005). Data depicted are representative of two to three experiments with three to five mice per group.doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003472.g003B Cells Regulate Neutrophilia by Modulating IL-17 PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 5 July 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 7 | e1003472can be readily localized [49]. In this model, the level of neutrophil infiltration was higher in the ears of vaccinated mMT mice relative to that detected in wild-type animals as early as 7 days post- vaccination (Figure 5A). The number of neutrophils at the site of vaccination was also higher in immunized mMT mice relative to wild-type mice (Figure 6A, Right Panel). Neutrophilia was similarly observed in BCG vaccinated sites in the ear of mice rendered B cell-deficient via 5D2 treatment (Figure 5B). These data revealed that in B cell-deficient mice, pulmonic neutrophilia observed during the acute phase of M. tuberculosis infection occurs also at the site of ID BCG vaccination in the ear. Since B cell deficiency is associated with sub-optimal develop- ment of BCG-elicited Th1 response (Figure 4), and since DC priming of CD4+T cells is critical to the development of vaccine- induced protection, we initiated studies to characterize the kinetics of DC migration to the draining lymph nodes following BCG vaccination. The results revealed that mMT or B cell-depleted C57BL/6 mice exhibited diminished numbers of CD11c+DCs in the superficial cervical lymph nodes compared to wild-type controls starting at as early as day 2 and continuing through day 7 post-vaccination (Figure 5D&F). The BCG-induced Th1response of the two B cell-deficient mouse groups, as assessed by the number of interferon (IFN)- c-producing CD4 +T cells in the draining superficial cervical lymph nodes, was diminished compared to that detected in vaccinated wild-type animals (Figure 5C&E). These data suggest that B cell deficiency results in impaired T cell priming following BCG immunization. The decreased number of BCG-induced DC migrated to the draining lymph nodes in the B cell-deficient animals could be a factor that contributes to the impairment of CD4+T cell priming observed in themMT and B cell-depleted mice. The effects of IL-17 neutralization on the development of BCG-induced Th1 response in B cell-deficient mice The enhanced pinna neutrophilia and the impaired Th1 response observed in B cell-deficient mice upon BCG immuniza- tion (Figure 5) prompted us to investigate the relationship between these two observations. Based on the finding that lung neutrophilia inM. tuberculosis -infected mice is Th17/IL-17 driven (Figures 2 & 3), we first examined the effect of IL-17 neutralization on BCG- induced Th1 response in the ear immunization model. In agreement with results obtained from the lung infection model(Figures 2 & 3), IL-17 neutralization significantly attenuated the BCG-induced neutrophilic response in the ear inoculation model, reducing the number of neutrophils in the BCG-vaccination site of C57BL/6 and B cell-deficient animals by 78% and 49%, respectively (Figure 6A). The results indicate that IL-17 is involved, at least in part, in neutrophil recruitment to the site of BCG immunization in both B cell-deficient and B cell-sufficient states. IL-17 neutralization in wild-type and B cell-deficient mMT mice, albeit in opposing fashion (Figure 6B). Concomitant with the decrease in neutrophilia at the site of immunization upon IL-17 neutralization, there was an increased BCG-elicited Th1 response in the B cell-deficient mice (Figure 6B). By contrast, IL-17 neutralization in immunized wild-type C57BL/6 mice resulted in a diminished Th1 response (Figure 6B). The incongruent effects of IL-17 neutralization on the BCG-induced Th1 response among wild-type and mMT mice were also apparent on DC migration to the draining cervical lymph nodes following vaccination (Figure 6C). IL-17 neutraliza- tion during BCG immunization of mMT mice did not alter the number of DCs in the draining cervical lymph nodes 7 days post-immunization, but decreased that in wild-type mice (Figure 6C). These data suggest that i) IL-17 modulates the BCG-elicited Th1 response; and ii) the enhanced response in B cell- deficient mMT mice upon BCG immunization contributes to the diminished vaccine-elicited Th1 immunity. This effect could be mediated by IL-17/Th17 per se and/or through the level of neutrophilic infiltration at the site of vaccination. The discrepant effects of IL-17 neutralization on vaccination-induced Th1 response in wild-type C57BL/6 and mMT mice warrant further investigation. Neutrophil depletion improves DC migration to and priming of Th1 cells in draining lymph nodes IL-17 neutralization resulted in only partial attenuation of the neutrophilic response in the ear vaccination model (Figure 6A). Due to this partial effect and the link between IL-17 and neutrophilic recruitment, the IL-17 depletion approach does not allow clear determination of the relative contribution of thiscytokine and neutrophils to the observed B cell-deficiency- associated Th1 and DC phenotypes. To begin to address this issue, we conducted neutrophil depletion experiments using the Figure 4. B cell deficiency results in a diminished Th1 response in BCG-immunized mice. Wild-type or B cell-deficient mice were vaccinated with BCG and at one month post-immunization, splenic T cells were assessed for the development of Th1 response by quantification ofIFN-c-producing CD4+T cells. A, cells in wild-type and mMT mice 1 month after vaccination revealed a diminished Th1 response in the B cell deficient group (** p ,0.005). B, A similarly decrease in BCG-induced Th1 response was also observed in mice rendered B cell-deficient via treatment with the anti-CD20 5D2 mAb (***p ,0.0005). Data shown are representative of three independent experiments with four mice per group.doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003472.g004B Cells Regulate Neutrophilia by Modulating IL-17 PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 6 July 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 7 | e1003472Figure 5. B cell-deficient mice, upon ID ear immunization with BCG, display an enhanced neutrophilic infiltration in the pinna and an attenuated Th1 response in the draining superficial cervical lymph nodes that are associated with diminished DC migration. Ears of wild-type or B cell-deficient mice were vaccinated intradermally with BCG and assessed at the indicated time intervals post-immunization. Cellsfrom the ear and the draining superficial cervical lymph nodes were procured as described in Materials and Methods and subjected to flowcytometric analysis. mMT mice ( A) and C57BL/6s depleted of B cells using the 5D2 anti-CD20 mAb ( B) exhibited elevated numbers of CD11b+Ly6G+ neutrophils compared to wild-type animals (*p ,0.05). Results of flow cytometric analyses showed a diminished number of IFN- c-producing CD4+Th1 cells ( C) and CD11c+DC (D) in draining superficial cervical lymph nodes of B cell-deficient mMT mice (relative to wild-type C57BL/6's) that were in the (1 6106CFU) (*p ,0.05). This Th1 ( E) and DC migration ( F) phenotypes were similarly observed in mice depleted B cells via treatment of the 5D2 anti-CD20 mAb (*p ,0.05). Data shown are representative of two to three independent experiments with four mice per group.doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003472.g005B Cells Regulate Neutrophilia by Modulating IL-17 PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 7 July 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 7 | e1003472Ly6G-specific Ab, clone 1A8 [14]. 1A8 completely depleted neutrophils at site of BCG immunization of both wild-typeC57BL/6 and mMT mice (Figure 7A). Neutrophil depletion reverses the DC and Th1 phenotypes in BCG-vaccinated mMT mice ofIFN- c-producing CD4 +T cells in the draining lymph nodes of mMT mice on day 7 post-immunization by over two fold (Figure 7C). Neutrophil depletion increased the number of DCsin the draining lymph nodes of the mMT mice by three fold (Figure 7B). Similar enhancing effects of neutrophil depletion on the number of Th1 cells and DCs were observed in the draining lymph nodes of BCG-vaccinated C57BL/6 mice (Figure 7B&C),albeit to a lesser extent than mMTs. To stringently test the B cell- specificity of these observations, we examined the effects ofneutrophil depletion on C57BL/6 mice rendered B cell deficientusing the anti-CD20 Ab 5D2. Results derived from the 5D2-based model are similar to those obtained using the mMT mice (Figure 7D&E). These results strongly suggest that in the ear vaccination model, B cells contribute significantly to the development ofvaccine-induced Th1 immunity by modulating the IL-17 driven neutrophilic response. In the absence of B cells, neutrophils play a dominant role in down-regulating the development of vaccine- induced Th1 response. The mechanisms by which neutrophils adversely affect the development of BCG-induced Th1 response remained to be defined. One possibility is the ability of neutrophils to internalize BCG, thereby competing with DCs (the primary antigen presenting cell (APC) responsible for the initiation of the anti-TB immune response) for antigens, which could result in a sub-optimal antigen dose required for T cell priming in lymph nodes. In support of this notion, bacterial load in the draining cervical lymph nodes of B cell-deficient mMT and 5D2-treated mice is lower than that of wild-type C57BL/6 mice (Figure 7F). Immune serum therapy in mMT mice reverses the neutrophil and Th17 phenotypes Previously we have shown that adoptively-transferred B cells (derived from M. tuberculosis -infected wild-type C57BL/6 mice) intomMT mice with TB effectively reverses the lung phenotypes Figure 6.

A, The frequency (Left Panel) and absolute number (Right Panel) of neutrophils (CD11b+Ly6G+) in the ear dermis of B cell-deficient mMT mice on day 7 following BCG vaccination was increased relative to that observed in wild-type C57BL/6 animals. In these studies, cells obtained from the vaccinated ears were pooled for analysis. Theenhanced pinna neutrophilic response was attenuated upon IL-17 neutralization. Upon ID ear vaccination, the B cell-deficient mMT mice exhibited decreased number of ( B) and CD11c+DC cells ( C) in the draining superficial cervical lymph nodes of mMT mice relative to those detected in wild-type C57BL/6's. While IL-17 neutralization increased the number of Th1 cells ( B) in the draining cervical lymph nodes of mMT mice intradermally immunized in the ear, it had no apparent effects on the number of DC ( C). By contrast, IL-17 neutralization attenuated DC migration ( C) to and the Th1 response ( B) in the draining cervical nodes of wild-type C57BL/6 mice (*p ,0.05, ***p ,0.0005).

That the transferred B cells are able to reverse pulmonic phenotypes of infected mMT mice without homing to the lungs suggests regulation via a soluble factor(s). In that same study, the transfer of B cells resulted in the appearance of Igs in therecipient mMT mice [1]. These results suggest the possibility that Igs may be one factor that can reverse the B cell-deficiency phenotypes, including neutrophilia. In support of this possibility, results generated from an M. tuberculosis infection model involving FccR knockout mouse strains strongly suggest that humoral immunity can regulate host responses (including tissue neutrophil- ia) to the tubercle bacillus [2]. To begin testing the Ig hypothesis, we conducted serum therapy study, which revealed that treatment of tuberculous B cell-deficient mMT mice with immune sera derived from M. tuberculosis -infected wild-type animals reversed the lung neutrophilia phenotype (Figure 8A). This serum therapy also resulted in a decrease in the number of Th17 cells in the lungs of treated tuberculous mMT mice (Figure 8B). The data suggest that components of the immune serum, possibly Igs, may play a role in regulating the neutrophil and Th17 response during acute M. tuberculosis infection. Discussion Cell-mediated immunity is well established as critical in defense against M. tuberculosis [50,51,52]. By contrast, the significance of B cells and humoral immunity in shaping the immune response to the tubercle bacillus is less clear [37,53,54]. Studies using B cell- deficient mMT mice, in conjunction with B cell transfer, haveprovided evidence that B cells and the humoral immune response can modulate anti-tuberculous immunity, including the level ofgranulomatous inflammation and neutrophilic infiltration in lungs[1]. Fc cR knockout mouse studies suggest that humoral immunity can influence development of Th1 responses during M. tuberculosis infection [2]. The data of the present study add the IL-17/Th17/neutrophils axis to the list of immunological factors regulated by Bcells and humoral immunity in TB. The results generated in two different models (lung M. tuberculosis infection and the ear ID BCG vaccination) involving mMT and C57BL/6 mice rendered B cell-deficient via treatment with two independent B cell-depleting agents, revealed B cell-dependent tissue neutrophilia at the site of interaction betweenmycobacteria and the host. These observations, together with datayielded by the IL-17 neutralization and neutrophil depletionexperiments, provided strong evidence that i) B cells regulateneutrophilia during M. tuberculosis infection and BCG immuniza- tion; ii) exuberant early neutrophilia can adversely affect vaccine-induced Th1 response by impairment of DC migration to draininglymph nodes, thereby compromising CD4 +T cell priming; and as a result, iii) B cells can optimize BCG-elicited Th1 immunity byregulating the IL-17/neutrophil response. Neutrophilia in thelungs of tuberculous mMT mice is apparent as early as 7 days p.i., which is prior to an increase in the number of total lung IL-17-producing cells (observed on day 21 post-aerosolization), suggest-ing the possibility that IL-17-independent mechanisms areinvolved in the regulation of B cell dependent lung neutrophilia[55]. The decrease in the number of DCs in the draining lymph Figure 8. Passive transfer of immune serum into B cell-deficient mice reverses the neutrophil and Th17 phenotypes. B cell deficient mMT mice were aerogenically infected with 100-300 CFU of M. tuberculosis Erdman and lung neutrophilia assessed at 1 month p.i..

This notion is supported by the decrease in bacterialburden in the draining lymph nodes of immunized B cell-deficient mice. It is, however, possible that the antigen uptake and migration capacity of the DCs at the site of immunization of a B cell-deficient host, is adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by the excessive neutrophilia (independent of the BCG competition theory) that occurs in the dermis of the vaccinated ear. The results that IL-17 neutralization with concomitant decrease in neutro-philia improves Th1 response in BCG-vaccinated mMT mice without affecting the number of lymph node DCs suggest the possibility that the immunization site in the ear of the mMT mice provides a local environment, of which excessive neutrophilia is a feature, can qualitatively compromise the capacity of DCs to effectively prime CD4 +T cells. The opposing effects of IL-17 neutralization on BCG-elicited Th1 response in vaccinated wild-type and mMT mice are intriguing. The results generated by the IL-17 neutralizationexperiments involving wild-type mice are, in fact, in agreement with a previous study reporting that IL-17 can drive BCG-elicited Th1 response [29]. The discrepant effects of IL-17 neutralization observed among wild-type and mMT mice in the BCG vaccination model could be secondary to differences in the level of the IL-17 response and to the dissimilarities in the quantity and quality of neutrophils at the immunization site among the two mouse groups,with the level of neutrophilia in the ear dermis of B cell-deficient mMT strain being significantly greater than that detected in the C57BL/6 wild-type mice. These same variables could result in the differential effect of IL-17 neutralization on the number of DCs in the draining lymph nodes of the two mouse groups. It will be of interest to determine the functional properties of the neutrophils infiltrating the immunization sites of the mMT and wild-type mice. Collectively, the IL-17 neutralization studies have provided evidence that B cells can optimize BCG-induced Th1 immunity by modulating the IL-17/neutrophil response. Results of the neutrophil depletion experiment support a role for these cells in regulating development of Th1 responses during vaccination. It has been reported recently that neutrophils enhance CD4 +T cell priming in the early phase of an aerogenic M. tuberculosis lung infection by promoting DC migration to draining mediastinal lymph nodes [8]. In the ear ID BCG immunization model employed here, neutrophil depletion en- hances the vaccine-induced Th1 response. The discrepant data regarding the role of neutrophils in modulating CD4+T cell priming could be due to the obvious multiple variables in the two models employed, including but not limited to the differences inthe strains of mycobacteria studied (BCG versus M. tuberculosis ), in the quality of the DCs (lungs versus skin), and in the conditions in which the mycobacteria interact with the host (lungs parenchyma versus dermis). In a Leishmania major model involving ID ear infection of metacyclic promastigotes, neutrophil depletion also results in enhanced priming of pathogen-specific CD4 +T cells [56]. By contrast and worthy of note, the observation that IL-17- neutralized C57BL/6 mice displayed a decrease in BCG-induced Th1 response and in the number of DCs in draining lymph nodes lends indirect support to the recently reported role for neutrophils in promoting T cell priming in acute TB [8], since IL-17 neutralization decreases the number of neutrophils at the site of immunization in the ear vaccination model. These contrastingobservations of the IL-17 neutralization and the neutrophildepletion studies could be due to differences in the immunological environment resulting from IL-17 neutralization versus neutrophildepletion. For example, IL-17 neutralization results in partial decrease in the degree of neutrophilia at the site of immunization and in the level of IL-17, while 1A8 treatment results in virtuallycomplete depletion of neutrophils without apparent interference with the amounts of IL-17. Together, the results also suggest that the complex roles of neutrophils in development of immuneresponse to M. tuberculosis could depend on the characteristics of the site of immunological reaction, the level of neutrophilia as well as the interaction with other immune molecules. Understandingthe mechanisms underlying the differential effects of neutrophil depletion on the development of the Th1 response in the lung infection and ear immunization model may shed light on therequisites for the development of optimally efficacious anti-TB vaccines. The precise mechanisms by which B cells regulate the IL-17 response remain to be determined. The effects of IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulins) treatment on M. tuberculosis -infect- ed mice [57] and results obtained from the Fc cRIIB- and Fc c chain-deficient mouse TB models strongly support a role for Igs in regulating anti-TB immunity, including the Th1 response [2]. The notion is further supported by the ability of adoptively transferredB cells from infected C57BL/6 mice to reverse neutrophilia in the lungs of infected mMT mice without having to home to the lungs [1]. In the current study, we demonstrate that immune sera frominfected mice can reverse the lung neutrophilia and Th17 phenotypes in B cell-deficient mice with TB. It is thus tempting to speculate that Igs, known effective modulators of inflammation[53,58], are a factor in the immune sera with the capacity to ameliorate the B cell-deficiency associated neutrophilia and Th17 phenotypes. We are cognizant of the complex nature of sera andas such, much work needs to be done in order to establish or refute a role for Igs in regulating the neutrophilic response in a tuberculous host. Experiments designed to address this issue arecurrently underway. In summary, results of the present study provide strong evidence that B cells can regulate tissue neutrophilia during M. tuberculosis infection and BCG vaccination by modulating the IL-17 response. In addition, the study has provided evidence that the compromised BCG-induced Th1 response associated with B cell-deficiency issecondary to neutrophilia. These observations suggest that B cells can optimize BCG-elicited Th1 immunity by regulating the IL- 17/neutrophilic response. It appears that optimally effectiveimmunization protocols should achieve a balanced level of IL- 17/neutrophilic response, which can only be achieved through a comprehensive understanding of the biology of these twoimmunological elements. Elucidation of the mechanisms by which B cells regulate the IL-17/neutrophilia response in M. tuberculosis - host interaction may help the design of novel effective TB vaccinesand of protocols for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. Last but not least, the overall congruent results of the mMT and B cell depletion experiments suggest the validity of the use of the mMT mouse to investigate the role of B cells and humoral immunity in the development of anti-mycobacterial immune responses [1].

All protocols used in the studyhave been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and UseB Cells Regulate Neutrophilia by Modulating IL-17 PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 11 July 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 7 | e1003472Committee of Albert Einstein College of Medicine (protocol # 20110602). Animals Female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories) and B cell- deficient mice ( mMT; Jackson Laboratories) [46], 8-10 weeks old, were used in all experiments. Infected mice were housed in ourbiosafety level-3 laboratory and kept pathogen-free by routineserological and histopathological examinations. Animal protocolsemployed in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Mycobacteria, mouse infection, and determination of tissue bacterial burden Bacterial stocks of M. tuberculosis strain Erdman (Dr. Frank Collins, Trudeau Institute, Saranac Lake, NY) were generated bypassaging through mice to maintain virulence as previouslydescribed [1]. Bacteria were stored at 280uC in aliquots until use. Mice were infected with 100-300 colony forming units (CFU) ofM. tuberculosis via aerosol inhalation using a Glas-Col to deliver the desired inoculum [59]. For eachexperiment, the accuracy of inoculum dose was confirmed byassessing the number of bacterial colonies upon plating serialdilutions of whole lung homogenates on 7H10 agar plates (Difco)as previously described [1]. Tissue bacterial burden was quantifiedas previously described by plating serial dilutions of lung, liver, and spleen homogenates onto 7H10 agar plates at appropriate intervals after infection [1]. Tissue bacterial load was determinedby counting the number of colonies on 7H10 agar plates afterincubation at 37 uC for 4 to 6 weeks. Preparation of single-cell suspension from tissues Single cell suspensions were prepared as previously described [1]. Briefly, aseptically procured lungs, spleen, or lymph nodeswere dissected at appropriate times after exposure to mycobacte-ria, then minced using sterile razor blades (Fisher Scientific) in coldRPMI 1640 with L-glutamine supplemented and 55 mercaptoethanol (complete lung tissues were thenincubated in 1 mg/mL collagenase and 30 mg/mL DNase (Sigma Aldrich) at 37 uC for 30 min. Digested tissues were passed through a 70- mm pore nylon cell strainer (Falcon; BD Biosciences) using the flat end of a sterile syringe plunger. The resultant cell suspensionswere then treated with ACK lysis buffer (Invitrogen) to lyse redblood cells. Cells were then washed twice with complete RPMI. The method of trypan blue exclusion was used to enumerate live cells. For the ID model of immunization, ear dermal sheets weresplit along the cartilage and placed skin-side up in RPMI completesupplemented with 10% FCS and collagenase (1 mg/mL),followed by one-hour incubation at 37 uC and 5% CO 2to prepare suspensions of cells. Single cell suspensions were obtainedby filtering through a 70- mm cell strainer (BD Falcon). Flow cytometry and intracellular staining Single cell suspensions prepared from various tissues as described above, were washed in Flow Cytometry Staining Buffer (eBioscience). Flow cytometric analysis and intracellular stainingwas as previously described [1,2]. For each sample,approximately 10 6cells were suspended in Flow Cytometry Staining Buffer. Cellular Fc creceptors were blocked by incubating cells in Fc block (BD Biosciences) on ice for 10 min. Cells werethen immunostained cells were excluded from analysis using the LIVE/DEAD Fixable Violet Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. Samples were collected on an LSRII (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), and data analysis was performed using FlowJo software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR). To stain for intracellular cytokines, single lung cellsuspensions prepared as described above were stimulated in wells of 96-well plates in RPMI-1640 with 10% (vol/vol) FBS for 2 hours at 37 uC and 5% CO 2in the presence of PMA (50 (500 ng/mL). Brefeldin A (1 mg/mL; eBioscience) was then added to the wells, and incubation was continued for another 2 hours at 37 uC and 5% CO 2. Following stimulation, the FoxP3 staining buffer kit (eBioscience) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol for intracellular cytokine staining. B cell depletion For B cell depletion studies, two different reagents were used to deplete this lymphocytes population from wild-type C57BL/6 mice. The first reagent, CD22-cal (Pfizer), is an immunoconjugate consisting of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that reacts specifically with mouse CD22 (a B cell-specific dose of 160mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 12 and 7 days before M. tuberculosis infection, and then at 9 and 14 days post-inoculation. This regimen has been shown in various mouse models to effectively deplete B lymphocytes without affecting other immune cells [47]. This CD22-cal protocol routinely attains ,95% of splenic B cell-depletion in treated mice at the time of M. tuberculosis infection and subsequent time intervals of analysis (Figure S1A and data not shown). 5D2, an anti-CD20 mAb (Genentech), was another B cell-depleting agent used. Mice received a dose of10 mg/kg of Ab intravenously two days prior to ID ear or SC BCG immunization. Two weeks after the initial dose, anti-CD20 5D2 was then given i.p. at a dose of 5 mg/kg every other week for maintenance. This 5D2 protocol was shown in pilot experiments to be highly effective in B cell-depletion in mycobacteria-infected mice (Figure S1B). The BCG immunization models BCG immunization was administered either subcutaneously or intradermally. For the conventional SC vaccination model, 106 Pasteur were inoculated subcutaneously in the scruff of theback of the neck in 100 ml of PBS containing 0.05% Tween-80 (Sigma Aldrich). For the ID vaccination model, an inoculum of 106BCG (determined in standardization experiments to be the optimal dose), in 10 ml of PBS containing 0.05% Tween-80 (Sigma Aldrich), was injected intradermally into the ear pinna of anesthetized mice using a Hamilton Microlitre syringe. Single cell suspensions of splenocytes and of the pinna and draining lymph nodes were obtained as described above and subjected to the IFN- cELISPOT assay (see below) IFN- cELISPOT assay was used to assess the CD4+T cell response upon exposure to mycobacteria as previously described [62]. T cells were purified from appropriate tissues at the desired time intervals using the Mouse Pan T Cell Isolation Kit IIB Cells Regulate Neutrophilia by Modulating IL-17 PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 12 July 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 7 | e1003472(Miltenyi Biotech). Detection of IFN- c-producing T cells was conducted using the Mouse IFN- cELISPOT Ready-Set-Go Kit (eBioscience) according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, T cells (16105and 36105) were seeded in wells of 96-well ELISPOT plates (Millipore) that had been coated overnight with IFN- c capture Ab. Peptide 25 (aa 240-254) of M. tuberculosis antigen 85B (P25-Ag85B) was used to stimulate CD4+T cells [62]. Splenocytes from na \u00a8ve uninfected mice were asAPCs. The APCs were pulsed with P25-Ag85B (10 mg/mL) for 1 hour at 37 uC and 5% CO 2, washed twice, and added to T cell-seeded wells (2 6105cells per well). T cells co-cultured with unpulsed APCs served as controls. After a thirty-six-hour incubation at 37 uC and 5% CO 2, cells were removed and the captured cytokine was detected using added to the wells for 45 minutes at room temperature and colorization was achieved using AEC substrate solution (eBioscience). The substrate reaction was stopped by washing the plate with distilled water. Spots were enumerated using an automated ELISPOT reader. In vivo IL-17 neutralization Two anti-mouse IL-17 mAb's were used. One was obtained from R & D systems (50104; IgG 2) and another from Genetech (IgG 1; Gift of Dr. Wenjun Ouyang, Genentech). The mAb's were administered was administered i.p. at a dose of 100 mg per mouse (in 200 ml of sterile PBS) every 3-4 days starting one day before M. tuberculosis infection or BCG immunization for the duration of the study. This regimen has been shown to effectively neutralize IL-17 in various experimental models [63]. Control groups received matched IgG isotypes. In vivo 200mg per mouse in 100 ml of sterile PBS, was administered i.p. every 3-4 days as previously described [64] starting one day before BCG immunization for the duration of the study. Passive serum transfer experiments Blood was collected retro-orbitally from C57BL/6 mice infected with 100 CFU M. tuberculosis Erdman at 1 month p.i.. Sera were collected after clarification by centrifugation of clotted blood andstored at 280uC until use. Sera thus collected are referred to as immune sera. One hundred ml of immune sera were administered i.p. every 3-4 days into mMT mice, starting 1 day before infection with 100-300 CFU of M. tuberculosis Erdman, and continued for 1 month thereafter. At 1 month p.i., lung cells were procured frommice and subjected to intracellular staining and flow cytometricanalysis. Statistical analysis Where appropriate, the statistical significance of data points was determined using the unpaired Student ttest or ANOVA analysis, assessed using GraphPad Prism 5 software. A pvalue of ,0.05 was considered significant. Supporting Information Figure S1 B cell depletion in C57BL/6 mice using CD22- cal and the 5D2 anti-CD20 Abs.
