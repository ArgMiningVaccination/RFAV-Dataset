Skillfully crafted, it combines the potency of B complex and the antioxidant-rich vitamin C, providing a holistic approach to safeguarding your health. Beyond just immune defense, this drip revitalizes your energy reserves, ensuring you stay vibrant and active. Additionally, it facilitates quicker healing, enhancing your body's natural recovery processes. Invest in yourself and strengthen your health armor with this rejuvenating infusion, perfectly designed to support and elevate your overall well-being. Threats to your health and energy can pop up at any time, so keep your immune system in peak condition to defend against these threats. We recommend our Immunity Drip once a month. Our Immunity Drip is more than just a supplement; it's a shield, meticulously crafted to fortify your immune system against daily onslaughts. The incorporation of the Vitamin B complex not only ensures optimal nerve and skin health but acts as a conduit for energy enhancement. Complementing it is Vitamin C, recognized for its role in supercharging immune functions and invigorating energy synthesis. Yet, the potency of our Immunity Drip goes beyond these immediate benefits. Dive deeper, and you'll find it bolsters white blood cell production, a crucial factor in fighting pathogens. Additionally, it promotes robust bone and muscle health while optimizing the circulatory system's efficacy. Incorporating a monthly Immunity Drip session is akin to equipping your body with a comprehensive wellness toolkit, ensuring you remain resilient, vibrant, and in the pinnacle of health. Your wellness armor, redefined. We've made it as simple as possible to sign up. Just provide us with some basic information and you're ready to go. Let us know what date and time work for you and we'll create an appointment. On the day of your treatment, arrive a few minutes early to complete the new patient paperwork. We also recommend wearing loose clothing that leaves your arms free. A registered nurse will insert the IV and monitor your vitals while you kick back in a comfy recliner with headphones and TV/music programming. Vitamin C supports a healthy immune system, nervous system, and brain function, and fights free radicals while creating new collagen. Vitamin B complex plays a central role in heart health, energy production, and immune system health, and is comprised of folic acid, cobalamin, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine, biotin, and pantothenic acid. Vitamin C is comprised of ascorbic acid and enhances immune system health, muscle strength, and bone health. We recommend that you plan for an hour or so. Just make sure that you're comfortable and that whatever you wear doesn't limit access to your arms. All of our vitamin IV drips are done intravenously. A registered nurse will insert the IV into your arm or hand and will also connect you to a device that will monitor your vitals. Both vitamin C and vitamin B complex support immune system function. Our drip is designed to improve white blood cell count (the defenders of the body) so that you can more easily fight off illnesses. Our drip also improves energy, boosts metabolism, and even strengthens your muscles and bones. Yes, there are! We'd be happy to discuss any additional treatments with you. "}
