These remedies may be natural cures for fatigue. Why are you so tired all the time? If you find yourself sleeping through multiple morning alarms or wishing you had a place at work to secretly snooze midday, there's a chance you suffer from fatigue or exhaustion. There are [medical reasons you feel tired all the time](https://www.thehealthy.com/fatigue/tired-all-the-time/), but fatigue not related to a specific medical issue could stem from a number of causes including inadequate or interrupted sleep, poor diet, stress, depression, lack of exercise, and jet lag, says [Maura Henninger](https://drmaura.com/all-conditions-treated/), ND, a naturopathic doctor in New York. Luckily, help for fatigue may be found in a natural remedy. \"Herbal remedies are fantastic at supporting certain kinds of fatigue, especially to issues related to the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, which governs the body's stress response,\" says Dr. Henninger. \"And who doesn't have excessive stress these days? Herbs are great at modulating the body's stress response.\" Next time you find yourself reaching for caffeine or sugar to combat the midday slump, consider these home remedies for your fatigue (and have a laugh at these [funny motivational quotes](https://www.thehealthy.com/mental-health/funny-motivational-quotes/), too). Licorice root If exhaustion has you functioning in zombie-mode and reaching for multiple cups of coffee per day, you could have adrenal fatigue. Although not considered a true medical diagnosis, adrenal fatigue is the name given to a collection of symptoms, [including body aches, digestive troubles, exhaustion, nervousness, and sleeplessness.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/addisons-disease/expert-answers/adrenal-fatigue/faq-20057906) Your adrenal glands, located on top of your kidneys, are responsible for the creation of cortisol. While this hormone plays a crucial role in the body's stress response, ongoing stress can cause the glands to produce inadequate levels of cortisol, leaving you wiped out. Licorice root, in standardized form, is a commonly used natural remedy for this sort of constant fatigue, says Dr. Henninger. This herb, which helps regulate normal system function and allows your body to better cope with stress, has been used for thousands of years in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine. To help restore cortisol levels, look for standardized licorice root in extract or pill form. If you take blood thinners, potassium, or blood pressure medications talk to your physician before taking licorice root because licorice\u2014albeit large amounts\u2014can create a blood pressure rise.
