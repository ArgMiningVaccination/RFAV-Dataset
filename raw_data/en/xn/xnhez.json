Today, people burn sage and other holy herbs to cleanse a space or environment, to generate wisdom and clarity, and to promote healing. The sage smudging ceremony can take place at any point in your wedding. Your officiant let your guests know what's happening, then begin burning the sage. They will typically wave the smoke created from the sage bundle around the couple from their heads to their feet. You may also want to choose an intention, affirmation or prayer to guide the cleanse to make it even more meaningful. Below I burned sage at the beginning of the ceremony to cleanse the space and the couple. Others have chosen to do this right before the wedding vows are said. Talk to your officiant to see what feels right for y'all! Sample Sage Smudging Blessings We begin today with a blessing for the couple. We invite harmony into the relationship allowing the couple to start this new phase in their relationship. I ask that you hold hands as we bless this space and you two. Option One May this smoke cleanse their hearts so that they may be filled with compassion and gratitude. May their hearts be in truth and grow in balance and joy. May they walk in beauty, love, and grace. May they walk with guidance on their life journey together. May they stay grounded and be reminded how-to walk-in balance, joy, love and in harmony with one another all the days of their lives. Option Two May your hands be cleansed, that they create beautiful things. May your feet be cleansed, that they might take you where you most need to be. May your heart be cleansed, that you might hear its messages clearly. May your throat be cleansed, that you might speak rightly when words are needed. May your eyes be cleansed, that you might see the signs and wonders of the world. May this person and space be washed clean by the smoke of these fragrant plants And may that same smoke carry our prayers spiralling to the heavens. Option Three May Lauren and Becca walk with guidance on their life journey together. May they stay grounded and strive to remember to communicate compassionately and to live in balance, joy, love and harmony from this day forward. Now I ask that you two take a deep breath, be captivated by the beauty of this moment...and let us begin. "}
