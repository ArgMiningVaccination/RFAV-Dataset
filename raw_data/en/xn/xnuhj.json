The high prevalence of obesity and physical inactivity is a worldwide public health issue, yet the mechanisms by which energy imbalance and obesity cause cancer remain unclear. MEB investigators are pursuing several approaches to address these issues, including: - Improvement of assessment tools for diet, physical activity, and body size, in order to disentangle these interrelated exposures; - Performance of etiologic studies in high-risk populations (e.g., South Asians); - Studies of biochemical mechanisms, including the use of high-throughput multiplex assays of possible obesity-related biomarkers (such as inflammatory markers/cytokines, metabolic hormones, and sex hormones). A wide variety of studies are conducted using the following cohorts: [Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study](/research/who-we-study/cohorts/alpha-tocopherol-beta-carotene-cancer-prevention-atbc-study) [Case-Control Study of Renal Cell Cancer among Caucasians and African Americans in the United States](/research/cancer-types/kidney-renal/renal-cell-us) [NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study](/node/303748) [Prostate, Lung, Prospective Study](/research/who-we-study/cohorts/prostate-lung-colon-ovary-prospective-study) [Shanghai Women's "}
