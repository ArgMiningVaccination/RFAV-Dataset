Iridology points at areas of blocked energy in the body and also helps to identify a sluggish organ or a weak nerve supply to a particular organ. This sluggishness or weak nerve supply causes fatigue and imbalance in the body. Once these areas or organs are identified we then work to develop and nutrition plan along with herbal medicine OR supplements to bring balance back. NATURAL SUPPLEMENTS Natural supplements can include a variety of products such as vitamins, essential fatty acids, probiotics, and herbs. Supplements should never replace food, but they can help to boost nutrition that may be lacking in our diets. Natural supplements are derived from natural sources, such as plants, whereas other supplements can be made synthetically. They usually come in a liquid, pill, or capsule form to make them easy to swallow and digest. If you are considering taking supplements, it is always advised to consult a doctor beforehand, as some supplements may be unsuitable for you or could cause side effects, while others may not be recommended to take alongside certain medications. Natural supplements can have a number of different benefits to improve overall health and wellbeing. TO SUPPLEMENT DIET DEFICIENCIES In an ideal world and with an abundance of different and healthy foods, we should be getting the nutrients we need from the food we eat. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. Pollution, pesticides, and over cultivated crops can mean some of the fruits and vegetables we eat no longer provide as many nutrients as before. Eating habits have also changed. Quick, ready-made meals lack the nutrients we need and can be high in salt, fat, and additives, which can lead to health conditions such as obesity and heart disease. Sufficient levels of vitamin D can also be hard to obtain if you are indoors a lot of the time or live in a place with limited sunlight. Natural supplements can be a good way to compensate for nutritional deficits that we may have in our diets as a result of these factors. Natural supplements can also be used to focus on specific health needs of individuals, such as to help gut and digestive function, improve mood, reduce tiredness, improve skin and nails, reduce hair loss, boost immunity, and support cardiovascular health. Supplements are also available for specific groups, such as children, seniors, and pregnant women to ensure the body is getting the desired amount of nutrients required to stay healthy and prevent any potential deficiencies. Supplements can be an effective way to keep us healthy and improve many disorders and conditions without the need for medications. AROMATHERAPY Aromatherapy is a holistic healing treatment that uses natural plant extracts to promote health and well-being. Sometimes it's called essential oil therapy. Aromatherapy uses aromatic essential oils medicinally to improve the health of the body, mind, and spirit. It enhances both physical and emotional health. Aromatherapy is thought of as both an art and a science. Recently, aromatherapy has gained more recognition in the fields of science and medicine. Aromatherapy works through the sense of smell and skin absorption using products such as these: - diffusers - aromatic spritzers - inhalers - bathing salts - body oils, creams, or lotions for massage or topical application - facial steamers - hot and cold compresses - clay masks You can use these alone or in any combination. There are nearly one hundred types of essential oils available. Generally, people use the most popular oils. Essential oils are available online, in health food stores, and in some regular supermarkets. It's important to buy from a reputable producer since the oils aren't regulated by the FDA. This ensures you're buying a quality product that is 100 percent natural. It shouldn't contain any additives or synthetic ingredients. Check out these essential oils available on Amazon. Each essential oil has an array of unique healing properties, uses, and effects. Combining essential oils to create a synergistic blend creates even more benefits.

After freezing the animals sciatic nerve it was noted that animal has pale eye syndrome or the normal pink eye colour of the albino rat is changed. After over a hundred years we have a animal model which is reproduced in laboratory experiments. This is very important evidence, which reinforces and supports the discovery. Iridology as a non-invasive diagnostic method is ignored by the medical community and therefore is not recognised in some countries, which is a great loss for preventative medical care. On all investigations which were compared with clinical, laboratory methods and patient history, we can make concludes that Iris diagnosis can be used for the detection of different internal diseases considering close connection between the eye and internal media of the body. Practitioners can choose or not to believe in Iridology - it is our choice, but we can't ignore the official statistical data. "}
