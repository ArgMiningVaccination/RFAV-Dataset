Treatment If you test positive for COVID-19 and are more likely to get significant illness from infection, treatments are available that can reduce your chances of being hospitalized, dying from the illness, and developing post-COVID conditions. If you are sick with COVID-19, call your doctor to ask about treatment options, even if your symptoms are mild right now. Don't delay - treatment must be started within days of when you first develop symptoms to be effective.

Post-COVID Conditions Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions. Post-COVID conditions are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience four or more weeks after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Even people who did not have COVID-19 symptoms during their infection may develop post-COVID conditions. These conditions can present as different types of health problems for different lengths of time. Post-COVID conditions may also be known as long COVID, long-haul COVID, post-acute COVID-19, long-term effects of COVID, or chronic COVID. Experts around the world are working to learn more about the short- and long-term health effects associated with COVID-19, who gets them, and why. If you are concerned that you may have a post-COVID condition, talk to your personal doctor for evaluation and treatment options. Did you ever have COVID-19?
