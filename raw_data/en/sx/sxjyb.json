Just like a wound can heal itself, Naturopathic Medicine is based on the reality that the entire body, if given the right care, has the innate ability to heal itself. When disease occurs, the Naturopathic doctor is diligent in their search to identify the cause and treat it without focusing on or overlooking problematic symptoms. When treatment is necessary the Naturopathic Doctor will in most cases use the least invasive and harmful treatments available while maintaining an effective protocol. In Naturopathic Medicine prevention is key. If we can guide our patients to make healthy choices and avoid disease than that is the true medicine. In guiding our patients to make their own healthy choices we believe that education is crucial and we strive to educate our patients about their disease, all of their options for treatment, and all possible outcomes. Naturopathic Medicine is composed of many modalities of which may be combined to create individualized treatment plans. Naturopathic doctors are trained in Botanical Medicine, Homeopathy, Nutrition and Supplementation, Counseling, Lifestyle Modification, Naturopathic Manipulation, and Pharmacology. Naturopathic doctors can order lab work and prescribe most medications that you are currently on or may need for treatment. In using pharmaceuticals we are extremely cautious in avoiding medications with possible side-effects and interactions with existing medications. We always consider the most natural treatment that will be effective before moving to pharmaceutical drugs. Naturopathic doctors are licensed by the state and are trained in accredited medical schools across the country. The rigorous curriculum includes all of the basic sciences as well as a standard medical curriculum. We also study four years of natural therapies. We intern both with established doctors and specialists in our field and complete two years of clinical training at a Natural Health Center. In Naturopathic Medicine we strive to work as a team with all of your other healthcare providers and advocate for all of the patients within our care. Although many Naturopathic Doctors specialize in one area of medicine, many work in Primary care seeing a wide range of complaints and a diverse population. Principles of Naturopathic Medicine: 1. The Healing Power of Nature. We respect the body's innate ability to heal and work to support the healing process using natural therapies. 2. Identify and Treat the Cause. We are diligent in our search for the underlying cause of disease and work to treat the cause and not just the presenting symptoms. 3. First Do No Harm. We use the least invasive and most natural therapies that are effective at creating a state of health and relieving problematic symptoms. 4. Treat the Whole Person. We recognize that each patient is a complex being with multiple factors affecting their health and wellbeing and consider these factors when developing treatment protocols. 5. Doctor as Teacher. Doctor means \"to teach\". We strive to empower our patients through educating them about their condition and all of their options for treatment. 6. Prevention. We support our patients in making healthy choices for their future and future generations. "}
