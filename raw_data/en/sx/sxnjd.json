The AAFP advocates for the evidence-based evaluations of integrative medicine (also referred to as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments and practices, using scientific and ethnographic methods, including quantitative and qualitative outcomes research of efficacy and effectiveness. When examining integrative medicine methods from different traditions, considerations for cultural perspectives and explanatory models should be made during the design and conduct of the research and for the interpretation of results.
