Design/methodology/approach Using convenience sampling, persons living with dementia and their care partners were recruited in Northern Colorado; after meeting inclusion criteria, they were invited to participate in the adaptive riding program. The program occurred for weekly, hour-long sessions for eight weeks. Field notes were collected during each session, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with five care partners after the program and analyzed by using theoretical thematic analysis. Findings Care partners found the adaptive riding program appropriate. Reported outcomes comprised three themes: well-being, meaning through social connections and function in daily life and aligned with the positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, accomplishment (PERMA) theory of well-being. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to explore the appropriateness of an adaptive riding program for persons living with dementia and their care partners who broadened understandings of the emotional, social and physical benefits. Findings support the inclusion of care partners in adaptive riding and may inform health-care providers' recommendations for such programs.
