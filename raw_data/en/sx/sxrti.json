Professor of Medicine, Chief of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Eastern Virginia Medical School December 1 7th, 2020 This is our recommended approach to COVID -19 based on the best (and most recent) literature . This is a highly dynamic topic ; therefore, we will be updating the guideline as new information emerges.

SARS- Co-V-2 RNA genome Page 6 of 40 | EVMS - COVID -19 Management Protocol 2020 -12-17 It should be noted that there is no cure or \"Magic -bullet\" for the prevention or treatment of COVID -19. However, r ecently, a number of therapeutic agents have shown promise for both the prevention and treatment of COVID -19 including ivermectin, Vitamin D, quercetin, melatonin and corticosteroids. Furthermore, it is likely that no single drug will be effective in treating this complex disease and that multiple drugs with diffe rent mechanisms of action and used in specific phases of the disease will be required . Prophylaxis While there is no \" Level 1 evidence\" that this \"cocktail\" will prevent/mitigate against COVID -19 we believe there is significant evidence supporting the efficacy of the individual agents included in the prophylactic protocol. Th is protocol MUST be part of an overall strategy which includes common sense public health measures, i.e. masks, social distancing, and avoidance of large groups of people. Furth ermore, it should be noted that there is emerging evidence suggesting that IVERMECTIN may be highly effective in the prevention and treatment of COVID -19. It is important to emphasize that ALL of the medications included in our prophylactic regimen are ine xpensive, safe, and widely available. Vitamin D3 1000-3000 IU/day . Note RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance) is 800 -1000 IU/day. The safe upper -dose daily limit is likely < 4000 IU/day. [1-22] Vitamin D insufficiency has been associated with an increased risk of acquiring COVI D-19 and from dying from the disease. Vitamin D supplementation may therefore prove to be an e ffective and cheap intervention to lessen the impact of this disease, particularly in vulnerable populations, i.e. the elderly, th ose of color, obese and those living > 45o latitude . [7-22] Vitamin C 500 mg BID (twice daily) and Quercetin 250 mg daily . [23-34] It is likely that vitamin C and quercetin have synergistic prophylactic benefit. [35] It should be noted that in vitro studies have demonstrated that quercetin and other flavonoids interfere with thyroid hormone synthesis at multiple steps in the synthetic pathway. [36 -39] The use of q uercetin has rarely been associated with hypothyroidism. The clinical impact of this association may be limited to those individuals with pre -existent thyroid disease or those with sub -clinical thyroidism. [40] In women high consumption of soya was assoc iated with elevated TSH concentrations. [41] The effect on thyroid function may be dose dependent, hence for chronic prophylactic use w e suggest that the lowest dose be taken. Quercetin should be used with caution in patients with hypothyroidism and TSH levels should be monitored. It should also be noted quercetin may have important drug- drug interactions; the most important drug- drug int eraction is with cyclosporin and tacrolimus. [42] In patients taking these drugs it is best to avoid quercetin; if quercetin is taken cyclosporin and tac rolimus levels must be closely monitored. Melatonin (slow release): Begin with 0.3 mg and increase as tolerated to 2 mg at night . [43-50] Zinc 30-50 mg/day g/kg (12 mg) immediately then repeat day 3. Ivermectin for pre -exposure prophylaxis (in HCW) and for prophylaxis in high -risk individuals (> 60 years with co -morbidities, morbid obesity, long term care facilities, etc). 0.15 -0.2 mg/kg Day 1, Day 3 and then weekly for 10 weeks, followed by biweekly dosing. [5,61 -64] Ivermectin has a number of potentially serious drug -drug interactions. Please check for potential drug interaction at Ivermectin Drug Interactions - Drugs.com . The most important drug interactions occur with cyclosporin, t acrolimus, anti- retroviral drugs, and certain anti -fungal drugs. Page 7 of 40 | EVMS - COVID -19 Management Protocol 2020 -12-17 Optional: Famotidine 20 -40 mg/day [55- 61]. Low level evidence suggests that famotidine may reduce disease severity and mortality. However, the findings of some studies are contradictory. While it was postulated that famotidine inhibits the SARS - CoV-2 papain (PLpro) as well as the main protease (3CLpro) this mechanism has been disputed.[58] Furthermore, a single study suggested that users of PPI's had a significantly increased odds for reporting a positive COVID -19 test when compared with those not taking PPIs, while individuals taking histamine -2 receptor antagonists were not at elevated risk.[62] This data suggest that famotidine may be the drug of choice when acid suppressive therapy is required. Optional/Experimental: Interferon - nasal spray for health care workers [54] Ivermectin dosing: 150-200 ug/kg or fixed dose 80kg) or 18 mg ( 80kg). [65] Depending on the manufacturer ivermectin is supplied as 3mg, 6 mg or 12 mg tablets. 50-64.9 kg - 12mg 65-79.9 kg - 15mg 80-94.9 kg 18mg 95-109.9 kg - 21mg 110 kg - 24mg Symptomatic patients at home (for the duration of acute symptoms) Vitamin C 500 mg BID and Quercetin 250 -500 mg BID Zinc 75-100 mg/day (elemental zinc) Melatonin 10 mg at night (the is unknown) [50] Vitamin D3 2000-4000 Highly recommended : Ivermectin 0.15-0.2 mg/kg orally on day 3). [1-5,63,67- 78] Table 1 , Figure 5 and ClinTrials.gov NCT04523831 . See drug- drug s above. mg/day (unless contraindicated) . ASA has antiinflammatory, antithrombotic, and antiviral effects. [79,80] Platelet activation may play a major role in propagating the prothrombotic state associated with COVID -19. [81] B complex vitamins Optional: Famotidine 40 mg BID (reduce dose in patients with renal dysfunction) [82-88]. Optional: Vascepa and Lovaza tablets must be swallowed and cannot be crushed, dissolved or chewed . Omega -3 fatty acids have anti- inflammatory properties and play an important role in the resolution of inflammation. In addition, omega- 3 fatty acids may have antiviral properties. [32,89 Interferon -/ s/c, nasal spray or inhalation. [93-96] It should be noted that Zinc potentiates the effects of interferon. [97,98] In symptomatic patients, monitoring with home pulse oximetry is recommended (due to asymptomatic hypoxia). The limitations of home pulse oximeters should be recognized, and validated devices are preferred. [99] Multiple readings should be taken over the course of the day, and a downward trend should be regarded as ominous. [99] Baseline or a mbulatory desaturation < 94% should prompt hospital admission . [100] The following guidance is suggested: [99] Page 8 of 40 | EVMS - COVID -19 Management Protocol 2020 -12-17 o Use the index or middle finger; avoid the toes or ear lobe o Only accept values associated with a strong pulse signal o Observe readings for 30 -60 seconds to identify the most common value o Remove nail polish from the finger on which measurements are made o Warm cold extremities prior to measurement Not recommended: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The use of HCQ is extremely controversial. [101] The best scientific evidence to date suggest s that HCQ has no proven benefit for post exposure prophylaxis, for the early symptomatic phase and in hospitalized patients . [102 -120] Considering the unique pharmacokinetics of HCQ, it is unlikely that HCQ would be of benefit in patients with COVID -19 infection ( it takes 5-10 days to achieve adequate plasma and lung concentrations ).[112,121- 123] Finally, it should be recognized that those studies which are widely promoted to support the use of HCQ are severely methodologically flawed. [124- inhaled In the early symptomatic (viral replicative phase), corticosteroids may increase viral replication and disease severity. [128] An OpenSAFELY analysis in patients with COVID -19 demonstrated a higher risk of death in COPD and asthmatic patients using high dose ICS. [129] The role of ICS in the pulmonary phase is unclear as patients require systemic corticosteroids to dampen the cytokine storm, with ICS having little systemic effec ts. Page 9 of 40 | EVMS - COVID -19 Management Protocol 2020 -12-17 Mildly Symptomatic patients (on floo r/ward in hospital ): Vitamin C 500- 1000 mg q 6 hourly and Quercetin 250 -500 mg BID (if available) Zinc 75-100 mg/day Melatonin 10 mg at night (the optimal dose is unknown) [50] Vitamin D3 20,000- 60,000 IU single oral dose. Calcifediol 0.2-0.5 mg is an alternative . [66] This should be followed by 20 ,000 IU D3 (or 0.2 mg calcifediol) weekly until discharged from hospital. Calcifediol is more efficiently absorbed, achieves 25-OH vitamin D levels quicker and is t hree times more potent than vitamin D3. [130,131] However, it is important to note that the optimal dose of vitamin D in the acute setting is unknown. [132,133] Very high doses may paradoxically block the vitamin D receptor. Highly recommended : Ivermectin 0.15 -0.2 mg/kg orally (12 mg) and repeat on day 3 [1-5,63,67 - 77]. It should be noted that ivermectin has potent anti -inflammatory properties apart from its antiviral properties. [134 -136] See Table 1 and Figure 5. See drug- drug interaction above. Enoxaparin 60 mg/day [75,137- 150] Consider increasing the dose to 1mg/kg q 12 hourly in those with a high D -Dimer or an increasing D -Dimer (see Xa monitoring below) . ASA 325 mg (if not contraindicated). Mod erate -severe COVID infection results in profound platelet activation contributing to the pro -thrombotic state and increasing the inflammatory response. [151 -153] Methylprednisolone 40 mg q 12 hourly ; increase to 80 mg and then 125 mg q 12 hourly in patients with progressive symptoms and increasing CRP . There is no w overwhelming and irrefutable evidence that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death in patients with the pulmonary phase of COVID -19 i.e . those requiring supplemental oxygen or higher levels of support. [154 - 166] The role of inhaled corticosteroids (budesonide) is unclear and appears to be rather limited. B complex vitamins Optional: Famotidine 40 mg BID alternative DHA/EPA 4g daily. Optional (not recommended) : Remdesivir 200 mg IV loading dose D1, followed by 100mg day IV for 9 days. [167,168] This agent has been reported to reduce time to recovery (based on an ordinal scale) in patients requiring low levels of supplemental oxyg en. [168,169] The recently published SOLIDARITY trial demonstrated no mortality benefit of this agent in the entire treatment cohort or any subgroup. [170] Considering the high cost of this agent and the lack of benef it on patient centered outcomes the role of this drug seems very limited. N/C 2L/min if required (max 4 L/min; consider early t/f to ICU for escalation of care) . Avoid Nebulization and Respiratory treatments. Use \"Spinhaler\" or MDI and spacer if required . T/f EARLY to the ICU for increasing respiratory signs/symptoms , increasing oxygen requirements and arterial desaturation . Page 10 of 40 | EVMS - COVID -19 Management Protocol 2020 -12-17 Progressive Respiratory symptoms (hypoxia- requiring N /C 4 L min : admit to ICU) : Essential Treatment (dampening the STORM) ; MATH + [171] 1. Methylprednisolone 80 mg load ing dose then 40 mg q 12 hourly for at least 7 days and until transferred out of ICU. In patients with an increasing CRP or worsening clinical status increase the dose to 80 mg q 12 hourly (then 125mg q 12 hourly) , then titrate down as appropriate. [154 -166] Pulse methylprednisolone 250 -500 mg mg/day may be required. [164] As depicted in Table 1, methylprednisolone is the corticosteroid of choice. 2. Ascorbic acid ( Vitamin C ) 3g IV q 6 hourly for at least 7 days and/or until transferred out of ICU.[27,172- 183] . Note c aution with POC glucose testing (see below). Oral absorption is limited by saturable transport and it is difficult to achieve adequate levels with PO administration. Should IV Vitamin C is not available , attempts should be made to administer PO vitamin C at a dose of 1g every 4 -6 hours . Mega -dose vitamin C should be considered in severely ill patients and as salvage therapy: 25g vitamin C in 200 -500 cc saline over 6 hours daily for 4 days, then 3g IV q 6 hourly for total of 7 -10 days of treatment. [184] (also see https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=Au - mp6RZjCQ ) 3. Full anticoagulation : Unless contraindicated we suggest FULL anticoagulation (on admission to the ICU) with enoxaparin, i.e., 1 mg kg s/c q 12 hourly (dose adjust with Cr Cl < 30mls/min). There is now good evidence that high intensity anticoagulation reduces mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID -19. [137,139,140,142- 150,185] Heparin is suggested with CrCl < 15 ml/min. Due to augmented renal clearance patients may have reduced anti -Xa activity despite standard dosages of LMWH. [186] We therefore recommend monitoring anti -Xa activity in underweight and obese patients, those with chronic renal failure and in those patie nts with an increasing D -dimer, aiming for an anti- Xa activity of 0.6 -1.1 IU.ml. Note: A falling SaO2 and the requirement for supplemental oxygen should be a trigger to start anti- inflammatory treatment (see Figure 2). Note: Early termination of asco rbic acid and corticosteroids will likely result in a rebound effect with clinical deterioration (see Figure 6). Additional Treatment Components (the Full Monty) 4. Highly recommended : Ivermectin 0. 15-0.2 mg/kg orally and repeat on day 2 (see doing above) . [1-3,67,70- 78,134- 136,187- 193] Note that ivermectin has potent antiviral and ant -inflammatory effects. See Table 1 and Figure 5. 5. Melatonin 10 mg at night (the optimal dose is unknown). 6. Calcifediol 0.2-0.5 mg. [66] This should be followed by 0.2 mg calcifediol weekly until discharged from hospital. Vitamin D3 takes many days to be converted to 25OH vitamin D; [194] this may explain the lack of benefit of D3 in patients hospita lized with severe COVID -19. [195] 7. Thiamine 200 mg IV q 12 hourly [196 -201] Thiamine may play a role in dampening the cytokine storm. [197] 8. ASA 325 mg. COVID infection results in profound platelet activation contributing to the severe pro-thrombotic state and increasing the inflammatory response. [151 -153] As the risk of significant bleeding is increased in patients receiving both ASA and heparin, ASA should therefore not be used in patients at high risk of bleeding. In addition (as noted below) patients should receive famotidine concurre ntly. 9. B complex vitamins 10. Magnesium: 2 g stat IV. Keep Mg between 2.0 and 2.4 mmol/l. [59] Prevent hypomagnesemia (which increases the cytokine storm and Qtc). [202 -204] Page 11 of 40 | EVMS Management Protocol 2020 -12-17 11. Doxycycline 100mg for 5 days a broad -spectrum antibiotic which has synergistic anti- viral and anti- inflammatory effects when combined with Ivermectin. [6,68,73,205] 12. Optional (Consider in severe cases). Anti-serotonin agents. Platelet activation results in the release of serotonin, which may contribute to the \"cytokine storm\". [206] Therefore, the serotonin receptor blocker cyproheptadine 4 -8 mg PO q 6 hours should be considered. 13. Optional. Atorvastatin 80 mg/day . Statins have pleotropic and antiviral effects. In addition, statins decrease express ion of PAI -1. Simvastatin has been demonstrated to reduce mortality in the hyper -inflammatory ARDS phenotype. [207] Preliminary data s uggests atorvastatin may improve outcome in patients with COVID -19.[208 -212] Due to numerous drug- drug interactions simvastatin should be avoided. 14. Optional: Famotidine 40 mg BID (20 -40 mg/day above). 16. Not recommended: The role of azithromycin in the treatment of COVID -19 is controversial. The best information to date suggests that azithromycin is of little benefit. [213,214] 17. Not recommended: Remdesivir. Has not benefit at this stage of the disease. 18. Not recommended. Convalescent serum [215,216] or monoclonal antibodies. (Eli Lilly recently announced that they are suspending their ACTIV -33 clinical trial as their monoclonal antibody failed to demonstrate a clinical benefit in hospitalized patients ). 19. Not recommended. Tocilizumab. Four RCTS have now failed to demonstrate a clinical benefit from tocilizumab. [217-220] 20. Broad -spectrum antibiotics if superadded bacterial pneumonia is suspected based on procalcitonin levels and resp. culture (no bronchoscopy). Due to the paradox of hyper -inflammation and immune suppression ( a major decrease of HLA- DR on CD14 monocy tes and T cell dysfunction ) secondary bacterial and fungal infection is not uncommon. [221] 21. Maintain EUVOLEMIA (this is not non -cardiogenic pulmonary edema) . Due to the prolonged \"symptomatic phase\" with flu -like symptoms (6 -8 days) patients may be volume depleted. Cautious rehydration with 500 ml boluses of Lactate Ringers may be warranted, ideally guided by non - invasive hemodynamic monitoring. Diuretics should be avoided unless the patient has obvious intravascular volume ove rload. Avoid hypovolemia. 22. Early norepinephrine for hypotension. It should however be appreciated that despite the cytokine storm, vasodilatory shock is distinctly uncommon in uncomplicated COVID -19 (when not complicated by bacterial sepsis). This appears to be due to the fact that TNF- which is \"necessary\" for vasodilatory shock is only minimally elevated. 23. Escalation of respiratory support (steps); Try to avoid intubation if at all possible , (see Figure 7) Accept \"permissive hypoxemia\" (keep O2 Saturation > 8 4%); follow tate and Central Venous O 2 saturations (ScvO 2) in patents with low 1-6 L/min Bagging; Full PPE. Crash/emergency intubations should be avoided. Volume protective ventilation; Lowest driving pressure and lowest PEEP as possible. Keep driving pressures < 15 cm H2O. Moderate sedation to prevent self -extubation Trial of inhaled Flolan (epoprostenol) Prone positioning. Page 12 of 40 | EVMS - COVID -19 Management Protocol 2020 -12-17 There is widespread concern that using HFNC could increase the risk of viral transmission. There is however, no evidence to support this fear. HFNC is a better option for the patient and the health care system than intubation and mechanical ventilation. C PAP/BiPAP may be used in select patients, notably those with COPD exacerbation or heart failure. A sub-group of patients with COVID -19 deteriorates very rapidly . Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required in these patients. Table 2: Comparis on of Methylprednisolone, Dexamethasone and Hydrocortisone - Number Need to Treat (NNT) Page 13 of 40 | EVMS - COVID -19 Management Protocol 2020 -12-17 Figure 5. Metaanalysis of Ivermectin clinical studies (in hospital mortality) 24. Salvage Treatments High dose bolus corticosteroids; Should considered in patients with progressive oxygenation failure despite corticosteroid therapy as well as in patients with severe MAS. Patients may require up to 5 exchanges. FFP is required for the exchange; giving back \"good humors\" appears to be more important than taking out \"bad humors\". Mega -dose vitamin C should be considered in severely ill patients and as salvage therapy: 25g vitamin C in 200 -500 cc saline over 6 hours daily for 4 days, then 3g IV q 6 hourly for total of 7-10 days of treatment. [181] (also see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au -mp6RZjCQ ) In patients with a large dead -space ventilation i.e. high PaCO 2 despite adequate minute ventilation consider \"Half- dose rTPA\" to improve pulmonary microvascular blood flow; 25mg of tPA over 2 hours followed by a 25mg tPA infusion administered over the subsequent 22 hours, with a dose not to exceed 0.9 mg/kg followed by full ARDS\" COVID -19 patients do not progress into a resolution phase. Rather, patients with COVID -19 may progress to a severe fibro -proliferative phase and ventilator dependency. E CMO in these patients would likely serve little purpose. ECMO however may improve survival in patients with severe single organ failure (lung) if initiated within 7 days of intubation. [235] Combination inhaled nitric oxide (or epoprostenol) and intravenous a lmitrine. The combination of inhaled nitric oxide, a selective pulmonary vasodilator, and almitrine, a specific pulmonary vasoconstrictor, may improve the severe V/Q mismatch in patients with severe COVID -19 \"pneumonia\". [236 -239] Page 14 of 40 | EVMS - COVID -19 Management Protocol 2020 -12-17 Figure 6. Premature discontinuation of corticosteroids and IV vitamin C (after 4 day) and the effect of reinitiation of this combination on the CRP profile. Salvage treatments of unproven /no benefit. Convalescent serum /monoclonal antibodies : the role and timing of convalescent serum and monoclonal antibodies are uncertain. [240 -243] Two RCT's failed to demonstrate any clinical benefit with convalescent serum. [215,216] In addition, Eli Lilly recently announced that they are suspending their ACTIV -33 clinical trial as their monoclonal antibody failed to demonst rate a clinical benefit in hospitalized patients . It is noteworthy that the only RCT demonstrating efficacy of convalescent plasma for an infectious disease was conducted more than 40 years ago, for treating Argentine hemorrhagic fever. [211] Furthermore, giving antibodies directed against SARS -CoV-2 appears pointless when the virus is already DEAD (pulmonary phase). In addition, IgG is a large protein which penetrates tissues poorly, and is unlikely to achieve submucosal concentrations required for mucosal immunity. [244] And lastly, COVID -19 pulmonary disease is immune mediated , and it would therefore appear paradoxical to enhance the antibody response with convalescent serum. [245] Janus Ki nase inhibitors downregulate cytokine expression may have a role in this disease. [246- 248] The role of the combination of Baricitinib and Remdesivir is unclear. [249] In patients with progressive fibrosis the combination of anti- fibrotic therapy with corticosteroids should be considered. [250 -253] It should however be recognized that unlike all the medications in the MATH+ protocol, pirfenidone and nintedanib have complex side - effects and drug interactions and should be prescribed by pulmonary physicians who have experience with these drugs. CVVH /D with cytokine absorbing/filtering filters [254,255] This treatment strategy appears to have a very limited role. Page 15 of 40 | EVMS - COVID -19 Management Protocol 2020 -12-17 25. Treatment of Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) A sub-group of patients will develop MAS , particularly those patients with severe COVID -19 disease .[256] While the pathophysiology of MAS in the setting of COVID -19 is unclear this appears to be driven by SARS -CoV-2 induced inflammasome activation and in creased IL -18 production as well as increased GM -CSF and INF production. [257 -260] The role of IL -1 and IL-6 in the pathogenesis of MAS is unclear. A ferritin > 4400 ng/ml is considered diagnostic of MAS. Other diagnostic features include increasing AST/ALT and CRP and progressive multi -system organ failure. [261] \"High dose corticosteroids .\" Methylprednisolone 120 mg q 6 -8 hourly for at least 3 days, then wean acc ording to Ferritin, CRP, AST/ALT (see Figure 8 at least 15% before weaning corticosteroids. Cons ider plasma exchange. The inhibition IL -1 (Anakinra) and IFN D-dimer are important prognostic markers. A PCT is essential to rule out coexisting track disease severity closely (although ferritin tends to lag behind CRP) . Early high CRP levels are clos ely associated with the degree of pulmonary involvement and the CT score. [262] In patients receiving IV vitamin C, the Accu -Chek POC glucose monitor will result in spuriously high blood glucose values. Therefore, a laboratory glucose is recommended to confirm the blood glucose levels. [263,264] No routine CT scans, follow CXR and chest ultrasound. ECHO as clinically indicated; Pts may develop a severe \"septic\" cardiomyopathy. Page 16 of 40 | EVMS - COVID -19 Management Protocol 2020 -12-17 Figure 7. Page 17 of 40 | EVMS - COVID -19 Management Protocol 2020 -12-17 Figure 8. SARS- CoV-2 induced Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) treated with Vitamin C 3g IV q 6 and increased methylprednisolone (125 mg q 8 hourly) Page 18 of 40 | EVMS - COVID -19 Management Protocol 2020 -12-17 27. Post ICU management a. Enoxaparin 40 -60 mg s/c daily b. Methylpredniso lone 40 mg day , then wean slowly (follow CRP) c. Vitamin C 500 mg PO BID d. Melatonin 3 -6 mg at night e. Vascepa, Lovaza or DHA/EPA 4g day (important for resolution of inflammation) 28. Post Hospital Discharge management a. Patients have an increased risk of thromboembolic events post -discharge. [265] Extended thromboprophylaxis (? with a DOAC) should be considered in high risk patients. Risk factors include: [266] i. Increased D dimer (> 2 times ULN) ii. Increased CRP (> 2 times ULN) [267] iii. Age > 60 iv. Prolonged immobilization b. The post -COVID -19 syndrome (long haul syndrome) , is characterized by prolonged malaise, headaches, generalized fatigue, painful joints, dyspnea, chest pain and cognitive dysfunction. [268 -273] Up to 50% of p atients experience prolonged illness after C ovid -19. The post -COVID -19 syndrome may persistent for months after the acute infection and almost half of patients report reduced quality of life. The neurological symptoms may be related micro - and/or macrovascular thrombotic disease which appears to be common in severe COVID -19 disease. [256] Brain MRIs' 3 months post -infection demonstrated micro -structural changes in 55% of patients. [274] Similar to patients who have recovered from septic shock, [275] a prolonged (many months) immune disturbance with elevated pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines may contribute to the post- COVID -19 syndrome. Consequently, A CRP should be measured prior to discharge and a tapering course of corticosteroids should be considered in those with an elevated CRP. It should be noted that much like omega -3 fatty acids corticosteroids have been demonstrated to increase expression o pro-resolving lipids including Protectin D1 and Resolvin D4 .[276 considered include: i. Vascepa, Lovaza or DHA/EPA 4g day ; important for resolution of inflammation by inducing resolvin production. [91,92] ii. Atorvastatin 40 mg daily (increase resolvin synthesis) [277] iii. Continue melatonin for its antioxidant properties and stabilization of the circadian rhythms. iv. Multivitamin with adequate vitamin D. v. Recently Ivermectin has been reported to have a role in the treatment of post- Covid -19 syndrome . [278] The anti -inflammatory properties of ivermectin may mediate this benefit. c. Post -COVID -19 pulmonary fibrosis. An unknown number of patients who have recovered from COVID -19 organizing pneumonia will develop pulmonary fibrosis with associated limitati on of activity. These patients should be referred to a pulmonologist with expertise in pulmonary fibrosis. Anti -fibrotic therapy may have a role in these patients, [250 -253] however additional data is required before this therapy can be more generally recommended.

Maintaining mental health and the avoiding the misinformation pandemic 'Misinformation on the Coronavirus might be the most contagious thing about it\" Dr. Tedros, WHO Director General The Panic and misinformation spread by Social Media travels faster than the pandemic itself.

However, a number of concepts are key to the management of this \"treatable disease; they include. 1. Patients transition through a number of different phases (clinical stages). The treatment of each phase is dist inct . .. this is critically important (see Figures 1 & 2). 2. Antiviral therapy is likely to be effective only during the viral replicative phase whereas anti- inflammatory therapy is expected to be effective during the pulmonary phase and possibly the post -COVID -19 phase. While Remdesivir is a non -specific antiviral agent that targets RNA viruses, it is likely that agents specifically designed to target SARS -CoV-2 will be developed. 3. The SARS -CoV-2 PCR remains positive for at least 2 weeks following detection of whole virus (by culture, See figure 3). Patients who progress to the pulmonary phase are usually PCR positive despite cessation of viral replication (and are therefore less likely to be infectious) . 4. Due to the imperfect sensitivity of the PCR test as many as 20% of patients who progress to the pulmonary phase will be PCR negative (even on repeat testing). At symptom onset PCR will be positive in approximately 60% of patients; maximal positivity rate is on day 8 (post infection) when 80% of patients will be positive (see Figure3). [281] 5. Symptomatic patients are likely to be infectious during a narrow window starting 2 -3 days before the onset of symptoms and to up to 6 days aft er the onset of symptoms (see Figure 3).[282 ] 6. It is important to recognize that COVID -19 patients present with a variety of phenotypes, likely dependent on inoculum size and viral load, genetic heterogeneity mutations and polymorphisms, biotypes, blood type, sex and androgen status, age, race, BMI (obesity), immunological and nutritional status, and co -morbidities .[157,283- 293] The phenotype at presentation determines the prognosis and impacts the optimal approach to treatment. 7. The pulmonary phase is characterized by immune dysregu lation, with activation of clotting and a pro -coagulant st ate together with the characteristics of an organizing pneumonia. [307,308] 8. Endothelial damage and an imbalance of both innate and adaptive immune responses, with aberrant macrophage activation, plays a central role in the pathogenesis of the severe COVID -19 Disease. [256] 9. As patients, progress down the pulmonary cascade the di sease becomes more difficult to reverse. The implications of this are twofold. a. Early treatment (of the pulmonary phase) is ESSENTIAL to a good outcome . b. Treatment in the late pulmonary phase m ay require escalation of the dose of corticosteroids as well as the use of salvage methods (i.e. plasma exchange). However, patients who present in the late pulmonary phase may have progressed to the irreversible pulmonary fibroproliferative phase (see Figure 9 ). 10. The pulmonary phase of COVID -19 is a treatable disease; it is inappropriate to limit therapy to \"supportive care\" alone. Furthermore, it is unlikely that there will be a single \" silver bullet\" to treat severe COVID -19 disease . Rather, patients will require treatment with multiple drugs/interventions that have synergistic and overlapping biological effects . Repurposed FDA approved drugs that are safe, inexpensive, and \"readily\" available are likely to have a major therapeutic effect on this disease. The impact of COVID -19 on middle - and low -income countries is enormous; these countries are not able to afford expensive propriety \" designer \" molecules. 11. The radiographic and pathological finding of COVID -19 lung disease are characteristic of a secondary organizing pneumonia (and not ARDS). [307,309,310] Page 21 of 40 | EVMS - COVID -19 Management Protocol 2020 -12-17 12. THIS is NOT ARDS (at least initially). The initial pulmonary phase neither looks like, smells like nor is ARDS. [311 -313] The ground glass infiltrates are peripheral and patchy, [309] and do not resemble the dependent air space consolidation (sponge/baby lung) seen with \"typical ARDS\". [314] Extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) is normal or only slightly increased; this by definition excludes non -cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ARDS). Lung compliance is normal (this excludes ARDS). Patients are PEEP unresponsive. Treating patients as if they ARDS is a very dangerous approach. The hypoxia is due to severe ventilation/perfusion m ismatch likely due to the microvascular narrowing, thrombosis and vasoplegia. 13. The core principles of the pulmonary phase (MATH+) is the use of anti -inflammatory agents to dampen the \"cytokine storms\" together with full anticoagulation to limit the microvascular and macrovascular clotting and supplemental oxygen to help overcome the hypoxia. 14. Ivermectin has emerged as the \" wonder drug \" to prophylaxis and treat COVID -19. Ivermectin inhibits viral replication and has potent anti- inflammatory properties. Emerg ing clinical data (including RCT's) suggest that ivermectin may have an important clinical benefit across the spectrum of phases of the disease, i.e pre- exposure prophylaxis, postexposure prophylaxis, during the symptomatic phase and during the pulmonary phase. [1-3,67,70 -77,134 -136,187- 193,315] In the recommended dosages , Ivermectin is remarkably safe (see T able 1 and Fig 5 ). However, as noted above there is the potential for serious drug -drug interaction. 15. The pulmonary phase of COVID -19 is characterized by PROLONGED immune dysregulation that may last weeks or even months. The early and abrupt termination of anti- inflammatory agents will likely result in rebound inflammation (see Figure 8).[316] 16. SARS- CoV-2 as compared to all other respiratory viruses, upregulates cytokines and chemokines while at the same time down regulating the expression of Interferon alpha (the hosts primary antiviral de fence mechanism). [131,155] Low innate antiviral defenses and high pro - inflammatory mediators contribute to ongoing and progressive lung injury . 17. Patients in whom the cytokine storm is not \"dampened\" will progress into the \"H phenotype\" characterized by poor lung compliance, severe oxygenation failure and PEEP recruitability (see Figure 9). Progression to this phase is exacerbated by ventilator ind uced lung injury (VILI). The histologic pattern of the \"H Phenotype\" is characterized by an acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP), with extensive intra -alveolar fibrin deposition called membranes. [288,310,317- 319] Corticosteroids seem to be of little benefit in established AFOP. High dose methylprednisolone should be attempted in the \"early phase\" of AFOP, however many patients will progress to irreversible pulmonary fibrosis with prolonged ventilator dependency and ultimately death. 18. An unknown percentage of patients with COVID -19 present with \"silent hypoxia\" with a blunted resp iratory response . This phenomenon may be related to involvement of chemoreceptors of the carotid bodies and/or brain stem dysfunction ,[320,321] and necessitates pulse oximetry in symptomatic patients managed at home (as discussed above). 19. It should be recognized that LWMH has non -anticoagulant properties that are likely beneficial in patients with COVID -19, these include anti -inflammatory effects and inhibition of histones .[322] in addition, in vitro studies demonstrate that heparin inhibits SARS -CoV-2 interaction with the ACE-2 receptor and viral entry ,[323,324] as well as viral replication [75,138] . Most [325] HPSE levels have been reported to be increased in patients with severe COVID -19 infection. [326] 20. Due to the ease of administration , greater anti- Xa activity and better safety profile we prefer low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to unfractionated heparin (UFH). 21. The combination of steroids and ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is essential. Both have powerful synergistic anti- inflammatory actions . [173,181] Vitamin C protects the endothelium from oxidative injury. [174,327- 329] Furthermore, vitamin C Increases the expression of interferon -Page 22 of 40 | EVMS - COVID -19 Management Protocol 2020 -12-17 alpha [26] while corticosteroids (alone) decease expression of this important protein. [330 - 333] It should be noted that when corticosteroids a re used in the pulmonary phase (and not in the viral replicative phase) they do not appear to increase viral shedding or decrease the production of type specific antibodies. [159,334] It is likely that heparin (LMWH) acts synergistically with corticosteroids and vitamin C to protect the endothelium and treat the endothelialitis of severe COVID -19 disease. 22. Notwithstanding the very important and impressive results of the Recovery -Dexamet hasone study, methylprednisolone is the corticosteroid of choice for the pulmonary phase of COVID -19. This is based on pharmacokinetic data (better lung penetration), [335] genomic data specific for SARS- CoV-2,[336] and a long track record of successful use in inflammatory lung diseases. (see Table 1) 23. For prophylaxis and treatment of the early symptomatic phase we suggest the combination of Quercetin (a plant polyphenol), Vitamin C and Zinc. [35] This is based on intriguing basic science data which indicates that: a. Zinc is essential for innate and adaptive immunity. [52] In addition, Zinc inhibits RNA dependent RNA polymerase in vitro against SARS -CoV-2 virus. [51] b. Quercetin has direct viricidal properties against a range of viruses, including SARS -CoV- 2, and is a potent antioxidant and anti -inflammatory agent. [24,29,34,34,337- 344] as a ionophore . [345] c. Vitamin C improves the potency of Quercetin and has antiviral and anti -inflammatory activity .[24] 24. It should also be noted that Vitamin D may be an enormously powerful prophylactic strategy against COVID -19. Vitamin D deficiency explains , in part , the enormous geographic variation in mortality of this disease. [11,346] It is likely that vitamin D supplementation may have a greater role in the prophylaxis than the treatment of severe disease.

Page 24 of 40 | EVMS - COVID -19 Management Protocol 2020 -12-17 Scientific Rationale for MATH+ Treatment Protocol (pulmonary phase) Three core pathologic processes lead to multi -organ failure and death in COVID -19: 1) Hyper -inflammation (\"Cytokine storm\") - a dysregulated immune system whose cells infiltrate and damage the lungs as well as other organs including the heart and bone marrow. It is now widely accepted that SARS -CoV-2 causes aberrant T lymphocyte and macrophage activation resulting \"cytokine storm.\" [246,248,259,260,286,294,296- 302] In addition, post -mortem examination has demonstrated features of the \" macrophage activation syndrome \", with hemophagocytosis and a hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis -like disorder. [256] 2) Hyper -coagulability (increased clotting) - the dysregulated immune system damages the endothelium and activates blood clotting, causing the formation of micro and macro blood clots. Clotting activation may occur directly due to increased express ion of Factor Xa as well as endothelial injury with the release of large aggregates of van Willebrand factor. [81] These blood clots impair blood flow. [139,140,142 -150,305,306,347,348] It should be noted that the thrombotic microangiopathy appears to target predominantly the pulmonary and cerebral circulation. [256] 3) Severe Hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels) -lung inflammation caused by the cytokine storm, together with microthrombosis in the pulmonary circulation severely impairs oxygen absorption resulting in oxygenation failure . The above pathologies are not novel, although the combined severity in COVID -19 disease is considerable. Our long -standing and more recent experiences show consistently successful treatment if traditional therapeutic principles of early and aggressive intervention is achieved, before the onset of advanced organ failure. It is our collective opinion that the historically high levels of morbidity and mortality from COVID -19 is due to a single factor: the widespread and inappropriate reluctance amongst hospitalists and intensivists to employ anti -inflammatory and anticoagulant treatments, including corticosteroid therapy early in the course of a patient's hospitalization. It is essential to recognize that it is not the virus that is killing the patient, rather it is the patient's overactive immune system. [245,248,256,321] Autopsy studies have demonstrated minimal viral cytopathic effects. [256,321] The flames of the \"cytokine fire\" are out of control and need to be extinguished. Providing supportive care (with ventilators that themselves stoke the fire) and w aiting for the cytokine fire to burn itself out simply does not work... this approach has FAILED and has led to the death of tens of thousands of patients. \"If what you are doing ain't working, change what you are doing\" - PEM The systematic failure of critical care systems to adopt corticosteroid therapy (early in this pandemic) resulted from the published recommendations against corticosteroids use by the World Health Organization ( as recent as May 27 th 2020) [349,350] . This recommendation was then perpetuated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Thoracic Society (ATS) , Infectious Diseases Association of America (IDSA) amongst others. A publication authored one of the members of the Front Line COVID -19 Critical Care (FLCCC) Alliance (UM), identified the errors made by these organizations in their analyses of corticosteroid studies based on the findings of the SARS and H1N1 pandemics. [154,351] Their erroneous recommendation to avoid corticosteroids in the trea tment of COVID -19 has led to the development of myriad organ failures which have overwhelmed critical care systems across the world and led to excess deaths. The recently published results of the RECOVERY - DEXAMETHASONE study provide definitive and unambiguous evidence of the lifesaving benefits of corticosteroids and strong validation of the MATH + protocol. It should be recognized that corticosteroids are the only therapy proven to reduce the mortality in patients with COVID -19.[352] The Page 25 of 40 | EVMS - COVID -19 Management Protocol 2020 -12-17 RECOVERY -DEXAMETHASONE study, randomized 2104 patients to receive dexamethasone 6 mg (equivalent to 32 mg methylprednisolone) once per day (either by mouth or by intravenous injection) for ten days an d were compared with 4321 patients randomized to usual care alone .[128] Dexamethasone reduced deaths by one- third in ventilated patients (rate ratio 0.65 [95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.88]; p=0.0003) and by one fifth in other patients receiving oxygen only (0.80 [0.67 to 0.96]; p=0.0021). There was no benefit among those patients who did not require respiratory support (1.22 [0.86 to 1.75; p=0.14). The results of this study STRONGLY support the EVMS /MATH+ protocol which recommends the use of corticosteroids for the \"pulmonary phase\" of COVID -19. It should be noted that we would consider the non -titratable 'fixed\" dose of dexamethasone used in the RECOVERY- DEXAMETHASONE study to be very low. Furthermore, as indicated above we consider methylprednisolone to be the corticosteroid of choice for the treatment of COVID -19 pulmonary disease. The benefit of methylprednisolone in improving respiratory function, ventilator dependency and mortality has been confirmed in a number of observational studies , [155,156,162,334,353- 355] as well as a randomized controlled study. [164] It should be recognized that the mortality benefit with methylprednisolone was not replicated in a recent Brazilian RCT. [316] However, in this study methylprednisolone was started relatively late (day 13 after symptom onset), but most importantly was stopped on day 5. T his failed study reinforces the concept of early and prolonged treatment with methylprednisolone titrated to the patient's clinical response. In patients at high risk of Strongyloides infection, screening and/or treatment of this parasite with ivermectin is suggested prior to treatment with corticosteroids. [356] Our treatment protocol targeting the key pathologi c processes has been highly successful, if begun within 6 hours of a COVID19 patient presenting with shortness of breath and/or arterial desaturation and requiring supplemental oxygen. If such early initiation of treatment could be systematically ac hieved, the need for mechanical ventilators and ICU beds will decrease dramatically . Further resources: The reader is referred to the large autopsy series by Bruce and colleagues which clearly outlines the pathophysiology of severe COVID -19 disease. [256] The scientific rationale for the MATH + protocol is reviewed in this paper.
