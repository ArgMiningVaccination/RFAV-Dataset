Acupuncture has received much attention for its use in cancer pain, and post-operative and chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting. The American Cancer Society has recommended its use for cancer and cancer-related symptoms like neuropathy, limb edema, and pain. Acupuncture can also help increase energy and appetite as it boosts immunity and relieves stress in patients undergoing cancer treatments. Cancer arises from abnormal changes in the genetic makeup of cells that causes the malignant cells to multiply uncontrollably. In Chinese medicine this is known as the \"Yin and Yang separating, in which the functional activity of the cell (Yang) loses touch with the intelligent guidance (Yin) of the cell's activity. In conventional medicine several factors are believed to trigger the cell mutations which cause cancer including genetic heredity, immune dysfunction, diet, extreme stress, hormone therapy, and environmental toxins. Common conventional cancer therapies include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy, and hormone therapy. All these can be very helpful, but they also cause side effects such as nausea and vomiting, malaise, fatigue, neuropathies, decreased immune activity, lack of appetite, and post-surgical and other pain. The traditional Chinese medicine treatment of cancer is based on the principle of Fu Zheng Pei Ben. Fu Zheng therapy refers to supporting the Correct Qi of the body, and strengthening the Qi of the organs in order to fight disease. This is based on the belief that the body has the ability to help itself heal and to expel pathogenic influences. Fu Zheng therapy also helps to improve the body's organs ability, particularly the kidneys and liver, to detoxify and eliminate pathogens and toxins, such as the drugs used in chemotherapy. When combined with conventional cancer treatments, Fu Zheng therapy helps the conventional treatments work more effectively. Acu Paincare Looking for more Verified Exporters?
