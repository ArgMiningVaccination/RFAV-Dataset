Published on Oct 30, 2020 [ By Dr. Surya Bhagwati ](#bottom_jump) Chief In- House Doctor BAMS, DHA, DHHCM, DHBTC | 30+ Years of Experience While most men like to boast about their prowess in bed, reality presents quite a different story. Premature ejaculation is estimated to affect around 40 percent of men globally and this severely impairs the quality of sexual activity and satisfaction. The term premature ejaculation refers to ejaculation or achievement of orgasm with minimal stimulation shortly before or after penetration, and before satisfaction is reached. This can lead to intense frustration for both partners. It adversely affects intimacy, sexual relations, and relationships. [Premature ejaculation](https://drvaidyas.com/ayurvedic-medicine/sexual-wellness/) is regarded as primarily psychosomatic, but can also have biological causes. It can also be affected by other factors but is not considered problematic when it occurs occasionally. However, it is classified as a problem when this occurs regularly. Additionally, low levels of energy, poor endurance, and a general lack of fitness can also impair one's ability to last long in bed. This has also become increasingly problematic today because of our urban and sedentary lifestyles. Traditional Ayurvedic insights are therefore even more valuable today. Ancient Ayurvedic texts have described a condition called Shukragata vata, which resembles premature ejaculation and also prescribes various treatments. Ayurvedic Remedies to Beat Premature Ejaculation and Improve Stamina Mental Distraction This is widely recommended as a psychological tool to cope with premature ejaculation. It requires you to take your mind away from the sexual activity, instead thinking of mundane subjects like work, accounts, math calculations, household chores, and so on. These nonsexual subjects work as a distraction to break your focus on sexual activity, thereby reducing arousal and prolonging the activity. While the field of psychology may be a modern invention, this is actually an ancient Ayurvedic remedy that is recommended in the Ananga Ranga texts. The human mind is described as the abode of 'kama deva' or desire and the role of the mind in this sexual dysfunction was clearly recognized. Other psychological tricks for premature ejaculation such as the start-stop and squeeze methods are also based on or derived from this same early Ayurvedic concept. Through repeated practice of these remedies, the ability to control and delay ejaculation can be developed. In time, you may be able to last longer in bed without even needing to use these tricks. Yoga Therapy Aside from the fact that premature ejaculation leads to unfulfilled sex, a sedentary lifestyle also impairs one's ability to perform adequately and lost long in bed. This makes exercise an important recommendation for almost any sexual dysfunction. It also has a significant role to play in treating premature ejaculation because of its physical and psychological benefits that are now widely recognized. However, this was already well-established in Ayurved and is actually best addressed with yoga as there are specific recommendations for this in Ayurvedic literature. Yogis who have truly mastered yoga can even exercise some control over autonomic body functions. This ability can also help influence and control the reproductive organ functions. Vajroli mudra or practices of vajroli involve activities that strengthen the uro-genital muscles. It takes years of practice and commitment to achieve this level of control, but this does not meant that the benefits aren't available to everyone. You can start by taking up a yoga practice with asanas such as surya namaskara, other backward asanas. Make it a point to also practice pranayamas like nadi shodhana and bhastrika, as well as mudras like vajroli and maha mudra. The efficacy of all of these therapeutic yoga practices has been proven in some studies, but it's important that you get instruction from a reputed yoga trainer to reap all of the benefits. Perhaps more importantly, you need to be consistent with your practice as yoga is not a quick fix for premature ejaculation. Ayurvedic Herbs Therapeutic herbs play a central role in Ayurvedic medicine, especially when dealing with male sexual dysfunction. Aside from the fact that Ayurvedic herbs can be used to promote the optimal dosha balance, they also have very precise therapeutic actions. When used in specific combinations or doses, these herbs can increase vitality, vigor, libido, and endurance in men, improving performance and helping you last longer in bed. The mechanisms through which these goals are achieved varies greatly depending on the herb used or the combination of herbs. For maximum efficacy, it is best to use a polyherbal [Ayurvedic sex power medicine](https://drvaidyas.com/product/herbo-24-turbo/) that delivers a blend of herbs. Typically, rasayana or rejuvenative herbs will be included as the main ingredients. [Ashwagandha capsules ](https://drvaidyas.com/product/ashwagandha-capsules/)and kapikacchu have been shown to improve performance duration in men, which is often attributed to potential testosterone boosting effects. However, the benefits are most likely linked to adaptogenic and anxiolytic effects. For similar reasons, brahmi is also regarded as effective with its strong anti-anxietyand stress relieving properties. Kapikacchu on the other hand is known to work as an aphrodisiac. Putranjiva is another herb that may increase ejaculation time, while others like amlaki, jaiphal, and mandukaparni are also highly recommended. Aside from consuming these herbs in the form of oral medicines or remedies, they can also be used in medicated herbal oils for procedures like vasti and shirodhara or can simply be applied over the body. Although you can use many of these [remedies to get relief from premature ejaculation and last longer in bed](https://drvaidyas.com/5-ayurvedic-herbs-to-beat-premature-ejaculation-improve-your-sex-life/), most Ayurvedic remedies are not quick fixes. You need to adopt these practices into your lifestyle and use them consistently for months to see results. As any Ayurvedic physician will tell you, it is also advisable to adopt healthy eating and lifestyle practices that support your optimal dosha balance. This is the best path to sustainable health and improved sexual performance. References: - Kalyanamalla. (1885). The Ananga ranga (R. F.
