For its tenth year, we moved the Y oung Writers Institute from SilverBay on Lake George to SkidmoreCollege in Saratoga Springs, NY, sothat our students could takeadvantage of the New Y ork StateSummer Writers Institute, directedby Robert Boyers, which convenes onthe Skidmore campus for the entiremonth. Having the opportunity towork on their own writing in threeclasses each day, hear accomplishedwriters in late-afternoon craft sessions or at packed eveningreadings, and then try out their ownworks-in-progress during late-nightreading sessions in the residence hallmeant that our high school writerswere thoroughly immersed in thewriting life for every waking hour.And here's what we have learned toexpect: they loved it. These young writers are unique in any number of disparate ways, butthey all share a devotion to writing.That common interest creates almostinstantaneous bonding when theymeet each other, but it alsoencourages them to revel in thewriting atmosphere of our intensive,week-long workshop. More than onehundred applicants from all regionsof New Y ork State send originalwriting samples each April, and wechoose the thirty-six best writers to attend the Y oung Writers Institute.That ability to be selective pays offfor us. Y ear after year, we offer thesestudents respect and recognition forwhat they have already achieved, andin return we receive not only acommitted, attentive group ofstudents for a week but also thedramatic, funny, moving, troubling,and remarkable creative pieces in thisanthology. It was our pleasure towatch as these pieces unfolded, andit's your pleasure to discover them here.

He was eager and impatient fora much needed sleep in thechambers below, for he had leeredtirelessly over the city and into thevastness beyond for many longhours. The day had been hot, andthe frigid sting of night waswelcome, even relished, in desertssuch as these. An endless expanse ofsand and rock yawned in everydirection, humbling the vain anddwarfing the powerful, intimidatingthe most seasoned travelers. Withinthe borders of this parched andempty land there sat a fortress, lowand broad and crafted from desertrock. Though only thrice the heightof a man, the walls were thick andstretched like wings from afar, theirends lost in the blazing heat as theybrushed one's limits of sight. Enemies were few of late, and such great armies as were oncemustered there were no longerneeded or maintained. The fortressand small settlements within it weredefended only by a small, well armedgarrison of perhaps eighty men,sparsely stationed along the length ofthe wall. And so Baldor crossed thefinal stretch of moonlit stone, theday's weight making him limp andlean heavily on the spear he carried. His shift of watch ended, Baldor could finally return to the armory,surrender his arms to the guard, andreport his observations of thesurrounding territory. He had seennothing, as expected, and lookedonly to rid himself of his wet, stickyarmor. The night was peaceful, ifdeadly cold, and Baldor wasgladdened to see the moon adriftupon the dunes. Still, he sighed, longand mournfully. He felt exposed andunsafe atop the sandy walls, knowingthat their easy accessibility placedhim in great peril. For months hehad avoided the shady stairwaysleading from town over the wallsand ran past them when his duties required it. The lamps and torchesilluminating the walkway weregreatly spaced, giving too manyopportunities, he thought, for citydwellers to approach him at night.His insecurity kept him marchingalong, studying stairways with care. A shadow flitted at Baldor's back. He took quick note of it butdid not turn or slow in his hobblingrhythm, the steady, painful ploddingthat keeps an enemy confident. Heknew the shadow, and he knew whoit belonged to. Unfortunately, he didnot know her intentions. The nimblefigure, a grown child's, perhaps,wove itself into the fabrics oftwilight, making it ripple slightlywhen approaching a lamp or torch.For some time it followed Baldor,keeping skillfully from lamplightand making not a sound. Baldorpaused at last; he knew how to playher games. The figure was trappedbeside a lamp post, locked in its haloof light. Baldorturned and facedher, poised like aserpent with hislong, steady spear.\"Show yourself tome, \" he whispered,\"or I shall stab youlike a rat. \" \"Already you have done that, \" awoman said,\"already you havewounded my frail,soft heart. I wounded you!\" Butforward she lunged, and Baldorstruck. The figure wailed and twistedfree, then leapt back into the darkness whence it came. Baldorsolemnly removed his helmet andwatched over the wall as it leakedinto the seams of stone blocksbelow. He limped on again, this timewith reports from his wife and hishardly untimely resignation. /square6Untitled by Conrad Baker \"I can't rave enough about this program.

I lovedevery minute of it.\" \u2014 Sarah Karpovich Young Writers | 4EVERY DAY IS HARD .I STILL SEARCH FOR you around every corner, half expecting you to reappear and openyour arms to me again. Eachmemory of you brings its own sting.When I open the windows to thebackyard, I wait to hear yourlaughter, but I am only shattered bysilence. I stare into the oncemanicured and vividly green lot, allfor you, but now left untouched. Hesays we should tidy, \"We could host aBBQ, and invite some of the ol'friends. How about Sherri? Y ou twogot along real well once. \" He doesn'tknow how I despise Sherri with herplump, third-trimester belly. I, too,had found it cute and endearingwhen she bumped into tables. Butnow it registers to me as annoyingand flaunty. He emerges from the bedroom, collared pale-blue polo, black tie,and nice slacks. I sip my morningcoffee, observing him bustle about,collecting files of clients from hiscomputer desk. \"Don't worry so much, \" hewhispers into my ear, then kisses my forehead, which I realize I've heldtense. I toss him a fake smile, andknow he will leave me alone. It'sbeen this way for the past fewmonths. I cannot stop blamingmyself for it. I let you slip throughmy fingers. If I had the chance, Iwould have told you to stay insidewhile Mommy answered the phone.I shouldn't have told you that youcould run ahead into the front yard,that I would be right there. In thosefew minutes, I left you vulnerable tothe world. Whoever stole you fromme, I hope they watch you carefully,with loving hands. This is the onlyway to imagine it. I pack my cart full of the week's groceries - chicken, avocados, milk. Ihear high-pitched laughter. Smiling,I look over, preparing to tell you thatas soon as we get home you can eatthe cookies, but only if you act like agood girl. I see you bending over abox of watermelons, your tiny armsstretching into the depths, hoping totouch one of the greenish orbs. Y ourface, looking down, is mostly hidden to me, but your plumped cheeksreveal you are smiling. Leaving mycart to the side, I slide over to youand place my arm on your shoulder.I whisper into your ear about thecookies, hoping for you to turn tome, eyes aglow. Instead, you panic.This child is, of course, not you. Amother rushes over with frightenedeyes, staring at me. She snatches herchild away, as if afraid I might first.The mother scoops her child in herarms and whispers something aboutstranger danger. I crack open. Thegirl is too fragile, too innocent, toodifferent, yet everything like you. AsI bolt for the overcrowded checkoutlines, a lump swells in my throat. Onthe drive home everything blurs;road signs, trees, other cars. I runinside, throwing myself on theamber-colored couch. The sun sets,colors melting and mixing. I wish Icould show you, to set blaze to yourimagination and heart, the way youdid mine. He gets home, hours after sunset. He finds me strewn across thecouch, heart pieces in a million different places. Beingcarried to the bedroom, Ilay my head against hischest and inhale. He smellslike musky cologne, sweatfrom another stressful officeday, and maybe a touch ofcity traffic. But most of all,he smells like safety. Ibreathe him in, hoping tobecome drunk enough tofall quickly back into sleep. He lays me into bed, tucks me in, and tells me itw i l l g e t b e t t e r ,s o m e d a y .Inod sleepily, ignoring my heart crying. Every day is hard. /square6Watermelon by Beverly Bartkowski \"This week has built a communityfounded on thebeauty of thatmade Writers | 5Donations: Right Here Please by Emily Beatty YOU COULD HA VE BEEN ANYTHING YOU wanted, and you constantly torture yourself with this fact.

It had started off as a nagging almost-thought in the back of youroverworked brain. It grew. It becamea regular thought, a constantthought, an obsession. Y ou would layawake at nights, listing undefinedthings that you hated aboutmankind. Y our job ceased to apply.Y ou became unemployed, hungryand impoverished. Y ou nevernoticed. T oo many people weresuffering. There was too muchwrong with the world for you tonotice your own problems. Death was not far off. Y ou became a mess of bones contained bytaut, colorless, rubbery skin, nearlyrobbed of life by your own brain. One day it all stopped. The fog cleared. The self-induced cataractsmelted away. Y ou were not happy.Y ou knew you could never be happyagain, but you felt that there was toomuch pain in the world for you tosimply sit at home and feel sorry foryourself and others. Y ou elected tofind the source of all evil and destroyit. With no more evil in the world, noone could ever suffer, and no onecould be as completely overwhelmedas you had been. Y ou traveled for weeks, months, years. Y ou lost track of time quickly.In all of your travels andconversations, you never once foundanything that could help you achieveyour goal. There were dead and dyingpeople of all ages littering the streets,deserts, and tundra. Y ou felt pity, butyou knew that to help one, or two, athousand, would not be doing justiceto the rest of them. So you passedthem by, in search of the thing thatcould help all of them... and help you. One day, in the far north, at the very center of a blizzard, you found acave in a snow-covered hillside, witha man patrolling in front of it. As youapproached, you saw that the manwas larger than average. He wasperhaps three meters tall, with a big fur lined greatcoat, a big furry cap,steel-toed boots and an appropriatelysized rifle slung over his shoulder. Asyou approached, he leveled the gunat you. He said nothing. And nowyou stand in front of him, listening tothe harsh wind and trying to shrugoff the sharp snowflakes. \"Why are you here?\" he asks, gun still on you. His voice cuts throughthe whipping wind and resonatesthrough your entire body. \"I wish to cure the world of evil, \" you shout, barely able to hearyourself. He lowers his gun and stepsaside, and gestures for you to enterthe cave. Y ou start shouting questionsat him. \"Who are you? What is this? Where is this. . . ?\" He shows no intention to respond. Y ou hesitate for a momentbefore entering the dark of the cave. The world falls away around you. Light seems to be devoured away assoon as you enter, like an animalbeing skeletonized by carnivorousfish. All that is left is calm, clear,silent darkness. Despite the completelack of anything tangible, you seemto have remained standing on solidground. Y ou take a careful stepforward in the abyss, and another.The solid ground remains. As youcontinue, the floor begins to slantdown. The slant increases as you gountil it seems almost vertical. Eventually you begin to feel the floor level out. Y ou think that youmust be very far underground. Asyou go farther, a ghostly green lightsculpts a square corridor out of thegloom. Y ou cast no shadow. Vaguely rhythmic clacking, echoes down the grey-green corridor.It gets louder. The sound of decayingpercussion, played by a seniledrummer, underlain by the drone ofa quivering shaker. Y ou shiver underyour skin. Y ou take an unconsciousstep back. The light gets brighter. Ahunched, grey creature comes around the corner. It wears a torn shirt,pants, cap and the remnants of shoes.With every step, the knees clacktogether, sending echoing percussivesounds towards you, always a little bitoff the beat. It gets closer, yellowedeyes bulging. \"Leave, \" it croaks. \"Go back. \"Y ou can't move. Y ou are paralyzed with fear. It limps past, intothe shadows behind you. Y ou want toleave, but you know that this couldbe your break-through. Y ou press ondown the tunnel. Around a corner, down another corridor, around more corners anddown more corridors. The light getsbrighter. Eventually you round acorner and see a door at the end,guarded by a man very much like theone outside of the cave, butsignificantly closer to your size. Hemay even be shorter. No sooner hashe spotted you than he aims his gunat you and orders you to stop. Y ouinstinctively obey. He tells you towalk up to him slowly, with yourhands on your head. Again, you obey. \"What do you seek?\" he barks in a high, nasal voice. \"I wish to cure the world of evil, \" you reply, shaking with nerves. Helaughs a cold, high, heartless laugh,stepping aside and opening the door. \"Go nuts!\" he says through body- wracking guffaws. Slightly unnerved, you continue through and onto the ledge. Thedoor slams behind you. Below you is an elaborate prison complex, or something like that. Onthe same level as you, but across theprison, you see a large palace, vividlycolorful in contrast with everythingyou have seen so far. Something inyour mind clicks at the sight of thatextravagant structure. Somethingyou've been looking for. It's a thingthat can't be described, only known. continued on page 8Young Writers | 8Y ou must get there. That you know. With no other options insight, you descend a stone staircaseinto the prison. One side of yourpath is lined by cells containing moreof that same grayed, hunched beingyou had seen. They simply wander incircles and lines around theirclaustrophobic cages. On the otherside is row upon row of cagesimprisoning small, translucenthumanoids with large heads and labcoats. They hold chalk and doodleand write on their floors. Y ou stopoutside of a cell containing one ofthe latter. \"Excuse me, sir. What is this place?\" It looks up from its sketches.\"Evolution is fact, not a hypothesis!\" It screams. \"Wake up!Wake up! We need to all wake upand see just how ignorant all of ouractions are!\" It leaps to its feet, smallpale arms flailing above its head.\"Religion is dissolving our societyfrom the inside out! Humans haverights! Rights, I say! These rightsdeserve observation by the tyrannicalleaders we select by process ofelimination for idiotic reasons! \"Life!\"Liberty!\"Happiness!\"We deserve these things, what they entail should not be dictated bythe religious and political fanaticsthat run our lives!\" Y ou step back as it begins running around in circles, armsflailing even more violently. Thewords get higher and faster, untilcompletely unintelligible. Y ou muttera quiet \"Nevermind, \" before sidlingoff, towards the palace. The beingwas quite obviously insane. Was itthe product or the reason of hisimprisonment? Y ou wonder toyourself. Perhaps both? Y ou get to the opposite end. A gated spiral staircase leads up a stonepillar that disappears into mistabove. Y ou notice that the staircase goes farther up than the palace, butthere is a bridge that seems toconnect the two. Y ou hesitate for amoment at the gate, before reachingthrough the bars and lifting the basiclock. Y ou have come too far to bestopped by a simple, unguarded gate. The ascension is slightly dizzying, but not difficult, and you eventuallyget to the palace. Y ou wonder what isabove the line of mist and if the pillarhas a top at all. Y our perceptions havebeen severely thrown off by this day.Y ou simply cannot imagine whatcould be up there. However, you feel that this blindingly colorful palace containssomething you have been seeking, soyou walk up to the crimson door andknock. In time, a tall, grey beardedman in a plaid bathrobe opens thedoor and wordlessly welcomes youinside. He motions for you to followhim into a cozy, colorful sittingroom. Y ou both sit. He snaps hisfingers and a bald young man in asuit appears. \"T ea, \" the bearded man says to the bald. His voice is deep andresonating. The bald man bows andexits. The bearded man turns to you. \"Who are you?\" he asks.\"I wish to cure the world of evil, \" you reply. \"I see... \"\"Who are you, and what is this place?\" \"I am God. \"\"Really?\"\"Most certainly. \"\"Then this must be Heaven. \"\"Y ou would think so, but no, it's not. \" \"Then what is this place?\"\"This is the collective human consciousness. The self-created worldof the human psyche. \" The tea appears. God pours a cup for the both of you. He sips hiscontemplatively. Y ou ignore yours,allowing it to calmly steam in silence.\"Why are you here and not in Heaven?\" \"I've always existed here. I can't go anywhere else. This is my job, andI've done it for thousands of years. \" \"If you're not in Heaven, what exactly is your job?\" \"I'm the jailer of the human psyche. Come with me. \" God rises,still holding his tea, and walksoutside with you in tow. He walks tothe edge of the cliff that overlookshis prison. Cells stretch out foreverright and left. \"Y ou see this? My job is to imprison these inhabitants oftheir minds. \" \"What have they done?\"\"Y ou see the sad, mostly-dead, colorless creatures? They want to behere. They are my followers andalways will be. They have forgottenwhy they chose to step into the cells,but they have chosen to do so, andthey will never leave. \" God sips his tea.\"The others: they are the convicted inmates under my care.They are the reasonable parts of sovery many minds. All that I havetried and judged have been foundguilty. I am working towards tryingevery single one. \" Y ou are surprised by his brutal honesty, but as you think it over, itmakes sense. It makes sense that thiswould be God's job. Y ou grimace. On God's belt is a large wrought iron key loop, with a single iron keyhanging from it. Y ou snatch it. Godlooks at you calmly. The surpriseonly registers when you embrace himand leap off of the cliff. The onlysound is the whistling wind in yourears for a few moments before anabrupt, painful, and loud stop. Y ourlast thought is that you have curedthe world of evil. The last sound youhear is the tinkling of breaking chinabeside you. /square6continued from page 7Young Writers | 9WHEN I BECAME A NINTH GRADER ,I WAS charged with the task of finding a job. I failed, but managed to land avolunteer spot as a soccer referee withthe town. It had taken a few phonecalls, a couple forms, a trainingsession dominated by a saliva-spewingidiot, but by the end, whether I likedit or not, I had joined the professionalwork force of America. For reasons stated, I remember the training session. \"Soccer refereeing is an art form, \" my boss had screamed. I had my misgivings\u2014it seemed pretty straight forward. Kick. Pass.Kick. Pass. Tackle? Y ou blow yourwhistle, smack the kid a little\u2014justmake him cry, no permanentmarks\u2014and resume play. Where'sthe room for artistic liberties? My cousin's a professional soccer player. No he's not. He's a winesalesman. But if he were, he'd disputethe fact. In a game which relies onacting, pussy-footing, and exotic paindances, refereeing is more guessing-game than empirical science. As Iwould painfully come to learn, it'snot about getting the call right\u2014it'sabout making it look damn good. The kid to my right looked bored to death; heck... I was bored to death.I offered a greeting and my hand. Wegot to talking between sessions, and Ilearned of his refereeing history. Thekid\u2014I can't quite call him a man\u2014had been drunk while reffing a six-year-old soccer duel. Players hadcomplained the ref couldn't seestraight, but the coach had dismissedthe claim as angry banter. When theref\u2014my new found friend\u2014collapsed in the goal during halftime,it took almost fifteen minutes and apair of wire cutters to untangle him.He didn't go unpunished, and wassentenced to community service by a righteous judge. At the time, theonly available volunteer work wassoccer refereeing. \"I'm warning you, this job reallysucks, \" my friend complained. I could tell he was biased.Training graduation was less of a celebration than a nauseating reactionto fruit punch. I shook a couplehands, looking like an idiot, andreceived my certificate. I didn't feelthat special. My mother showed upfor the event and sat, at my request,on the opposite side of the room (mybrother was watching TV , andcouldn't make the ceremony). Theyread the names, and a few peopleclapped. Clap, clap, clap. Great. I wasready to ref... or so I thought. I remembered a time when I had played recreational soccer. My teamhad scored, and we were rolling ontop of each other, making out, like acouple of logs, when the refereecalled the play offsides. \"No goal, \" he had screamed, with a flamboyant thrust of the arms. Parents started yelling. One threw a frozen juice-box from theteam cooler. I was determined not torelive that situation.I wasn't told what to wear, so I spent about a half-hour looking forshin guards in my attic\u2014knees sore,shins covered in mice scat, coughingup dust\u2014and it turns out I didn'tneed them. They also told me tobring a whistle, so I washed mythumb and middle finger before Ihitched a ride to the fields. I showedup with a red shirt, my recoveredshin guards, sweat pants, and a cellphone in my pocket. In the lot,moms ushered their kids out ofminivans, while others groomedtheir children by licking their fingersand fixing their hair. I imaginedbetraying my reffing powers. Might Itrip a kid?

Not a land mine or anything\u2014just too much apple juice at dinner. \"Where the hell's your whistle?\" my boss questioned. It was rhetorical, but I didn't realize, showing him my thumb andmiddle finger. \"Take mine, \" he ordered, a disgusted look from a disgusting face. Should I have thanked him for the used whistle? Maybe. \"And here's your uniform, \" he added, \"I hope you can take anextra large. \" The white t-shirt read: \"Parks and Recreation: T own of________. \" I leave my town name blank, with the hopes that you, my reader, mayfill in your personal residence. Then,however vicariously, you mightanswer my question: How was I to betaken seriously? T own parks andrecreation! The label evoked theimage of a counselor who made hiscampers toss a rubber chicken andscream their name. I was far fromsuch a man\u2014I was a professional, asoccer referee, prepared to enter abattle of parental complaints andprickly children. I had taken a ball to my assigned field, and had prodded the teams toget in position. All was ready to go\u2014I even had my fingers in mymouth\u2014when my style-wary bosscalled out: \"Y ou can't wear a red shirt under your uniform!\" Say it ain't so. I stood, amidst parents, coaches, and young children,forced by awkward confrontation tostrip half-naked. That's bad enoughfor the self esteem of a 14-year-old,but when you're embarrassed aboutwhat your brother calls \"caved innipples, \" the prospect of doing soseems doubly harsh. Kids stared at my naked form, unsure of an emotional response.Standing there, bare chested, as if I'd conjured up an audience to watch mechange, I couldn't help but crack agrin and shake my head. I looked likedimple-boy. I blew the whistle to start the game. Swarms of dirty little children,with dirty little fingernails, chasedafter the ball. The scene reminded meof the time my older brother hadgotten stoned with three of hisfriends, who then chased me aroundthe house for a piece of pizza. In my nostalgia, I lost track of the game. Damn Marijuana. My sensescame about as two kids\u2014 a cute girl,and an overgrown boy\u2014collapsed infront of me. I blew my boss's whistle,unaware I'd even put it in my mouth. I spat. Play came slowly to a halt. One child, obviously confused,started rolling in the grass. Crap. I hadn't seen the play. What had they told me to do? Make aneducated guess? I pointed at the boy,and accused him of assaulting thelittle girl. The coach exploded\u2014I must have guessed incorrectly. The man stomped onto the field. T en feet away, his moustache begantwitching violently. He towered aboveme, spitting saliva, rocking forward ina disgusting rage. I couldn't keep myeyes off his moustache. It wasperfectly groomed\u2014the sign ofmasked belligerence\u2014and itmimicked every syllable that exited hismouth. Sweat and spit droplets hit myforehead, and his breath\u2014acombination of meatloaf and maplesyrup\u2014flowed into my mouth. Whenit hit the back of my throat, and beganto burn the nostrils, I lost it. I don'tthink I've ever found it since. Blowing my whistle to his ear's dismay, he shut up and cringed. Witha thrust of my middle finger, and afew choice words, I ordered the coachoff the field. Slowly tilting his head,he stared puzzled, chewing his gum,as if surprised by my violentoutburst, but refused to budge. \"Thomas, come back, \" his wife pleaded. He was pissed. I was pissed.He ignored her, staring, while she repeated. For reasons unknown even to myself, I demanded she leave thepremises. It was a chain reaction of sorts. Kids started complaining we werewasting time. I kicked a child out ofthe game for tossing a lump of grassin the air. By this time, my boss hadrealized the commotion, and wasyelling at me. \"Get over here now!\" he demanded. \"Shut up you grizzly prick, \" I responded. I was a professional, entrusted with responsibility, and I wasattempting to control the situation.By undermining me, my boss wasundermining all soccer referees.It'd make a great case for their labor union. A parent threatened to call the police, so I left the game. When lawenforcement gets involved, I tend todraw the line: those guys are realprofessionals. It's funny that I'd volunteered for this. I was working withoutpay\u2014a benevolent citizen with goodintentions that had turned rotten.Jacked up on a mix of hormones and adrenaline, I walked off the fieldwhile smacking my butt and bending forward. \"Screw all of you, \" I yelled up at the sky. \"Mushy nipples!\" shouted one of the first graders. I can now understand where my friend was coming from, the day hehad told of his embarrassing exploiton the soccer field. Reffing soccerwas not a job, nor a profession: itwas an art. And given the day'sevents, I had come to realize that Iwas not an artist. /square6continued from page 9Young Writers | 11The Mosquito by Laura Colaneri I know, the second the sound evades capture by my Venus flytrap ears, I am lost.

Itwas a Thursday afternoon, and hewas back on duty. Passing the gatesof the vast camp, he glanced at thewords engraved in the steel barrier\u2014\"Jedem das Seine\u2014Everyone getswhat he deserves. \" He silently agreedfor perhaps the thousandth time,and continued the short walk to hispost. The distinct sound of infantssobbing, followed by coos from theirmothers chirped persistently. Kurtspit, partly as a public display ofdisgust, but more so because themorning's breakfast was God-awfuland the taste wouldn't leave hismouth. He contemplated why theJews complained so fervently aboutstarving\u2014the food could make oneabstain from eating anyway. He was following the simpleroutine he repeated nearly four times a day, every day directing the bulkfrom the cattle car towards thecrematorium. Six months atAuschwitz had both trained andhardened him, now his job actuallyfelt enjoyable, especially since heworked at the same camp as hisfather. Though they didn't worktogether\u2014Mr. Veigzar was arespected lieutenant and Kurt, onlynineteen, merely a guard\u2014occasionally his watchful father gavehim a nod displaying his approval.Each time this occurred Kurt nearlyburst with pride. Since his motherhad passed and his brotherestranged, they were really all eachother had. The doors cracked open and a tidal wave of people poured onto theplatform. An uproar of sobs andcries commenced, and Kurt bellowedwith a heavy tone of authority \"Stop your crying and head to the right. \"Few obliged, so Kurt snatched theleash that held four canines fromArnold, a fellow guard who mannedthe entrance. If Arnold wasn't goingto enforce discipline himself, Kurtdecided he'd have to take The vicious shepherdsmercilessly gnawed the skin of athin, middle-aged man, and thecrowd collectively gasped in horror.They will get used to it, he thought...i ft h e y l i v e that long. Each head was tilted downward as the mass of people stumbledtowards the crematorium. The firstgroup was already headed inside,leaving three other groups anxiouslysitting, paralyzed by fear. Onewoman sat apart from the tight-knitcluster of people, and on her lap sat continued on page 15 \"The instruction was great . . . and unique. Advice wasindividualized, and we writers, notstudents.

She rocked him as he glanced frantically at the still-newsurroundings. The woman wassomewhat pretty, though heavilyworn-down and showing signs ofemaciation. She looked familiar, andKurt racked his brain, trying to recall where he recognized thiswoman from. The next group rose shakily when called. Smoke poured from the top ofthe crematorium, and Kurt gave asmall cough, something he tended todo when he accidentally inhaled it. Atleast the smell no longer botheredhim. All the while he continued toponder why that girl seemed so veryfamiliar. It was most curious; he had,after all, been separated from Jews allhis life. Rarely had he had anyinteraction with them, at least if hecould avoid it. The mysterious woman, he thought to himself, looked almostreminiscent of a girl Margot\u2014whomhis brother had fallen for a few yearsback. Their father, though, had madeit clear that to associate with Jewswas a sin. Ehren had stubbornlydisagreed, and the words he hadspoken the night he left had foreverstuck with Kurt. \"What is religion,father, between lovers? Betweenfamily? We are all people. Shouldn'tthat be enough to let us liveharmoniously?\" he had foolishlyquestioned. Though Kurt could seehow much Margot meant toEhren, Kurt couldn't possiblyimagine abandoning their father; toabandon him for a Jew was simplyunfathomable. His father hadrepeatedly insisted that they werebetter off without Ehren, but, evenstill, Kurt wondered what hadbecome of his beloved only brother. Again, the smoke seeped into the sky, and the second to last groupcrept forward. They entered thechamber, some praying in theirnative tongue, others silent andemotionless. One younger man,panicked and hysterical, struggled to escape, pushing furiously throughthe forlorn crowd. Kurt promptlygave him a sharp, forceful kick to hisabdomen. He tumbled onto theground, and lay still for a fewmoments. Then, after regainingconsciousness, he began to prayfuriously. Kurt \"Our father, who art inheaven. . . . \" The Jew began to cry.Kurt hoisted him up and shoved himthrough the entrance, reuniting himwith his fellow group members. Hepatted the door as he locked it.Several yards away, Kurt's fathernodded in his direction, as if by cue. Kurt glanced at the final group, huddled together several feet away.Even the woman had joined themnow, protectively gripping the boyon her lap. Kurt now had a clearview of him, and he studied the boyas he had studied the mother. He,too, looked startlingly familiar andonce again Kurt was baffled. Withhair the color of a newborn chick's,and eyes a crystal blue, he certainlylooked out of place. The child alsopossessed a curiosity about him thatkind of reminded Kurt of how hehimself had been as a boy. Like they had three times before, the chamber doors swung open,welcoming the final group inside.The small, remaining mob stood andbegan to file in, calmer than any group previous. When the woman,holding her small son's hand, passedKurt, something struck him. As theirpleading eyes met his, memoriesrushed through his mind. Days ofexploring the woods with a youngEhren jolted him, along with thevision of his intense blue eyes, alwaysalert and mischievous. His kneesweakened as he replayed the firsttime he met Margot in his head,when he had been unaware of herreligion but enthralled by heraffectionate nature. Recollectionsarose of countless nights when hehad covered for Ehren as he snuckout to meet his forbidden love. All atonce the strong connection surfaced;his face paled as the realization hithim, and he nearly collapsed withhorror. Kurt vaguely heard a doorslam behind him, and suddenly theall-too familiar roar of a firesounded as he caught his fathernodding at him in the distance. /square6continued from page 14 \"This week has been wonderful,both as an aid to allour creativeendeavors and as ameans which | 16Nicky's Pizzeria by Willa Granger I.

Although I do admitthat the experiments that wecollaborate on do consume a largeamount of our time, I must say thatthis is a burden and a pleasure thatwe scientists share. In the hopes ofrenewing your fervor forexperimentation I have decided toshare with you some of what I havelearned about the amusing creatureswith whom I co-exist. Like most small minded creatures humans stand on only twolegs. It is clear to us large brainedmammals that this is not the mostlogical of standing positions as itdoes not appropriately distributeweight nor does it contribute tosuperior balance. Besides any matterof physical inadequacy the positionalso gives them the look of stretchedout featherless pigeons. Humanshave other weaknesses as well. Forexample they must encasethemselves in a second skin in orderto gain further protection from theelements. Even in places and timesin which protection is not neededthe people do not shed the second skin while in the presence of others. A human's mental capacity does seem to be large enough tounderstand and react to the basicsigns of affection and anger. UsingLassie's A Study of the Human Psyche for reference, I have conductedvarious experiments on my people.When I snarl or snap at them theyseem to understand that these aresignals that I am about to attack.Likewise they respond to my lickingor nuzzling them in a positive way.Therefore it can be concluded thatthey have the ability to perceive myactions to be affectionate. The modern person seems to be enslaved to glowing box shapedcreatures. I believe that these \"boxes\"are an invading species perhaps fromanother planet who enslaved theweakest species they found here onearth. I have extensively studied theworks of historians such as Fido andRex and have concluded from thesehistories that the invasion of theseboxes began sometime in the 1920s.They took over slowly and now itseems they have taken nearly everyperson into slavery. The largest of these boxes in my people's house isin the space known as the \"livingroom. \" The box is placed high mostlikely for worshipping. Most of thetime when my people enter theroom they are obliged to hear thebox speak and show them pictures.The words themselves areunintelligible. It is my theory thatthe boxes have created a languagethat combines visual and verbalimages that are simple enough forthe inadequate mind of a person. My people are not free of their masters when they leave the livingroom. On the contrary it seems thatthey are never permitted to bewithout one. If they are not listeningto orders they are at the very leastproviding transport for one or moreof the smaller ones in their pockets.One particularly appalling onecontrols the person's thoughts bygrabbing its ears with long thintentacles and feeding informationdirectly into his or her mind. I believe that it is clear that due to the relatively recent enslavementof humans our experiments of falseinferiority to humans have reached anew importance. We must study howan enslaved species reacts toenslaving and supposedly beingdominant to our species. Dear friends, fellow scientists, I urge you to continue yourexperiments and on a sentimentalnote always remember the words ofthe great philosopher Rover, \"Atreasure is worth nothing unless you bury it. \" So friends if youtreasure this letter don't hesitate tobury it along with your bones andanything shiny you find.

Of course, it wasthe suburbs. He'd have to try thewindows. At least this family didn'thave a dog or an alarm system. Damn! The windows were locked too. He'd have to smash oneof them. Taking out his flashlight, heslammed the butt against the glass.CRASH! It shattered easily enough,but the noise reverberated throughthe whole neighborhood. He lookedaround, making sure no one had heard the deafening crash, andwithout a second glance slippedthrough the open window. He'd root through the bedrooms first, people always kept theirvaluables there. The steps squeakedand squawked as he took them threeat a time. He twisted the doorknob ofthe nearest room and pulled open thedoor. He was taken aback by thebright pink wallpaper decorated withBarbies. There was a pile of disfiguredBarbies right beneath a patch of off-color wall paper. Clearly he was in thewrong room. There would be nothingworth his time in there. Suddenly, the policeman's head erupted in pain. It was as if he'd justhad a knife driven through his skull.He stumbled into a wall, groping hisforehead.

He'd also been havinga lot of memory loss, waking upsometimes not knowing where hewas or what he was doing. Each timewas marked by these terribleheadaches. Eventually he would endup passing out from the pain. He'dreally have to hurry now. He'd needto find some valuables and get thehell out of there before he passed out. He flung open the next door. This one looked like the parents'room. He burrowed as fast as hecould through the drawers of thewardrobe on the right hand side ofthe room. Nothing. He upturned thenext wardrobe, causing all theshelves to spill their contents, andquickly searched through themiscellaneous items. Still nothing ofvalue. He threw a frantic glancearound the room. The mahogany nightstand caught his attention. It was his lastchance. He slid open the only drawerand found a small oak box,decorated with an engraved acornon the top. He popped open the lid.It was empty. But that couldn't be, itwould be pointless not to putsomething in a box like this. Andwhere was the woman's jewelry? Inan upscale place like this the wifealways had pearls or diamonds. Just as he was about to give up in frantic rage, he noticed that the softvelvet lining wasn't actually attachedto the edge of the box. He lifted itout, and there, etched into the oak,were three numbers: 20-12-31. It wasa combination. But then, where wasthe safe? He'd have to find it quickly. He swiftly crammed the little box into his pocket and begantearing down all the paintings andshoving all the pieces of furnitureaway from the wall. But there wasstill no sign of the safe. Then it occurred to him. Thatone discolored patch of Barbie wallpaper. He sprinted to the littlegirl's room, found the off-color spotand ripped the Barbies off the wall.Just as he had expected, there was alarge black safe secured in the wall.He then took out the little oak box,checked the combination andopened the safe. Inside was a smallstack of cash, pearls and some goldjewelry. He needed something tohold it all. He scanned the room and found a little handbag with pink unicornson it. That would have to suffice. As he opened the front door of the house, his head exploded intobright fireworks of agony. Hestaggered across the front lawn,barely able to see straight. He wasfeeling faint, his eyes wereswimming . . . the pain was overwhelming. When he reached hispolice car he could barely open thedoor. He managed to put thehandbag on the front seat and gethalfway into the car before he passed out. *** He awoke to the sounds of a car pulling into the driveway. He jerkedup, hitting his head on the roof ofhis car. He looked around to take inhis surroundings as bolts of pain flashed inside his skull. Where washe? This house didn't even lookvaguely familiar. Suddenly, shouts began emanating from the home. Thepoliceman walked over to see whatthe problem was, clutching the backof his head. He knocked on the frontdoor. A woman quickly opened it. \"I'm Officer John Smith, is there a problem here?\" he asked. \"I heardshouting. \" \"I think someone's broken into our house!\" she shrieked. The woman said it looked pretty bad upstairs, so he headed therefirst. As he entered the first room hewas taken aback by the bright pinkof Barbies on the wall. They lookedcuriously familiar, must be deja vu.There was a black safe\u2014the doorhung lazily open, and it was empty.What kind of lowlife filth wouldsteal from a family like this?

The Hispanic cleaningwoman smiled at me as I passed herin the hallway. She was stout,motherly-looking. I smiled back andcontinued down to the elevator.Smiles were universal. I didn't haveto search through my Italian-Englishdictionary for the right words whenI smiled. I pressed the button for the elevator, and rode it down to the firstfloor. It had taken me severalinteresting elevator rides to acquaintmyself with American elevators. InAmerica, the first floor was actuallycalled the second floor, and theground floor was called the first floor. Our hotel room was on the third floor and on the outskirts of theUpper West Side, which I'd beenassured was very close to CentralPark. I had dreamed of visiting NewY ork City ever since I was a little girl.We were staying in New Y ork Cityfor three weeks, and I was excited tobegin exploring the city. I had beento Italian cities before, but never formore than a couple of hours, andalways under the watchful eye of myparents. Besides, I was sure le citte italiani couldn't compare to New Yo r k Ci t y. I walked down the street towards a falafel vendor I'd seen earlier. As Iwalked, I mused. If you lookedaround without glancing up at anyof the glaring advertisements andclosed your ears to the low roar ofconversation that filled the air, thecity could have almost been Roma or Napoli or Bologna. But it was Nuova York Citta negli Stati Uniti. New York City in the United States of America.The hard sounds of the wordsseemed to knock into each other,fighting for dominance. Englishlacked the beautiful, emotional flowof Italian, but there was something captivating about it, something thatpromised to both reward anddisappoint. At the end of the street I pressed the button and waited for the littlegreen man to replace the red hand. Iturned left and then right, andabruptly stopped short in surpriseand shock. The falafel cart wasn'tthere anymore. My stomachrumbled in disappointment and myheart quickened with the unease ofuncertainty. I didn't even know whata falafel was, but I wanted one. Witha sigh I turned around and startedback towards the hotel. I had gone two blocks when I realized I should have made a rightturn somewhere. At least, I thoughtit was right. I tried to retrace mypath in my head, but I wasn't reallysure where I was now. Forcing myheart down from my throat, I turned around and walked a block. I lookedboth ways, but the streets all lookedthe same. Finally, I turned andstarted walking in what I thoughtwas the right direction. By now, myheart was pounding. I didn't evenknow the address of my building,and even if I did, I wasn't sure Iknew how to ask for directions inEnglish. Not knowing what else to do, I kept walking, heart pounding, palmssweaty. Suddenly New Y ork City nolonger seemed so exhilarating andnew. Now it was cold andforbidding, impassible. All at once,the noise overwhelmed me. Thepeople who hurried by on the streetsnever looked away from where theywere headed, their feet a chorus of Untitled by Teresa Kline continued on page 26 Young Writers | 26drums pounding incessantly. On the side of the street, vendors shoutedout their wares in loud, callousvoices, fighting to be the loudest, themost piercing, to better catch theattention of the people whorampaged by with single-mindeddetermination. A cacophony ofvoices and honks of car hornsweighed the air down withimpatience and frustration. I began walking faster. I didn't know if I was going in the rightdirection or not, but I had to keepmoving. Moving meant I hadn'tadmitted defeat. Faster and faster Iwent, until I was flat out running,and the further I went, the fewerpeople in business suits I saw. WhenI finally stopped, I was panting andterrified. I had no idea where I was.Dove sono ? The street was narrow and dirty, and stank of sweaty bodies. Garbagelittered the ground, and I saw novendors selling food or purses orwatches. A dozen or so people weresprawled in various positions indoorways and on stairs. A few werelying flat on the sidewalk. Most hidtheir faces against their arms, curledup around themselves, but one man,unblinking, unmoving, stared up atthe sky. I shrank back from thepeople who passed me on the street,smelling of alcohol and somethingelse I couldn't identify. Some of themswayed, some of them walked, someof them staggered. A woman laycurled beneath a shopping cart ladenwith clothes and empty plasticbottles, and a few yards away fromher an old man sat in a doorway,wearing several layers of clothes,staring at nothing, his hands claspedloosely together. Beside a nailed-upstorefront window three women inlow-cut shirts and tiny skirtslounged and smoldered at theunsavory men who passed by. Thenarrowness of the alley and the tall,dilapidated apartment buildings hid the sun, and turned the street into adim vista full of shadows. A youngman, surrounded by empty bottles,lay on the ground. He reached outwith one hand and implored andbegged the empty space in front ofhim. The stench of unwashed bodies,waste, and human refuse blendedtogether to create a shocking aromaof poverty, hopeless and undeniable. My legs were shaking, and my fingers were cold and clammy. Myheart beat as though I was stillrunning. I turned around and beganhurrying in the opposite direction.My heart beat louder than a train,and I began to run. La polizia .I should find la polizia . I thought I knew the English word for that. I ranpast a young man sitting next toalmost a dozen empty bottles andmumbling something. I ran past aman holding a cardboard sign thatsaid 'Help. AIDS. ' I ran past morewomen in gaudy, revealing outfits,past an old woman relieving herselfin the middle of the sidewalk, past aman with his hand in his pants, pasta boarded-up store and the scorchedremains of a building and a tied-upbulldog that barked and snarled atme, his eyes glinting red. I ran until I saw a man in a uniform coming out of anapartment building. He was gettinginto a car that said 'Police' on theside. Frantic, I shouted, \"Help!\" usingone of my few English words beforehe could shut the car door behindhim. He turned around unhurriedlyand raised his eyes, looking tired andresigned. He said something inEnglish that I didn't understand.\"Non parlo , \" I sobbed, knowing full well he couldn'tunderstand a word I was saying, butunable to stop. \" Mi sono perduta. \"I repeated myself almost fanatically,and he sighed. He spoke again,slower this time, and louder, asthough I was deaf.T ears streaming down my face, I fought to find the right words. \" Mi sono perduta. No look home, \" I managed, my tongue tripping overthe foreign syllables. I wasn't sure ifthat was right or not. \"Are you lost?\"the policeman asked, very slowly,carefully enunciating each syllable. Ididn't understand what the wordsmeant. I realized I was rubbing myarms in a fenzied, hysterical way, andI was shaking all over. The scent ofthe street closed in on me and myvision blurred, going dark aroundthe edges. My heart was hammeringas fast as a hummingbird inside mychest. I felt the policeman take myarms and put me in the back of hiscar. He got into the driver's side,turned on the car, and began todrive, glancing at me in the mirrorevery once and a while. I criedsilently in the backseat. I realized he was talking, still slowly and loudly, as though heexpected me to suddenly understand.\"It's a rough neighborhood aroundhere. \" I didn't know what that meant.\"Not exactly the place for a girl to bewandering around. \" I didn't knowwhat that meant either. \"Don't worry,though. We'll get you home. \" Likebefore, these words meant nothing tome, but the reassuring glance he gaveme in the mirror was all thetranslation I needed. All I had wanted was to see the city I had dreamed of for years. I hadwanted to taste the foreign food,watch the people, feel the pulse ofthe city's life. Ho una esperienza. I had had no idea the city was a placewhere desperate people lived withouthope, hidden away in slums, out ofthe public eye, that the businessmenand women moving with single-minded determination were theglitter and feathers on an elaborateCarnivale mask that hid the city'strue face. The Big Apple was dippedin candy on the outside to hide itsrotten core. /square6continued from page 25Young Writers | 27Ode to an Umbrella by Tessa Kuster I.

Young Writers | 29Down the Manhole by Emma Loy-Santelli CHARON WAS NOT IN THE BEST OF moods. Truth be told, he had never been in the best of moods. A sunnydisposition just didn't correspondwith the ferryman's personality. Hehad met people with sunnydispositions, and had hated everyone of them. In fact, considering thathe had never left the Underworld, hehad encountered a surprisingly largenumber of sunny dispositions. Butthat was people for you. In terms ofmoods, however, he had been inbetter ones than the one thatgripped him now. He stared at theboy, sitting on a rock in the darknessand looking around him in interest.This show of interest annoyedCharon to no end, since he, Charon,the one who had to spend countlessmillennia there, found theUnderworld about as interesting asdirt, which there happened to be alot of. \"Can I go now?\" asked the boy. Charon stared at him. He just didn'tget it, did he? \"I ain't dead, \" the boy continued.\"Huh?\"And now he had been temporarily relieved of his ferrymanduties in order to interrogate somekid who had apparently managed tosneak past every single bit ofUnderworld security. By accident.Right, good story. The boy started to hum tunelessly. The sound seemed to stickin the flat air. Charon glared at him. \"I could have you thrown into Tartarus for this, \" he snapped,hoping that this, at least, would get areaction. The boy shrugged. \"Cool. \"Cool? What did that mean? It wasn't even a sentence. \"There you would endure unbearable torture for the rest ofeternity, \" Charon continued. Hewaited expectantly. The boy looked around him, seeming to find some sort ofentertainment in observing the drab, greyish brown wastes that made upmost of the final resting place of thesoul. This particular area of theUnderworld was pretty far out of theway, and mainly featured twistedblack trees and jagged black rocks. \"So can I go home, or what?\" the boy asked finally. \"Of course not!\" Charon snarled. \"T ell me what you came for,or...you'll regret it, \" he finished,cursing to himself. It had been awhile since he had had to threatenanybody. The boy smirked. \"What's the magic word?\"Charon blinked at him.\"Now?\" he guessed.He got a grip on himself. \"Y ou let me do the talking, you littledelinquent. What are you doinghere? Rescuing your girlfriend?\" \"No. \"\"Trying to talk to your father?\"\"No. \"\"Y ou have to complete a challenge, is that it?\" He shrugged. \"I guess so. \"Charon was thrilled. So that was it, was it? Well, he certainly knewhow to deal with that. \"I got a dare, \" the boy continued. Charon deflated. \"A dare. \"\"Y eah. T o go down a manhole. \" The kid grinned. \"I was gonna getfifty bucks for it. Now I think I'mgonna ask for a hundred. Above andbeyond, you know?\" Charon felt he had to ask, if only to try to understand theintricate complexities that were thehuman mind. \"Someone told you to go down a manhole... and you did?\" The boy shrugged. It seemed to be how he started most sentences, asif to prepare the observer for theproclamation to follow. \"Hey, fifty bucks is fifty bucks. \"Charon couldn't argue with this bit of wisdom. He knew quite wellthat fifty dollars was, indeed, fifty dollars, if not more. The boy glanced at his watch, rather pointedly. \"Y ou know, \" he said, \"your security must be pretty lame. I mean,look at all the people who broke inhere. Orpheus, Odysseus, Aeneas,Heracles, me..., \" Charon blinked at this unexpected spouting of classical trivia. \"Not to mention the fact that Heracles actually stole Cerberus. \" \"He . \" \"Seems pretty dumb to me, \" said the boy. \"Not as dumb as going down a manhole, \" snapped Charon, ratherdefensively. In his opinion the kidwas heading for a few thousand yearsas a weasel. Charon felt that hewould enjoy watching that. Staring atthe boy, he asked himself how havingkids could possibly be so popular. There was a moment of silence. The boy began tapping his handagainst his knee. The sound was likea finger poking at Charon's soul. \"It's not like I even had to go through any of that, anyway.Cerberus, or anything. I mean, I gotdown the hole and Cerberus was,like, way back there. \" He waved vaguely into the bleak distance. Charon studied the boy. Hehad to be lying. There was no waythat an entrance like that could havegone unnoticed. No way at all. Silence stretched out again, broken only occasionally by the faintscreams that regularly emanatedfrom Tartarus which was, inappearance, a high-security prison,but with a greater emphasis onthumb screws and eternal torment.Charon let the silence drag on.Maybe the screams would freak thekid out, which would be highly continued on page 30Young Writers | 30amusing to watch. He waited. \"Got any cards?\"Charon stared at him. \"Cards?\"\"Y eah. Anything. What do you do for fun down here?\" Charon stared at him some more.The boy glanced at his watch again. \"I should be home playingCall of Duty right now, you know. \"He looked at Charon's blankexpression. \"Y ou know, the videogame? Man, you are old. \" Charon was thinking, hard. Any time a member of the living wascaught trespassing they were kickedright back out again. Not literallykicked, of course, though Charonwould have liked to take a boot to afew of them. But he just couldn'tsend the kid home yet. He was sogod damn relaxed. Y es, he was goingto put some fear of Charon into thiskid before sending him on his way. Itwas the first goal he had had in thelast...well, ever, probably. He crankedup the force of his glare and aimed it at the kid. He had started hummingagain, tapping his foot absently. Heglanced at Charon. \"So, what's up with you?\"Charon stubbornly kept glaring.\"I've been thinking, \" the boy continued. \"Have you still got thesame boat?\" The glare, unbidden, dimmed a bit. \"I mean, have you ever considered upgrading to, I dunno, a motorboat,or something? I drove one of thoseonce. It was pretty sweet. \" I will not respond, Charon told himself. I am just going to keepglaring until he damn well notices. \"Y ou know, you could paint your name on it, and stuff, and get a realjacked-up motor. Y ou can go madfast on one of those things. \" Hefrowned at Charon. \"Something up with your eyes?\"The kid couldn't get a hint ifit was hammered into his foot. Charon gave up, all motivation anddrive gone. \"Don't you have a job you're supposed to be doing?\" the kidasked, glancing around. \"Y es, \" said Charon through clenched teeth. He did. A job thathad never before looked quite asappealing as it did now. \"How 'bout this?\" said the boy. \"Y ou send me home, and forget yousaw me. Say you taught me a lesson.Say I promised never to come back. \" \"Do you?\" Charon demanded quickly, hope blooming in his mind.This was all he really needed fromthe kid, right? A promise that he'dnever come back? Sure. That woulddo it. \"Y eah, I won't come back. Why would I? This place is lousy. \" Charon agreed completely, but didn't feel like saying so. However, heknew that, with the boy gone, thingsfor him would suddenly be just alittle bit less lousy. He had a job todo, so it was about time he got backto it. Right now. Kick the kid out, ifnot literally, then at least figuratively. And who knew? Hemight even get himself amotorboat. The boy found himself lying in theroad. He slowly pushedhimself to his feet andglanced around. T o hisleft was the openmanhole. Above, the skywas darkening.

Others enjoy horseback riding. Many are entertained bytheatre. Me, I shoot heroin. Heroin and I have had a dazzling relationship. Unfortunately it's timefor us to part ways. I made thisdecision this morning when I wokeup after a night of heavy drug use insome random person's bed. I hadawoken suddenly in a room that stunkof mold and rolled over only to findmyself face to face with a man with athick black handlebar moustache. Ontop of that I soon discovered that allhe was wearing was a pair of asslesschaps. It opened my eyes to the factthat heroin can take me places I reallydon't want to go. Of course my separation from heroin wasn't going to be easy. Thisisn't because I've been dealing andshooting smack for five years. And italso isn't because I've experimentedwith everything from freebase,speedballs, hydromorphone,fentanyl, oxycodone, pethidine, andmorphine, to name just a few. I'm not even worried about the symptoms I will suffer fromwithdrawal, even though I probablyshould. No, I'm worried about twoof my biggest clients: my parents. \"Going clean? Y ou? Ha!\" my mother cackled. My mother wasquite peculiar looking, which isprobably due to the fact that she hasbeen a heroin addict for nearlythirty-five years. Her skin is quitesmooth and wrinkle free, eventhough she is in her early sixties. Thisis due to the heroin, which often hasthis effect on people. As she likes tosay, \"Chiva is the best skin productout there bar none!\" But her skinitself is scarred and covered in scabsand she has managed to acquire thesemassive jowls, which, when she islaughing like she is right now, seemto flap up and down like the pudgywings of a bird.\"Have you been smoking the reefer?\" my father cut in. \"Y oushould stay away from crap like that,it kills brain cells!\" My father wasalso far from the norm when it cameto his appearance. T o be honest, helooks very similar to my mother;except he has his long gray hair tiedinto a ponytail and doesn't have anyjiggling jowls. \"Now dad, really! Y ou should know better than to think that!\" Isaid exasperated, \"I don't dabble insuch trivial activities! And besides,you mainline heroin!\" \"Arty, if you go clean, how are your father and I supposed to satisfyour heroin needs?\" \"Oh well, let me think for a moment, hmmm, maybe you couldthink about getting clean yourselves, \"I offered in a serious tone. \"Don't be foolish!\" my father grunted, \"I've been shooting smackfor over half my life, and I'm perfectlyhappy, so why should I quit now?\" \"Well that's a dirty shame for you I guess. . . \" \"Now Arthur!\" my mom piped up again. \"Think about this: if youquit dealing and we don't have asource of free chiva, how can weafford to buy any from anyone elsewhen we still have to pay for themortgage, insurance, and groceriesamong other things?\" My mom wastrying to play the guilt card that shehad played so many times before. \"I'm not budging on my decision, I'm finished with drugs, \" Istated again. \"Listen you selfish son of a bitch, \" my father growled, \"we put aroof over your head, put hot mealson the table, I mean Jesus Christ!Look at you, you're like what,twenty-seven, twenty-eight now, andyou still live with us!\" All of my patience just evaporated. \"This is absolutelyludicrous!\" I yelled in a rage, \"I'mgoing clean whether you like it or not!Personally, I don't give a shit what you think!\" I stood up violently andknocked over the chair I was sittingin. Before I marched out of the room Isneered at my father, \"Oh and by theway Dad, I'm only twenty-one!\" I made my way up the carpeted stairs to my bedroom and dived ontomy bed. The sheets reeked of variousodors due to the fact that theyprobably hadn't been washed inmonths. It didn't bother me though,and soon my eyelids twitched shut. \"Dinner!\" my mom's piercing scream shot through the house. Ilazily rolled off my bed andmeandered to the dining hall. Myparents were already seated and therewas an enormous crock-pot sittingin the middle of the table. I walkedover and removed the lid, ready toserve myself. I yanked the lid off andimmediately stumbled backwards.The crock-pot was filled withsyringes, all bobbing up and down inthe boiling water. I then witnessed inhorror as my parents each grabbed asyringe nonchalantly, as if it wassome sort of pork roast. They eachrolled up their sleeves revealing beltstightly wound around their upperarms. Gingerly picking up thesyringes they methodically jabbed theneedles into their bulging veins. . . My eyes burst open and I shot upright and began breathing heavilyand rubbing my eyes trying to forgetthe dream. I grabbed the phonelaying on my nightstand and dialedup a man named Dupree. Dupreewas an old friend from high schoolwho also dealt heroin, but has whatis called a chicken shit habit, sincehe's not really addicted and onlylikes to shoot up pineapple, which isheroin mixed with Ritalin. I figured Icould sell him my remaining stashand use the money to invest insomething legitimate, like a toplessbar. He was all for the deal and I continued on page 32Young Writers | 32promised to meet him the next day. I made a quick trip to the bathroom and while I was washingmy hands, I took a long look at thereflection in the mirror. The facestaring back at me was grotesque. Itwas past the point of being gauntand was now more emaciated. Mycheeks had an almost concave look,and the dark bags underneath myeyes seemed to be sagging farther andfarther down. I couldn't stand thesight of myself and spiraled into aviolent fit, repeatedly punching themirror until it was smashed to bits ofglass and my knuckles were bloodied.I stood there for a moment panting.In the beginning, heroin gave me apurpose, an identity, but now Irealize that all this time it has actuallybeen slowly giving me an identity Inever wanted. It has turned me intonothing more than a lowlife junkie. I washed the blood off my hands and slapped some water on my faceand went to bed. That night I wastormented by recurring dreams andhallucinations involving syringes, myparents, and my own skeletal looks.At one point I hallucinated that JanisJoplin and Jim Morrison entered myroom carrying whiskey and drugs,ready to let the good times roll. Finally at seven o'clock in the morning I passed out due to sheerexhaustion, and didn't come to until nearly two in the afternoon. I had tomeet Dupree in twenty minutes, so Igrabbed my jacket and my stash ofsmack and bolted out the door,avoiding contact with my parents. I met Dupree at a playground adjacent to an elementary school.Dupree was very skinny and verywhite, but if you ever told him so hewouldn't believe you. \"Y o homes! What's cracking! So you really are serious about this. Shitman, I thought you wasn't gonnashow!\" Dupree said excitedly as hegave me a high five followed by a fist pound. \"No man, I'm serious, \" I replied as I pulled five Zs of smack out ofmy duffel bag and placed them inthe trunk of Dupree's car. \"Are yousure this is the best place to do this?\" \"Of course man! Them little kids ain't gonna make a fuss about us. Ohshit! Y ou wasn't kidding when yousaid you had a shitload of scag!\"Dupree said as he weighed theheroin on a small scale he kept in thetrunk of his rusted Chevrolet. \"Do you think you can make a good profit of it?\" I asked curiouslywhile I watched what I presumed tobe third graders scamper about on aset of monkey bars. \"Hell yeah man! I can pimp this shit easy! Oh and look at that, five Zsexactly!\" \"So how much can I get for it?\" I asked. \"I can probably throw ten Gs your way, \" Dupree answered. \"Come on now Dupree, I'm not buying into that bullshit, \" I said in acool voice. \"All right you caught me. Hey I'm just a business man, trying tomake a living in these hard times... \" \"All right, I get it. How about we settle for double, \" I said and Dupreereluctantly nodded in agreement anddoled out twenty grand into a brownpaper bag.\"One love my brother, \" Dupree replied. I did another fist pound withhim and began my trek home. I wasfeeling high on life, for the moment. During the walk home though, my condition transformed rapidly. Ithad been two days since I hadstopped using, and alreadywithdrawal was setting in intensely. Ibegan to suffer from chucks, orhunger pains caused by the lack ofheroin in my diet. I also beganshivering uncontrollably andsweating profusely, even though itwas November. I needed a hit. Justone more hit and then I could quitfor good. When I reached my parents' house, I was in bad shape, but stillmanaged to sneak by my father, whowas watching a TV set that I hadstolen a few months earlier from anold folks' home. I made my wayupstairs to my bedroom and grabbeda dime bag hidden in my drawer. Iwanted to throw it in the fireplace,but my desperation for a hitoverpowered me. I collected all of my materials and began to prepare for my lastinjection of smack. As I was cookingthe heroin, a gunshot ripped throughthe house. The dresser in front of mewas now painted with blood. Icollapsed to the floor and turned toface my assailant. The first thing myeyes focused on were a pair of jowls,those grotesque flapping jowlsbelonging to my mother. I shiftedmy focus to her entire face, whichwas void of emotion. I tried to say something, but all that spurted out of my mouth wasblood. My mom was still pointingthe gun at me, her hand kept steady. The last thing I saw before my vision faded and eyelids claspedshut, was my mother reaching forthe half-mixed heroin, so she too,could get just one more hit. /square6continued from page 31 \"Here at AnonymousYoung Writers | 33I am the ooze of the 20th century Bubbling in the heat -urban landscape The playground across the street from the high riseThe river with more carcinogens than a pack of cigarettesI am from competitionI threw elbows in basketball games when I was sixI am from a dad who enjoyed his Jewish milkUntil they sent him to rehabI am from a mom who carries the scale of justiceSometimes juggling meI've passed through the parks where kids got highI've attended the parties on the Upper East SideToo early for regretAnd simply bored of angstI Am by Hayden Miller \"I had a great time becauseof the great faculty.\"\u2014 Anonymous Young Writers | 34Mornings, we wake to your voice the way farmers wake to fowl crowing at the sun on the shoulders of a field.

Anyway, my mom wascooking dinner, and I was left on myown to create something with therainbow-like array of brightlycolored paper spread out around me. However, I soon grew bored and decided that I needed somethingmore exciting to busy myself with. Ieyed my surroundings.

I climbed uponto the bed, scissors in hand, andpulled the sheets over my head,trying to keep my secret operationunder wraps. There, in my littlehairdressing den, I grabbed a clumpof shiny brown hair and held it infront of my eyes. With my free hand,I began to snip. For several minutes Iproceeded like this, taking sections and snipping, until my mother's voicerang out summoning me for dinner.My work wasn't quite finished, butthe damage was surely done. I set the scissors down and felt the choppy pieces of hair that fellstiffly around my face. I smiled at myhandiwork. Head held high, Isauntered into the kitchen. With onelook of shock and confusion, mymom made it clear that she didn'tshare in my delight at the haircut Ihad just given myself. The following day I was whisked off for an emergency visit to thehairdresser, who did her best to eventhings out, but who ultimatelydecided that we just had to wait it outfor my hair to re-grow. My motherwas horrified. I felt victorious. \"I can't believe you did this, \" she said sounding exasperated.\"What on earth possessed you to cutyour own hair?\" The answer I gave seemed quite obvious to me.

He knew which catsand dogs had fleas by the patterns intheir fur and which animals werebeginning to get sick by the state oftheir pupils. In his fourth-gradeEnglish class he astonished histeacher in an assignment aboutadjectives with a description of ablade of grass. Whereas moststudents wrote one or two words(green, pointy) Sam's effortsproduced four pages. Butobservation can be dangerous; thereare some things best left unnoticed,facets of the world that are betterseen out of the corner of the eye. It began with a simple enough thing\u2014a thin slice to the flesh at thetip of the index finger, at a diagonalto the faint lines of the print. Apaper cut. Sitting on his bed, Samdropped the offending book on thefloor and began to call for aid before remembering no one was home.Instead, he turned back to the cut.Staring at it, his face gave noindication of the sharp pain thatthreatened to burst out of the tinyincision. It came in waves, pushingat the doors of flesh periodically, intime with his heartbeat. Sam noticedthe oozings of blood, beginning atthe edges and welling into the gap atthe center, eventually overflowingand running down the side of hisfinger. It followed the contours of hisfingerprint. Then something newcaught his eye. It was a dark shape, seen fleetingly at the edges of his vision,but Sam turned his attention to it immediately. At first it seemed to tryto elude him, fading away among theshadows on the wall. But Samconcentrated on it and began tonotice things. With each detail, theobject came into sharper focus. First he noticed the faint wrinkles in the object, something ofcloth. Sure enough, he saw it to be adark cloak, hanging toward theground. The material had a similarquality to leather, which created aburnt appearance and odor. Y et insome places hair could still be seen;thin, coarse hairs not unlike thoseof...a human. The cloak was made of human skin. Sam began to feel very afraid. The painin his finger threwitself at the woundfaster and faster inconjunction with thebeating of his heartand as did, theimage became clearer.His attention wasdrawn upward, andsuddenly everythingwas in perfect focus. The cloak's hood was pulled back,revealing an utterlyhairless head. Lashes,brows, all weremissing. The face waspure white except forthe blue veins crisscrossing in a chaoticfashion. Red lips satabove a sharp chin, but they were cracked and bloodseeped from them. Sam, despite histerror, noticed that the bloodpumped in sync with the throbbingof his cut. And this was not all.Blood dripped at the same rate fromthe pits where ears, eyes, and a nose The Pain of Perception by Liam O'Connor continued on page 37\"Being here was extremely helpful. Ithelped my dream ofbecoming a betterwriter turn into areality. All the peopleI've met here were sosupportive of writingand I havememories to drawfrom for my writing.Thank you!\"\u2014 Soniya Shah Young Writers | 37should have been. The phantom's head had not been facing Sam. But as he stared atit, gaping in soundless horror, itbegan to turn, ever so slowly. Samwatched as its attention becamefirmly placed on him. Shutting his eyes tightly, he screamed as loudly as he could,yelling until his throat grew coarseand raw from its effort. Sobbingquietly, Sam peeked through hisfingers for the apparition. It was gone.He curled up on the mattress, back placed firmly against the wall,his tears slowing until they finallystopped. The halt in his tears hadnothing to do with recovery fromthe incident; rather it was due to hisreaching an understanding. Thoughstill terrifying, everything was somuch more manageable afterfiguring out the cause behind it. AndSam, with his miraculousobservation skills, had reached aconclusion. The correspondencebetween the phantom's blood andhis own pain suggested that it hadappeared in response to the cut.Perhaps the pain itself. The avoidance of pain is a large part of life. But for Sam, it becameall that mattered. His obsessivecaution and constant fear broke him.And barely a week after the incidenthe tripped and banged his kneedespite all attempts to avoid injury. \"No!\" he yelled frantically. His mother glared at him. \"Calm down, you're making a scene. \" She grabbed his wrist andhelped him up. But Sam was staring blankly past her, an expression of such terror onhis face that she herself felt nervous. The phantom was back, proving Sam's theory. But he noticed that asthe pain faded away, so did thephantom. Rather than being acreature that responded to injuries, itwas a manifestation of his own pain. But for Sam, this simply meant hecould never escape it no matterwhere he hid. He collapsed in fearand despair, shaking onthe ground. He became aware of his surroundings andfound himself in hisbedroom. He could hearthat his mother wasspeaking in hushed toneswith the doctor, but thecontent of theirconversation wasimpossible to discern. Itwasn't much of a stretchto assume it centered onhim. Sam entered hisanti-phantom position,back to wall. Sam's terror only grew as time went on.His mother failed toconsole him and thedoctor was unable todetermine what waswrong. Neither of themcould persuade him toleave the comfort of his room. As faras Sam was concerned, the likelihoodof getting hurt while huddled in hisroom was fairly low, and he had nodesire to test the fates. Though hisroom was the site of the firstincident, it was the most comfortingof the environments available tohim. Sam's fear consumed him. He grew stunted and pale, his eyes wideand dulled from both the dimness ofhis room and perpetual terror. Samate nothing but soft foods and neverventured outdoors; a sharp edgecould gash his mouth and the sunwould surely burn his skin. It was because of this excessive caution that the phantom returnedone last time. During a wind storm the tree next to Sam's room was blowndown. It was an old and rotten elm,ant and termite tunnels accumulated by its many years of growthweakening it significantly. Blowndown by the tempest it crashedthrough Sam's window, a straybranch skewering one leg. Sam awoke instantly, the sensation of pain filling him. Hismind went into shock from theagony and the fear that accompaniedit. Sam twisted, agonized, desperatefor awareness, desperate to know ifthe phantom would come. There it was, standing motionlessly at the side of the bed. Itstared down at Sam, its horrid faceturned to him. Cold sweat poringdown his face, Sam tried to call forhelp, but no sound came. As thephantom reached, its white handsgrasping, Sam's voice finally camefree, screaming for all he was worth. Then all he knew was pain. /square6continued from page 36 Young Writers | 38A Lament to Savour: An Ode to Chewing Gum by Ada O'Higgins My father, exiled, somber and silky with old age sits back and watches the sky turn pink above the sweet sexuality of his cigar.

Where wereher curtains? Where were thephotographs her mother had taken?The bed felt off, uncomfortable. Shetried to speak but her vocal cordswere too dry to make sound. Thesmell of cheap cleaner and crampedair drifted under her nostrils. Wherewas she? The thought echoed, thenvanished, and faded away into herfoggy mind. She tried to bring itback, to even remember what shewas trying to remember, but it wasgone. She fell again into a hazyunconsciousness. The sun came through the window and cast an unmovingshadow across the smooth floor.Everything was still and noiseless,until a group of interns led by aresident doctor walked briskly intothe room. Each person's shoes madelight tapping noises against thelinoleum as they crowded around thewoman. The resident's eyes flickedover the woman's face before hewhipped \"Can someone tellme her condition?\" An intern in theback blinked, hesitating. Then hand. snapped. \"It's intern responded. \"She'sparalyzed. \" The doctor turned backto the woman, and for a moment aglimmer of concern flashed acrosshis usually callous face. He stood,captivated by the woman's tranquilglow that could only mean there wasstill life. She looked so young, sopure. She couldn't have been morethan twenty. It made the doctor thinkof his daughter, away at college. Shedidn't call much, didn't email. Theyhadn't exactly left on good termsafter his only child decided on art forher career path. What was shethinking? He had worked so hard,trying to provide her with a goodhome and a good upbringing. Howhard can you work if you're an artmajor? Drawing sketches and throwing paint around? He couldn'ttake his eyes off the woman. \"What awaste art is, \" he thought to himself.\"Especially when life is so short. \" Butit was the second part that botheredhim. He closed his eyes, pushing thethought away. He'd call her when hegot home. An intern coughed andmade him jump. The movementmerged into his quick stride as he leftthe room. On his way out he passed a nurse. He barked a sharp hello, but lookedaway quickly and continued on hisway. The nurse nodded inacknowledgement, letting wisps ofunkempt hair fall across her cheek.She entered the woman's room torefill the cupboards with supplies.Mindlessly she stacked linens andbedpans onto the plain, white shelves.She turned to leave, but stopped atthe sight of the pale figure on thebed. Her seemingly lifeless bodymatched the rest of the room, butthere was something about the faintsmile resting on her face. She seemedcalm, unafraid. The nurse tilted herhead, and blinked her tired eyesthoughtfully. When she was that age,she had plans. She had ideas in mindfor what would happen and when.Sometimes, when she fell into therhythm of her work, she would thinkabout her dreams again, but only inthe nostalgic way that one rememberschildhood. They were distant,unattainable. Still these thoughtsmade her eyes smile when theycrossed her mind. The nursewondered what the woman's dreamswere. Which ones were now ruinedbecause of the accident? The nursesighed. Even after ten years in thehospital, certain stories still struckher. She turned to leave the room, butlooked back once more at thewoman, her hand resting lightly onthe white frame of the door. The second after the nurse stepped out, a panicked girl burstinto the room. She was not much younger than the woman in the bed.When she saw her, her weight shiftedbackwards and she clutched herheart. The girl had the same definedcheekbones as the woman, whichsoon became stained with tears offear and uncertainty. She collapsedinto a chair, and buried her mouth inher hand. The girl's soft crying andthe steady beat of the heart monitorfilled the room. Who was this person,lying there so calm and content?Where was the girl she grew up with?The one who, as a senior, begansinging \"Endless Love\" to heryounger sister in the middle of thecafeteria. She was loud, off-key, andgot even worse when everyone turnedto look. \"I was welcoming you to thehigh school, \" she said later, defendingherself. \"Y ou'd humiliate yourself as afreshman anyway, I was helping youget it out of the way!\" The girl waited in the hospital room, and searched for a quickglimpse of hope, the slightest signthat things would be okay. Butnothing happened, nothing changedexcept the lengths of the faintshadows across the floor. The girlgrew used to the beeping heartmonitor until it was almost soothing.Hours passed, the room darkened.The girl, curled up in the chair, beganto sleep. Sometime in the early morning, the woman in the bed blinked heavilyand dragged herself to consciousness.The room wavered, still blurry. Thewoman blinked again. Soon thingswere sharp and recognizable. She sawcupboards and drawers, white andneatly arranged along two walls. Shenoticed the slender-armed girl asleepin the chair. The girl's face was tight,and part of her long black hair clungto her neck, damp from sweat. \"Iknew she would come, \" the womanthought. She had trouble lifting thecorners of her mouth, but she felt thesmile none theless. /square6The Woman in the Bed by Jackie ParkerYoung Writers | 40Gypsy>Diva by Ariel Rehr THE LOBBY IS BUZZING WITH PEOPLE . With the same elegance andexcitement that was formerlyassociated with going to the theatre,the prospective audience waits earlyoutside the big wooden doors, soclean and waxed that they radiate theenergy of the room. Elegant women in pearls cling to their handsome male counterparts,holding their champagne glassesbetween manicured fingers. The thrill of opening night is evident everywhere, except, this isnot opening night. The show hadbeen open for months, captivatingaudiences nearly every night. TheT ony awards have been given out,naming three of its actors the best intheir field. I enter the lobby minutes before eight, hurrying down the red velvetstairs and heading straight for thecommotion. The merchandise tableis crowded with people, all wishingto pre-order their copy of the yet-to-be released cast recording, withouteven entering the theatre. The ushers take tickets, scanning them with a beep that is becomingsoothing and exciting to me, thesmile across my face embarrassinglywide as I follow the usher who takesmy mother and me on our own upto the box by stage right. We sit inthe cushiony red velvet chairs, linedwith gold trimmings, and the entirescene is magical. An orchestra sits on stage, dozens of dapper men holding theirpolished instruments that reflect thebright spotlights of the stage. The lights fade away as the orchestra begins to play, a medley of tunes both familiar and new tome. I squeeze my mother's hand; sheraises an eyebrow but smiles at mychildish excitement. A thin screen covers the orchestra as they play their last notesof the overture, and new lightingreveals the set.Once again surprising me, the show plays as though it is openingnight. The cast seems at theirbrightest, their chemistryundeniable. Though anannouncement before the showrevealed that the lead had injuredher foot and would be wearingspecial shoes throughout theperformance, and though I noticeanother actress incorporating tissuesinto her act, the performance seemsotherwise flawless. Near the end of the second act, the lead, the woman with theprotective slippers, sings a soliloquy.She imagines herself on a stage, infront of a huge and impressedaudience. At the end of the number,much of the audience, includingmyself, rises to give her a standingovation. Imagining that she isresponding to her own audience, thewoman is able to graciously thank usfor the applause, bowing andblowing kisses to the rising patronswho stand for a solid minutepraising her. She waves at me; I amsure of it because my mother and Iare the only ones in the box. Myheart skips a beat and I beam. And with the beat of music, the show continues on and what seemsto be the ending actually revealsanother half an hour ahead of us.Which is too bad for the oldercouple in the nearby mezzanine whoI see leave during the clapping. At the actual ending of the show, the large cast comes on stage,running to the front for individualbows as they narrow down towardsthe stars. The three leads eventuallywalk off hand in hand, laughing andhugging each other, and visiblymouthing words of encouragementand praise. This family I see on stagein front of me makes me jealous andhappy all at once. We return down the same red velvet steps, into the main part of thetheatre and then out the doors thatlead to the metal barricades which I quickly find a space behind. Rapidly,the space behind me fills up as moreand more people crowd for spotswhere they can give theircongratulations to the cast. I hold my Sharpie marker and Playbill tightly, handing it off to actorafter actor with a \"Wow, that wasincredible\" or \"Amazingperformance!\" They graciously thankme, leaving their signatures in blackmarker across the traditional booklet. The diva, this former 'gypsy' now the T ony award-winning star herself,walks out the door. A black limowaits for her at the end of the shortsidewalk but she surprisingly pausesto listen to her eager fans and signfor each and every one. She comes tome and I manage to stutter an \"Ohmy gosh, that was the most brilliantperformance I have ever seen. \" Shequietly thanks me, signing the photoof herself on the cover of the Playbillin silver marker, and she moves on tothe next patient person. Soon, asquickly as she came out, she gets into the car and the crowd quicklyfades away. /square6 \"Meeting and hanging out withother FerrinYoung | 41Ode to the Mud Puddle by Adam Sax The ground is puddled with rain Which is how the oceansMust have begun:A beautiful messOf squishy cratersPolka-dotted between trees Wee beasties swim In these temporal tidal poolsGrowing and multiplyingMaking meiotic soupIn the notches of the lawnWhere frogs and feet can play Splashes flood pieces Of the asphalt pathsMaking us danceTrying not to soakOur sandal clad feetIn the wet dirt and grass But it is wonderful, The dance between puddlesHolding arms akimboSpinning, missingSplash! and you're inToes cringing, cold and brown \"This week was so much fun.

Goright ahead and stare at me, Mom.But don't you know that parents areresponsible for how their child turnsout? So, news flash, the way I am isyour fault. Of course, I don't actuallysay this.

Still, I can tell she'shappy to see me. We sit down acrossfrom each other in the sticky vinylbooth, and begin discussing oldmemories. \"Remember Miss Bell?\" she asks.\"Y eah, I remember. She was the one who was always saying, 'There'sno such thing as a stupid question. ' Ican't stand when people say that.Isn't it better to tell the brutal truththan to delude morons into thinkingwhat they say is actually valid?\" Claudia ignores my little rant. \"I just ran into her on my way here.Apparently, she got married last July;can you believe it?\" I snort. Am I supposed to be happy about this? Let out a cheer, ahip hip hooray? I don't think so.\"Y ou know how I feel aboutmarriage. \" \"Y eah, I know. But this is our teacher. Weknow her.

Or maybe she's justoffended that I insulted her formercrush. I'd probably be if she did thatto me. We get on the topic of our families, a subject I'd really rather avoid. \"So, how's your mom been doing since the divorce?\" she says. I positively hate the \"D\" word. I avoid it at all costs, and it practicallymakes me shudder to hear Claudiause it so casually. \"Um, I don't know.Okay, I guess, \" I say.\"How've you been doing?\" she says this more cautiously, as if thewrong word could make me leapacross the table and attack her. I shrug. \"All right, I guess. As good as I possibly can be. \" Her gaze is serious and penetrating. \"Are you sure? I knowthis really good psychologist. He's afamily friend. He can help you dealwith your feelings of anger and grief. \" My jaw drops open. \"Are you kidding me? Since when did you turn into Oprah?\" I spit angrily. \"Andwhat would you know about my'anger and grief?' In case you needreminding, your parents have beentogether for 32 years. Y ou have noclue what I went through. \" Claudia looks sad, in an almost pitying way. \"I know it was horrible,what you went through, and I wish Icould've been there to help you. Butyou can't just stay angry for the restof your life. There comes a timewhen it's like, get over it already. \" I shake my head slowly, completely in shock. \"What did youdo with Claudia?\" I reach out andtap her skull with my pointer finger.\"Is my cynical best friend fromjunior high in here at all?\" Claudia sighs slowly, the sound dragged out and wistful. \"She grewup. I suggest you do the same. \" We sit there, just looking at each other, and for some reason I feel likecrying, something I haven't done in years. After our emotionless goodbyes, I walk home slowly, my feet dragging,feeling like I've been beaten up. WhatI keep focusing on is the look she hadon her face while she was lecturingme about therapy. It was pity, fear,and confusion, all at once. It was theexact look my mother had given methis morning. I don't think I everwant to see it again. I somehow arrive home and go up to my room. My bright, cheeryred walls seem morose in the mood I'm in. I plop down on my bed, tooemotionally exhausted to even reachthe remote to the television. Whenthe conversation from the diner popsinto my mind, my tiredness shifts toanger, and I begin pacing around myroom. What was it she had said? Oh,yeah. \"Y ou can't just stay angry for therest of your life. There comes a timewhen it's like get over it already. \"Gosh, what helpful advice that is. I'm soooo sad about my parents' divorce.Whatever shall I do? I know! I'll getover it! How simple. Suddenly, I stop everything, and stand still in the middle of my floor.My pacing has turned to furiousstomping in my anger, my face isflushed, and I'm being bitter andsarcastic about someone who used tobe my best friend. Why am I likethis? It makes sense that I wascynical in junior high, when I washormonal and nearly friendless, witha face full of zits. Cynicism made mefeel like I had a morsel of control insuch a scary time of my life, andhelped me bond with Claudia. Butit's probably not healthy to channelall my emotions about the \"D\" wordinto sarcasm. The problem is, if Istop depending on my crown, wheredo I go from there? Feeling the strain on my sore muscles, I plod over to my woodencabinet, open it, and reach towardsthe back. I know it's there, where Iput it years ago. It has to be. Finally, I find what I'm looking for, and pull it out. It's a note Claudiawrote me when she was bored inmath class, from 8th grade. It says:Cynicism is what would be created ifintelligence and rapier wit had a lovechild, after intelligence cheated onkindness. And really, who wouldn't? I chuckle darkly. That Claudia, she'squite a funny girl.
