Description Peripheral Arterial Disease Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common atherosclerotic syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality. A less common cause of PAD is Bu erger disease (also called thromboangiitis obliterans), which is a nonatherosclerotic segmental inflammatory disease that occurs in younger patients and is associated with tobacco use. The development of PAD is characterized by narrowing and occlusion of a rterial vessels and eventual reduction in distal perfusion. Critical limb ischemia is the end stage of lower -extremity PAD in which severe obstruction of blood flow results in ischemic pain at rest, ulcers, and a significant risk for limb loss. Physiology Two endogenous compensating mechanisms may occur with occlusion of arterial vessels: capillary growth (angiogenesis) and development of collateral arterial (arteriogenesis). Capillary growth is mediated by the hypoxia release of chemokines and cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor and occurs by sprouting of small endothelial tubes from preexisting capillary beds. The resulting capillaries are small and cannot sufficiently compensate for a large occluded artery. Arteriogenesis with collateral growth is, in contrast, initiated by increasing shear forces against vessel walls when blood flow is redirected from the occluded transport artery to the small collateral branches, leading to an increase in the diameter of preexisting colla teral arterioles. The mechanism underlying arteriogenesis includes the migration of bone marrow -derived monocytes to the perivascular space. The bone marrow -derived monocytes adhere to and invade the collateral vessel wall. It is not known if the expansion of the collateral arteriole is due to the incorporation of stem cells into the wall of the vessel or to cytokines released by monocytic bone marrow cells that induce the proliferation of resident endothelial cells. It has been proposed that bone marrow -derived monocytic cells may be the putative circulating end othelial progenitor cells. Notably, the same risk factors for advanced 3 ischemia (diabetes, smoking, hyperlipidemia, advanced age) are also risk factors for a lower number of circulating progenitor cells. Treatment Use of autologous stem cells freshly harvested and allogeneic stem cells are reported to have a role in the treatment of PAD. Stem cells can be administered in a variety of routes, derived from different progenitors, and be grouped with different co -factor s, many of which are being studied in order to determine the best clinical option for patients. The primary outcome in stem cell therapy trials regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amputation -free survival, defined as time to major amputation and/or death from any cause. Other outcomes for critical limb ischemia include the Rutherford criteria for limb status, healing of ulcers, the Ankle -Brachial Index (ABI), transcutaneous oxygen pressure, and pain -free walking. The ABI measures art erial segmental pressures on the ankle and brachium and indexes ankle systolic pressure against brachial systolic pressure (normative range, 0.95 to 1.2 mm Hg). Summary Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common atherosclerotic syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is the end stage of lower -extremity PAD in which severe obstruction of blood flow results in ischemic pain at rest, ulcers, and a significant risk for limb loss. Use of autologous stem cells freshly harvested and allogeneic stem cells are reported to have a role in the treatment of PAD. For individuals who have PAD who receive stem cell therapy, the evidence includes small randomized trials and systematic reviews. Relevant outcomes are overal l survival, symptoms, change in disease status, morbid events, functional outcomes, quality of life, and treatment -related morbidity. The current literature on stem cells as a treatment for CLI due to PAD consists primarily of phase 2 studies using various cell preparation methods and methods of administration. A meta -analysis of the trials with the lowest risk of bias has shown no significant benefit of stem cell therapy for overall survival, amputation - free survival, or amputation rates. Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been published that used granulocyte -macrophage colony -stimulating factor (GM -CSF) -mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC). The route of administration of cell therapy and the primary outcomes differed between stu dies. In the trial that added cell therapy to guideline -based care, there were no significant differences in progression -free survival and frequency of limb amputation at 1 year of follow - up. There was a substantial rate of subsequent surgical intervention in both arms. Well -designed RCTs with a larger number of subjects and low risk of bias are needed to evaluate the health outcomes of these various procedures. Several are in progress, including multicenter randomized, double -blind, placebo - controlled tria ls. More data on the safety and durability of these treatments are also needed. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. Policy History Date Action 3/2023 Annual policy review.
