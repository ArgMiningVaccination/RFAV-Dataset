As a Mind-Body therapist, I appreciate the person as a whole as well as the relationship between a person's mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual experiences. This approach can also be called Holistic or Integrative. I believe that it's necessary to address more than the mind in therapy to get results. So, much of our experiences get stored within the body. That's where Integrative Psychotherapy comes in. Integrative Psychotherapy is an approach to healing with a number of techniques that enhance the mind's interactions with bodily function, to bring in relaxation and improve overall health and well-being. It can help people get in touch with their body and experience the physical sensations within in order to enrich overall health. Overall, the mind and emotions can impact physical health on a deeper level, and they often play a very important role in the way we experience pain. It often happens that people who suffer from chronic pain are also overly stressed, depressed or anxious and have experienced something that is considered to be traumatic. This is where the mind-body therapies can truly make a difference to help you relax and heal. Techniques used in Mind-Body Therapy can include mindfulness, yoga therapy, hypnosis, meditation, nutritional and wellness exploration, guided imagery, neurofeedback, EMDR and biofeedback. I like to combine a broad range of different holistic approaches to help each client reach the deepest level of healing possible.. Whatever the struggle, there's hope to heal. "}
