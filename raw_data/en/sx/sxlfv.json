The science of Ayurveda is a system of holistic health that includes all facets of our being: our inborn constitution (or dosha), lifestyle, environmental factors, nutrition, and much more. Ayurveda recognizes that there are influences we cannot change and things that we can. It asks us to be active participants in our well-being by making choices which are in sync with our true inner nature. If you'd like to learn more about Ayurveda, join us for [Yoga & Ayurveda: A Match Made in Heaven](https://www.greenlotusyogactr.com/training-yoga-school/yoga-ayurveda-teacher-training), or [schedule an appointment](https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/classic/ws?sLoc=0&sTG=4&sView=day&studioid=3142&stype=-9) for a personal Ayurvedic consultation to learn more about how to use Ayurveda to bring balance to your own life. An Ayurvedic cleanse is gentle on the body and includes plenty of easy-to-digest, nourishing foods that give variety to the basic two recipes recommended so that each person's preferences can be met with ease. We even offer options for Keto- and Paleo-friendly options. Approaching a cleanse in this way aids the body in maintaining good digestive health which, in turn, affects our overall health and well-being. Because Ayurvedic cleansing includes a daily diet of wholesome, fresh foods, it generally can be practiced safely by most people. Cleansing may not be appropriate for people with certain medical conditions or women who are pregnant. Please consult your health-care professional if you have a condition which affects your digestion or blood sugar. A simple three-day cleanse may help: Improve digestion and metabolic function Promote regular and balanced elimination Nurture an improved sense of energy and vitality Encourage a balanced sleep cycle Promote improved overall health The cleanse may be done on any three consecutive days of your choosing which leaves you in control of timing. We recommend selecting three days when you may be less busy or have more opportunity to rest. This adds a retreat-or-spa-like feeling to the cleanse and reminds you each day that you are taking care of yourself in body, mind, and spirit. Finding time for rest and relaxation throughout the day is important because we digest most efficiently when we are at rest. Your body will be able to get the most out of the foods you eat.
