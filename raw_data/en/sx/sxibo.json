Please take a break from dr. Google. Spend your research time looking for a reputable pediatrician in your area. Outside of allergy or familial vaccine injury history, you have nothing to worry about. If you don't vaccinate your kid, you have a lot to worry about. Even benign illnesses like chickenpox can rear their ugly head years later. I had finally recovered from a horrific csection and sepsis when I came down with shingles. I endured terribly painful nerve damage (and still do) because I had chicken pox as a kid (I'm older than the vaccine.) Do you want your kid to have that? Those chicken pox parties seem less celebratory when you think some of the adults now dealing with nerve pain. And please, by the invocation of all that is worthy, don't bring your unvaccinated (or delayed vaccinated) child around any newborns or immunocompromised people. That includes Walmart. Drs offices. Parks. Schools. The general public. Omg don't @me at this it was 8 months ago I was 2 months pp with PPD I'm not even going to bother looking upthread Anyone who has the common sense to read and know the difference between a scientific study and a @#$%ing BLOG. This is really good to hear. :) Hehe np :) no hard feelings! Totally missed the {} sorry. Now I feel stupid and ignorant hahahaha My apologies:) And partly Trump and the wall nonsense. Yes I was absolutely being sarcastic. I do not, nor have I ever believed Mexicans are nasty. Thank you to the people who saw the {}. Please google the meaning of {}. She was actually making fun of Americans. No one is bullying you. People are tearing apart your \"evidence\", links and opinions because they're incorrect, dangerous and ignorant. How can you not see that? You are being bombarded with FACTUAL information and links and you still cling to your idea that the delayed schedule is safe. Your kids might have got lucky, but you have no idea if they harmed another adult or child because hey received their vaccinations late. It's selfish and it is ignorant. You know you clash with people on this. Time and time again you post the same Bull. Have you not reflected on that and thought \"well, I feel like I'm victimised when I post things on these threads, maybe I won't participate because I get upset that people are mean\". I'm harsh with you on this topic because it is downright dangerous to spread false and misleading \"information\" about no vaccines and delayed schedules. Please listen and take in people's FACTUAL information. Stop putting your children (and others) in danger. Get some more help for your PPD, stop participating in threads that you know upset you. If everyone always gangs up on you, don't come here anymore. Seriously. At some point you have to take responsibility for your actions. No one is forcing you to be here. If you know that this site is full of people who \"bully\" you, why on earth would you stay? Is it fair? No. Not much in life is fair. So YOU have to take actions for YOURSELF. Stop coming here. Get well. And then maybe you can come back. You are posting incorrect and harmful information. Then complaining when people are outraged by it. Stop. Please stop. You are making yourself a victim. No one is doing that for you. Stop. She was being sarcastic and making the same point you just made. Whether anyone died or not due to the measles outbreak is somewhat irrelevant. The fact there even was a measles outbreak when it was previously eradicated is enough reason to believe that not vaccinating or delaying vaccinations is dangerous. If a tornado hit your town and there were no casualties would you think tornadoes aren't dangerous? Your comment is stupid! Why are you calling Mexicans nasty? You're ignorant, the majority of people who cross the border it's Central Americans Mexicans actually do fly. Educate yourself before you come and make those type of comments. And I would just like to add a link to expand on her comment regarding \"no deaths\" occurring during the Disney outbreak. Yes of course no one wants to see anyone die so that's not even a piece of my argument but the reason outbreaks of measles are so damaging to the population and herd immunity is because of what the disease itself does to the immune system. Having this disease practically eradicated in the population actually helped to bolster immunity towards other diseases, not just the measles. The measles acts like an immune system eraser and opens up the person to illnesses that they would have likely fought off naturally or were immunized to. The link: [http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2015/05/07/measles-immune-system/#.WaLgC0EpCEc](//blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2015/05/07/measles-immune-system/#.WaLgC0EpCEc) For the record, I had said that relying on anecdotal evidence and anti-vaccine propaganda was stupid. Not that you're stupid. I believe that you're foolish to continue using those sources even though they've been roundly disproven but you, indygrl2016 as a person are not stupid. This is the CDC report on all the measles outbreaks since 2000, when measles had been ELIMINATED in the US. Then it made a comeback, specifically because herd immunity was compromised by none other than anti-vaxxers. [https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html](//www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html) Measles is so extremely contagious that only one sneeze from an infected person can linger in a room for two hours and will infect 90% of the people who come in contact with the virus. [https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/transmission.html](//www.cdc.gov/measles/about/transmission.html) The more people who are infected in a given area, the greater chance a measles virus has to infect and kill the immunocompromised, unprotected individuals, and babies. In 2000, the number of people who could be infected by measles in the US was ZERO. In 2015, that number rose to 188 people in 24 states from the Disneyland outbreak alone. If anti-vaxxers and delayed vaxxers didn't exist, that number would have been 1 or 2 cases. And even then, one or two would have been a sharp rise in itself and would have only occurred because of a mass outbreak in the Philippines in 2014, which resulted in 58,110 cases and 110 deaths. [http://www.wpro.who.int/immunization/documents/mrbulletinvol9issue1.pdf](//www.wpro.who.int/immunization/documents/mrbulletinvol9issue1.pdf) The virus at Disneyland was a measles (B3), and was traced directly to an infected person visiting the park who was in contact with or infected in the Phillipines. If the United States continues to listen to anti-vaxxers and gives credence to unscientific delayed vaccine schedules, we run the risk as a society of having an outbreak on the same level of the 2014 Philippines Outbreak. Aaaaaand we come full circle! Well, he also believes vaccines cause autism, so..... I mean, the president of the United States looked directly at the eclipse without protection so I don't know if that argument is going to work lol. I'm kind of kidding but not. I was amazed at the number of people who said in the comments of links, \"So what? Everyone looked at it without glasses. It's no big deal!\" No. Not everyone. Learn to science, America. I don't think I ever said the CDC is bull ***. If I thought that my kids would not be vaccinated at all so to assume I don't trust science isn't true but that's the assumption being made on here. Some of the links I posted were not all false. I posted the Disneyland link to show there were in fact no deaths from that measles outbreak but someone said it was totally false. Anyone can google and see that's true what the article said. But people just dismissed everything I linked which is why I never wanted to post anything in the first place. Did you look directly at the sun during the solar eclipse? I'm going to assume you didn't. I'm going o assume further that the reason you didn't not was because scientists said not to. Now imagine last week there was someone on a thread in HT telling all of us, you included, that the science behind the dangers of looking directly at the sun was bullshit. I would imagine you would find that frustrating. It's what the other posters whom you feel are \"attacking\" you feel right now. This topic, like not looking at the sun should not even be debatable at this point given all of the countless research. Yet here you are. Maybe now you can understand why everyone is getting so upset with you and annoyed. I don't decide to participate in a debate expecting to be called stupid, ignorant, uneducated etc. in that Stay at home mom thread you are referring to I explained and clarified my point numerous times but no one listened. Same thing here no one listens to me they just continue to bash and call me names. I know we aren't 12 but someone just made a thread about adult bullies so yes they are out there I'm not wrong for feeling like I could be \"ganged up\" on because it does happen with adult women. Thank you I'm sorry you're going through PPD. It's awful and I'm glad you're getting help. Please understand most of the posters are not only refuting your statements because they are not based on sound science, but also because there could be lurking moms to be reading and being swayed either way. I would say you are very lucky your children didn't contract anything during the delayed window, but truly it's due to science, via herd immunity. Most parents follow the AAP and CDC guidelines which has benefits for those who have been scared into delaying or skipping vaccines altogether. Be well and take care of yourself. You aren't a joke. It's just that your sources aren't credible and you believe something that is based on falsities. If someone posts inaccurate information it will be pointed out. It's not actual evidence if it has been disproven. Oh my gosh. Stop. Seriously. No one was discussing they were attacking and calling me stupid, ignorant, and said lol at your links like I'm some big joke So blame the victim fine No ones ganging up on you. We are discussing. You asked which was more credible, then told everyone to stop talking to you when that was answered. And VG defends your delayed schedule? She's one of the most vocal anti-antivaxxers on here, so that surprises me. It's not about who creates the thread. You're participating. You post false info and sources that widely disputed on a debate board- I would expect to be challenged. If your ppd is making it difficult for you to engage in being challenged on your views, I would step away. But if these arguments trigger you, then stop opening threads that are clearly about vaccines. You're putting yourself in the position. And wonka and VG who don't event post anymore are the only ones who ever stick up for me because everyone always gangs up on me I have sought help I have 3 different social workers who are actually helping me. I don't create these threads but I respond to them same as anyone else. I don't but heads with anyone other then these random vax threads that keep getting creating and I along with everyone else is responding to. If you want to question my ppd that's on you. Is it really so hard to admit, in the face of mounting evidence, that you might... just might be wrong? That you were bamboozled by an anti-vaxx industry that thrives on parental anxiety and debunked studies to hock books, lectures, and alternative \"medicine\"? This isn't a conspiracy of opinion. Not is it a battle of wills or opinions where each is equally valid. Because guess what you can't fake or cover up: The scientific method. Coming up with a hypothesis, testing it, cataloging results, and then making sure that same experiment can be repeated again, strips away lies, arguments and opinion. It's unarguable. And the FACT is that the scientific method backs up vaccinating children according to the CDC schedule, and by DR. SEARS OWN ADMISSON, a \"delayed\" schedule has no scientific basis and is instead based on \"feelings\". \" [https://www.google.com/amp/yournewswire.com/why-dont-amish-children-get-autism/amp/](//www.google.com/amp/yournewswire.com/why-dont-amish-children-get-autism/amp/)\" [http://www.snopes.com/the-amish-dont-get-autism/](//www.snopes.com/the-amish-dont-get-autism/) FALSE. Dan Olmstead conducted an anecdotal, non-scientific survey with 100 families in Lancaster County, PA. ... \"The argument that near non-existent rates of autism amongst the Amish are related to a failure to vaccinate rests on two assumptions: 1) that the Amish do not vaccinate their children, and 2) that the Amish do not get autism. Both assumptions are false. A 2011 study published in the journal Pediatrics surveyed 1,000 Amish parents about their vaccination habits. Of the 359 people who responded: 68% stated that all of their children had received at least 1 immunization, and 17% reported that some of their children had received at least 1 immunization.\" ... \"Preliminary data have identified the presence of ASD in the Amish community at a rate of approximately 1 in 271 children using standard ASD screening and diagnostic tools although some modifications may be in order. Further studies are underway to address the cultural norms and customs that may be playing a role in the reporting style of caregivers, as observed by the ADI. Accurate determination of the ASD phenotype in the Amish is a first step in the design of genetic studies of ASD in this population.\" So it looks like that article you posted that's a link away from another article on an anti-vaxx site, is pure bunk, balderdash, and bullshit. Then stop coming on here. You KNOW that the majority of people on this board strongly disagree with you. This happens EVERY SINGLE TIME you post about your delayed schedule. STOP POSTING if it's such a \"trigger\" for you. As far as the @ business, you can absolutely choose to ignore that. You don't HAVE to open the app/site, read, and respond. You are an adult. If this is truly triggering you, and you have ppd, stay off the internet. This isn't the only thread you have butted heads with others in. There are NUMEROUS threads you have done this. Seek help if you haven't for your ppd. It's a serious deal and it's not shameful to get help. I had ppd so so bad and had to take a break from the internet. I think wonka is the only one here now that was there 4 years ago and saw how I was. It's not fun. I was so upset by everything online. So get off. Stop posting about controversial topics when you KNOW you are the minority. This is a debate board and you have been apart of it long enough to know that these types of threads turn into debates. You cannot play the \"she just wanted opinions, I'm not here to debate\" card. You really do know better. And this is why I said I didn't want to engage in link wars no matter what no one will read actual evidence as is such in some of the links posted. I can't deal with being attacked I have PPD and this is triggering me so I can't continue being called stupid etc please everyone don't @ me or talk about me I'm done. I know what you're thinking. The one link brought me to a page that listed studies that show a link between vaccines and autism. I don't just take someone's word and believe blindly, so o did some research. One of the studies, Elevated rubeola [measles] titers in autistic children, did find something interesting. I'll paste the abstract \"Virus-induced autoimmunity may play a causal role in autism. To examine the etiologic link of viruses in this brain disorder, we conducted a serologic study of measles virus, mumps virus, and rubella virus. Viral antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the serum of autistic children, normal children, and siblings of autistic children. The level of measles antibody, but not mumps or rubella antibodies, was significantly higher in autistic children as compared with normal children (P = 0.003) or siblings of autistic children (P Now, just reading this and not thinking critically would lead you to believe that hey, maybe the vaccine for measles can cause autism. However, I started thinking about it. Even though the etiology of autism is unknown, they know that both genetics and environment play a role. Autism Speaks has said that a child who has a predisposition for autism, something in the environment can \"bring it out\" if you will. This is true for many various illnesses. Anyway, my thoughts are that these children who had elevated levels of antibodies which may have \"caused\" the Autism, would of had the same exact process happen if they had contracted measles. Or a host of various autoimmune responses. Here's complications that can arise from measles. \"The following less common complications: Encephalitis: This affects around 1 in every 1,000 patients with measles. It is an inflammation of the brain that can sometimes be fatal. It may occur soon after measles, or several years later. Complications that are very rare but possible include: Neuritis, an infection of the optic nerve that can lead to vision loss Heart complications Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE): A brain disease that can affect 2 in every 100,000 people, months or years after measles infection. Convulsions, motor abnormalities, cognitive issues, and death can occur. Other nervous system complications include toxic encephalopathy, retrobulbar neuritis, transverse myelitis, and ascending myelitis.\" That study does not definitely prove that those children would not have Autism if they never received the vaccine. It's also a chicken and egg type of scenario. Did those children have an abnormal response to the vaccine because they had autism already, or did the vaccine cause the abnormal response. Either way, I would rather have a child with Autism than a child who suffers/dies from a disease. Here's the link to the study. This is off topic, but related to what we're saying... I first had the internet at 16, and would go into games that had chatrooms (pogo.com). I can't count the amount of silly questions I had. Some questions are reasonable if you've never been out of the states, but I literally had people asking me, on an internet chatroom, if in England we had computers, or the internet, clean running water etc. And they were serious. When I pointed out that it was called the 'worldwide web' they couldn't account for it at all. They believed the internet was US only. I know re vacuum. I'm from Canada and have travelled many times to the USA to hear interesting assumptions about life north of the border. Credible: Peer reviewed research Randomized controlled trials Prospective and retrospective studies Population studies Reproducing study results Animal studies Not credible: Mommy blogs People who write books/websites stating opinion without reliable research to bank it up Non reproducible research Personal yet inaccurate interpretation of data Personal opinion Anecdotal stories Fear Someone says something so it must be true Opinion articles There are standards of what is credible. You don't get to decide that. I don't get to decide that. The fact that you don't know this, again shows you aren't well informed and just don't understand how to \"do your research\". Vax truth is antivaxx propaganda. It's not credible. None of your links are. Especially the ones who choose to believe a disbarred dr who faked his study. Not once, in all of the studies around the world, has his results been repeated. That alone should tell you that it's false nonsense. And it's been studied a million times. You know, the USA exists in a vacuum. That's why the wall will totally stop those nasty Mexicans {} because they all walk across the border and don't fly in or anything. There was a phone app game my husband was playing for a while. It was called plague something and basically he had to create viruses and distribute them around the world and kill everyone off before they found a cure. Little morbid, but it's crazy how fast those things spread with all the airline routes around the world. Yes it's just a game, but there's absolutely an element of truth in how it works. Are you arguing credibility by providing an article in which a reporter visited a town in Pennsylvania and determined that there was a link between autism and vaccines because he met 3 autistic children? Do you not see the difference between making medical decisions for your children based on stuff like this vs science? Do you understand the concept of peer reviewed scientific journals? Why?? Diseases come from OUTSIDE the country. We're not safe until the diseases are gone from the world. [https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/06/02/health/minnesota-measles-outbreak-bn/index.html](//www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/06/02/health/minnesota-measles-outbreak-bn/index.html) Note that USA had declared measles eliminated in 2000. No one is saying don't question anything. And yes, the scientists who do years of medical research are without a doubt more qualified than a biased documentary put together by a former doctor who's license was pulled. You can't possibly argue that a handful of hearsay stories, documentaries, and \"vaxtruth.org\" are more credible than the CDC. I mean, you adhere to other CDC and AAP standards which you deem credible. Why aren't they credible with vaccinations? Please stick to USA statistics These last two things you posted are propaganda pieces that have been debunked by scientists and doctors. There is little to no truth in them whatsoever. They're complete fabrications or at best, complete manipulation of real data. And who gets to decide who is more credible? You? Yes I understand for the millionth time [http://vaxtruth.org/2015/01/measles/](//vaxtruth.org/2015/01/measles/) What these movies then tell me no one should question anything What disease that has not appeared since 1979 are you referring to? Polio? [http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2014/05/05/309868063/the-comeback-of-polio-is-a-public-health-emergency](//www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2014/05/05/309868063/the-comeback-of-polio-is-a-public-health-emergency) Emergency not here. But what if polio cases arrive in your country? It's not about who has more links. It's about the source provided and the information provided on the link. Where the info comes from etc. If you are looking at this as who has more links, no wonder you don't understand. It's about content and quality. \"With the delayed schedule they receive the majority of the vaccines by the time they are entering school. And that's not true that it's mandatory to attend school depending where you live. I went to school in Texas and several friends believed in Christian Science and they were not vaccinated.\" I grew up as a Christian Scientist. Let me share with you an article about how not vaccinating worked out for them: [https://exchristianscience.com/2015/09/1985-measles-outbreak-at-principia-college-patient-5/](//exchristianscience.com/2015/09/1985-measles-outbreak-at-principia-college-patient-5/) Thank God I'm in a pro vaccines state! Link wars? M'kay. Oh lord the war links lol exactly why I should just keep my mouth shut. I'm out this has been going on for literally hours and I just can't anymore. I respect everyone's opinion but it's time to just end. You get more aluminum naturally than you ever get in a vaccine. Oh my, what an awful sentence. Sorry. This link discussing recent study of aluminum in vaccines. The risk is the amount of aluminum. One of the many reasons listed under Dr Sears and dr Paul's plan to delay. Yes I know what I'm talking about stop talking to me like I'm stupid. I didn't just wake up one day and decide to do this I read and listened to numerous evidence and facts and made my decision. Like I said my pediatrician supports me and that's all that matters not sanctimonious mommies on WE. The delayed pace doesn't change any risk factors. What risk factors change and what benefit is gained using a delayed schedule? You are worried about chemicals...it's hard not to eye roll at that argument since you really don't know what you are talking about if that's your argument. The reason the risk of those diseases are lower now than before is because vaccines work. You just proved my point. The risk of getting vaccinated is small. You really don't understand do you? Or you don't want to understand? And no these things aren't necessarily such low risk once acquired as you are making them out to be in the young population. Go visit an icu and see what parents are going through when their child is intubated and ill. That might make it more real for you since you can't reason well or critically think. I have a friend whose mother has post polio syndrome. It causes her SO MANY problems. It's not just a quick disease that you just get over With the delayed schedule they receive the majority of the vaccines by the time they are entering school. And that's not true that it's mandatory to attend school depending where you live. I went to school in Texas and several friends believed in Christian Science and they were not vaccinated. I work in a clinic, and honestly I've seen much more people with problems because they didn't get he vaccines on time or at all, vs people who've had the vaccines and gotten a reaction. And I'm not talking about kids I'm talking about adults. One patient had polio when he was little and has one leg paralyzed stated that his mom didn't want to give him the polio vaccine when he was little (she was going to wait till he was a bit older) because she heard that giving vaccines before 6 months could kill the child. Hmm well guess what? He has to live like this for the rest of his life because of something his mom heard and was afraid of. Google is not a Doctor and not everything that is on the internet is true, I thought everyone knew this. You should not be googling things when it comes to health. I'm so glad children who aren't vaccinated can't attend school! And I hope my child is never around a kid who isn't vaccinated before getting her scheduled vaccines. And it's your decision to believe in Dr. google, and I hope your children never get sick before getting their delayed vaccine even if it won't kill them. Imagine your child gets mmr and is out in the public for some reason and gives it to a 6 month old who's mom is planning to give vaccines on scheduled time (12 months) I'd feel horrible being you and pissed being the mom of that other child. I so much rather a poke vs days or weeks of my child to be miserably sick, and chemicals? We consume, breathe chemicals all the time, we put them in our hair too. :) That is very sad. I'm glad we have vaccinations for things like that now. I met an older gentleman the other day with Post Polio Syndrome. He cannot walk, he has had MANY surgeries and medical procedures and he was the sweetest man. It made me so sad. Exactly. I'm glad I've never seen a case of polio. From what I know of it, it's a terrible, terrible disease that even if you survive has life long consequences. I hope I never see one. Although I believe there has been a few cases in recent years. The vaccinations were developed because people who cared stepped up and said too many people are dying. We need to figure out a way to stop this happening. The more anti vaxxers don't vaccinate, the more likely it is we'll see diseases like this reemerging. I think the most frustrating argument against vaccines and their current schedule is \"these diseases barely exist anymore.\" You must understand that this is *because* of vaccines right? If the anti-vax movement had happened back then, they would still be here. Sadly, she won't, because judging by all of her uneducated scientifically void links and responses, she has made up her mind and she thinks she (and Dr. Google) are right. That's all medical science is outweighing the benefits vs risk. Do I risk my kid getting a bunch of chemicals and vaccines all at one time which could result in a seizure, coma, death, neurological damage in the off chance of getting certain diseases that has not even appeared since 1979, or that are treatable if actually contracted, whereas the others would be permanent. I take the delayed pace because I see the risks as too high with the way the current schedule is set up. Why do you think no one is listening? Please explain how acknowledging that side effects exist but that the benefit outweighs the risk is ignoring facts? I'm allergic to penicillin. I found this out when I took it and went into anaphylaxis. 400 people die a year by penicillin in America. Do you think penicillin is dangerous? Something that should never be offered to kids due to this statistically small risk? Vaccine injuries happen for a teeny tiny percentage of vaccinated patients. And millions more are saved. Take some time to think if you have been buying into misinformation due to fear. \"Injuries\" occur for every single medication. So arguing that you don't give vaccines because a rare reaction *could* occur is illogical, makes no sense. Unless you don't give any medications whatsoever. Also,As I said earlier, my friends baby had a severe allergic reaction to apples and basically anaphylactic shock. Should we never give or children apples because one kid had a bad reaction? Reading the real facts is scary...too scary and that's why people just dismiss it and don't listen to it Yeah, it definitely worked out in my favour. I have wonderful parents. Oops! I meant mumps. My Dad had the mumps, not measles. I was hospitalized for chicken pox at 18 months because it was such a bad case. My parents said it was horrendous. I am so glad there is a vaccine now. OP, we will vaccinate on schedule, with all recommended vaccines. If something were to happen to my child as a result of me not protecting him I would never forgive myself. A PP mentioned possible side effects from vaccines, such as fever and seizures that could cause damage. The chances of that are very rare, and I am more comfortable taking that chance than taking the chance that they will contract a deadly disease and die. My dad had the mumps as a child and as a result cannot have children. He is lucky it wasn't worse. That's so sad! But wonderful that he found you :) My dad had the measles as a child and as a result is unable to have children (I am adopted). Right on. Thank you, and I'm sorry your grandmother had to endure that. We have a neighbor and a dear friend who is deaf due to meningitis he contracted at 18 months old. I had chicken pox when I was six and I will never forget how miserable I was. I distinctly remember telling my mom that I hoped there would be a shot for it by the time I had kids so they wouldn't have to get chicken pox. Oops, \"considered\" a delayed schedule, not \"questioned\". Sorry for the multiple responses to you, but I thought another poster had made the comment about chicken pox. My grandfather had non-Hodgkins lymphoma. He beat cancer. And then he contracted chicken pox thanks to his weakened immune system, it caused encephalitis, and he died five years before I was born. It's been forty years and my dad can still barely speak of it. I was concerned about the MMRV because of the increased risk of febrile seizures compared to two separate vaccines. I asked our pediatrician if we could do the MMR and a separate varicella vaccine in a couple weeks. He agreed to do it, but pointed out that although it did have an increased risk of febrile seizures, the odds of it happening when you did the math were still incredibly low. Again, I trusted his judgment. She received it and her first Hepatitis A at the same time and had no fever whatsoever. My daughter was a preemie. Because she was so small, the neonatologist told us they were going to delay her Hepatitis B vaccine until she was at least 28 days old. Since she was a preemie, my husband and I did discuss doing a delayed vaccine schedule, and we discussed it with our pediatrician. He said she'd be fine to follow the CDC schedule, and the fact she was a preemie actually made it more important to follow the schedule to be sure she was protected. The worst side effect was a 102 degree fever we think was caused by the Hib vaccine, and it quickly responded to Tylenol. If she hadn't been a preemie and if the neonatologist hadn't delayed the Hep B, we wouldn't have even questioned a delayed schedule. Exactly what Kardu said. Nothing else even needs to be added with that plethora of good information. Unless there is familial history of adverse reactions to vaccines you should follow the recommended schedule for vaccines according to the country you reside in. I'm assuming you are American (correct me if I'm wrong), so you should follow the schedule that the CDC recommends. Not following this schedule is dangerous to your children and to the general public. ^ Kardu said everything much more politely so I'll just ditto her and the links she provided. I follow \"Mine have done very well on it\" Well ***. That's all the evidence we need. She asked specifically for personal experiences so I have her mine. Y I did follow the Dr Sears for my 4 yr old and just recently started this new VFP with my infant. My 4 yr old did good on that plan she's rarely ever sick and never had bad reactions other then a little sleepy. My 2 month old just got the DTAP and HIb and she was just a little sleepy as well but didn't run a fever. Her crying though made me cry as well :( **ETA- Oh shoot, sorry. I did not realize how old this thread was until just now. Thank you :) Doing your research involves looking at the credibility behind your sources. This poster you're defending routinely posts sources with poor science, such as Dr. Sears and realfarmacy. The anti-vaccine movement seems to be blind to this distinction that not all \"information\" is of the same quality. The trunk is pretty much the same as a car seat. Just make sure to drive safe and everything is fine. \"Go with your gut\" instead of decades of scientific, peer-reviewed research is truly excellent advice. My kids hate car seats, and I know accidents aren't super common, so I just let them roll around the back of the van. We mommas have got to stop bashing on each other and give support to every choice! Mom always knows best!!!!!!!!!! It probably came up in the related posts at the bottom of another vaccine thread. Most peds \"allow\" a delayed schedule because they figure it's better to delay than not vaccinate at all. It's them trying to find a middle ground with people who are afraid of vaccines. Whyyyyyyy are you commenting on a thread that's over a month old? How did you even find it? \"I so agree with you. This is such a highly debatable subject\" No it's not. \"and pro CDC vaxxers can be such bullies.\" We don't suffer fools. If you don't vaccinate then you're a fool. Period. There's no debate. \"Delayed schedules are fine and many peds are fine with it!!\" No they're not, unless they're quacks or trying to appease anti-vaxxer nut jobs. \"So saying \"trust or only go by what your doc says\" is an ignorant statement as not all doctors are on the same page.\" Yes they are. They just know that they have to placate idiots who visited Dr. Google first. \"Mine specifically said it's a little alarming to the additives now being added. She is totally fine with a spaced plan.\" She rolled her eyes when you left her office. No shingles is a plus! I'm just always worried I'll end up with chicken pox from somewhere. Poor baby - poison ivy looks like it would be awful to have! My mom bought some soap that apparently works wonders from poison ivy - it's all natural - try looking it up (I cannot remember the name, sorry). At least we can't get shingles?? I'm not that worried about it when I'm not pregnant but I try to be as vigilant as possible when I am. My daughter got into poison ivy pretty badly last week and it kinda looks looks chicken pox - I wish I could hang a sign on her neck that says \"this is NOT chicken pox.\" Titers*** I'm in the same boat as you! I was tested as a teen and I had tiders, so they didn't give me the shot. When I got pregnant with my son I mentioned I'd never had chicken pox so they tested me again and I was negative. I wasn't aware at the time that chicken pox while pregnant is very dangerous! Last pregnancy, my coworker had an outbreak of shingles and kept telling everyone \"it's not contagious, don't worry about it.\" I told her it was to me if she had any uncovered wounds and it could be fatal. I pretty much stayed in my office with the door shut for two weeks. Ugh no, it's very frustrating. I'm very risk averse, so having my life in the hands of people that decide not to vaccinate and let their kids get chickenpox is not a fun place to be for me. I'm about as pro-vaccine as you can get, so I'm a case study of WHY EVERYONE SHOULD GET VACCINATED AGAINST VACCINE PREVENTABLE ILLNESSES. I've had someone suggest that I'm perhaps just immune, but I haven't had any healthcare professional suggest a test for that. Do you deliberately post links from anti-vaxx websites to irritate people (and scaremonger) because it's fun for you to see how us folk who believe in science react, or are you really so uneducated, misinformed and ignorant that you don't realise the websites you're using are anti-vaxx propaganda? The titers are looking for antibodies in your blood to that particular substance, in her case the varicella virus. If she has received the vaccine and titers don't show any antibodies it means her body didn't \"fight\" the infection, or create an immune response. It would most likely be some sort of deficiency in her immune system that didn't recognize the varicella vaccine and create the \"memory\" to fight the same virus later on, especially having received the vaccine multiple times. Someone like her would need to rely on herd immunity for this particular virus. You can't get shingles unless you've had chicken pox. If you were exposed to someone's weeping shingles sores you could get chicken pox. My mom thought I had chickenpox as a baby but my titer was negative so they gave me the vaccine as a teen. I was tested during my first pregnancy and it was negative again so I got another vaccine after baby was born but I still test as negative. I'll try another vaccine round after this baby (I walked in to an after hours clinic, it was kind of hard to find). So here I am pregnant without immunity (despite my best efforts). If I'm exposed to chickenpox I have to immediately be admitted and given a very expensive antibiotic. And there's still a 50% chance I'll die or the baby will die. It's terrifying. I hope people who don't vaccinate or delay or \"don't really mind chicken pox\" say far away from me. I know. I didn't want to bring up the other thread, but I really, really question it. Taking a break from my stressing about the hurricane hitting my city to say, wtf. You call out all these women for being \"santimommies\" but you were all about working moms have it harder blah blah. Your fingers type a lot of bullshit. There are worse things that could happen to your children than vaccine side effects. Seriously. They could um... I don't know... lose their *** house and all their belongings. Being in the position I am now has changed my life. And I would gladly deal with vaccine side effects. Aaannndd, I quit reading here. I literally LOL'ed at your pseudo science article. But this was cool. In regards to your Disneyland comment since people want a link war Spot on! I'd never heard of this Dr Paul before but he sounds like a quack. Of course there have been more reported cases of autism in recent years. It's not because of vaccinations, or medical side effects, it's because doctors and therapists have become better at diagnosing it. We know more about asd now than we ever have before, and that can only be a good thing. And sadly, it's already started to happen. There are places, such as CA, where antivaxx is becoming popular and many people are not vaccinating. Guess what's happening? Outbreaks are coming back. Diseases that were basically extinct are on a sharp rise. Babies are dying and being hospitalized. It's despicable She only picked that up because she has nothing else to say to all the great points you brought up. Deep down, she knows that you are right and she's wrong. She's just taking advantage of the fact that other people \"risk\" vaccines, so the odds of her child contracting a horrible deadly disease are rare. I said earlier, if everyone thought like she did and people just stopped vaccinating, all the antivaxxers would be rushing to the clinic once they saw babies suffering and dying from horrific diseases. When someone brings up the debunked autism/vaccine correlation as fact I feel utterly hopeless that this anti-vax movement will ever die. So maddening. Seriously, that's the ONE thing you picked out from my comment? Exactly! And it's a slap on the face to all parents who have children on the spectrum. Like, \"hey, if you would've followed this new, improved, delayed vaccine schedule your kid wouldn't have \"caught the autism\"!\" It's all a load of unnecessary crap!! First, I can honestly say I've never used the term \"fake news\" in my life. Instead of lame excuses, post your links and let us all form our own opinions. Of course I would be devastated if my child sustained a vaccine injury. Just like I would be devastated if my child had a side effect or allergy to any drug. But I can acknowledge the risks while understanding that the benefits outweigh them. I can't afford Disneyland. Question. Do you take your child anywhere in a car? Because there is infinite more risk of having a fatal car accident then a vaccine related death. Use a car seat? Yes? Oh, because you want them to be as safe as possible? It's proven that car seats can prevent death in the event of an accident. It's also proven that vaccines prevent death in the case of contracting a fatal preventable illness. How about letting them ride a bike? Because that could kill them too. They could get hit by a car or fall and hit their head. Walking down the street? A car could hit them. Would you take them on a plane? Carnival rides? Do you go to the doctor when they are sick and take prescribed medicines for illness? Would you take your MMR delayed child to Disneyland right now? See where I'm going with this? Stupid stupid stupid. Not vaccinating (or doing a 'delayed' schedule) is stupid. Period. And selfish. I was waiting on the \"vaccines cause autism\" *** to start spewing. You might be singing a different tune if you saw kids with polio. But you haven't. Why? Oh that's right. Because of vaccinations. Typos * kids * Dr Paul \"As tragic as they are\" Exactly if it was your child that was injured you might be singing a different tune. Nevertheless like I said my kid gets vaccines not that I need anyone on here approval for that. Google the results of Se Paul 'a clinic and the amount of children with new cases of autism since he began his schedule. No one is denying that vaccine injuries are a reality. But those injuries, as tragic as they are, don't outweigh the risk of non vaccinating, as an individual or as a society. That's because you don't have an article that isn't fearmongering. It doesn't matter what I would link you would pick it apart as if they were fake kids and fake news that real injuries occurred. Right, because the vaccines are supposed to protect against the common cold. I would be seething inside. It would be hard not to tell them how misinformed they are. I agree with everything you said, and I'm sorry that your dad is immuno-compromised. I'm so sick of the scaremongering and the \"resources\" - one of indygirl's links was vaccinesarebad.com or some such. (Sorry, don't want to scroll up to find it, it just struck me while I read through the posts). I mentioned the preemie thing mainly because so many anti vaxxers or people that delay the schedule do so because of fears for their premature children. My daughter was born at 37 weeks, but growth restricted (Nicu pedi said she seemed like a 34 weeker to him). Like I said even then, there wasn't a doubt in my mind that her vaccinations were still very necessary things. Exactly. It drives me bonkers. I recently saw a good friend of mine had I hadn't seen in months. She's antivaxx and I had sent her all of cinchi (spelling?) links and told her everything I know. When i saw her I asked if she had given ANY vaccines. She said \"no. And my son only has been sick once with a cold\". I was fuming inside with that remark, but I held my tongue because she's a good friend. My friend is a NICU nurse and treats micro-preemies from 23 weeks up. I asked her about vaccinations and she said that they try and give them the newborn one on or as close to their due date as possible as long as they aren't having any major issues. It's more important to try and get them vaccinated as soon as they're healthy enough to because their health it more at risk than your average term baby. She says occasionally they will spread out the vaccines (on a case by case basis), but they aim to keep them on schedule according to their due date. Unfortunately they have to ask parents not to bring younger nursery age siblings if they hear of outbreaks because even the common cold can be deadly to a 23/25/25 etc week baby who is already fighting for their little life. I can only imagine how horrible it must feel for a mm with a premie that beat all the odds to leave the hospital and then be put at risk because of ignorant, negligent parents thinking that the \"dangers\" of vaccines are more important than the dangers of preventable diseases. I've shared before on threads like this, my dad have myasthenia gravis and is immunocompromised. It's close to my heart because these ignorant parents could play a part in killing my dad. I cannot get behind parents that don't vaccinate, or that do so on an irresponsible delayed schedule when there is no medical need to do so. To me, there's no need to delay vaccines unless a child of yours (hen) has had a bad reaction in the past. People that delay from the outset are misled, and dangerous to their own children and to others. The only reason someone would choose to delay vaccinations for their first child that has never received vaccinations before (and therefore hasn't suffered an adverse effect), is because of fear mongering and anti-vaxx rhetoric. It needs to be stopped. Yes, your kid didn't have an adverse reaction but that's likely not because you delayed the schedule, it's because they likely wouldn't have had an adverse effect anyway. And this reinforces their ignorance and they do the same for the next child. All the while endangering other people's friends and families, as well as leaving their own child open to diseases. It's gross and I think parents should be charged with neglect for not providing their children with correct medical care. and then *we* become the sanctimommies. My daughter was a preemie. We nearly lost her three times her first week alone. It was never a question in my mind to delay or deny vaccinations because I knew she would need that protection. She's up to date and has been sick twice in her life, once with roseola, which lasted four days, and a cold, the only symptoms of which was a 101 fever that lasted three days. So yes, we can say on both sides 'oh my child was fine and rarely got sick'. The stats on whooping cough in CA freak me out because much of DH's family are there and anti vax. We didn't let his parents see our daughter until she was two months because they refused to get the tdap. That was fine, that was their choice, as was ours to deny their visit. As it happened, they got it and were able to see her when she was about six weeks old. Same rules will apply for this baby but we won't be travelling to CA with him until he's had at least one dtap. Not worth the risk, imo. You're not doing \"link wars\" because there are no links to back up your bullshit logic. That's why I'm not doing the link wars. That's fine That website also claims that avoiding fluoride will prevent Alzheimer's. I got as far as \"autism\" listed as a vaccine risk before I audibly sighed and rolled my eyes at the misinformation you are spreading, again. My BIL got shingles all the time and they offered his the vaccination at 41. Maybe your doctor can get you a waiver of some sort so you can get one. I'm not eligible because I'm so young. That's because there is no logic unfortunately I just don't understand the logic, but you're right, she did say that! I'm so sorry. It's so painful. Have you had the shingles vaccine? My outbreak was over 3 months ago so I'm eligible now and I have to stop putting it off. I don't know why they only recommend it to people over 60. I know many people who had their first outbreak much younger. It's excruciating at any age. She already stated she doesn't care to look at research, so you won't get an answer from her Can you get the vaccination? [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4657773/](//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4657773/) The results of this study: \"Our results suggest that in most cases, genetic or structural defects are the underlying cause of epilepsy with onset after vaccination, including both cases with preexistent encephalopathy or benign epilepsy with good outcome. \" [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC320893/](//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC320893/) This study focused on the risk of febrile and non-febrile seizures and the DTP and MMR vaccines. \"Neither vaccination was associated with an increased risk of nonfebrile seizures.\" \"There are significantly elevated risks of febrile seizures on the day of receipt of DTP vaccine and 8 to 14 days after the receipt of MMR vaccine, but these risks do not appear to be associated with any long-term, adverse consequences.\" I'm interested in some legitimate, peer-reviewed studies stating children are a significant risk of brain damage as a result of vaccinations. It comes and goes. I've had it on and off for 15 years. My MIL was offered the shingles vax and her insurance wouldn't cover it. It was several hundred dollars. The pharmacist also told her not to get it bc I was about a week away from having a baby. Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry :-(. A friend of mine had it last year and she was *miserable*. I hope you get through it soon! I don't know I don't start the threads. There are also kids who has seizures who resulted in permanent brain damage even though your son did not. Well, there IS a shingles vaccine though I think they don't recommend it until you turn 60 as that is when most develop shingles, but I'm with you. I did have chickenpox as a child and I feel like I'm on an if/when roulette wheel for shingles. I'm terrified of shingles. I've never had chicken pox and they will not give me the vaccine. I looked like a crazy lady at the pediatrician's office asking a million questions about whether or not I could get chicken pox from my son getting the shot. Why is this a debate every few days here?? Dr. Sears is a quack. Vaccines don't cause autism. There's no proof that the CDC schedule isn't safe. My son had a febrile seizure after vaccines - technically it isn't the vaccines fault, it's because of a fever - which could've been caused by the vaccine or any number of other viruses, bacteria, etc. Hell, he had another febrile seizure from strep throat. He still got all of his vaccines, but on a \"delayed\" schedule - meaning he only got 2 at a time, so if he needed 4 we went back 2 weeks later to get the others. His pediatrician and neurologist agreed this would be best since he was prone to high fevers with vaccinations. As I said in another one of these threads a few days ago, I'd take 100 more febrile seizures before I even thought about not letting him get vaccinated. He lived through his febrile seizures and eventually outgrew them - there's no \"outgrowing\" death as a result of not vaxxing. I have shingles. It pure misery. Agonizing. I don't know why anyone would risk that with their children. Hmm ignorant isn't a name it's actually an adjective. You're choosing to ignore facts. \"Chickenpox never bothered me I got to stay home from school and watch tv.\" Complications from chickenpox can include: -Bacterial infections of the skin, soft tissues, bones, joints or bloodstream (sepsis) -Dehydration. -Pneumonia. -Inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) -Toxic shock syndrome. -Reye's syndrome for people who take aspirin during chickenpox. But ignoring immediate complications from chickenpox, what about shingles? 1 in 3 people who've had chickenpox will develop shingles. [http://www.webmd.com/vaccines/features/shingles-chickenpox](//www.webmd.com/vaccines/features/shingles-chickenpox) People who get shingles can expect 2-4 weeks (if you're lucky. Some cases can last for months) of nerve pain, burning, itching, oozing, [http://www.healthline.com/health/shingles-pictures?tre=false#8](//www.healthline.com/health/shingles-pictures?tre=false#8) Complications from shingles can include: -Postherpetic neuralgia. For some people, shingles pain continues long after the blisters have cleared. This condition is known as postherpetic neuralgia, and it occurs when damaged nerve fibers send confused and exaggerated messages of pain from your skin to your brain. -Vision loss. Shingles in or around an eye (ophthalmic shingles) can cause painful eye infections that may result in vision loss. -Neurological problems. Depending on which nerves are affected, shingles can cause an inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), facial paralysis, or hearing or balance problems. -Skin infections. If shingles blisters aren't properly treated, bacterial skin infections may develop.

Have a blessed day. If everyone decided to stop vaccinating, and we had outbreaks of all of these deadly diseases and babies all around were dying, I'd bet all of these antivaxxers would change their minds and be racing to a clinic. They don't vaccinate because they don't want to take a slight chance that their baby might have a reaction, and since everyone else does give vaccines, they have nothing to worry about. It's selfish and they are taking advantages of herd immunity. Ahhhh, the American dream. Exactly. You're ignorant. And choosing to be that way. Did you not see that in 1964 2,000 babies DIED from rubella and it causes 11,000 miscarriages? In 1921 15,000 people died from diphtheria? That's also a significant amount for what the population total was back then I don't revolve my life around what people across the world are able to do. I'm not playing the link wars. If it means I'm privileged to have a choice then praise be to God for blessing me in that aspect of life. \"Before the middle of the last century, diseases like whooping cough, polio, measles, Haemophilus influenzae, and rubella struck hundreds of thousands of infants, children and adults in the U.S.. Thousands died every year from them. As vaccines were developed and became widely used, rates of these diseases declined until today most of them are nearly gone from our country. Nearly everyone in the U.S. got measles before there was a vaccine, and hundreds died from it each year. Today, most doctors have never seen a case of measles. More than 15,000 Americans died from diphtheria in 1921, before there was a vaccine. Only two cases of diphtheria have been reported to CDC between 2004 and 2014. An epidemic of rubella (German measles) in 1964-65 infected 12\u00bd million Americans, killed 2,000 babies, and caused 11,000 miscarriages. Since 2012, 15 cases of rubella were reported to CDC.\" Agreed. It is so gross that in a first world country people would not take advantage of every little thing they could that keeps their children healthy and safe. I don't get it. Preach! [https://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2015/02/04/measles-is-just-the-start-whooping-cough-outbreaks-are-on-the-rise-too/#7815a38d5566](//www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2015/02/04/measles-is-just-the-start-whooping-cough-outbreaks-are-on-the-rise-too/#7815a38d5566) That's the link to my above post. There are women and children in third world countries that would do anything to be able to get vaccines. All of this antivaxx nonsense is basically a slap in the face to them. Your privilege is showing, and yes I mean PRIVILEGE. You want to know why they would cut off their right arm to get their children vaccinated, while some ignorant fools refuse them in this country? Because in the US, and other first world countries, we have the PRIVILEGE of not seeing children around us everywhere sick and dying, from vaccine preventable illnesses! California's battling the worst epidemic in 70 years. Public health officials are warning of unprecedented outbreaks in other states, and stressing the need for vaccination. Am I describing the measles outbreak? No \u2014 whooping cough. Whooping cough, known clinically as pertussis, is a highly contagious disease that's transmitted by \"close contact,\" which is often sneezing or coughing. (The basic reproduction number is between 12 and 17, which is much more contagious than Ebola and about on par with measles.) Pertussis, known for an explosive cough so violent it can break a person's rib or cause the person to vomit or pass out, had appeared to be on the way out in this country in 1976, the disease's low ebb. There were just 1,010 cases \u2014 far below the 100,000 typical in the 1940s. The disease was vanishing under the assault of childhood vaccinations. Not anymore. The year Camille got pertussis [2012], Wisconsin alone recorded 6,462 cases. The national total was 48,277. In recent weeks, there have been a half-dozen pertussis outbreaks across the country, from Michigan to Washington State. And Nebraska's been especially hard-hit. \"There were more than 200 whooping cough cases in January,\" Dr. Joseph Acierno, Chief Medical Officer and Director of Public Health for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, said this week. \"[That's] higher than some of our total case numbers for previous years and that's concerning.\" And unlike measles, which can kill, these whooping cough outbreaks already have. One infant died in California several weeks ago. Another newborn passed away in Kansas. In both cases, the children were too young to receive the pertussis vaccine; they were depending on herd immunity. To be sure, there are a few other reasons why the whooping cough outbreak differs from the resurgence of measles. For one, Americans have shifted to a newer, safer vaccine for whooping cough, but it appears to provide less protection. The pertussis bacteria also may have mutated. But if vaccination opt-out rates continue to rise for preventable diseases like pertussis (and measles), then that makes things riskier for everyone, and helps the disease catch hold. Also See: Seven Strategies To Encourage Vaccination Rates To Rise In Wisconsin, Johnson and Fauver note that exemptions for pertussis vaccination more than doubled between 2000 and 2013 \u2014 from 2.3% of K-12 students to about 5%. And experts stress that vaccine opt-outs also are at the roots of California's terrible whooping cough epidemic, which is the state's worst outbreak since World War II. \"We had a lot of unvaccinated children that acted as the kindling to start an outbreak,\" Dr. Paul Katz, a pediatrician at Kaiser Permanente, told NPR's April Dembosky. \"Those children were able to infect all the other children who were vaccinated but were too early for a booster -- they became the rest of the wood to start the fire.\" I want to highlight a few things. Whooping cough had been almost eliminated, at only about 1,000 cases a year. It increased to over 48k nationwide! In the 1940s there were about 100,000 cases a year. The article highlighted two cases of infants who died from it, because they were too young to be vaccinated and they were dependent upon herd immunity. Let this sink in, \"And experts stress that vaccine opt-outs also are at the roots of California's terrible whooping cough epidemic, which is the state's worst outbreak since World War II.\" What does it have to do with questioning the CDC? How are people who follow the vaccine schedule not questioning the CDC and how exactly are you questioning the CDC by making up your own logic? You aren't. But you are justifying your uneducated logic by pretending you are the only one without smoke in your eyes. Stating that there can be side effects to a medication is not new or novel information. It is not proving anything. It is not indicating that you are more informed. It just means you discovered a fact about medicine and don't understand risk vs. benefit. \"Someone had a seizure once so vaccines are dangerous!!!\" So does that mean you don't ride in cars because someone had an accident once? You won't get surgery to remove your appendix if it ruptures because there is a risk to anesthesia? You won't use antibiotics because someone had an allergy once? You aren't smarter than everyone and some rebel questioning the big bad CDC. You are reading something without being able to think critically about it, understand it, or interpret it and then get upset when someone points out the faults in your thought process. What I don't get about this, is people claim to make these decisions because they are interested in doing the best for their children. But when someone shows you that you are incorrect, it's not about being informed for you. It's about being right and ignoring facts. How is that looking out for your child's best interest when you don't allow yourself to be open to all information? There is no evidence that delayed schedule has any benefit and no evidence the current schedule is dangerous. And the schedule does not change anything about side effect profiles. If you want anecdotal evidence (which apparently means more than science), look around. Do you see people dying or being maimed by polio? You were vaccinated, as were most people whose parents did the right thing. They are ok and didn't have seizures and they didn't have side effects. They do get the MMR on delayed schedule just not till a few years later. \"And a lot don't\" So you're comfortable taking that chance with your child? That they may or may not die if they get measles just because you felt like it wasn't necessary to vaccinate them? And a lot don't. Chickenpox never bothered me I got to stay home from school and watch tv. It's just another one of those to question why is yet another being added. Being on a delayed schedule is not anti vax. It's just against giving so many at once and only getting those that are most necessary. That are very rare and may not be related to the vaccine at all. All events, related or unrelated, that occur within a certain time period are listed as side effects. The percentage of reactions is quite small in the population. Studies showing the safety and efficacy of vaccines are not limited to the CDC. They are also found the world over. The evidence for vaccines is overwhelming. Lots of kids die every year from measles. And call me crazy but I'm sure my child would rather not go thru the misery of chicken pox, hence the whole shot thing. You don't die from every disease that you could encounter. Both my parents had the measles. Pretty sure we all had the chickenpox. Scare rhetoric? No, actual real life events that have occurred. \"Don't blindly follow the CDC!\" \"Look at the vaccine injuries!\" \"Look at the scary side effects!\" These are all antivaxx rhetoric that is used to scare parents into ignoring all of the studies and research that prove the efficacy and safety of the vaccines and schedule. Saying you followed a delayed schedule and the kids are fine, perhaps is because like PP said, the other kids they're around probably got the shots they needed when they were supposed to. And if your child WAS infact exposed to something they should have been vaccinated for and weren't, they might and gotten sick and died. I don't see how you can avoid or deny that. Their getting the vaccine later than recommended leaves your child more vulnerable to diseases longer. That's the threat. My first post was in response to your post stating that your children are doing great on a delayed plan. I'm simply stating that mine did NOT follow a delayed plan and are ALSO fine. Because vaccines don't cause autism, even if you give them on the recommended schedule. Why do we have to keep having this argument like three times a week here?? It's so frustrating! No matter what facts I tell you about the number of children who have had Vaccine injuries you could care less cause you are so brainwashed into never questioning the CDC. If you actually researched the delayed schedule they get that vaccine so relax There's scientific facts that state too much water can kill you and yet we still need it. There's always going to be a risk for something. Usually the benefits outweigh the risk and that's why the medical field recommends it. I just feel like no matter what facts we tell you, you find unreliable sources and go with what they say. Makes total sense. If your kids are following a delayed schedule, then what you can do right now is say thank you to all the other people in you community who follow the CDC schedule and protect you and your children from your anecdotal stupidity. There's \"scientific facts\" that prove that cough medicine can be fatal. There's \"scientific facts \"that drinking certain kinds of alcohol can prolong your life. There's \"scientific facts\" that lead is safe for human consumption. But what you're ignoring here is PROBABILITY. And your ignorance of probability is why you're getting schooled by all the women on here who don't want their children dying of pertussis from YOUR ignorance. My kids are following a delayed schedule and have never had a single issue....so there's that. The thread was asking for mothers with personal experiences in Dr Sears schedule not everyone give me your sanctimonious opinion on the idea of them. There is scientific facts that prove certain vaccines can result in seizures. So stop acting like I'm just forming some opinion and am ignorant to everything. I'm not going to go to my pediatrician and say you know what some moms on the Internet told me I shouldn't be following a delayed schedule so let's go ahead do what they say. I see it every day on the TAVS page. They interpret things to match their agenda and reaffirm their thought processes. My son has received all his vaccines on the CDC schedule and has also never had a single issue (not even sleepiness!). So there's that... I'll interject here to say that, while there certainly are doctors who advocate for delayed vaccination schedules or even are antivaxx, I think that's probably not what's going on here. I'm not a doctor, but I'm an NP, and I'm always amazed at how people hear what they want to hear from me. I once had a patient who told me she Smoked marijuana. I told her my concerns and thanked her for being honest with me about it. I got notes back from a specialist she also sees, and apparently she had told him that I had given her the ok to smoke marijuana. People are going to twist their doctor's words into an affirmation to continue doing what they wanted to do anyway a lot of the time. If you brought your child to the doctor with some sort of illness, and she/he said \"I'm sending over a script for X. Your child should be feeling better within 2-3 days\". What would you do? Would you research that particular medicine, searching the Internet for all possible side effects, reading research studies done and the effects the medicine had on rats, looking for any story of some child who had a reaction to it, etc. Or, would you just pick up the medicine and give it to your child? Every. Single. Medication. Has possible side effects. Do you read the fine print? \"May cause seizures, stomach ulcers, heart attack, stroke, or sometimes fatal reactions\". Most medications include some, if not all, of them. Does that mean you wouldn't give it to your child? Vaccines are the same way. Very rarely, a child may have some sort of reaction to a vaccine. Does that mean we shouldn't vaccinate our children? My friends baby ate apples for the first time and basically went into anaphylactic shock. Does that mean I shouldn't ever give my baby apples? It's not derailing the discussion. You don't take scientific research and evidence and would instead take to fear mongering and opinion pieces along with discredited research written by disbarred drs. Presenting you with scientific facts is not derailing the thread. Scientific facts and research was presented in the first response, long before your misguided opinion appeared. Apparently we do I'm not trying to debate anything people need to stop constantly derailing threads. The OP asked for personal experiences which I had so I shared. She didn't ask for people to try and school her on vaccines as if y'all know something her or I don't. This is where you are wrong and have faulty logic and obviously a poor understanding of what you are trying to debate. A side effect of a medication that someone else has doesn't deter me at all. Someone else can have an anaphylactic reaction to an antibiotic and if I needed that antibiotic I would take it with no hesitation. Everything in medicine has side effects. Vaccines are no exception. The rare exception doesn't mean they don't work or shouldn't be taken. I am more scared of the diseases than I am of a rare side effect. If my child had a rare side effect or reaction I would discuss with my pediatrician the best way to proceed with that child and any future children. I wouldn't become anti vaccine. I had an allergic reaction to an antibiotic once. I didn't start a campaign to keep everyone in the country from using that medicine. What are you even talking about? It makes no sense. If you would actually read through the links I listed it gives specific cases of infants dying and other various vaccine injuries. This isn't personal opinion that is based off of incidents that have occurred. If you saw your friend take a pill and said here take this then watched her die...you wouldn't want to take that pill now would you. The Supreme Court itself has ruled that vaccines are unavoidably unsafe. Again that's not my opinion. Personal opinion or belief have no place in science. It's about scientific method and practices can change as research changes our understanding of a topic. But just believing whatever you want because you feel it's your right to have a personal opinion is nonsense. I believe we are all capable of having different beliefs regarding the situation? I don't appreciate you calling it a stupid decision but that's your opinion. Just as in that thread plenty of women questioned the American pregnancy association. But it's a deadly sin to question the CDC. As I stated before I'm not interested in any link wars or justification. But I can understand you calling me out on that it's understandable. But as I said we don't all apply the same logic to every situation of our lives. *nor am I. Not am I. Which is why I stick to reputable sources. I have looked for a reputable site that shares your concern about hep B. I couldn't find one. We can go back and forth with articles all day long...ones that defend CDC, ones that support delayed or even anti vax. I'm not interested in doing that. This article is complete fear mongering nonsense. Do you have a reputable link (backed by peer reviewed scientific research) that raises concerns about the hep B shot? It's scary that people read these articles and take them for fact. Definitely a reputable source, since it says it causes Autism and all. I think some doctors have agreed to a delayed schedule in order to compromise with those who would not otherwise vaccinate at all. This is different than a doctor actually believing a delayed schedule or skipping certain vaccines is beneficial. Perhaps your doctor is one of these. (Though her hep B comment is scary and would make me question her abilities.) But vaccinating is a major decision with lifetime ramifications for your kids and others. In light of all the research that disagrees with your doctor, a second opinion would be wise. I am very glad you are vaccinating at all, of course. The fact that your doctor doesn't understand how you contract hep b is what worries me. This is basic science and she does t get it so I wouldn't trust her for anything. It's not silly and you can't make a blanket statement \"no board certified doctor would say that\" because why the hell would I lie and say she did? Hep B is a newer vax and you should research some families bad experiences with getting it. The OP just wants to know mother's experiences with alt schedule she didn't ask for people's sanctimonious herd immunity is the best thing ever advice. We can't even argue with people like that. They will believe what they want to believe, and they will never change their minds. One of my closest friends is refusing to vaccinate, he's 11 months. I sent her all of the links posted above and told her everything that I know. She insisted that vaccines cause autism and would not listen to anything I had to say. I recently saw her after not seeing her for months. I asked her if she ever vaccinated at all, she said \"no. And he's never been sick except for one cold\". I couldn't even. Yeah, no. That's a careless response. That's borderline negligent. You can get hep b from anywhere blood or saliva is, not just from you. That's a silly comment and the fact that your doctor said it would make me get a new doctor. Good grief---do you see a \"holistic\" doctor or what? No board certified doctor would agree to this. My pediatrician asked if I was Hep B positive and I said no and she said ok we don't need to do it. She is board certified and an amazing doctor. I will listen to her to know if I am doing the right thing. Are you a doctor? I listen to my doctor who is perfectly fine with my decision and other doctors. There are numerous reasons to delay you can choose to not believe them and close your eyes to any contradictory information that doesn't fit the herd agenda. Seriously, unless the child in question has had a vaccine reaction herself, there is absolutely no reason to delay vaccines. Except the mother, who read a ton of misinformation and let antivaxxers scare her. Out of curiosity, I clicked on the first link. I made it this far: \"You could choose to delay the first shots until one year old to reduce the number of shots. For instance, pertussis is not fatal in children over one year old, so if you waited till your child was over one, you wouldn't require the pertussis vaccine.\" I can't even put into words how incredibly flawed this logic is. I believe that this paragraph speaks pretty well for itself. Op: Please speak to your child's pediatrician. Believe it or not, he or she is knowledgeable on the subject. The fact that most pediatricians have children themselves, who they also vaccinate, speaks volumes. Well the link I posted was very long and full of several side links but this was one of them [http://www.vaccineriskawareness.com/Infant-Mortality-Rates-Fall-Where-Immunisation-Rates-Are-Low](//www.vaccineriskawareness.com/Infant-Mortality-Rates-Fall-Where-Immunisation-Rates-Are-Low) \"Did you read all the Vaccine injuries listed in the link I posted? I am comfortable with my decision and so is my doctor.\" What are you referring to specifically here? Is that the link with the list of studies? Are you referring to a certain study in particular? Did you read all the Vaccine injuries listed in the link I posted? I am comfortable with my decision and so is my doctor. The only thing you've done by following alternative schedules is exposed your child to illnesses longer. There is no evidence that these alternative schedules do anything but leave children more vulnerable for longer. The only reason those schedules exist was because people thought vaccines cause autism, which has been found to be untrue. She didn't ask for a debate just wanted to know personal experiences. But if you would like to know some of the rationale as to why some people choose this you can read the links I posted above and listen to the podcast of Dr Paul. Just curious as to your reasoning? I genuinely cannot wrap my mind around the decision to follow one of these plans, so I'm curious to hear your rationale if you're willing to share. My kids' doctor is a paediatrician, so I'm pretty sure he likes kids being healthy, and he went to school to study medicine, and he has years of practical experience treating children and preventing disease. So I trust his schedule. Dr Sears....? Nope nope nope. Still, I'll admit it's at least better than not vaxxing, I'll grant you that. No! I follow what MY children's pediatrician and our public health nurses recommend. Because they don't want my kids getting sick. Thanks to Kardu for posting links. Other than for medical necessity, I just can't understand why the *** someone wouldn't vaccinate their kids. It's disgraceful and negligent. I'm not saying that it wouldn't absolutely suck if your (general) child had a reaction to a vaccine, because it would. But I would feel better about them reacting negatively to me trying to protect them versus them becoming ill, possibly dying, because I never tried, because I wore ear muffs to scientific research and because I thought mommy bloggers and google knew better. Try explaining that to your child.
