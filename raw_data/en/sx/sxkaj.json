Vaccines ca n cause severe injuries such as seizures, death, anaphylaxis, brain damage and other reac tions. The type and severity of reactions may vary from vaccine to vaccine and child to child. The effects of a v accine injury may be temporary or permanent. If you notice any changes in your child's condition after receiving a v accine, you should contact your doctor immediately or go to a hospital. Vaccines have never been proven to be safe or effective and your child may contract the disease even if he is vaccinated. What has been proven is that yo u can get the disease from the vaccine or from coming into contact with a recently vaccinated person. The polio vaccine is just one example. It is a known fact that most healthcare providers do not fully inform patients of the side effects a vaccine can have on the body, brain and immune system. Because of the highly toxic ingredients all vaccines contain, you should thoroughly research vaccines for yourself before making such an important decision. DO NOT allow someone else, even your healthcare provider, scare or force you into making this decision without being fully informed. Many healthcare providers have not researched vaccine history or toxicology and are not fully informed. Always provide a detailed history of your child's health to your doctor. Make sure they know of allergies, neurological problems, nutritional deficiencies, any imm une system disorder and skin diseases such as eczema. Most physicians and nurses do not warn pa rents that if their child's health is compromised in any way, such as having a common cold or previous reaction to a vaccine, they should not receive vaccines. Benefits of Non-Vaccination When you choose to not vaccinate your child, you have the responsibility to educate yourself on how to maintain the well-being of not only their body but also their mind and spirit as well. Childhood diseases can result in minor symptoms to severe complication or death depending on the child's immune system and treatment protocols followed. The stronger the immune system, the less severe are the symptoms of the disease. A child that goes through the full expression of the disease (i.e. feve r and skin eruptions, without suppressing any of these symptoms) usually acquires immunity from that disease for life. Good nutrition and cleanliness play a major role. The risk of contracting various diseases can vary over time or locality. Symptoms or complications of these diseases may be treatable by alternative methods or ma y resolve without treatment. Educate yourself on childhood diseases from informed alternative sources. Fear of these diseases comes from not being properly informed. For More Information To make a truly informed decision there are numero us sources of information on the risks of vaccines and the risks and benefits of childhood diseases. Sources of informa tion to determine if the ri sks associated with vaccines outweigh any perceived benefits include: vaccine package inserts, the Physicians Desk Reference, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, public and medical lib raries or state and local health agencies. (NOTE: These sources do not give complete and total information on vaccine ingredients and their toxicity, nor do they provide accurate statistics.) Vaccination Liberation - www.vaclib.org or (888) 249-1421 National Vaccine Information Center - www.909shot.com or (800) 909-SHOT / (703) 938-0324 (NOTE: The two websites above, Vaccination Liberation and the National Vaccine Information Center, have proven to be excellent sources for extensive vaccine information.) Reporting Reactions If you do decide to vaccinate, report vaccine reactio ns to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (800) 822-7969. Always get the vaccine name, vaccine manufact urer and lot number. Keep records of day to day reactions from the time of vaccination for at least 6 mont hs to 2 years, no matter how slight the reactions. Long- term effects of vaccines have not been well documented by the allopathic community and are just now being researched. If your child has been injured by a vaccine , he may be eligible for compensation under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Page 2 of 2 Revised 9/03 Source: Vaccination Liberation, P.O.
