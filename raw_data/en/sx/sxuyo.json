Escalation Strategies in the ... Neurology International Open 2018; 2: E56-E59ReviewIntroduction Most myasthenia gravis (MG) patients are sufficiently treated with expanded standard therapy; 10 to 15 % of cases are therapy-refrac- tory. Such situations are very stressful for patients and represent a major challenge in the treatment of myasthenia gravis. There is to date no generally-accepted definition of therapy-refractory myas - thenia gravis. It is broadly accepted that these are generalized courses of the disease which despite (expanded) standard therapy consisting of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, steroids and usually at least two steroid-sparing long-term immunosuppressants in suf - ficient dose and duration exhibit moderate to severe functional im - pairment (see German article by Urban et al., Therapiestandards und individualisierte Therapie bei der Myasthenia gravis (English: Therapeutic Standards and individualized Therapy for Myasthenia Gravis)) [1]. Current international consensus guidelines recom - mend treating treatment-refractory MG cases in specialized centers with sufficient expertise, as well as therapy escalation with regular IVIg administration, plasmapheresis or immunoadsorption at in - tervals [1]. These procedures are approved for the treatment of myasthenic crisis in Germany; IVIg is also approved for off-label use in cases of severe exacerbation (refer to German article by Janzen R., Janzen Myasthenic Syndrome and congenital myasthenic Syndromes)), but not for interval ther- apy (refer to German article by Schroeder et. al. 2017, Myasthenie - Exazerbation und Krise (English: Myasthenia - Exacerbation and Crisis)). Repeated use of these procedures as escalation therapy is likewise considered a feature of refractory courses of the disease. Serious side effects and clinically relevant contraindications of standard therapeutics must also be taken into account (see infor- mation box). Therapy-refractory MG patients are more likely to be female, younger (25 to 50 years), thymoma-associated, or an - ti-MuSK-positive. This article provides an overview of reserve drugs used as well as ongoing intervention studies for the treatment of refractory MG. On the one hand, the evaluation of these drugs must take into ac-count that the majority of MG patients can be treated satisfactori - ly with (expanded) standard therapy, despite the fact that the avail - able data is insufficient even for the approved drugs prednisone, prednisolone, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil (the latter used off-label in the case of ineffectiveness or intolerance of aza - thioprine therapy) (refer to article by Urban et al., Op. cit.). On the other hand, the reserve drugs discussed below have been primar- ily used in therapy-refractory MG patients, so that it can only be as -Hoffmann Sarah, Meisel Andreas.

Neurology International Open 2018; 00: 00-00 Escalation Strategies in the Treatment of Refractory Myasthenia Gravis Authors Sarah Hoffmann1, 2, Andreas f\u00fcr Neurologie, Charit\u00e9 - Stuttgart \u00b7 Hoffmann sarah.hoffmann@charite.de Abstr Act Among all patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), 10 to 15 % are considered to be refractory to (expanded) standard treat - ments. Current international consensus guidelines for the man - agement of myasthenia gravis recommend referral of refrac - tory MG patients to centers with expertise in the treatment of MG and chronic intravenous immunoglobulin therapy or plas - mapheresis. Here we briefly summarize current approaches to overcome refractory myasthenia gravis. E56 Hoffmann S, Meisel A. Escalation Strategies in the ... Neurology International Open 2018; 2: E56-E59sumed that their effectiveness in non-treatment-resistant MG pa - tients is at least as good as that of refractory patients. Rituximab The monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab has been in off-la - bel use in the treatment of MG for several years. The rationale for this therapy is the elimination of B lymphocytes, the progenitor cells of antibody-producing plasma cells. To date, there are a num - ber of case series and uncontrolled studies indicating positive ef - fects in MG patients who are refractory to standard medications [2, 3]. Although positive effects have primarily been described in anti-MuSK-positive patients, it is becoming increasingly clear that this is also true for anti-AChR-positive as well as seronegative MG patients (with absent evidence of antibodies) [4]. Two systematic reviews on the use of rituximab in refractory MG cases report a re - sponse rate of 83.9 % and 44 %, respectively [2, 4]. Although Iorio et al. found comparable response rates independent of antibody status [4], Tandan et al. reported significantly higher response rates among MuSK-positive compared to AchR Ab-positive patients (72 % vs. 30 %) [2]. Currently, one Phase II and one Phase III trial on the effect of rituximabin MG are ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02110706, NCT02950155). At this time, two different thera - py regimes are being used: 1. Administration of 2 \u00d7 1000 mg absolute dose at a 14-day inter- val or 2. Weekly administration of 375 mg/m2 body surface for 4 succes - sive weeks Each regimes is continued by follow-up doses at an interval of approx. 6 months. It is unclear how often the therapy should be re - peated. Current data indicate that this therapy should be per-formed at least three times [5]. In addition, immune markers (e. g., regulatory B cells, memory B cells) are increasingly being investi - gated for guiding therapy [6]. On the whole, Rituximab has a fa - vorable side effect profile [4]. However, 2 cases of progressive mul - tifocal leukoencephalopathy in MG patients during described [7, 8]. Eculizumab Eculizumab a monoclonal antibody directed against complement factor C5. Eculizumab is approved for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and has also been used successfully in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome [9]. The complement system plays an important role in the AChR antibody-induced destruction mechanism of the neuromuscular junction. This involvement of the complement system depends on the IgG subtype; the AChR anti - body belongs to the IgG1 subtype, while the anti-MuSK is an IgG4 antibody subtype in which the complement system plays no role. Based on these pathophysiological considerations, eculizumab was tested in 14 treatment-refractory anti-AChR-positive MG patients in an investigator-initiated, randomized, double-blind, place - bo-controlled, cross-over Phase II study. Compared to placebo, there was a significant improvement in the quantitative myasthe - nia gravis score (QMG) of patients [10]. The subsequent manufacturer-sponsored, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III (REGAIN) study on the use of eculizum - ab in refractory anti-AchR-positive MG patients enrolled 126 pa - tients NCT01997229). As primary end-point, the MG-ADL score (myasthenia-specific score for daily living activity) was examined using the worst-rank method, which was missed with a p-value of 0.0698. The secondary endpoints (such as QMG, MG-QOL) were significantly improved in the worst-rank pro - cedure, as well as responder analyses and sensitivity analyses [11]. There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to side effects. Based on the available data, the European Commission approved the use of eculizumab in refractory general - the induction phase (weeks 1-4) at a dose of 900 mg weekly, in the maintenance phase (from week 5) at a dose of 1200 mg every 2 weeks. A decision to continue therapy should be made based on an evaluation after 6 and no later than 12 weeks of treatment of whether a significant improvement in the Quanti - tative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) Score as well as daily activity (My-asthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living, MG-ADL) was achieved. Similar to other immunosuppressants used for MG, it is currently unclear how long eculizumab should be administered. In the course of the REGAIN study, eculizumab was given for 26 weeks. The study participants had the opportunity to continue treatment as part of a currently ongoing open label extension study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02301624). In the prior Phase II cross-over study, pa - tients initially treated with eculizumab experienced worsening of the symptoms during the placebo study phase without reaching baseline QMG scores. This might indicate a longer duration of ecu- lizumab effectiveness and may justify an attempt to discontinue therapy, which should be performed after about 12 months; ther- apy should be continued if the symptoms worsen significantly. By consensus, the medical advisory board of the German Myasthenia gravis Society recently presented concrete recommendations for the definition of therapy-refractory generalized myasthenia gravis as well as the indication and proceedings for therapy with eculizum - ab [12]. Since life-threatening and fatal meningococcal infections have occurred in connection with eculizumab therapy, patients must be vaccinated against meningococci prior to treatment (as was done in the studies mentioned above). For medical reasons, the indication for therapy must be assessed very carefully. This includes the weighing of the individual therapy of severely affected MG pa - tients against the very high treatment costs of eculizumab.

Escalation Strategies in the ... Neurology International Open 2018; 2: E56-E59ReviewHigh-dose Cyclophosphamide and Stem Cell Therapy High-dose cyclophosphamide therapy has been used since the 1960s in the treatment of MG. Several case series as well as a ran - domized, double-blind study with 23 patients show positive effects in the treatment of refractory cases [13-16]. Current internation - al consensus guidelines likewise recommend the use of cyclophos - phamide for the treatment of refractory MG cases [1]. However, data from long-term observations also show a high rate of compli - cations of immune ablative therapy [17]. Therefore, this therapy is reserved for the most severely affected refractory MG cases and only after the above-mentioned therapies have been exhausted. Autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) should likewise be used as a last resort due to the relatively high mortality rate of 6-8 %. Autologous SCT in refractory MG patients has been repeat- edly performed successfully; a potential cure of MG is discussed in a recent case series of 7 patients with complete remission after au- tologous SCT [18]. However, this was a retrospective case collec- tion and none of the patients had previously been treated with rituximab or eculizumab. In this regard, it is interesting to note that AChR antibodies have been detected in up to 20 % of allogenic stem cell transplanted patients due to other indications [19], although only few of them develop myasthenic symptoms [20]. Outlook There are currently several immunosuppressive or immunomodu - latory drugs in different clinical study phases, the mechanisms of action are summarized in table 1 . Apart from the belimumab study, all studies are still in progress. Based on the available study registry information on the primary endpoint and the secondary endpoints, belimumab is not effective in the treatment of refrac - toryMG.SuMMAry Both nationally and internationally, rituximab has increas - ingly been used in the treatment of refractory myasthenia gravis. The experience in myasthenia centers corresponds to the results in the literature, i. e., refractory MG patients with AChR antibodies, MuSK antibodies as well as seroneg - ative patients improve under this therapy. However, suffi- ciently supporting study evidence is missing so far. Such ev - idence is now available for eculizumab, which has led to its approval for patients with anti-AChR-positive generalized refractory myasthenia gravis. Neither high-dose cyclophos - phamide nor stem cell therapy play a role in the German medical care system; due to the very unfavorable side effect profile these therapies should be reserved for the extreme - ly rare MG cases that do no respond to the above-mentioned therapies.
