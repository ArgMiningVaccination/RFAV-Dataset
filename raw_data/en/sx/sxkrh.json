Naturopaths believe that the human body has a strong and natural healing ability which can be used to fight against most diseases. The six basic principles of naturopathic treatment are as follows: - Facilitate and augment the body's self-healing process - Identify and treat the cause rather than the symptoms - At no point should any naturopathic treatment cause any harm to the patient - Educate the patients an encourage them to take responsibility of their health - Aim to treat the entire being of the patient - Whenever possible, prevent the disease rather than curing it Naturopathy and Cancer or Naturopathic Oncology There is no evidence that naturopathy alone can treat Cancer. However, most Naturopathic Oncology providers use naturopathic principles and treatment to provide supportive therapy services. Some benefits offered are: - Regulation of metabolism and Digestion during the Cancer treatment - Management of side-effects like nausea, fatigue, etc. Some treatment options suggested by naturopaths to Cancer patients are: - Herbal and botanical preparations - Dietary supplements - Homeopathic remedies - Physical therapy (including exercise, massage, etc.) - Hydrotherapy - Lifestyle counseling - Acupuncture - Chiropractic care It is important to note that you must opt for Naturopathy along with another form of treatment. Find a Naturopath who has experience in dealing with Cancer patients and discuss with your doctor before you start any therapy.
