OSTROWSKY PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER RWJBARNABAS HEALTHHEALTH NEWS RECOGNITION FOR TOP-NOTCH BARIATRIC SURGERY Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) has been recognized by Healthgrades for having superior patient outcomes in bariatric surgery. It's among the top 5 percent in the nation for this procedure. The hospital is the only one in central and southern New Jersey to receive this distinction two years in a row. A GENEROUS GIFT In February, Spirit Halloween, the largest seasonal Halloween retailer, donated $89,000 to support the Child Life Program at The Bristol-Myers Squibb Children's Hospital (BMSCH) at RWJUH. Over the years, the program has donated nearly $700,000 to BMSCH. The funding has enabled the Child Life Department to purchase much- needed toys and supplies and hire a child-life specialist in BMSCH's pediatric surgical suite. It has also helped make the hospital's annual Halloween celebrations possible. A BEST MATERNITY CARE HOSPITAL RWJUH was named to Newsweek 's 2021 list of Best Maternity Care Hospitals. The distinction recognizes hospitals that have provided exceptional care to mothers, newborns and their families, as verified by the 2020 Leapfrog Hospital Survey. RWJUH delivers more than 2,500 babies annually in its designated Regional Perinatal Center, which provides the highest level of maternal and neonatal care. A MESSAGE FROM LEADERSHIP Let's Beat COVID-19 The development of COVID-19 vaccines is one of the greatest achievements in medical science. At RWJBarnabas Health, we're proud to be a key part of the effort to get the vaccine into the arms of all eligible people in New Jersey. We also remain committed to fighting the spread of the disease. That's why we join with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in urging everyone, whether vaccinated or not, to continue with the simple precautions we know are effective in preventing the spread of the coronavirus: Wear a mask. Stay at least six feet apart from people who don't live with you and avoid crowds. Wash your hands thoroughly and often; use a hand sanitizer if soap and water aren't available. The reason for this continued caution: In some cases, COVID-19 vaccines may protect against severe infection, but may not necessarily prevent mild or asymptomatic infection. If this is the case, an infected person could still spread the virus. We are proud to be a part of the vaccination effort. Back in December, Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital was one of six hospitals in New Jersey to receive and administer the first doses of COVID-19 vaccine to our frontline healthcare heroes. Since then, we have administered thousands of doses at our vaccine clinic. We helped the state open the vaccine mega-site in Edison, which is now vaccinating thousands of Middlesex County residents weekly. Our commitment to this effort will extend for as long as it takes to end the pandemic. It will take all of us working together as a community to minimize the ongoing effects of COVID-19. Together, we can protect friends, family and neighbors and end this pandemic. Yours in good health, @RWJUH @RWJUH RWJBarnabas Health Healthy Together | 2 | Spring 2021 RWJUHNB_Memo_Spring21_Final.indd 2 3/17/21 9:20 AMTo learn more or to make a vaccination appointment, visit www.rwjbh.org/covid19 .\"At the outset, we knew we would be helping with the COVID-19 vaccination effort,\" says John Bonamo, MD, MS, Executive Vice President and Chief Medical and Quality Officer at RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH). \"But we weren't aware just how much the state would be relying on healthcare systems to make this happen.\" Just as they did when the pandemic first hit, the experts at RWJBH rose to the challenge. \"We opened our first vaccine clinic the week the vaccine came out in December,\" he recounts. \"Then we opened clinics at each of our 11 acute care hospitals.\" RWJBH is also administering the vaccine at the Middlesex County megasite in Edison, which it runs; the former Sears in the Livingston Mall; RWJBarnabas Health Arena in Toms River; Brookdale Community College in Monmouth County; and smaller clinics, including in Bayonne and in the Greenville section of Jersey City. \"We're also assisting municipal efforts in four counties\u2014Ocean, Somerset, Essex and Monmouth\u2014 by providing some or all vaccinators for their clinics,\" Dr. Bonamo says, \"and we're partnering with the state, the National Guard and others. In addition, we've applied for more vaccination sites for physician offices.\" As of mid-March, RWJBH had already vaccinated approximately 150,500 people and was vaccinating more at the rate of 2,000 a day at its hospitals and 4,000 a day at the Edison megasite. However, Dr. Bonamo says that number will increase significantly as vaccine availability does. \"We're ramping up,\" he says. \"We're in this to get it done.\" By summer, Dr. Bonamo says, vaccine supplies will make it available to all who want it. The challenge will shift to making sure everyone who's eligible chooses to be vaccinated. DISPELLING FEARS \"Many people started out with 'vaccine hesitancy'\u2014they wanted to see how other people did with the vaccine first,\" says Dr. Bonamo. \"As they saw others feeling good about having had the vaccine, they became more open to it.\" That led to the clamor for vaccination appointments the state saw in the winter. Vaccine hesitancy persists, however. \"There's understandable mistrust, especially in the black community, born of all the social inequity and healthcare injustice that has happened over the years,\" he says. \"We're working hard to dispel that with all kinds of outreach and town halls being done by healthcare professionals of color.\" Older adults should prioritize getting the vaccine, Dr. Bonamo says. \"The years they have are precious, and many seniors who got COVID-19 did not do well,\" he says. \"Often, that's because they have at least one other comorbidity\u2014diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, kidney disease, lung disease or obesity\u2014that contributes to their risk.\" Dr. Bonamo emphasizes that his message isn't just for certain groups, but for everybody who's eligible for the vaccine. \"Get vaccinated,\" he says. \"That's it. It's safe, it's smart, it's advanced science and it's the right thing to do to protect yourself and your family.\" JOHN BONAMO, MD AS AVAILABILITY INCREASES, EXPERTS HAVE ONE STRONG MESSAGE FOR THE PUBLIC: GET THE SHOT.VACCINATING NEW JERSEY Healthy Together | PB | Spring 2021 RWJBarnabas Health | RWJBH.ORG | 3 System_CovidVaccine_Spr21_Final.indd 3 3/17/21 11:35 AMSabiha Hussain, MD, and her team at the Post-COVID Recovery Program Clinic at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital A NEW CLINIC IS HELPING PATIENTS WITH LONG-TERM SYMPTOMS MAKE A COMPLETE RECOVERY.MOVING ON AFTER COVID- Healthy Together | 4 | Spring 2021 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital | RWJBH.ORG/NEWBRUNSWICK | 5 RWJUHNB_Covid-19_Recovery_Spr21_Final_rev.indd 4 3/17/21 2:46 PMWhen pulmonologist Sabiha Hussain, MD, first started seeing COVID-19 patients in March 2020, she knew there would be lasting effects. \"I looked at their CT scans and saw bronchiectasis, damage to the lungs that makes it difficult to clear mucus,\" she says. \"Pulmonary problems are important because they have a lasting impact on patients' health and can drain the healthcare system if they're not addressed.\" Of the 600,000 and counting COVID-19 cases in New Jersey, about 10 percent of patients experience long-term health problems, says Dr. Hussain, Associate Professor of Medicine in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and the Adult Cystic Fibrosis Program at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital. Dr. Hussain wanted to create a multidisciplinary program that would address all of patients' healthcare needs\u2014medical, social, nutritional and rehabilitative. In January, she launched the Post-COVID Recovery Program to care for patients who continue to experience symptoms of the illness four weeks after diagnosis. A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH After a patient makes an appointment, he or she completes a survey. Patients are asked to report their symptoms, such as shortness of breath, fatigue, anxiety and depression. They also are asked whether they have access to transportation and healthy foods and whether they can afford their prescriptions, says Dr. Hussain. At the initial appointment, patients are assessed by a pulmonologist, nutritionist, physical therapist, mental health provider, social worker, respiratory therapist and pharmacist. A breathing test is administered to check a person's lung function; a CT scan of the chest is taken to view the condition of the lungs; and a musculoskeletal evaluation is performed to check for weakness and dizziness. A neurologist conducts a cognitive evaluation. \"Fifteen to 20 percent of patients develop cognitive symptoms, and 30 to 40 percent have anxiety or depression,\" says Dr. Hussain. The clinic not only assists patients with their medical problems but also their financial and legal needs. Legal services are available for patients who have housing challenges, and those who are experiencing financial problems can receive assistance from the clinic's pharmacist, says Dr. Hussain. HOPE FOR PATIENTS While rehabilitation specialists oversee many COVID-19 rehabilitation clinics, the program at RWJUH is managed by physicians. \"It's rare for a COVID-19 recovery program to be run by physicians,\" says Dr. Hussain. \"Ours is managed by internists, pulmonologists and critical care specialists.\" Dr. Hussain was chosen to oversee the clinic because of her expertise in cystic fibrosis, which requires a multidisciplinary approach to care, says Joshua M. Bershad, MD, Executive Vice President for Physician Services at RWJBarnabas Health. \"She's experienced in treating chronic lung diseases and obtaining resources from many disciplines,\" he explains. The clinic will be partnering with the one at Saint Barnabas Medical Center, a sister hospital. The system is planning for a third site, says Dr. Bershad. Dr. Hussain is thrilled about the program. \"This clinic is a model for patient care for other conditions,\" she says. \"Almost every disease must be approached in a multidisciplinary way.\" In the future, it's possible that multidisciplinary clinics will be developed to care for patients with conditions like diabetes and hypertension, says Dr. Hussain. \"Not only does the hospital care about patients' physical health; it also cares about their mental health and social well-being,\" says Dr. Hussain. This is good news for COVID-19 patients with long-term health problems, who often have \"nowhere to turn,\" says Dr. Bershad. \"The new clinic will provide hope,\" he says. \"COVID-19 patients will now have a medical home. The clinic provides a compassionate and empathetic approach to care.\" Clinic physicians will collect data on COVID-19 patients. It will be used to develop the most appropriate treatments for the disease. \"We need to address the physiology of COVID-19,\" says Dr. Hussain. \"We need effective medications. This program will show us how to really care for COVID-19 patients.\" ARE YOU ELIGIBLE FOR TREATMENT? The Post-COVID Recovery Program Clinic is held every Monday from 8 a.m. to noon at the Clinical Academic Building, located at 125 Patterson Street in New Brunswick.

When Jeannette Wright was pregnant with her third child in 2019, she was devastated to learn that the baby had a congenital diaphragmatic hernia. With this condition, there's a hole in the diaphragm, the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen. This birth defect, which can prevent the baby's lungs from developing completely, was discovered during Jeannette's routine 20-week ultrasound exam. It affects about 1 in 3,600 babies, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"I joined a Facebook group of moms who have babies with the condition, and I saw that some didn't survive, while others were thriving,\" says Jeannette, who lives in Piscataway. Her older children are 7 and 5. Doctors wouldn't know how severe the hernia was until the baby was born. Jeannette's obstetrician told her that she could terminate the pregnancy or the baby could have surgery in utero. She didn't like either option, so she decided to get a second opinion at The Bristol-Myers Squibb Children's Hospital (BMSCH) at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH). Jeannette discovered that BMSCH had just created an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) program. With ECMO, lung and heart function are taken over by a machine. \"ECMO helps buy time for the lung vasculature to mature,\" says Yi-Horng Lee, MD, Chief of Pediatric Surgery at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and Surgeon-in-Chief at BMSCH. About one-third of babies with congenital diaphragmatic hernias require ECMO, he adds. \"When I met Dr. Lee, he made me feel like my baby would have a chance,\" recalls Jeannette, who decided to see an obstetrician at RWJUH. \"I trusted the team.\"SAVING AYLA YI-HORNG LEE, MD Healthy Together | 6 | Spring 2021 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital | RWJBH.ORG/NEWBRUNSWICK | 7 RWJUHNB_PediatricECMO_Spr21_Final.indd 6 3/17/21 10:24 AMIT TAKES A VILLAGE The maternal-fetal medicine team at the RWJUH maternity center monitored Jeannette throughout the remainder of her pregnancy. On September 24, 2019, Ayla was born. \"I didn't know what to expect,\" recalls Jeannette. \"I was so scared. I remember asking, 'Is she breathing?' They said, 'Don't worry. We're intubating her and taking her to the NICU.'\" It turned out that Ayla's hernia was on the right side of her body, which usually has a worse outcome, says Dr. Lee. About 11 hours after her birth, doctors recommended that she go on ECMO. \"Ayla was the first newborn to go on ECMO at BMSCH,\" says Dr. Lee. Ayla was sedated so that the many tubes connecting her body to the machine wouldn't be disturbed. ECMO requires 24/7 monitoring by critical care nurses and a critical care physician. Surgeons must also be on call. Two coordinators\u2014Dominick Carella and Tracy Low\u2014have to keep an eye on the machine. \"These two pediatric ECMO veteran nurses helped us set up the program and run frequent simulations to make sure our staff stays sharp,\" says Dr. Lee. \"It took two years to train our staff in ECMO.\" When Ayla was 10 days old, doctors performed the hernia repair surgery. A corner of the NICU was transformed into an operating room. Ayla was still on ECMO, and Jeannette began to worry whether Ayla could survive without the machine. In the meantime, Jeannette's older children had just started school. She would drop them off at school, go straight to the hospital, then go home around dinnertime. After her children went to bed, she would return to the hospital and stay there until 2 a.m. For nine months, she spent every day at the hospital. Around Halloween, Ayla wasn't doing well, and doctors met with Jeannette and her husband to discuss the possibility that she might not be able to come off the ECMO machine. Ayla had a mind of her own, recalls Jennifer Owensby, MD, Medical Director of ECMO at BMSCH. the textbook,\" says Dr. Owensby. \"She didn't do well when we expected her to. But she always bounced back.\" TURNING THE CORNER To help Ayla breathe better, the doctors placed a tracheostomy tube in Ayla's neck and connected it to a ventilator. When she was three weeks old, doctors tried to take her off ECMO. They did it very slowly, in five- and 10-minute intervals. \"We realized Ayla likes things slow, on her terms,\" says Jeannette. Finally, after 23 days, she was removed from the ECMO machine. Ayla still had a long road ahead of her. She needed the ventilator to help her breathe, and she had pulmonary hypertension, in which there's high blood pressure in the lung arteries. \"I celebrated the little things, like when she could drink a few milliliters of formula or open her eyes or move a finger,\" says Jeannette. \"Only the nurses and doctors could understand.\" Eventually, Ayla was transferred to Children's Specialized Hospital (CSH), where she participated in physical and occupational therapies. She learned how to sit and roll over. On June 29, 2020, Ayla finally came home. \"I'm happy with the progress she's made,\" says Jeannette. \"I'm so proud of her.\" Today, Ayla still has tracheostomy and feeding tubes, and she uses a ventilator at night. She sees her pulmonologist once a month and her cardiologist every six weeks, and she's participating in feeding therapy. Dr. Lee expects her to make a full recovery. \"She's doing wonderfully,\" he says. \"I'm very proud that our team came through for her.\" Jeannette is grateful for the care Ayla received at BMSCH and CSH. \"I have Dr. Lee's phone number on speed dial,\" she says. \"And I keep in touch with the nurses, who came to Ayla's birthday party. They always went the extra mile to make us feel comfortable.\"Ayla enjoys playing with her older siblings, Grayson, 7, and Sophia, 5.

To help them navigate this challenging chronic disease, Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital's Community Health Promotions Program (CHPP) offers the Latino Diabetes Wellness and Prevention Program. It is providing much-needed assistance to the community. One aspect of the program, Project Inspire, focuses on youth. Participants learn about healthy eating and the importance of exercise. They also learn to prepare healthy meals and snacks that can be suitable for a family member with diabetes. Education for adults is also important. Over the course of two sessions, participants learn how to monitor their blood sugar, count carbohydrates and use diabetes medications effectively. A certified diabetes educator discusses medications. The program also offers monthly support groups, known as Grupo Vida, where participants put into practice the lessons they learned in the educational component of the program. There are eye screenings, cooking demonstrations and presentations on how to prevent diabetes-related complications. Members who have completed the educational component of the program are entitled to a voucher for a free membership at the RWJ Fitness & Wellness Center. INFORMATIVE AND SUPPORTIVE New events are constantly being created for participants. The group has done yoga sessions on a nearby beach and has learned how to grill healthfully in a park. \"Participants love the group,\" says Leslie C. Malachi, CHPP nutritionist. \"We try to do little things to keep them motivated. We recently created live videos at the grocery store to explain how to read food labels.\"Clockwise, from left: Participants learn which herbs are easy to grow at home and attend presentations about diabetes. * Children who participate in Project Inspire learn how to make meals and snacks with healthy ingredients. *NOTE: This photo was taken before mask and social distancing recommendations were in place.

To connect with one of NJ's top cardiovascular specialists, call 888.724.7123 or visit www.rwjbh.org/heart .Everyone experiences an increased heart rate at some point. You exercise, and your heart rate increases. You become frightened or stressed, and your heart beats faster. You might experience the increased heart rate as a skipped beat, a flutter or a pounding in your chest. \"A temporary increase in heart rate has many causes,\" says David Dobesh, MD, Chief of Cardiac Electrophysiology at Jersey City Medical Center and a member of RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group with offices in Jersey City and West Orange. \"Emotional stress, physical stress, psychological stress, even things like caffeine, nicotine, too much alcohol or fever. Your body is performing a complex balancing act with your pulse.\" A lesser-known but common source of increased heart rate is medication, including some kinds of over-the- counter medicines and certain prescriptions. \"People should be aware that some medicines dobriefly increase your heart rate,\" says Dr. Dobesh, \"and usually those episodes are not something you should be concerned about.\" POSSIBLE CAUSES Common medications that may increase heart rate for a short period of time include: Decongestants, specifically those that contain pseudoephedrine, a stimulant. \"If the decongestant has a capital 'D' at the end of its name, it contains this ingredient,\" says Dr. Dobesh. Some inhalers for asthma, emphysema or COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Theophylline, an oral asthma medication. Medications for ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). Diuretic medications (used to help prevent fluid retention) could result in dehydration, says Dr. Dobesh. Some blood pressure medications may inadvertently lower blood pressure too much. \"If your pressure is very low from either dehydration or overmedication, the body will respond by increasing the heart rate to compensate,\" he explains.\"Some medications carry warning labels about increased heart rate but in practice this side effect is unusual,\" Dr. Dobesh says. \"These include certain antidepressants and also thyroid medications, which will not usually increase heart rate if they're taken at the recommended dose.\" Similarly, herbal supplements such as ginseng, valerian root and orange bitters should not increase heart rate when taken in normal doses, he says. While a short-term increase in heart rate from medication or emotional or physical stress is normal, increased heart rate that lasts for a long time is not. \"If you're repeatedly feeling symptoms of a racing heartbeat that make you uncomfortable, tell your doctor,\" advises Dr. Dobesh. \"Further testing may be appropriate.\"WHAT IS TACHYCARDIA? For most people, a heart rate between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm) is normal. When your heart beats more than 100 bpm for reasons unrelated to physiological stress, that's known as tachycardia, from the Greek words for \"swift\" and \"heart.\" If increased heart rate is a concern, basic testing, such as an electrocardiogram or blood work, can be done to determine whether you should be referred to an electrophysiologist\u2014a cardiologist who specializes in heart rhythms. The electrophysiologist will look for possible types of tachycardia that are caused by an abnormality of the heart itself and can affect how well the heart pumps blood. Examples include atrial fibrillation (AFib), atrial flutter and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). A wide range of treatments may be considered, including lifestyle changes, medications and medical and surgical procedures.

This may be because people have been less active during this period, perhaps gaining weight or not controlling high blood pressure,\" he says. People who may have warning signs of an aneurysm often neglect them, assuming they'll simply go away, he says. In addition, many people have avoided seeking care because of fear of going to a hospital during the pandemic. \"The classic symptom is a severe headache\u2014one that feels like the worst headache of your life,\" Dr. Nanda explains. \"Not every headache is an aneurysm, of course, and most of the time it's not anything serious. But if you have this terrible headache along with neck stiffness, and bright light bothers you, you should go to the Emergency Department to have it investigated.\" ADVANCED TREATMENTS Aneurysms can be diagnosed by a CT (computed tomography) scan, which uses X-rays to determine whether blood has leaked into the brain. Doctors may also order an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), which uses computer- generated radio waves to create detailed images of the brain. Other diagnostic tests include About one in 50 people in the U.S. has a brain aneurysm\u2014a \"balloon\" of blood protruding from an artery.

If surgery is indicated, we'll get our team together and perform it within 12 to 24 hours,\" says Dr. Nanda. \"For years, a procedure called clipping was the only way to fix an aneurysm,\" he explains. In this procedure, a craniotomy is performed to create an opening in the skull and then a small metal clip is placed on the aneurysm to stop the blood flow. \"Clipping is still the best solution for some cases,\" Dr. Nanda says. \"Today, however, the mainstay of treatment is coiling. We can thread the catheter through a groin artery to place a coil on the aneurysm, and there is no need to open the skull.\"TEAM OF EXPERTS Decisions about treatment are made on a case-by-case basis. \"We have a multidisciplinary team at RWJBarnabas Health and Rutgers,\" says Dr. Nanda. \"We have neurologists, neurosurgeons, a neuropsychologist, a neuroradiology team and endovascular specialists, all providing input about what will be most effective for the patient. We're like a special forces team, able to come together quickly. The patient gets 10 experts for a problem immediately, which is a huge advantage.\" Nurse practitioners, neurology nurses and neurophysiology technologists round out the care team. \"Another benefit of being part of a large system is that we have the advantage of research, clinical trials and education,\" Dr. Nanda says. \"We can do what we call translational research, meaning we take basic research that's being done on stroke and translate it into the clinical realm. It's a bench-to-bedside approach where we can really improve the condition of patients.\"WHAT IS A BRAIN ANEURYSM? A cerebral (brain) aneurysm is a weak spot on a brain artery that balloons or bulges out and fills with blood. If it bursts, it spills blood into the surrounding tissue, an event that's called a hemorrhage. Brain cells, deprived of oxygen, begin to die, and the patient may have a stroke.

We don't want to see our patients develop life-threatening issues like encephalitis from measles or meningitis from Haemophilus influenzae type B, which are prevented by safe, routine childhood vaccinations.\" \"Parents have been hesitant to bring their children to doctors' offices or clinics for fear of exposing them to COVID-19,\" explains Patricia Whitley- Williams, MD, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the Bristol-Myers Squibb Children's Hospital at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and Division Chief of Allergy, Immunology and Infectious Diseases at Rutgers- Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. \"However, these offices are following all the recommended guidelines fromthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\" Dr. Whitley-Williams says. \"Offices are sanitized in between patient appointments, plastic barriers are up, patients and visitors are checked for fever and masks are worn.\" (For children, wearing a mask is recommended over the age of two years.) \"Pediatricians' offices have protocols in place to keep well children and sick children apart,\" adds Dr. Hasan. \"Some set aside special time periods just for vaccinations. Many places require that people check in over the phone and wait outside in their cars. Patients and families then are brought straight into the office, so there's no exposure to other people in a waiting room.\" Parents who have safety concerns should contact their pediatrician's office to ensure that proper safety measures are in place, the doctors advise. FOLLOW THE SCHEDULE Timing is important when it comes to childhood vaccinations, Dr. Hasan says. \"Please don't put off having your child vaccinated because you think it's better to space the shots out,\" she says. \"The schedule of vaccines has been carefully determined to minimize risk and get the best response for each age.\" The recommended schedule for routine childhood vaccinations can be found at www.cdc.gov/vaccines. Expectant mothers should get the Tdap vaccine to protect the baby against pertussis, sometime between the 27th and 36th weeks of pregnancy, the CDC recommends. \"That vaccine has been a game changer for protecting vulnerable newborns,\" Dr. Hasan says. One vaccine many parents are eager to explore for their children is the one for COVID-19, Dr. Hasan says. \"I can't tell you how many calls we get about that,\" she says. \"We're eagerly awaiting the results of trials so we have safety data for the younger age groups, particularly for vulnerable populations such as those with kidney, heart or lung disease.\" In the meantime, routine childhood vaccinations should proceed as advised by your pediatrician. \"Parents and guardians should be assured that these vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective,\" says Dr. Whitley-Williams, \"and they save lives.\"To find a pediatrician at RWJBarnabas Health, call 888.724.7123 or visit www.rwjbh.org/doctors .UZMA HASAN, MD DON'T DELAY ROUTINE VACCINATIONS THAT WILL KEEP YOUR CHILD SAFE FROM PREVENTABLE DISEASES.WHY CHILDHOOD VACCINATIONS CAN'T WAIT PATRICIA WHITLEY-WILLIAMS, MD Healthy Spring 2021 System_PediatricVaccin_Spr21_final.indd 14 3/16/21 11:39 AMAt Children's Specialized Hospital, we provide world-class care for children and young adults who face special health challenges across the state of New Jersey and beyond.

A competitive athlete, Olivia had been training for the Age Group Triathlon World Championships in August 2015 when she crashed her bike while riding at 27 miles per hour. The impact of the crash left Olivia suffering from a broken nose, a torn gluteus maximus and several strains in her legs. Though her injuries healed with time, her pain continued and got progressively worse. Finally, Olivia was diagnosed with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), a form of chronic pain that develops after an injury but gets worse over time. While CRPS is not well understood, it's thought that high levels of nerve impulses are sent to the affected site. Olivia tried several outpatient therapies, but her pain persisted, leaving her unable to do most social or physical activities. Even walking to the car after a therapy session was an ordeal. After researching other avenues for treatment, Olivia learned about the four-week Inpatient Chronic Pain Management Program at CSH. \"I was searching for a way to get my life back to normal,\" says Olivia. \"During the initial evaluation, they asked me what my goals for the program were, and the first thing that I said was that I wanted to race again.\" She entered the program in January 2016. WILL TO WIN During her time at CSH, Olivia learned techniques for moving in a way that would help her manage the pain. Her natural competitiveness came out during timed activities like learning how to step in and out of a tub, or going for a walk outside. \"I always strived to beat my time from the day before,\" she recalls. Swimming, aquatic therapy and group and individual psychotherapy helped her learn to desensitize herself to pain and function normally. After four weeks, Olivia was feeling more in control of her CRPS\u2014and ready to get back to her senior year of high school. By the end of that year, she had been accepted into a prestigious university and was back to competitive sports. In 2019, nearly four years after her accident, Olivia competed in the Age Group Triathlon World Championships, the same competition she'd been training for when she crashed her bike. Olivia recalls the moments before the competition began: \"I remember thinking, 'I can't believe I'm actually here!' And that's when it all hit me: There's no way I would have been able to do it if it weren't for my time at Children's Specialized Hospital. The treatment I got there gave me the chance to live out my dreams.\" For more information about Children's Specialized Hospital, call 888.244.5373 or visit www.rwjbh.org/childrensspecialized.A COMPETITIVE ATHLETE ACHIEVES HER DREAMS THANKS TO AN INNOVATIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.A RACE AGAINST PAIN An RWJBarnabas Health facility Hard work at the Inpatient Chronic Pain Management Program enabled Olivia to compete in triathlons again.

Their exercise routines and nutritional habits are rooted in the principles of living healthy. Like our community, they rely on experts to help guide them along the way. That's why our partnership with RWJBarnabas Health is so important and works so well,\" says Steve Kalafer, Somerset Patriots Chairman Emeritus and RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH) trustee. Over the 22-year history of the partnership, RWJBH has hosted regular health fairs, blood drives and food drives, and has provided information on how community members can get access to key health services and screenings. Somerset Patriots players have benefited, too: RWJBH provides sports medicine services to keep players on the field of play. For kids, the Somerset Patriots, in partnership with the health system, created the Hit a Home Run Program. Featuring former pitcher Nate Roe, the education program for schools (delivered virtually this school year) is designed to teach young children how to eat healthier, make smarter lifestyle choices, be a good teammate and friend and understand the importance of exercise. FRIENDS IN NEED The Somerset Patriots team has been a stalwart supporter of RWJBH. Last summer, the organization raised more than $16,000 for the RWJBarnabas Health Emergency Response Fund to help support healthcare professionals as they served communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The money was raised in a variety of ways, including online auctions, merchandise sales of T-shirts and face masks, a pop-up shopping event and drive-in movies at TD Bank Ballpark. \"We are so grateful to the Somerset Patriots for their continued support of our hospital and our community throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, from donations of food for our staff to hosting blood drives and holding events to benefit our Emergency Response Fund,\" says Tony Cava, President and CEO of Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset, a pillar of healthcare throughout Central New Jersey. \"Their ongoing support helps ensure that our community has access to the comprehensive healthcare services they need.\" A SOURCE OF PRIDE RWJBH employees, many of whom live locally, take great pride in the partnership, attending games and participating in group events. Players feel that spirit as well. \"We pride ourselves on being active in our community to help make a difference,\" says Somerset Patriots President and General Manager Patrick McVerry. \"Our fans are always there for us at the ballpark and for all of our efforts.

To express their gratitude, they have established a gift annuity and funded several programs. \"We want to make sure that people who are less fortunate than we can receive excellent healthcare,\" says Judith. Judith and Harvey discovered that the hospital's Community Health Promotions Department had launched a Healthy Housing Ambassadors program, which helps protect local residents from the dangers of lead paint and other hazards. They contributed to the program in 2019 and supported the hospital's emergency response fund, which purchased personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic. \"It's wonderful that the hospital is concerned about the community,\" says Judith. \"So many people are working hard to help others, and it feels good to be part of it.\" GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND The Watermans have always been impressed by the care they've received at RWJUH. In 2014, Harvey had triple bypass surgery at RWJUH. When he was in recovery in the coronary Intensive Care Unit, Judith recalls that he had to be moved from one room to another. \"I was worried he wouldn't be able to walk, so I asked the nurses about it,\" she says. \"They said, 'We'll bring a wheelchair for him in case he needs to sit.' He was fine, but she did that to take care of me. I realized that the hospital cares not only for patients but also for the people who love them.\" Then, in 2017, Judith was diagnosed with recurrent breast cancer and had a double mastectomy. She was scared, but her surgeon, Susannah S. Wise, MD, always made her laugh. \"She showed me pictures of her young son, who had a snail on his cheek,\" recalls Judith. \"Dr. Wise told me it was a 'rescue snail.' I started to laugh, and I felt my blood pressure drop.\" When Judith was first diagnosed with breast cancer, she was using crutches because she had injured one of her knees. At a radiation treatment appointment, one of the crutches fell to the ground. \"Before I could grab it, there were three people at the door to help me,\" she recalls. \"It made me feel cared for.\" During her treatments, Judith was concerned that the radiation would affect her lungs. Her radiation oncologist agreed to position her in a way to minimize her exposure. \"He has an international reputation, yet he was very respectful of my wishes,\" says Judith. \"It's the culture of the hospital.\"Judith and Harvey Waterman have been so satisfied with their medical care that they have made generous donations to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital.

I said to myself, 'I'm going to donate a kidney.' From that moment forward, I was like a man on a mission.\" James Neebling, the subject of the post, was a total stranger to Artie, though the two men had a friend in common. The owner of a freight brokerage business, James, also 58, had had diabetes for 25 years. He had gone on dialysis at the end of 2018 after collapsing while on a business trip. \"The ER doctor looked at my labs and said, 'Listen, if you don't start dialysis immediately, you'll be dead,'\" recalls James. For the next six months, James left his home at 4:30 a.m. three days a week in order to receive dialysis and then put in a full day at work. \"Fifty percent of the time, I felt out of it, drained,\" he says. \"I looked around at the people in the dialysis center who had been going for years and thought, I can't believe this is my life.\" James applied for an organ transplant at Robert Wood Johnson From left: Artie Regan with fianc\u00e9e Susan Crosby-Fox and James Neebling with fianc\u00e9e Mary Gibney-Doherty after James' kidney transplant Healthy Together | 18 | Spring 2021 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital | RWJBH.ORG/NEWBRUNSWICK | 19 RWJUHNB_KidneyDonor_Spr21_Final.indd 18 3/17/21 12:32 PMFor more information about the Kidney and Pancreas Transplant Center, visit www.njtransplant.org.University Hospital (RWJUH), and after a battery of tests, he was placed on the waiting list. He was warned it would likely be five years before a kidney became available. That's when his fianc\u00e9e, Mary Gibney-Doherty, posted his story on Facebook, hoping to find a living donor among the couple's friends and connections. \"There aren't nearly enough deceased donor kidneys to help patients who need them,\" says Ronald P. Pelletier, MD, a transplant surgeon and Program Director at the Kidney and Pancreas Transplant Center at RWJUH. \"That's why it's important to try to find a living donor.\" A PANDEMIC DELAY Artie saw the Facebook post just as the COVID-19 pandemic began to emerge in the U.S. Although he passed the psychological assessment required for donors, he was forced to wait for blood work and other tests because the hospital was overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients. Artie was finally cleared and found to be a good match for James in July 2020. The surgery was scheduled for August 4. But James had been kept in the dark, pending the results of Artie's tests. When the hospital called to say there might be a donor for him, he began to get his hopes up. James learned the good news just days before the surgery at a surprise party organized by the men's mutual friend. There, Artie popped open a bottle of champagne and revealed that he would be James' organ donor. James was overwhelmed with gratitude. \"You've really got to be special to not only want to donate a kidney but to do it for someone you don't even know,\" he says. The surgery went off without a hitch. \"I can't tell you how great I feel,\" says Artie. \"Every day, I wake up feeling like a better man.\" PAYING IT FORWARD By early September, Artie was ready to lead the annual walkathon he hosts honoring those who died on 9/11. This time, he dedicated the walk to the transplant program at RWJUH. Advaith Bongu, MD, the kidney/ pancreas transplant surgeon who performed James' procedure\u2014along with others from the transplant team\u2014 participated. Mary pushed James, who was still weak from the surgery, in a wheelchair. \"Organ donors are a special breed,\" says Dr. Bongu. \"It takes a real commitment. But the experience has been as life-changing for Artie as it has been for James.\" Today, James is in excellent health, and the two men have developed a deep bond. Last fall, they started an organization called The Kidney Exchange\u2014of Hope to help bring together people in need of kidneys and prospective donors. Artie wants more people to experience the impact that donating a kidney has had on him. \"I had no idea how good you could feel about yourself,\" he says. The experience helped him turn \"a year of lemons into lemonade,\" Artie adds. \"I was able to not only do something good but possibly something that can inspire other people to step forward.\" RONALD P .

It went smoothly, and Patricia returned to Dr. Lee's office every six months to have an echocardiogram, an ultrasound test that enables doctors to check the heart's function. Patricia felt fine until the summer of 2020. She was weak and experienced shortness of breath whenever she walked. Her symptoms persisted into the fall. One night in October, she passed out while trying to get a glass of water. \"I was especially tired,\" she recalls. Patricia went to the Emergency Department at RWJUH. Tests showed that she had aortic insufficiency, in which the main heart valve is unable to close completely. The purpose of the aortic valve is to ensure that blood ejected from the heart only moves downstream to other vital organs. The valve was not closing properly, so blood was flowing backward into the main chamber of the heart. This requires the heart to work harder to pump sufficient blood to the body. Over time, the additional stress on the heart causes it to fail. \"Doctors told me that my heart valve needed to be replaced,\" she says. A BREAKTHROUGH DEVICE Luckily, Patricia was eligible for a new, minimally invasive procedure. She was enrolled in a clinical trial of a next- generation transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) device called the In May 2013, Patricia Buscemi, 71, a former hairdresser in Aberdeen, had a sinus infection and was worried she might have pneumonia, so she saw her doctor. Imaging tests showed she had a 6-centimeter ascending aortic aneurysm\u2014a bulge in the main artery of the heart\u2014 that needed to be removed immediately. The procedure was performed by Leonard Y. Lee, MD, Chair and Professor of Surgery at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and ChiefA LIFESAVING HEART VALVE MARK J. RUSSO, MD, MS Healthy Together | 20 | Spring 2021 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital | RWJBH.ORG/NEWBRUNSWICK | 21 RWJUHNB_TAVR_Spr21_Final.indd 20 3/17/21 10:02 AMJenaValve. The being studied to treat aortic insufficiency, says Mark J. Russo, MD, MS, Chief of Cardiac Surgery and Director of Structural Heart Disease at RWJUH and Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and a member of RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group. RWJUH is one of only 15 hospitals in the country\u2014and the only one in New Jersey\u2014that's participating in a study of the device, which received a Breakthrough Device Designation from the Food and Drug Administration in January 2020. This designation is reserved for investigative therapies designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. Another criterion: Preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies. During the procedure, which lasts less than 90 minutes, doctors access the femoral artery and vein\u2014large blood vessels in the groin, just above the thigh\u2014using needles, wires and catheters. No incisions are required. X-ray and ultrasound guidance\u2014 including echocardiography performed by Chunguang Chen, MD, Director, Advanced Noninvasive Cardiac Imaging at RWJUH\u2014is used to ensure that the new valve is positioned properly. The JenaValve is placed inside the existing valve, thus replacing the diseased native valve. A special \"locator technology\" enables the JenaValve to be secured in the correct area of the heart. Currently, patients who have this procedure are given general anesthesia, but in the near future, Dr. Russo expects to perform the procedure when patients are conscious. Patricia was scheduled for the surgery on December 15, 2020. She was one of approximately 100 patients enrolled in the study, says Dr. Russo. \"Given Patricia's previous heart surgery and the heart failure she developed as a result of a leaking valve, open-heart surgery would be risky for her,\" says Dr. Russo. \"However, without a replacement valve, she would die from her heart condition. Surgical aortic valve replacement remains the standard for treating aortic valve disease. However, the JenaValve device allowed us to replace her valve and enable her to avoid the more prolonged recovery associated with open- heart surgery,\" says Dr. Russo. A QUICK RECOVERY The surgery went remarkably well, reports Dr. Russo. For Patricia, \"the worst part was when the IVs were placed,\" she says. Patricia was impressed with the nursing care. \"The nurses were very attentive,\" she recalls. \"They were always asking if they could prop up my pillows and walk me to the bathroom.\" After a single night in the hospital, Patricia was discharged to her home. \"If Patricia had required open-heart surgery to fix her valve, she likely would have been in the hospital for many days and required weeks of recovery,\" says Dr. Russo. \"With this approach, there's none of the trauma involved in open-heart surgery. Therefore, Patricia was able to return home the day after her valve was replaced. In fact, patients often say they feel better right away.\" Indeed, Patricia noticed she was able to breathe better and had more energy. In January, she had blood work, an EKG and an ultrasound of the heart, and everything looked great, she says. Though Dr. Russo expects this new valve to last for many years, the procedure can be redone if it fails. \"At RWJUH, we are fortunate to have access to many cutting-edge technologies,\" he says. \"However, the JenaValve is clearly among the most exciting new heart valve therapies currently being investigated anywhere in the world. This device may provide lifesaving therapy to a large population of patients who would otherwise have no effective treatment option. The JenaValve has the potential to save a tremendous number of lives.\" Patricia is grateful. \"I'm so glad I had the procedure,\" she says. \"I would only go to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital.\"Patricia Buscemi was able to breathe better and had more energy after receiving a new heart valve.

For Robert Nash, 58, a former ironworker for the New York City Transit Authority, the day is still fresh in his mind. When the first plane hit the Twin Towers, he and his team were told it was a plane crash, and they raced to the area to set up their equipment. When the buildings collapsed, they were forced to leave the area. Later that day, they returned, along with firefighters and police officers, to work on \"the pile,\" where they dug through steel and rubble looking for survivors. \"Teams of doctors and nurses showed up and said, 'Where are your masks?'\" he recalls. \"We said, 'No one told us to put our respirators on.'\" For more than a month, Robert, who lives in Lincroft, worked on the pile every day, from 12 p.m. to 12 a.m. After the search and rescue mission was complete, he returned to the World Trade Center (WTC) site sporadically to remove giant pieces of steel from the debris. In total, he spent about a year working on the pile. A SLEW OF HEALTH PROBLEMS Back in 2001, Robert was 38 and in good health. He and his coworkers routinely carried heavy tools, torches and tanks into subway stations. About four years later, he noticed he was having trouble breathing while he was on the job. He was also having frequent nosebleeds. About six of his coworkers had developed breathing problems, too. He saw a doctor in New York City and was diagnosed with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), nodules on his thyroid gland, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), emphysema and asbestos in his lungs. \"I walk around like a time bomb,\" he says. Robert had always enjoyed baseball and bowling, but his breathing problems prevented him from being active. He had to take around 12 medications daily to cope with his health problems. When he was healthy, he weighed 235 pounds, but his weight had ballooned to 400 pounds. Making matters worse, he was struggling with a lack of sleep and panic attacks. \"I would wake up in the middle of the night gasping for air,\" he recalls. It turned out that Robert had obstructive sleep apnea, in which the throat muscles relax and block the airway, causing a person to stop breathing multiple times throughout the night. Robert was tired of traveling to New York City for his medical appointments, so he decided to find a doctor closer to home. THE LINK BETWEEN SLEEP APNEA AND 9/11 Friends recommended Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH). His first doctor retired, so he recently began seeing Jag Sunderram, MD, ATSF, Medical Director of the Medical Intensive Care Unit at RWJUH and Professor of Medicine and Division Chief, Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. Dr. Sunderram and his colleagues are studying around 4,000 9/11 first responders in New Jersey. \"In 2010, we were getting a lot of referrals for sleep studies,\" he says. \"The patients were young\u2014in their 30s and 40s\u2014and were not obese [a typical risk factor for sleep apnea].\" Most patients were detectives, police officers and construction workers who were being monitored and treated by the World Trade Center Health Program at Rutgers in Piscataway. \"Their noses and mouths had been covered by cement and dust particles in 2001,\" says Dr. Sunderram. \"They had symptoms such as runny noses, snoring, sore throat, reflux and irritation of the nasal passages.\" Seventy-five percent of the first responder patients had sleep apnea, whereas only 25 to 40 percent of the general population has it, says Dr. Sunderram. \"We are trying to identify a mechanism that would explain why obstructive sleep apnea is so prevalent in the WTC first responders,\" he explains. \"There is a strong association with chronic nasal inflammation, which the first responders suffer from.\" Dr. Sunderram recommended that Robert be evaluated at the RWJUH Comprehensive Sleep Disorders Center. He had pulmonary function tests, a sleep study and a 6-minute walk test to evaluate his shortness of breath. \"Robert had severe sleep apnea,\" says Dr. Sunderram. \"During the test, he stopped breathing about 86 times per hour, which is equivalent to once every 45 seconds.\" By comparison, people with moderate sleep apnea stop breathing 15 to 30 times per hour. \"The drop in oxygen levels during the night leads to changes in mood and memory and high blood pressure, which increases the risk of a stroke and heart attack,\" says Dr. Sunderram. Dr. Sunderram recommended that Robert use a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine, which keeps the airways open. \"I love it,\" he says. \"I use it every night.\" Dr. Sunderram says he's doing very well. \"His sleep apnea is completely controlled, and we've had great success in treating his asthma and COPD,\" says Dr. Sunderram. Robert agrees. He walks twice a day and swims at the local YMCA. So far, he has lost 75 pounds. \"I have bad days sometimes,\" he says. \"But overall, I'm very happy.\"COMPREHENSIVE TESTING The Comprehensive Sleep Disorders Center at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital offers the following services: a sleep lab, where patients are tested for narcolepsy, epilepsy and seizures and movement and behavioral disorders wakefulness testing, which is used for professionals such as airline pilots pediatric sleep disorders insomnia delayed sleep phase syndrome If you snore, choke or gasp while you sleep, suffer from daytime sleepiness, have a body mass index of 30 or higher or have high blood pressure, you might benefit from a sleep evaluation.
