History of Homeopathy Once patients start to react to a homeopathic medicine, many of them become interested in the history of homeopathy. Below is a brief history with some links for those interested. Homeopathy was founded in 1796 by the German physician, [Samuel Hahnemann](http://www.homeopathycenter.org/sites/default/files/Samuel%20Hahnemann%20Founder%20of%20Classical%20Homeopathy.pdf). Hahnemann had become disappointed in the dangers of conventional medicines of the time and sought a form of medicine that was gentle yet effective. He found, while interpreting medical textbooks, that many substances which caused certain symptoms or diseases in a healthy person, could also treat those same symptoms in a sick person. Homeopathy is based on this law of similars (or \"like cures like\"). The most common way this is illustrated is in cases of insomnia. The conventional way to treat this is by giving a drug to bring on an artificial sleep, which can often cause side effects or addiction. The homeopathic way is to treat insomnia by giving the patient a minute dose of a substance, which in large doses causes sleeplessness in a healthy person, such as coffee. Surprisingly, this will enable the patient to sleep naturally. The more closely the symptoms of the patient match those of the medicine, the better the outcome. Research Over time, many other physicians and experts in homeopathy have successfully reproduced the findings and contributed to the study of Samuel Hahnemann. Today there any many practitioners, both naturopathic and medical doctors alike that employ his methods effectively with their patients. Another common misconception is that there is no research in homeopathy. In fact, there is much positive research of homeopathic medicine.
