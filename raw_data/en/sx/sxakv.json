I have not enjoyed something this much in a long time. Many thanks Wonderful products. I enjoyed the clay mask and it's amazing scent and quality. Thank you for gift. I will be purchasing from you again. The packaging of this soap is really attractive! I included it in some care packages to loved ones and it felt like I was gifting them great soap, and also a wish for their well being. This soap smells amazing, but it leaves my skin feeling squeaky after I use it, which makes me feel like it's striping my skin of natural oils. The grits are also a little too harsh. I'm not sure what the grits are made out of, but I scratched my armpit really badly on a sharp piece of grit. I do like the facemasks from Anne's Apothecary, so please don't take this review as a negative review of the company, I just didn't have success with this soap. Refreshing and long lasting.
