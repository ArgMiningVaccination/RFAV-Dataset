They were written near the end of Steiner's life and in a way summarize, in highly concentrated form, the whole of anthroposophy. Each essay ends with a short summary of its contents and these are known as the \"leading thoughts.\" The leading thoughts are mantras and can be used quite fruitfully for meditation.
