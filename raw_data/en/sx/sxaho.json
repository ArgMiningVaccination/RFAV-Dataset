ARC 2832C PROFESSIONAL LICENSURE DIVISION [645] Amended Notice of Intended Action Pursuant to the authority of Iowa Code section 148C.3, the Board of Physician Assistants hereby gives Notice of Intended Action to amend Chapter 327, \"Practice of Physician Assistants,\" Iowa Administrative Code. Notice of Intended Action was published in the Iowa Administrative Bulletin as ARC 2417C on February 17, 2016. An Amended Notice of Intended Action was published in the Iowa Administrative Bulletin as ARC 2531C on May 1 1, 2016. The Board of Physician Assistants received comments and feedback on its first Amended Notice of Intended Action, which led the Board to file this subsequent Amended Notice of Intended Action. As authorized by 2015 Iowa Acts, Senate File 505, division XXXI, section 1 13, this second Amended Notice of Intended Action establishes a definition of supervision for physician assistant practice within physician/physician assistant care teams. After receipt of public comments following the publication of ARC 2531C on May 1 1, 2016, the Board of Physician Assistants concluded it is unable to move forward with adopting the minimum standards as proposed in its first Amended Notice. Feedback received by the Board led to concerns about the impact of the proposed rule on access to care for Iowans. In addition, the Board reviewed policy from national physician and physician assistant or ganizations including the American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of Physicians, American Osteopathic Association, Federation of State Medical Boards, American Academy of Physician Assistants, and numerous other national physician or ganizations for specific guidance for physician/ physician assistant collaborative practice. The Board used these principles which incorporate policies of the or ganizations above: Physicians and physician assistants (P As) working together in a team-oriented collaborative practice provide a proven model for delivering high-quality , cost-ef fective patient care. Ef fective teams are best defined by physicians and P As at the practice level to maximize skills of the providers and meet patient needs. In each practice setting, there should be joint communication and decision-making to best meet the health care needs of patients. Further , health information technology provides a vital link to ensure ef fective and timely communication between physicians and P As and enhance patient care. Each physician/P A medical practice should determine appropriate clinical roles within the medical team, enabling each clinician to work at the fullest extent of their education and expertise. Flexibility in state regulations enables physicians to delegate appropriate duties to P As based on their own assessment of each P A ' s knowledge, skills, and abilities within their scope of practice. The Board of Physician Assistants intends to continue to work with the Board of Medicine to jointly adopt this definition of supervision by rule as required by the 2015 legislation. Any interested person may make written comments on the proposed amendments no later than December 27, 2016, addressed to Susan Reynolds, Professional Licensure Division, Department of Public Health, Lucas State Of fice Building, Des Moines, Iowa 50319-0075; e-mail susan.reynolds@idph.iowa.gov . IAB 12/7/16 NOTICES 1 109 PROFESSIONAL LICENSURE DIVISION[645](cont'd) A public hearing will be held on January 6, 2017, from 8 to 9 a.m. in the Fifth Floor Board Conference Room 526, Lucas State Of fice Building, Des Moines, Iowa, at which time persons may present their views either orally or in writing. At the hearing, persons will be asked to give their names and addresses for the record and to confine their remarks to the subject of the proposed amendments. After analysis and review of this rule making, the Board of Physician Assistants concludes that the proposed rule will have no impact on jobs. These amendments are intended to implement Iowa Code chapters 147, 148, 148C, and 272C and 2015 Iowa Acts, Senate File 505, division XXXI, section 1 13. The following amendments are proposed. I TEM 1 . Adopt the following new rule 645\u2014327.8 (147,148,148C,86GA,SF505): 645\u2014327.8 (147,148,148C,86GA,SF505) Definition of physician supervision of a physician assistant. This rule establishing a definition of physician supervision of a physician assistant in the state of Iowa is intended to be jointly adopted by the board of medicine and the board of physician assistants in accordance with 2015 Iowa Acts, Senate File 505, division XXXI, section 1 13. 327.8(1) Definition of supervision. Supervision means an ongoing process by which a supervising physician and physician assistant jointly ensure that the medical services provided by the physician assistant are appropriate. A supervising physician retains ultimate responsibility for patient care. A physician need not be physically present at each activity of the physician assistant or be specifically consulted before each delegated task is performed. Supervision shall not be construed as requiring the physical presence of the supervising physician at the place where such services are rendered except insofar as the physical presence is expressly required by Iowa Code chapter 148C . 327.8(2) Additional elements of supervision. a. Supervision must be tailored to the individual practice setting and take into account the experience of both the physician and physician assistant. b. Individual practice requirements must guide how to best use health information technology to enhance patient care by ensuring ef fective and timely communication between physician and physician assistant. c. The supervising physician and physician assistant must determine appropriate methods of evaluation for each practice. This evaluation may include, but is not limited to, review of delegated services, periodic chart review , and existing evaluation tools as determined by the practice. d. Both the supervising physician and physician assistant must review all of the requirements of physician assistant licensure, practice, supervision and delegation of medical services as set forth in the Iowa Code. I TEM 2 .

Pursuant to the authority of Iowa Code section 13B.4(8), the State Public Defender hereby gives Notice of Intended Action to amend Chapter 12, \"Claims for Indigent Defense Services,\" Iowa Administrative Code. This proposed amendment will allow an attorney in an adult criminal case to submit a claim for attorney fees within 45 days after the date of the expiration of the time for appeal from the judgment of conviction. This amendment is intended to allow the attorney a fairer opportunity to timely submit a fee claim after all required services have been performed. Any interested person may make written suggestions or comments on the proposed amendment on or before January 3, 2017. Such written comments should be sent to Kurt Swaim, First Assistant State Public Defender , Fourth Floor , Lucas State Of fice Building, 321 E. Locust Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50319; by fax to (515)281-7289; or by e-mail to kswaim@spd.state.ia.us . A public hearing will be held on January 3, 2017, at 10 a.m. in Conference Room 424, Fourth Floor , Lucas State Of fice Building, 321 E. 12th Street, Des Moines, Iowa, at which time persons may present their views orally or in writing.

The agency does not believe that the proposed amendment poses a financial hardship on any regulated entity or individual. After analysis and review of this rule making, no adverse impact on jobs has been found. This amendment is intended to implement Iowa Code chapters 13B and 815. The following amendment is proposed. Amend paragraph 12.2(3)\"a\" as follows: a. Adult claims. For adult claims, \"date of service\" means the date of filing of an order indicating that the case was dismissed or the client was acquitted or sentenced , the date of the expiration of the time for appeal from a judgment of conviction, the date of a final order in a postconviction relief case, the date of mistrial, the date on which a warrant was issued for the client, or the date of a court order authorizing the attorney' s withdrawal from a case prior to the date of a dismissal, acquittal, sentencing, or mistrial. The filing of a notice of appeal is not a date of service. If a motion for reconsideration is filed, the date on which the court rules on that motion is the date of service. For interim adult claims authorized by subrule 12.3(3) or 12.3(4) , the date of service is the last day on which the attorney claimed time on the itemization of services.

These changes are being made to bring administrative rules into compliance with 2015 Iowa Acts, chapter 137, section 149, section (1)(q), as amended by 2016 Iowa Acts, House File 2460, section 27, which requires the Department of Human Services to increase the contractual managed care rate floors and the fee-for -service rates and payment limits by 1 percent over the rates in ef fect April 1, 2016, for providers of home- and community-based service (HCBS) waiver services for which the managed care rate floor is based on the average aggregate reimbursement rate for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2014. The outdated language regarding encumbering a portion of the cost of home and vehicle modification over 12 months is also being removed as these paragraphs were to be stricken in a prior rule making that removed the cost of home and vehicle modification from the monthly cap under the waiver program. These amendments increase fee-for -service upper payment limits and reimbursement rates by 1 percent over the rates in ef fect June 30, 2016, for providers of HCBS waiver services for which the managed care rate floor is based on the average aggregate reimbursement rate for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2014. These amendments also increase managed care, the contractual reimbursement rate floor based on the average aggregate reimbursement rate for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2014, by 1 percent over the rate floor in ef fect on April 1, 2016. The caps on the total monthly cost of HCBS waiver services for members under each waiver and the annual respite limit for the intellectual disability (ID) waiver are also being increased by 1 percent. The increases in the caps are put in place so members may receive the same services after the rate increases. Finally , these amendments correct the annual limit for specialized medical equipment in Chapter 78 to align with the limit listed in subrule 79.1(2). The Council on Human Services adopted these amendments on November 9, 2016. Pursuant to Iowa Code section 17A.4(3), the Department finds that notice and public participation are unnecessary because these amendments are mandated by 2016 Iowa Acts, House File 2460, section 27, which permits the Department to adopt emer gency rules for this purpose. Pursuant to Iowa Code section 17A.5(2)\"b\"(1)(b), the Department also finds that the normal ef fective date of these amendments, 35 days after publication, should be waived and the amendments made ef fective November 15, 2016, because the amendments confer a benefit on the public. Providers will receive rate increases to the upper rate limit and the cap on the monthly cost of waiver services. These amendments are also published herein under Notice of Intended Action as ARC 2849C to allow for public comment. These amendments do not provide for waivers in specified situations because requests for the waiver of any rule may be submitted under the Department' s general rule on exceptions at 441\u20141.8(17A,217). These amendments may increase private sector wages for employees providing home- and community-based services under HCBS waiver programs. These amendments are intended to implement Iowa Code section 249A.4 and 2016 Iowa Acts, House File 2460, section 27.

As required by the Act and 34 CFR Section 361.36, if the division cannot serve all eligible individuals who apply , the division shall develop and maintain a waiting list for services based on significance of disability . a. The three categories of waiting lists are as follows, listed in order of priority to be served: (1) Individuals with most significant disabilities; (2) Individuals with significant disabilities; and (3) Other individuals. b. An individual' s order of selection is determined by the waiting list and the date on which the individual applied for services from the division. All waiting lists are statewide in scope; no regional lists are to be maintained. c. Assessment of the significance of an applicant' s disability is done during the process of determining eligibility but may continue after the individual has been placed on a waiting list. 56.6(7) Individuals who ar e blind. Pursuant to rule 1 1 1\u201410.4(216B), individuals who meet the department for the blind' s definition of \"blind\" are to be served primarily by the department for the blind. Individuals with multiple disabilities who also are blind may receive technical assistance and consultation services while the department for the blind provides their rehabilitation plan. Joint cases are served in the Iowa self-employment program and other contracts developed by the DSU. 56.6(8) Students in high school. The division may serve students in high school who may legally work in competitive integrated environments. If an applicant is in high school and is determined to be eligible for vocational rehabilitation services, such services begin before the student exits the secondary school system. The services shall not supplant services for which the secondary school is responsible and are delivered according to the memorandum of understanding in ef fect with the department of education. a. When the DSU determines that a student is eligible for services, the student' s place on the waiting list under subrule 56.6(6) shall be determined. If the waiting list category appropriate for the student is a category currently being served, the case record moves to a planning status and the student will work with a counselor , or other DSU representative, to develop an IPE. The student may also work with other representatives of the student' s choosing to assist with the development of the IPE; however , said plan is not in ef fect until approved and signed by the rehabilitation counselor of record. Otherwise, the case is placed in Status 04-0, and the student' s name is added to the waiting list for that category , based on the student' s date of application. The IPE must be in place as required by federal regulations, unless the student has agreed to an extension or is on a waiting list. The IPE shall be developed in accordance with the standard established by the division and within the time frames established by federal regulations. b. The counselor assigned by the division to work with the student may participate in the student' s individualized education program meetings to provide consultation and technical assistance if the student is on the waiting list for services and received preemployment transition services prior to the decision on eligibility . Once a student is removed from the waiting list, the counselor may also provide vocational counseling and planning for the student and coordinate services with transition planning teams. When such services do not supplant services for which the secondary school is responsible, the division may begin to provide services specifically related to employment, such as supported employment. As needed for the student' s progression toward employment, a student who is in high school or in an alternative high school and has not yet met high school graduation requirements after four years of secondary enrollment may continue to receive services that do not supplant the responsibilities of the high school. A student who is in the student' s final year of high school and has made satisfactory progress and has demonstrated job-specific skills to work in the student' s trained profession may receive assistance in purchasing tools to be used on the job for which the student studied.

Rescind rule 281\u201456.8(259) and adopt the following new rule in lieu thereof: 281\u201456.8 (259) Case diagnosis used in case r ecording. The diagnosis of an individual with a disability is conducted by qualified personnel under state licensure laws, and the division personnel use that information as part of the eligibility requirements. The eligibility of the individual constitutes a comprehensive study of the individual, including a medical as well as a vocational impediment of the individual. Each case diagnosis is based on pertinent information, including the individual' s health and physical status, intelligence, educational background and achievements, vocational aptitudes and interests, employment experience and opportunities, and personal and social adjustments. This information then is used to assess the significant impediments posed by the diagnosis toward employment to determine and identify the comprehensive services needed to prepare for , obtain, maintain, or advance in competitive integrated employment. 56.8(1) Medical diagnosis. As a basis for determination of eligibility and formulation of the individual' s rehabilitation plan, the division secures competent medical diagnosis. When necessary , the diagnosis is, if at all practicable and appropriate, secured from recognized specialists in specific fields indicated by the general medical diagnosis. Whenever possible, the diagnosis is accompanied by recommendations as to the means and methods of restoration and by a statement of any physical or mental limitations that may exist. 56.8(2) Curr ent medical r eports. The division accepts a medical report in lieu of securing a new examination when the report can be relied upon to provide a sound basis for diagnosis of the physical or mental condition of the individual; is from providers or sources as listed in the case service manual; and is from an accredited or certified medical or treatment institution recognized by the state of Iowa or licensed by the department of public health or department of human services in any other state.

A case record documenting participation in a transitional alliance program shall be maintained until the job candidate reaches age 25 or later . 56.8(6) Achievement of an employment outcome. Any eligible individual, including an individual who is presumed eligible, must intend to achieve an employment outcome that is consistent with the individual' s unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice. The DSU is responsible for informing individuals, through the application process for services, that individuals who receive services from the DSU must intend to achieve an employment outcome. The individual' s completion of the application process for vocational rehabilitation services is suf ficient evidence of the individual' s intent to achieve an employment outcome. I TEM 9 .

These amendments implement 2016 Iowa Acts, House File 2439 and Senate File 2326, which amend Iowa Code chapter 34A. These amendments primarily focus on the distribution of collected wireless E91 1 surchar ge revenues. First, the amount of wireless E91 1 surchar ge revenues passed to the local E91 1 services board is increased from 46 percent to 60 percent of revenues collected. The method by which these funds are disbursed remains unchanged from current practice. Funds are disbursed based on wireless 91 1 call volume and square miles of the E91 1 service area for the associated public safety answering point (PSAP). Second, a one-time payment of $4,383,000 is made to the Public Safety 1 172 FILED IAB 12/7/16 HOMELAND SECURITY AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT DEP AR TMENT[605](cont'd) Department for payment of the 2017 state fiscal year financing agreement entered into by the T reasurer of State for the statewide interoperable communications system as described in Iowa Code section 29C.23 as amended by 2016 Iowa Acts, Senate File 2326. Last, any unspent funds, not to exceed $4,400,000, may be spent in the following order of priority: grants for PSAPs to consolidate physical facilities and technology , funding of public awareness and educational campaigns, and funding to PSAPs for communications equipment related to receiving and dispatching 91 1 calls as well as costs to access the statewide interoperable communications system. Notice of Intended Action was published in the Iowa Administrative Bulletin as ARC 2740C on October 12, 2016. In addition, these amendments were simultaneously Adopted and Filed Emer gency as ARC 2741C . A public hearing was conducted on November 1, 2016. No public comment was received on these amendments. These amendments are identical to those published under Notice of Intended Action and Adopted and Filed Emer gency . The Department adopted these amendments on November 16, 2016. These amendments will have a fiscal impact to local E91 1 service boards. The increase in the wireless E91 1 surchar ge revenue pass-through from 46 percent to 60 percent is projected to increase the annual amount of revenue received by the E91 1 Service Board from $12,800,000 to $16,800,000. The funds made available to the service boards after all costs have been addressed are limited to $4,400,000 in state fiscal year 2017. In state fiscal year 2016, the fund provided $1 1,000,000 to local E91 1 service boards after all costs had been addressed. The $1 1,000,000 expenditure rate was not anticipated to be continued for an extended period of time as the rate was implemented to spend down the surplus balance. After analysis and review of this rule making, no impact on jobs has been found. These amendments are intended to implement Iowa Code chapter 34A as amended by 2016 Iowa Acts, House File 2439 and Senate File 2326. These amendments will become ef fective January 1 1, 2017, at which time the Adopted and Filed Emer gency amendments are hereby rescinded. The following amendments are adopted. I TEM 1 .

This amendment rescinds current Chapter 30 regarding the Impaired Pharmacy Professional and T echnician Recovery Program and adopts new Chapter 30 establishing the Iowa Monitoring Program for Pharmacy Professionals. The program and committee established pursuant to the new chapter are intended to support the evaluation and monitoring of licensees who are impaired as a result of alcohol or drug abuse, dependency , or addiction, or by any mental or physical disorder or disability , while protecting the health, safety and welfare of the public. The program will provide an alternative to formal disciplinary actions against pharmacists, pharmacist-interns, and pharmacy technicians who recognize their impairment and seek assistance and monitoring under the guidance of the program committee. The rules identify the members of the program committee, the or ganization of the committee, and the length of appointment terms. Impaired professionals' eligibility requirements and terms for participation and continued monitoring under the program are established. The rules define actions that constitute noncompliance with the terms of participation in the program and the consequences of noncompliance. The rules identify the circumstances under which program participant records and information may be disclosed to parties other than members of the committee.

The Association suggested amending the membership of the committee established pursuant to subrule 30.3(1) to include \"one pharmacist-intern from each college of pharmacy in Iowa.\" The Board elected not to amend the committee membership in this manner . The colleges of pharmacy are represented on the committee as identified in the subrule. T wo changes from the Notice have been made for consistency and clarity . The word \"committee\" was changed to \"program\" in the definition of \"self-report,\" and the word \"individual\" was changed to \"applicant or licensee\" in subrule 30.4(2). This amendment was approved during the November 2, 2016, meeting of the Board of Pharmacy . After analysis and review of this rule making, the Board has determined that the ef fect of this rule making on jobs cannot be accurately predicted. One of the goals of the Iowa Monitoring Program for Pharmacy Professionals is to encourage pharmacists, pharmacist-interns, and pharmacy technicians who recognize their impairment and who seek assistance and monitoring under the terms of the program to remain in practice within the profession. The continued employment and professional practice af forded these individuals, under the guidance and monitoring provided by this program, should have a positive impact on jobs in Iowa.

ARC 2840C PUBLIC HEAL TH DEP AR TMENT [641] Adopted and Filed Pursuant to the authority of Iowa Code section 137.1 19, the Iowa Department of Public Health hereby amends Chapter 77, \"Local Boards of Health,\" Iowa Administrative Code. The purpose of Chapter 77 is to define the structure, powers, and duties of local boards of health. The chapter also describes a process for voluntarily mer ging local boards of health into a district board of health. T o date, this process has not been utilized to completion. Counties that have attempted to form a district board of health have reached points of impasse, some of which were related to Iowa Code requirements that were too inflexible. 2016 Iowa Acts, Senate File 2159, removed unnecessary barriers to district formation and cumbersome requirements that were part of the application process. It IAB 12/7/16 FILED 1221 PUBLIC HEAL TH DEP AR TMENT[641](cont'd) also removed references to the Iowa public health standards since local boards of health are pursuing national accreditation instead. These amendments reflect the changes that 2016 Iowa Acts, Senate File 2159, made to Iowa Code chapter 137 and allow more flexibility for determining the district board' s membership and makeup, modify documentation required to be submitted to the Department, limit the Department' s role in assessing the application for completeness, and permit the newly mer ged entity to subcontract for a treasurer or auditor if necessary . A new rule is adopted to allow city boards of health to voluntarily dissolve by submitting notice to the Department. Notice of Intended Action was published in the Iowa Administrative Bulletin as ARC 2725C on September 28, 2016. A public hearing was held on October 18, 2016. No public comments were received. These amendments are identical to those published under Notice of Intended Action. The State Board of Health adopted these amendments on November 9, 2016. After analysis and review of this rule making, no impact on jobs has been found. These amendments are intended to implement Iowa Code chapter 137 and 2016 Iowa Acts, Senate File 2159. These amendments will become ef fective on January 1 1, 2017. The following amendments are adopted. I TEM 1 .

ARC 2842C TRANSPOR T A TION DEP AR TMENT [761] Adopted and Filed Pursuant to the authority of Iowa Code sections 307.12 and 307A.2, the Iowa Department of T ransportation, on November 16, 2016, adopted amendments to Chapter 821, \"Highway-Railroad Grade Crossing Surface Repair Fund,\" Iowa Administrative Code. Notice of Intended Action for these amendments was published in the October 12, 2016, Iowa Administrative Bulletin as ARC 2751C . These amendments change the way in which funds are distributed by the Department to assist railroads and highway authorities in repairing highway-railroad grade crossing surfaces. The repair of highway-railroad grade crossing surfaces restores a safe and smooth crossing for the motorist. Applications were only funded in the order in which they were received. Funding applications in the order received left no discretion or process to advance projects based on need, safety or other considerations. These amendments allow the Department to set aside an amount not to exceed 50 percent of the repair fund in any fiscal year for discretionary project selection and set out the criteria to take into consideration when utilizing that funding. Cost sharing between the Department, railroad, and highway authority remains unchanged. Other amendments update the contact information of the Department and the chapter implementation sentence. These rules do not provide for waivers. Any person who believes that the person' s circumstances meet the statutory criteria for a waiver may petition the Department for a waiver under 761\u2014Chapter 1 1. These amendments are identical to those published under Notice of Intended Action. After analysis and review of this rule making, no impact on jobs has been found.
