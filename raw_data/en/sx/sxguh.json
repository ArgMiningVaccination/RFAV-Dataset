This booklet seeks to clarify teenagers' rights under New York State and federal law to make their own medical decisions. It is designed as an aid to teenagers and the professionals - social workers, counselors, teachers, and medical providers - who work with young people. Frequently, professionals can encourage communication between young people and their parents, helping adolescents find needed support as they confront health issues. When teenagers cannot or will not speak to their parents, professionals can encourage them to seek the support of other adults - family members, friends, social workers - rather than face their health problems alone. By publicizing information about adolescents' rights, however, we hope to encourage teens to seek medical care even when they cannot or will not confide in adult family members or friends. We also hope to encourage professionals to respect the rights of adolescents and provide care when a minor does not seek adult involvement. After all, health care without adult involvement is generally preferable to no health care.INTRODUCTION9 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawThe booklet is set up as a reference guide to the situations young people often encounter when seeking health care. Section I defines the basic terms used to describe adolescents' legal rights. Section II explains the general rules about minors' rights to consent to health care and who - such as parents and guardians - can consent when a minor can't. Section II also discusses adolescents who are married, pregnant, parents, emancipated, or incarcerated and therefore may have the right to make some or all of their own health care decisions. Section III outlines the general rules regarding confidentiality in medical care, and those situations where confidentiality may be compromised. In specific areas of health care, adolescents often can make their own health care decisions. Section IV sets forth the types of care that capable adolescents can generally obtain without parental consent. This section clarifies a teen's rights to consent to treatment relating to pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV and AIDS, sexual assault, substance use, and mental health. This section also discusses transgender-related health care, although minors usually cannot consent to this on their own. Section V discusses the specific challenges faced by minors in foster care who seek confidential treatment.Section VI provides an overview of public health insurance programs available to minors. 10 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawAt many points, a hypothetical question is offered to illustrate a scenario that might arise concerning a particular topic. We hope that the answers will further clarify the issues. The endnotes at the back of the book offer more detailed information and provide relevant legal citations. This booklet, however, cannot take the place of individualized legal advice. A young person or provider may need to consult an attorney to address complex legal issues concerning health care. We hope this booklet will assist in educating adolescents and providers about minors' rights, and that it will ultimately help young people get the health care they need and deserve.11 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawINTRODUCTIONI. BASIC DEFINITIONS13 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawI. BASIC DEFINITIONS Who Is a Minor? The law defines a minor as a person under the age of 18.3 A minor is denied certain rights under the law, such as the right to vote or run for elected office. A minor is also entitled to additional protection, such as financial support by a parent. 4 Q T oday is Aisha's 18th birthday. Is she a minor? A N o. She is no longer under the age of 18, so she is no longer a minor. Who Is an Adult? Legally speaking, the term \"adult\" refers to anyone 18 years of age or older. What Is Informed Consent? \"Informed consent,\" also referred to in this booklet as \"consent,\" means that the patient voluntarily agrees to a proposed treatment. In order to consent, patients must have the capacity to consent , meaning they must understand: Their condition, and The nature and purpose of the proposed and alternative treatments, and The predictable risks and benefits of the proposed and alternative treatments (including the option of no treatment at all). 5 14 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawA patient who does not understand all of the above cannot give informed consent. Adults are generally presumed to have the capacity to consent. 6 A health care provider must obtain informed consent before providing medical treatment, unless it would not be reasonable to do so, as is the case in some emergencies. 7 Consent may be given orally or through the use of a written form, and may sometimes be inferred from a patient's conduct (for example, holding out an arm for a shot). 8 A health care provider who fails to obtain consent before treating a patient may be liable for malpractice (subject to exceptions) 9 or assault and battery.10 When a person has the capacity to consent to a health service, that person also has the right to refuse to consent to a health service.11 Accordingly, a person who understands his or her condition and the nature, risks, and benefits of the proposed and alternative treatments cannot be forced to undergo a treatment the patient has declined. Q G eorge is an adult with cognitive impairments. Can he consent to his own care? A M aybe. If the doctor reasonably determines that George understands his medical condition and the consequences of various treatments, the doctor can treat George based on George's own consent, unless a court has appointed someone else to make health care decisions for George. If the doctor believes George lacks the ability to give informed consent, the law sets out a procedure to follow to ensure that George can still get the care he needs. 12 15 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawWhat Is Confidentiality? Confidentiality, with regard to health care, means that information about treatment, such as medical records, cannot be disclosed or released without the permission of the person who consented to the care. 13 Q S arah asks her doctor for a pregnancy test. Her boyfriend later calls the doctor to find out the results for her. Can the doctor disclose the results to Sarah's boyfriend? A N o, not without Sarah's permission. The information is confidential and cannot be disclosed to anyone but Sarah. A health care provider must obtain informed consent before providing medical treatment, unless it would not be reasonable to do so, as is the case in some emergencies.I. BASIC DEFINITIONSII. CONSENTING TO HEALTH CARE17 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawII. CONSENTING TO HEALTH CARE Minors and Consent A minor's right to consent to health care depends on two distinct questions. First, does the minor have the legal right to consent, either because the minor is part of a group to whom the law gives this right (e.g., married minors, minors who are parents, minors in the military) or because the minor is seeking a type of health care for which the law allows a minor to give independent consent (e.g., reproductive health care, certain mental health services)? Second, does the minor have the capacity to consent , meaning the maturity and intelligence to assess the risks and benefits of proposed treatments and alternatives, so as to give informed consent? These two aspects of consent together are prerequisites to the treatment of minors based on their own decisions. In order to authorize treatment independently, a minor must have both the legal right to consent and the capacity to give informed consent . If either of these is missing, the consent of a legally responsible adult will be necessary. This booklet focuses mainly on a minor's legal right to consent. When a passage says minors \"can consent\" or \"can make their own health care decisions,\" it means that the minor has the legal right to consent. Remember, however - whether this is separately mentioned or not - that the minor must also have the capacity to consent before independently authorizing health treatment. There is no minimum age requirement for giving informed consent. Some young minors may have the capacity to consent, while older minors may not. When a minor is consenting on his or her own, a health care provider should document in the medical record how the provider determined the minor's capacity to consent. 18 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawUnder New York law, the following categories of minors may legally consent to all, or much, of their own health care: Pregnant teens, Minors who are parents, Married minors, Minors serving in the armed forces, Emancipated minors, and Incarcerated minors. In addition, a minor who understands the risks and benefits of proposed and alternative treatments can consent to the following types of care: Reproductive health care, including family planning (i.e., birth control, including emergency contraception), abortion, pregnancy/prenatal care, care during labor and delivery, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, including HIV; Certain mental health services; Certain alcohol and drug abuse services; and Sexual assault treatment. Providers also can treat minors in an emergency without parental consent. When treating minors who do not fit into one of the categories described above or when providing other types of care, health care providers must ordinarily obtain parental consent. 19 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawQ D ana is 17. She goes to her doctor to be treated for genital herpes. Does the doctor need to get Dana's parents' permission before treating her? A N o. A minor has the legal right to consent to health care for sexually transmitted infections. So long as Dana has the capacity to consent, meaning that she understands the risks and benefits of the proposed and alternative treatments, parental consent is not required. Adults Who Can Consent on Behalf of a Minor When a minor cannot consent to medical care, the minor can obtain services only with the consent of another person, such as a parent or guardian who can lawfully give such consent . The following adults may consent to health care for a minor. Parents Generally, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their minor children. 14 A parent retains this right even when the parent has decided voluntarily to place the child in foster care.15 Alternatively, a parent whose child is voluntarily placed in foster care may (but need not) delegate medical decision-making authority to the local commissioner of social services. 16 II. CONSENTING TO HEALTH CARE20 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawQ P atricia, 34, has decided that she cannot care for her 14-year-old son, Eric, until she deals with her drinking problem. She places Eric in foster care. Eric needs to be treated for strep throat. Who can consent to Eric's health care? A B ecause she has voluntarily placed Eric in foster care, Patricia can consent to her son's medical treatment, or she could delegate the responsibility for consenting to his care to the local commissioner of social services. Guardians and Parental Designees When a minor has a legal guardian, the guardian may consent to the minor's health care. 17 Also, a parent may designate another person as a \"person in parental relation\" to a minor for a period not exceeding six months. Such a designee may consent to a minor's health care, subject to certain limitations. 18 The Commissioners of Health or Social ServicesIf a family court judge determines that a child has been abused or neglected and takes the child into court custody, or if a child has been removed from his or her parents and placed in the local commissioner's custody, the local commissioner of social services or the local commissioner of health may consent to health care for the child. 19 21 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawQ S isters Jayna and Delia have been removed from their parents based on a judicial finding of neglect and placed in foster care. Neither of the girls has ever had dental care, and both need cavities filled. Who can consent to this treatment? A B ecause a court has placed the children in foster care, the local social services commissioner or health commissioner can consent to dental care for Jayna and Delia. Consent for Vaccinations An adult caring for a child - a parent, legally appointed guardian, custodian, grandparent, adult sibling, adult aunt or uncle, or another adult who has a parent's written authorization to consent to the child's care - may consent to a child's vaccination, 20 even if this adult would not necessarily be able to consent to other health care for the minor. Q T om is six years old and needs a tetanus shot. His parents are out of town, and he is staying with his aunt and uncle. Can they consent to the vaccination for him? A Y es. Even though they are only caring for him temporarily, they can consent to his vaccination, unless they have reason to believe that his parents would object.II. CONSENTING TO HEALTH CARE22 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawThe human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine is an exception. Minors may consent to this vaccine on their own.21 Legal Status and Minors' Rights to Consent to Care New York law grants certain minors the right to consent to all or most health care for themselves. This is true, for example, when a minor is married, pregnant, parenting, serving in the military, or otherwise emancipated. As with anyone seeking treatment, a minor who cannot adequately understand the risks and benefits of treatment cannot consent to care, regardless of legal status. Married Minors Minors who are or have been married may consent to their own medical, dental, health, and hospital care without the consent of any other person. 22 Minors Who Are ParentsIn New York State, parents, regardless of age, may make all decisions relating to medical, dental, health, and hospital services for themselves 23 and their children.24 Q R osa, who is 16, and her two-year-old son, Manuel, both catch the flu. Must Rosa involve her parents in order to get treatment at the doctor's office? A N o. As a parent, Rosa can consent to medical services for herself and her child.23 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawPregnant Minors A pregnant minor can consent to medical, dental, health, and hospital services relating to prenatal care.25 No court has explained the scope of services that may be considered \"relat[ed] to prenatal care.\" Given the courts' long-standing deference to physicians in such matters, 26 however, it is safe to assume that if a physician or other qualified health care provider concludes, in the exercise of sound professional judgment, that a service is related to prenatal care, the provider may offer the service based on the minor's consent. New York law grants certain minors the right to consent to all or most health care for themselves. This is true, for example, when a minor is married, pregnant, parenting, serving in the military, or otherwise emancipated.II. CONSENTING TO HEALTH CARE24 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawQ P riti, who is 15 and pregnant, develops serious dental problems during her pregnancy. May Priti consent on her own to dental care? A I f Priti's dentist concludes that her dental problems are related to her pregnancy (as is often the case), the dentist may treat Priti based on her own consent. Emancipated Minors While there is no statutory definition of \"emancipation\" in New York, courts have defined \"emancipation\" as \"the renunciation of legal duties by a parent and the surrender of parental rights to a child.\" 27 Parents in this state have a continuing responsibility to support their child financially until the child reaches the age of 21, unless the child has become emancipated before turning 21. 28 Once a child is emancipated, the parent no longer has an obligation to support the child. 29 25 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawUnder the common law, emancipation occurs when the minor: Attains economic independence from his or her parents through employment; Enters into military service; Marries; or Withdraws, without cause, from parental supervision and control, in which case a court may decide that \"constructive emancipation\" has occurred. 30 When a minor is married or serving in the military, New York State law makes clear that the minor is emancipated and may therefore consent to health services independently. When a minor has been constructively emancipated or has attained economic independence, however, a health care provider may require proof of emancipation. In these circumstances, youth legal services organizations, such as The Door (https://www.door.org/), assist minors in preparing letters of emancipation, whereby minors attest to living apart from their parents and supporting themselves. 31 These letters set out the factual basis for constructive emancipation, and health care providers may be willing to treat a minor who presents such a letter based on the minor's own consent. 32 Note, however, that these letters of emancipation are not legally binding; it remains in the discretion of the health care provider to decide whether to treat a minor based on such a letter, and a court could later conclude that the minor was in fact constructively emancipated, or not. 33II. CONSENTING TO HEALTH CARE26 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawQ R on, 17, has been living on his own for two years. He is financially self-supporting and lives in an apartment with roommates. He is not in regular communication with either of his parents. He has had serious allergies all his life and has recently learned that his chronic congestion is aggravated by cysts in his sinuses. May Ron consent to surgery to remove the cysts? A P robably. The doctor could reasonably conclude that Ron is emancipated and therefore entitled to make medical decisions for himself. If the doctor were hesitant, Ron might seek the assistance of an organization that could help him prepare a letter of emancipation to further assure the doctor of his emancipated status. Incarcerated Minors Minors who are incarcerated in facilities under the control of the Department of Corrections may generally consent on their own to routine medical, dental, and mental health services. Such care is defined to include \"any routine diagnosis or treatment, including without limitation the administration of medications or nutrition, the extraction of bodily fluids for analysis, and dental care performed with a local anesthetic.\" 34 In addition, incarcerated minors may consent on their own to their immunization against hepatitis B.35 When a court is committing a minor under 18 years old to the Department of Corrections, the judge must ask whether the parents or legal guardian will give the minor permission to consent to routine health care. 36 Even if no parent or guardian gives permission, however, the law provides that the court order committing the minor to the Department of Corrections will be treated as giving the minor the right to consent to routine services. 37 So long as an incarcerated minor is under 18, a parent or guardian may file a 27 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Lawmotion objecting to any routine health service to be provided to the minor based on the minor's own consent.38 The law explicitly recognizes that incarcerated minors retain the right to \"consent on [their] own behalf to any medical, dental or mental health service and treatment where otherwise authorized by law to do so\" (as with most reproductive health and many mental health services). 39 These same rules apply to minors who have been found delinquent and placed with the Office of Children and Family Services, a social services district, or the division for youth. 40 Mature Minors While New York grants certain minors the right to consent to health care, as described above, New York courts have not yet declared that every mature minor has such a right. Many states have adopted a \"mature minor\" doctrine or statute, allowing any minor with the capacity to understand the risks and benefits of proposed and alternative treatments to consent or refuse consent to such treatment. 41 New York has no such statute, and the only court to have directly considered the issue declined to decide whether the mature minor doctrine applies in this state. 42 While several guidance documents on medical ethics and practice advise practitioners to treat mature minors based on their own consent, 43 New York law has not yet followed this path.II. CONSENTING TO HEALTH CAREIII. CONFIDENTIALITY IN HEALTH CARE29 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawIII. CONFIDENTIALITY IN HEALTH CARE General Confidentiality Rules Unless otherwise specified by law, a health care provider may not reveal confidential information about a patient without the patient's permission. 44 When the patient is a minor, the right to control the disclosure of health information generally follows the right to consent independently to the underlying health service that is the subject of the information. Federal law gives a minor the right to authorize the disclosure of health information if the minor consented to the health service in accordance with state law . 45 In addition, when a parent agrees that his or her minor child can have a confidential relationship with a health professional, the minor is entitled to control the health information pertaining to any service provided within the scope of that confidential relationship. 46 Generally speaking, therefore, when a minor consents to health care, the information relating to that care may not be disclosed without the minor's permission . New York law reinforces this general federal rule in an important respect. State regulations create a Statewide Health Information Network, an electronic information-sharing platform for health care providers, health plans, governmental entities, and others. The state regulations governing the network define \"minor consent patient information\" as \"patient information relating to health care of a patient under 18 years of age for which the patient provided his or her own consent as permitted by law, without a parent's or guardian's permission.\" 47 The state regulations go on to say that no entity participating in the Statewide Health Information Network may \"disclose minor consent patient information to the minor's parent or guardian without the minor's authorization.\" 48 Thus, in New York, a health care provider, plan, or government entity that participates in the Statewide Health Information Network (as most do or soon will) needs the written authorization of a minor patient before disclosing information to a parent about a health service for which the minor gave legal, independent consent . 49 30 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawViolation of the federal regulations can result in the imposition of civil monetary penalties (as well as other penalties available under other law) by the agencies charged with enforcement. 50 Breaches of the rules governing the Statewide Health Information Network can lead to warnings, restrictions on participation in the Network, or fines. 51 Violating other, more general state confidentiality rules constitutes professional misconduct and may be punished by fine, reprimand, or revocation of a license. 52 Additionally, a patient may sue a health care provider for damages for breaching his or her confidentiality in violation of New York law. 53 When it is the parent, and not the minor, who consents to the minor's care, information about the treatment usually may be disclosed to the parent. Sometimes, however, the law requires or allows a health care provider to withhold information about a minor patient from the parent even when a parent consented to the initial treatment. A health care provider must not reveal information to a minor patient's parents if the provider determines that disclosure would be detrimental to the provider's relationship with the minor, to the care and treatment of the minor, or to the minor's relationship with his or her parents. 54 A provider may withhold information from a minor patient's parents if the minor is over the age of 12 and objects to the disclosure. In such cases, the health care provider should rely on his or her judgment as to whether to disclose the information. 55 A provider may withhold information from a minor patient's parents if (i) the provider reasonably believes the minor is subject to abuse or neglect by the parent, (ii) disclosure could endanger the minor, and (iii) the provider determines in the exercise of professional judgment that it is not in the best interest of the minor to involve the parent. 56 31 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawQ W hen James turns 13, his pediatrician, Dr. Song, has a talk with him and his mother, and they all agree that James will have a confidential relationship with Dr. Song going forward: James will be allowed to decide, in consultation with Dr. Song, when to involve his mother in health care decisions. When James is 16, he sees Dr. Song about a rash in his genital area that appeared after he started wearing a cup for hockey practice. Dr. Song recommends a prescription for an antifungal cream. James does not want to consult his mother about this. Must Dr. Song get consent from James's mother before prescribing the cream? A N o. Because James' mother assented to the confidential relationship between James and Dr. Song, Dr. Song can rely on James's informed consent and need not get prior consent from his mother. 57 NOTE: Health care confidentiality rules generally apply only to health care professionals and the individuals they supervise.58 These rules do not apply to people who obtain confidential health information in nonprofessional capacities, such as friends, family members, neighbors, and landlords. In certain narrow circumstances, the law may require or allow a health care provider to breach confidentiality and disclose information to specified person(s) or institution(s). However, even under these circumstances, other guarantees of privacy remain and general disclosure is not allowed. (See below, When Otherwise Confidential Care May Not Be Confidential.)III. CONFIDENTIALITY IN HEALTH CARE32 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawSchools and Confidentiality The law governing the confidentiality of school health records is unsettled. Federal and state laws generally give parents the right to access the \"education records\" of their minor children.59 Education records are broadly defined to include those containing \"information directly related to a student\" and \"maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a person acting for such agency or institution.\" 60 The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted this definition to refer to records kept in a central location or a permanent secure database by \"agents of the school, such as teachers, administrators, and other school employees.\" 61 It is unclear how this definition applies to health records maintained at a school. Some records, including health screening and immuniza t ion records collected and kept as a condition of enrollment, must be disclosed to parents upon their request. 62 Other records may be subject to mandatory disclosure to parents or not, depending on the context. Given the Supreme Court's interpretation of the relevant federal law, it appears to make a difference whether the health records at issue are stored in the school's central files or database and maintained by school employees. Private medical records, separately maintained by school-based health professionals, may be beyond the reach of the federal law . 63 School-based health care providers would do well to check with counsel before denying or releasing sensitive health information to parents . Such providers should also let students know whether the information they provide will be kept confidential, and students should ask about confidentiality protections, especially if they have particular concerns in this regard. In-school programs aimed at preventing or treating drug and alcohol abuse are in a special category. Those subject to federal regulation or receiving federal assistance (whether directly or indirectly) are 33 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Lawbound by federal confidentiality requirements.64 These requirements permit disclosure only with the prior written consent of the patient except in narrow circumstances such as to avert a medical emergency or to comply with a court order. 65 Other adults with whom a minor may interact at school - such as teachers, guidance counselors, social workers, and coaches - are not necessarily required to keep conversations confidential. However, professional ethics and student privacy rights weigh against disclosing to third parties highly personal information, such as information about a student's pregnancy, sexual orientation, or mental health. 66 As with other licensed health professionals, school health care Some records, including health screening and immuniza tion records collected and kept as a condition of enrollment, must be disclosed to parents upon their request. providers who reveal confidential information without permission may be subject to professional discipline and may also be sued for illegal disclosure. 67 Schools that disclose confidential student records without the written consent of the student's parents also face loss of federal funding. 68 III. CONFIDENTIALITY IN HEALTH CARE34 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawQ P huong, a high school junior, complains to the school nurse that she has a sore throat and cannot eat. Phuong's parents signed a consent form at the beginning of the school year authorizing the nurse to treat Phuong. Can the nurse reveal this information to Phuong's parents? To the principal? A T he nurse may and, on their request, probably must disclose the information to Phuong's parents because of their rights to access their child's \"education records,\" including those health records maintained in a central school location or database by school employees. However, the medical information should not be disclosed to the principal without Phuong's parents' consent. Q I n a counseling session with the school social worker, Jessi reveals that she is a lesbian. She asks the social worker not to tell anyone. Can the social worker \"out\" Jessi to her parents? A T he professional obligation to maintain the confidences of clients would normally prevent the social worker from reaching out affirmatively to inform Jessi's parents, but if the social worker makes notes of the information, which are then stored in the school's permanent files, Jessi's parents would probably have a right to view those records. 35 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawQ D iana, 16, gives her gym teacher a note requesting that she be excused from gym because she is pregnant. Is the teacher bound by confidentiality? A M aybe. Generally, teachers do not have the same confidentiality obligations as health professionals. Depending on the circumstances, however, disclosure might violate professional ethics and/or the student's privacy rights. It would be best for the teacher to talk to the student about whether she has the support of her parents or other adults regarding the pregnancy. If the student needs additional support, the teacher might work with her to approach social workers, counselors, or others trained to advise students in such situations. Some schools reach beyond their disclosure obligations to create policies that compromise students' confidentiality. For example, some schools ask school nurses, psychologists, and social workers to report a student's pregnancy to her parents and/or school officials. 69 Such policies put school-based health care providers at risk of committing professional misconduct by affirmatively revealing students' confidential communications. A school-based health care professional asked to do this should consult with an attorney. When Otherwise Confidential Care May Not Be Confidential In certain situations, a health care provider may not be able to keep information relating to a minor's care completely confidential. Sometimes, the law requires a health care provider to report patient information to a government agency, 70 and in other situations, a provider may be compelled to reveal a confidential communication in a legal proceeding. III. CONFIDENTIALITY IN HEALTH CARE36 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawThis section identifies some of the situations in which health care may not be entirely confidential. In talking about issues of confidentiality with any patient, medical ethics dictate that providers discuss possible legal limitations on the confidential nature of their relationship.71 Child Abuse Reporting What Is the Child Abuse Reporting Law? New York's mandatory child abuse reporting law carves a narrow exception into a professional's duty of confidentiality to minor patients. This law requires all \"mandated reporters\" - including health care providers and school officials 72 - to make a report to the State Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment when they have a reasonable suspicion that a minor is abused or neglected by a parent, guardian, custodian (any person regularly found in the child's household) , 73 or other person legally responsible for the child's care .74 A mandated reporter who works in a school, institution, facility, or agency must personally report suspected child abuse to the State Central Register and immediately inform the director of his or her place of employment. 75 A report will trigger an investigation of the parent or other responsible person. The patient's or student's permission is not required. A caregiver is guilty of abuse 76 or neglect77 if the caregiver directly harms a child or acts in a way that allows78 a child to be physically or emotionally harmed or sexually abused.The child abuse reporting law does not automatically apply whenever a child is a victim of a crime. The appropriateness of a child abuse report depends on whether the wrongdoer is legally responsible for the child's care. Further, reports to the Central Register can trigger an investigation only of the minor's parent(s) or other custodian or caregiver. Child protective services agencies are not 37 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Lawauthorized to investigate crimes committed against children by third parties who are not legally responsible for the minor's care. When a mandated reporter has a reasonable suspicion of child abuse, a failure to report can lead to liability.79 In contrast, the law immunizes mandated reporters from liability when they make a report in good faith, without willful misconduct or gross negligence. 80 NOTE: A separate law governs physical or sexual abuse that is committed against a student by a school employee or volunteer. School employees must report any allegations of such abuse to school authorities, not to the Central Register. 81 How Might the Reporting Law Present a Confidentiality Problem for Non-Abused Minors?Some health care providers have questioned whether they must make a report of child abuse or neglect when they learn that a parent is aware of and has not taken steps to prevent an underage patient's voluntary sexual activity. These questions arise because the law provides that caregivers who allow a sexual offense to be committed against a child may be considered abusive. 82 According to New York criminal law, any minor age 16 or younger who engages in vaginal, oral, or anal sex is a victim of \"sexual misconduct,\" even when the activity is consensual.83 Therefore, when parents know that their underage child is having sex and do nothing to stop it, the question is whether the parents are \"allowing\" a sexual offense to be committed against their child. New York courts have declined to give the child abuse statute so broad and untenable a reading, refusing to countenance child abuse charges against the parents of every sexually active minor in the state. 84 Instead, the courts have concluded that an abuse charge based on underage sexual activity \"must be limited to those parents III. CONFIDENTIALITY IN HEALTH CARE38 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Lawwho fail to intervene in forced sexual relationships of which they have personal knowledge .\"85 Therefore, it is not child abuse for a parent to know that a minor child has chosen to be sexually active and to do nothing to stop it. Of course, this does not apply where the teenager is having sexual relations with a family member or where the sex is coerced. Mandated reporters should try to understand the circumstances that led to a younger minor's pregnancy, STI, or other indication of sexual activity. A report of child abuse or neglect is warranted where the minor was coerced to have sex or subjected to sexual abuse, and a parent or other caregiver knew or should have known of the coercion or abuse and did not take reasonable steps to prevent it. Where the minor is immature and the minor's more mature sexual partner seems to wield outsize influence or power over the minor, a health care provider may conclude in the exercise of appropriate professional judgment that the relationship is coercive or abusive. In that case, a parent's acquiescence to the relationship would be reportable. A report based on a parent's assent to a minor's consensual sexual activity is unwarranted, however, if the minor's sexual relationship is voluntary. Q D aniel, who is 16 years old, is planning to make an appointment with a clinic to check for STIs. He is sexually active with his boyfriend, who is 19. Should Daniel be concerned that the clinic might report his case to child protective services because he is technically a victim of the crime of sexual misconduct? A T he law is on the side of Daniel's care remaining confidential. Courts have determined that parents are not guilty of abuse merely for knowing that their adolescent son or daughter is having consensual sexual relations. In addition, Daniel's boyfriend is not a proper subject of a child abuse report - only parents, custodians, or guardians are. 39 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawQ M ust Daniel reveal his boyfriend's name if his health care provider asks? A N o. Daniel can keep this information private. Q W hat if a minor who is a few years younger than Daniel seeks care related to sexual activity? A D epending on the particular minor's maturity, the minor's partner's age, and other circumstances of the sexual relationship, some providers may determine that a younger minor has been forced or coerced into a sexual relationship with an adult. In that case, a provider with a reasonable suspicion that a parent or legally responsible adult has allowed the sexual abuse to occur, and thus abused or neglected the child, is obligated to report the parent. Sexually Transmitted Infection Reporting Health care providers are obligated to report to county and/or state departments of health all cases of syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. Positive HIV test results are also subject to reporting . For a detailed discussion of these laws and how they relate to patient confidentiality, see Section IV. Prevention of \"Harmful Acts\" to Third Parties Psychologists, psychiatrists, and rape crisis counselors may breach confidentiality to notify an endangered person and/or III. CONFIDENTIALITY IN HEALTH CARE40 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Lawthe police if a patient presents a serious and imminent danger to another person.86 However, notification is not mandatory.87 Court Proceedings As a general rule, health care providers may not disclose confidential medical information without the patient's consent. This rule extends to court proceedings, protecting health professionals from having to testify about confidential information they receive from their patients or clients. Such testimonial privileges apply to communications between a patient and a physician, registered professional nurse, licensed practical nurse, dentist, podiatrist, chiropractor, 88 psychologist,89 social worker,90 rape crisis counselor,91 medical corporation, professional service corporation, or university faculty practice. 92 However, even these providers may be compelled to testify in court or release confidential records in connection with child abuse or neglect proceedings 93 and when a patient under the age of 16 has been the victim of a crime.94 NOTE: Although providers have an affirmative obligation to report reasonable suspicions of child abuse, there is no such obligation regarding other crimes committed against a minor patient, with the exception of mandated reports of gunshot and life-threatening stab wounds. 95 In fact, making a police report without the patient's consent would violate confidentiality and constitute professional misconduct. 96 Confidentiality Among Health Care Providers and in the Insurance and Billing ProcessWhen information is shared among health care providers or between providers, health plans, and insured individuals, confidentiality can be compromised . Problems can arise, for example, when parents seek access to their children's electronic health records for a permissible purpose, but the records include 41 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Lawwhat should be confidential information; breaches can also occur when bills or explanations of benefits are sent home. Under New York law governing the Statewide Health Information Network - which permits the sharing of electronic health records among providers, insurers, government agencies, and others - parents may authorize participants in the Network to view minors' health records. 97 Parents have this authority even when a minor's health record pertains to confidential health services to which the minor consented and even though parents themselves are not permitted to review such records without the minor's authorization . 98 The regulations include exceptions for minors who are emancipated and when federal or state law or regulation requires the minor's authorization for the disclosure. 99 The federal HIPAA regulations, in contrast, prevent parents from authorizing the release of a minor's health care information and give that right instead to minors themselves when the information pertains to a service to which the minor gave independent legal consent. 100 It would seem that the federal regulation entitling minors to control health information about services to which they have consented requires the minor's authorization for disclosure of the information to Network participants, and that the federal regulation therefore overrides the New York regulation entitling parents to authorize such disclosures. Despite the NY regulation, therefore, it would be advisable for providers to get the consent of the minor before disclosing to Network participants health information pertaining to a service to which the minor gave independent, legal consent. This situation is confusing enough that mistakes may well occur. III. CONFIDENTIALITY IN HEALTH CARE42 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawQ J ade's father has given Jade's pediatrician, Dr. Samedi, written authorization to access all health information in the Network about Jade. Under the New York regulations, this general authorization appears to be sufficient to enable Dr. Samedi to see records about Jade's visit to a reproductive health clinic to be tested and treated for an STI, even though Jade consented to that service and her father is not supposed to see the related information. If Jade's family is moving to another state, and her father asks Dr. Samedi for a paper copy of Jade's entire health record to give to her new pediatrician, should Dr. Samedi turn over the records? A N ot in their entirety. Dr. Samedi has an obligation not to give Jade's father the part of the record pertaining to the STI treatment to which Jade consented. But because that information is part of Jade's lifelong medical record, because the New York regulations appear to give Dr. Samedi access to that record based on Jade's father's general consent, and because the regulations include no mandatory provisions for segregation or special treatment of sensitive health information, 101 the STI record could inadvertently end up in the hands of Jade's father. 43 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawA minor's best workaround may be to ask providers of sensitive services in fields such as reproductive health, mental health, and substance abuse treatment if their patient information can be kept out of the Statewide Health Information Network . The New York regulations allow, but do not require, the \"qualified entities\" that manage the Network to provide a means for patients to withhold their health information. 102 If a minor sees a health care provider whose \"qualified entity\" offers this option, it may be possible to keep confidential information out of the Network. Minors seeking care through the Medicaid program face other issues with regard to electronic information sharing; these issues are discussed more fully in the public insurance section of this booklet (Section VI). The medical billing process can also lead to breaches of confidentiality , 103 and these breaches may affect young adults because New York law permits parents to cover their otherwise uninsured children up to age 29. 104 Billing practices can lead to unintended disclosures in a number of ways. For example, a state law requires managed care plans to notify the patient in writing and by phone regarding initial coverage determinations as to services that require preauthorization. 105 It is therefore essential that providers find out whether the relevant HMOs require preauthorization and discuss the possible consequences with the patient. There is no perfect solution to the problem of confidentiality in the medical billing process, but to minimize the risk of involuntary disclosure to parents, a provider can: Refer a minor patient for free care when available and advise the minor that the referral may ensure confidentiality that might otherwise be breached in the billing process;III. CONFIDENTIALITY IN HEALTH CARE44 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Law Discuss insurance, medical and lab billing, and alternative forms of payment with the minor patient and inform the patient if the billing process may compromise confidentiality; Warn a patient when a health service being sought requires preauthorization and will trigger a determination notice by mail and telephone to the minor's residence; Ask the minor patient for alternative contact information if the patient does not want to be contacted at home; federal and state regulations mandate that health care providers honor reasonable requests to alter the manner in which the provider communicates with the patient, and require insurance companies to honor requests to send information to a different address if disclosure of the information could endanger the patient; 106 Request that an insurance plan require prenotification instead of preauthorization for a procedure, thereby avoiding mandatory calls and mailings to the household; Educate the billing department about minors' rights to confidentiality and be sensitive to the diagnosis and treatment stated on bills that are sent home; and Consult with legal counsel before releasing any medical records that might result in harm to the adolescent patient. A minor receiving confidential care should be aware that billing may lead to inadvertent breaches of confidentiality and should always: Ask providers whether treatment bills, lab bills, or other documents will be sent home; Discuss using an alternative contact address for the purposes of such documents; and Ask about sliding pay scales and cash payments that may reduce insurance and other billing problems.45 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawQ J ose, who is 16, receives treatment for a sexually transmitted infection. Because of the type of treatment, he does not need parental consent and the care is confidential. He decides to pay for the treatment by using his parents' insurance plan. Will information about his treatment be disclosed to his parents through the billing process? A P ossibly. The health care provider cannot disclose the information to Jose's parents. However, there is a risk of limited disclosure through the insurance process. By asking the insurance company about its notification procedures, both patient and provider can identify and respond to any risks.III. CONFIDENTIALITY IN HEALTH CAREIV. TYPES OF HEALTH CARE THAT MINORS CAN RECEIVE WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT47 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawIV. TYPES OF HEALTH CARE THAT MINORS CAN RECEIVE WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT Birth Control Birth control is used to prevent pregnancy and to address a variety of health conditions. Contraceptives come in many different forms, including hormone-based birth control pills, intrauterine devices, implants, shots, condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides. Consent and Access A minor may consent to confidential contraceptive services and prescriptions without parental involvement. The federal constitutional right to privacy underlies the right of adults to receive confidential contraceptive services. 107 The U.S. Supreme Court has extended this privacy right to minors in matters relating to the use of contraception.108 For this reason, the government cannot restrict a minor's access to contraception without a compelling reason. 109 There are no such restrictions under New York law. Therefore, a minor's right to confidential contraception without parental notification or consent is protected in New York . Moreover, when a minor's health care is publicly funded, his or her access to contraceptive services is further protected. Two federal programs require that family planning services and supplies be provided confidentially to all eligible recipients, including sexually active minors: Medicaid 110 and Title X of the Public Health Service Act.111 Thus, if a clinic or hospital receives funding under either of these programs, it must offer a broad range of contraceptives to minors based on their own consent. Even when a court places a minor in a religiously affiliated foster care agency, the minor must be given access to reproductive health information and services, including contraception. 11248 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawConfidentiality As discussed above, a minor is entitled to confidential family planning services without parental involvement.113 Furthermore, courts have repeatedly construed the confidentiality safeguards of the Medicaid and Title X statutes to prohibit parental consent or notification requirements for teenagers entitled to family planning services under these programs. 114 Q A 1 4-year-old girl, Carla, wants to get a prescription for birth control pills. Does she need parental consent? A N o. Prescription contraceptives, like all other forms of contraception, must be made available based on the independent consent of a minor with the capacity to understand the risks and benefits of the prescribed drug and its alternatives. Exception: Sterilization Even though sterilization is a form of birth control, the laws governing sterilization are much stricter than those applicable to other birth control services. Neither federal nor state funding may be used for the sterilization of anyone under 21 years old. 115 Further, in New York City, sterilizations may not be performed on anyone under 21 years of age, regardless of the funding source. 116 These restrictions reflect the permanent nature of sterilization and mitigate the risk of past abuses that involved the involuntary sterilization of women of color, poor women, and women with disabilities. 11749 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawEmergency Contraception Emergency contraception (EC), or the \"morning after pill,\" is a high-dose birth control pill that prevents pregnancy if taken shortly after unprotected sexual intercourse. EC is contraception; it cannot interrupt an already existing pregnancy, and it is not the same as a drug known as mifepristone (RU-486), which is taken to induce abortion during the first several weeks of a pregnancy. Most types of EC are effective when taken within 72 (sometimes up to 120) hours after unprotected sex, with effectiveness varying by brand and type. 118 As a rule, the sooner EC is taken following unprotected sex, the more successful it is in preventing pregnancy. To facilitate fast access to EC, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists urges doctors to provide advance prescriptions for EC to patients during routine gynecologic visits. 119 Purchasing Emergency ContraceptionIn April 2013, the FDA approved certain types of EC for sale to people over the age of 15 without a prescription. Following litigation, the FDA revised this approval to include all minors of childbearing age. 120 Minors can also obtain certain types of EC directly from family planning clinics and other providers across the state. Emergency Contraception, Medicaid, and Title X Both over-the-counter and prescription EC are covered by New York State Medicaid. Medicaid clients do not need to present a fiscal note or any documentation from a doctor to use Medicaid to purchase EC from a pharmacist. 121 Also, Title X - a federal program that gives grants to support family planning and other preventive services - requires grantees to include a broad range of acceptable and effective family planning methods. 122 IV. TYPES OF HEALTH CARE THAT MINORS CAN RECEIVE WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT50 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawTitle X guidelines further advise providers to offer the full range of FDA-approved contraceptive methods.123 Based on these guidelines, many Title X clinics offer EC on the same basis as any other safe and effective family planning method. Emergency Contraception and Rape Crisis Care The New York State Public Health Law requires every hospital providing emergency treatment to a survivor of sexual assault to provide prompt written and oral information about EC, and to provide EC when requested. 124 ConsentBecause EC is a method of contraception, it is available to all minors without the consent of a parent . 125 ConfidentialityBecause minors have the right to consent to contraceptive services, information relating to EC may not be disclosed without the permission of the patient. 126 Abortion Various methods of abortion are available depending upon the stage of pregnancy, the patient's preferences, and other medical indications. Abortions by all methods have low complication rates.127 Patients should talk to their providers about which method of abortion is best for them. Consent A minor in New York can obtain an abortion without parental involvement. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that a state may require parental involvement in a minor's abortion decision if the 51 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Lawstate also provides an alternative procedure for the minor to seek authorization from a court.128 But New York State does not require parental consent or notification. Therefore, a pregnant teen in New York may consent to (or refuse) an abortion, as long as she understands the risks and benefits of the procedure and its alternatives . ConfidentialityNew York law forbids the release of medical records pertaining to a minor's abortion to the minor's parents without explicit consent from the minor. 129 As a matter of practice, most providers encourage teenagers to involve their parents or other supportive adults in their abortion decisions. Most teens do voluntarily consult one or both parents about their abortion decisions, 130 and those who do not often have compelling reasons including, among others, a reasonable fear of abuse or of exacerbating already strained family situations.131 Q K im is 15. She is from Iowa but is staying in New York for the summer for a dance program. She has found out that she is pregnant and wants to terminate the pregnancy. Does she need parental consent? A N o. While Kim is in New York, she will be treated according to New York law. She does not need parental consent.IV. TYPES OF HEALTH CARE THAT MINORS CAN RECEIVE WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT52 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawSexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) Consent A minor who provides informed consent can be tested or treated for a sexually transmitted infection without a parent's or guardian's consent . 132 Q T anya is 15. She thinks she might have herpes, but she doesn't want to tell her parents. Can she get medical attention without telling them? A Y es. Whether by diagnosis, prescription, or surgical treatment, physicians may treat adolescents for STIs without parental consent. So long as Tanya has the capacity to provide informed consent, the doctor may not disclose information about STI services to her parents without her permission. Confidentiality New York and federal law expressly forbid the release of information about STIs to parents or guardians without the patient's permission.133 Health care providers must, however, comply with New York regulations that require them to report suspected or confirmed cases of communicable diseases. Because New York includes syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia in its list of communicable diseases, physicians must report cases of these STIs to state health officials. 134 The reporting requirements allow for limited disclosure of personal information only to certain specified state officials. 135 Moreover, New York law adds special confidentiality protections to reports of 53 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Lawsyphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia: The state or local departments of health that receive and maintain such reports must keep them confidential, except that very limited disclosure may be permitted to other public health agencies for purposes of disease control. 136 HIV/AIDS The law differentiates HIV/AIDS from other STIs and provides special protections for the confidentiality of people living with HIV or AIDS, but narrow exceptions in the law require disclosure of HIV/AIDS information in limited circumstances (see below). 137 ConsentA minor who provides informed consent may be tested and treated for HIV/AIDS without a parent's or guardian's consent and may also consent to preventive care to avoid infection . 138 Q R aoul, a 16-year-old who lives with his mother, is HIV- positive, but has not told his mother. Raoul has now developed an AIDS-related illness and wants medical care but will avoid treatment if he is required to tell his mother. Can a physician treat Raoul without parental consent? A Y es. A physician may treat Raoul without consulting his parents. However, the physician may want to help Raoul talk to his mother or find a supportive adult in whom he can confide about his situation.IV. TYPES OF HEALTH CARE THAT MINORS CAN RECEIVE WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT54 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawQ J im and Toni, both minors, are considering a sexual relationship. Jim has been sexually active before and believes he may have been exposed to HIV. Toni has never been sexually active before and wants to prevent exposure to HIV. Can Toni consent to using pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to avoid infection? 139 A Y es. A provider can prescribe PrEP based on Toni's own informed consent. Testing New York law requires informed consent before an HIV test can be administered. 140 Because the capacity to consent to such testing is determined without regard to age,141 a minor with capacity has the right to consent to - or to refuse - HIV testing. Primary care providers, hospitals, and certain diagnostic and treatment centers are legally required to offer HIV testing to every individual \"age thirteen and older (or younger than thirteen if there is evidence or indication of risk activity).\" 142 The law contains an exception to the written consent requirement for newborns, who are routinely tested at birth without parental consent, even though the test may not accurately reveal the baby's HIV status and may indicate whether the mother is HIV-positive. 143 An individual who decides to get an HIV test may choose to have either an anonymous test at a Department of Health site or a confidential test . The difference between the two types of tests is the degree of confidentiality associated with the results. Anonymous testing means that the person being tested does not reveal his or 55 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Lawher name; informed consent is given through use of a coded system with no linking of individual identity to the test request or results.144 Therefore, the results can never be traced to the individual. Anonymous HIV/AIDS testing sites can be located by calling 311 or the regional Anonymous HIV Testing Programs listed in the state and city health department publication, Say Yes to the HIV Test, https://www.health.ny.gov/publications/9678.pdf (p. 4). All other HIV testing is confidential , which means that while the results will largely be kept confidential, they will be subject to reporting and contact notification disclosures (see below). Confidentiality Because people living with HIV/AIDS often face discrimination, confidential HIV-related information - meaning any information about whether a person has had an HIV-related test, has tested positive for HIV, or has an HIV-related illness or AIDS - generally may not be disclosed without the patient's permission. The law explicitly forbids physicians, health officers, social services providers, and health care facilities from releasing confidential information, except in specified circumstances, and only to designated individuals or facilities. 145 In fact, any person who discloses confidential HIV-related information without a signed release under circumstances other than those prescribed by law (see below) is subject to civil and criminal penalties. 146 Special Confidentiality Considerations in HIV/AIDS Care Disclosure to a Minor's Parents or Guardians A person who obtains confidential HIV-related information in the course of providing any health or social service to a minor may disclose such information to the minor's parent or guardian without the minor's permission only if : IV. TYPES OF HEALTH CARE THAT MINORS CAN RECEIVE WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT56 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Law the minor lacks the capacity to consent to the HIV/AIDS services at issue; and the parent or guardian is lawfully authorized to consent on the minor's behalf; and 147 the physician reasonably believes that disclosure is medically necessary in order to provide timely care and treatment; and the physician has given the minor appropriate counseling regarding the need to disclose the information to the minor's parents, and the minor still will not make the disclosure. 148 Even if all the above conditions are met, a physician may not disclose confidential information to a minor's parents if: the physician concludes in the exercise of professional judgment that \"the disclosure would not be in the best interest of\" the minor; or the minor is otherwise authorized by law to consent to HIV-related care, for example by virtue of marriage, parenthood, pregnancy, or emancipation ( see Section II). 149 All decisions regarding parental involvement in a minor's HIV/AIDS treatment, including the reason for the decision, must be noted in the minor's medical record. 150 Disclosure to a Minor's Adoption or Foster Care Agency, Adoptive or Foster Parents, or AttorneyWhile a minor in foster care or waiting for adoption has the same right to refuse or consent to an HIV test or treatment as any other minor, information about such testing or treatment is sometimes subject to broader disclosure. Note, however, that as with any other patient, minors who receive an anonymous HIV test will be assured confidentiality.57 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawWhen a minor in foster care or awaiting adoption is tested confidentially, but not anonymously, HIV-related information must be released to the following: An authorized foster care or adoption agency,151 which must in turn disclose the information to the minor's prospective foster or adoptive parents, or to relatives or other responsible persons who will assume care of the child through official placements; 152 An attorney appointed to represent the minor (generally in child abuse or neglect proceedings) insofar as disclosure of the information serves the purpose of enabling the attorney to represent the minor. If the minor is capable of consenting to his or her own health care, the attorney cannot redisclose the information to anyone else without the minor's permission. 153 Disclosure Pursuant to Written ConsentA patient's general authorization for the release of medical information is insufficient to authorize disclosure of HIV-related information. Rather, written consent must specify that HIV-related information is to be disclosed. 154 Disclosure without specific written consent is punishable by a jail sentence or fine.155 Disclosure Pursuant to a Court Order Providers may be required by court order to disclose confidential HIV-related information to someone who would not otherwise have access. 156 However, the person requesting the court order must prove extraordinary circumstances to justify the disclosure, and the court must safeguard the confidentiality of the HIV-related information. 157IV. TYPES OF HEALTH CARE THAT MINORS CAN RECEIVE WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT58 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawTests and Diagnoses of HIV: Reports to the Department of Health Physicians and other designated medical personnel must report to the New York State Commissioner of Health the names of individuals who receive a positive HIV test, a diagnosis of AIDS, or a diagnosis of an AIDS-related illness. 158 In addition, laboratories must divulge the results of other HIV-related tests, regardless of the patient's stage of treatment. 159 The New York State Department of Health cannot disclose any of this information further, except to the extent necessary to conduct contact tracing. Tests and Diagnoses of HIV: Contact Tracing A health care provider is also required by law to report to public health officials all known sexual and needle-sharing contacts upon a test or diagnosis . 160 \"Known contacts\" may include a spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend, whether the name is disclosed by the patient or known independently by the provider. 161 However, the patient is not required to name any contacts162 and cannot be punished or denied treatment for refusing to do so.163 Further, although the provider must ask the patient for contact names, the patient is not required to conduct independent research to identify additional contacts. 164 After receiving reports from health care providers, local public health officials determine whether contact notification will protect the public health. If so, the officials are responsible for notifying reported contacts that they may have been exposed to HIV. 165 Public health officials responsible for notifying contacts may not disclose any information relating to the identity of the original HIV patient or any other contact. 166 However, a contact may be able to figure out independently who triggered the report and notification. Before making a report to a public health official, a health care provider must screen the patient for signs of domestic violence.167 The public health official will defer notifying a contact if the patient 59 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Lawreports that notifying a particular contact would severely risk the physical health and safety of the patient, his or her children, or someone else.168 Disclosure of domestic violence involving children can also lead to a child abuse investigation. An individual always has the option of anonymous HIV testing. Individuals who are tested anonymously will not be reported. Anonymous testing ensures confidentiality because related information cannot be traced back to that person. However, reporting and contact notification rules are triggered once treatment begins. 169 Q M aya, who is 15, thinks that she might be HIV-positive. She is worried that her boyfriend, Sean, who is 17 and has a temper, might find out that she has cheated on him if he learns of her HIV status. What are Maya's options? A M aya can get tested for HIV at an anonymous HIV testing site. She will be given a coded receipt that she can use to get her results without revealing her identity. If Maya tests positive, however, she cannot maintain complete anonymity once she begins treatment. Her treating doctor will perform a diagnostic test to confirm that Maya is indeed HIV-positive, which will trigger the reporting and contact notification laws. Maya can choose not to share Sean's name with her doctor, or if her regular doctor already knows of Sean, Maya can choose to see a new doctor for treatment after receiving the anonymous test results. If Maya does tell her doctor about Sean or if she uses her regular doctor, contact notification could still be deferred if there is a severe risk that Sean will physically injure Maya or otherwise threaten her safety, although notification will be reconsidered at a later date.IV. TYPES OF HEALTH CARE THAT MINORS CAN RECEIVE WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT60 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawQ D r. Johnson has been treating Samuel, 17, for five years. With Samuel's informed consent, Dr. Johnson recently ordered an HIV test that turned out positive. Dr. Johnson tells Samuel that she is required by law to ask about and report any sexual or needle-sharing partners that he may have, but that Samuel is not required to share the names of such people. Samuel chooses not to tell Dr. Johnson of any contacts. What are Dr. Johnson's obligations to report? A D r. Johnson must report Samuel and any of his contacts who are known to Dr. Johnson. For example, if Dr. Johnson knows Samuel recently got married, she must include Samuel's spouse as a contact in her report. However, Dr. Johnson does not need to perform any additional or independent investigatory work (such as interviewing other people) in order to have made a good faith report to the Department of Health. Even without such extra efforts, Dr. Johnson has fulfilled her reporting duty and will not be penalized for failing to identify or locate additional contacts. Ongoing HIV Treatment: Partner/Contact Notification In addition to the notification requirements associated with tests and diagnoses, a physician has the option of breaching a patient's confidentiality to inform a known contact directly if the physician believes disclosure is medically appropriate and there is significant risk of infection to the contact. 170 However, prior to any disclosure, the physician must take each of the following steps: Counsel the individual living with HIV of the need to notify the contact; and61 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Law Inform the individual living with HIV of the physician's intent to make disclosure to the contact as well as the physician's responsibility to report the patient's name and the names of contacts to the Commissioner of Health; and Give the individual living with HIV a chance to choose whether the disclosure will be made by the physician or a public health officer; and Screen for domestic violence to determine if deferment of notification is warranted. 171 Q J ames is 16 years old and living with HIV. In a routine physical, he tells his physician about having unprotected sex with Colin, whom the physician also treats. Must the physician tell Colin he is at risk of being exposed to HIV or report this contact to the Department of Health? May the physician tell Colin? A T he physician's duty to report contacts to the Commissioner of Health arises at the time of diagnosis of HIV/AIDS or during monitoring that involves laboratory tests; it is not otherwise an ongoing duty. 172 The physician therefore has no duty to report to the Commissioner. The physician may, however, breach James's confidentiality by telling Colin if medically appropriate and if Colin faces a significant risk of infection. However, the physician is not required to do so and cannot be sued or otherwise held liable for failure to tell Colin. 173 Before making the disclosure, the physician must follow the mandated counseling protocol with James.IV. TYPES OF HEALTH CARE THAT MINORS CAN RECEIVE WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT62 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawPrenatal Care, Labor, and Delivery Services Consent A pregnant minor may consent to medical, dental, health, and hospital services relating to prenatal care. 174 Labor and delivery services are also within the scope of the services to which a pregnant minor can consent. Once a child is born, the minor parents can consent to all medical care for themselves and for their child . 175 Q P riya is pregnant and 15 years old. May she decide whether to have a cesarean section or a vaginal delivery? A Y es. Physicians may strongly encourage a young woman to seek a supportive adult's assistance when making a difficult decision such as this. Ultimately, however, if Priya understands the risks and benefits of the procedures, she can make the decision for herself. Confidentiality As discussed above, a minor may authorize or withhold authorization for the disclosure of health information related to any health service to which a minor may lawfully consent. 176 Such information must remain confidential, unless the minor who consented to the health services expressly authorizes the release of that information. 17763 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawSexual Assault Care What Is Sexual Assault? A person is sexually assaulted when anyone (including a stranger, acquaintance, date, spouse, or family member) engages in any type of sexual activity with that person without his or her consent. Assault may involve the use of physical force, emotional coercion, threats, or manipulation. Also, a person may be incapable of giving consent by reason of mental impairment or incapacity (being intoxicated or having passed out, for example). Sexual assault can be violent or nonviolent, and it may or may not involve physical injuries. What Does Sexual Assault Care Involve? A person who has been sexually assaulted may seek reproductive health services or treatment for injuries. Sexual assault services involve two components: medical care and evidence collection. If sexual assault is suspected, hospitals are required to provide, upon request, prophylaxis against sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy (EC), as well as counseling regarding all treatment options so that survivors may make informed choice s. 178 Additionally, hospitals must advise patients of the availability of local rape crisis or victim assistance organizations and, subject to patient consent, contact such organizations on their behalf. 179 Hospitals must also discuss with survivors the option of reporting the offense to the police.180 The second part of sexual assault care involves what is commonly called the \"rape kit,\" which is used to collect evidence such as semen, hair, and blood samples for later use if the survivor chooses to file criminal charges. 181 Generally, evidence collection is most effective within 72 hours of the assault and before showering. A survivor can choose to receive care where evidence is collected IV. TYPES OF HEALTH CARE THAT MINORS CAN RECEIVE WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT64 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Lawand then decide later whether or not to file charges. Merely having the examination does not mean the survivor must press charges. Consent A minor who is capable of giving informed consent can consent to many aspects of sexual assault care without parental involvement. For example, a minor with capacity may consent to confidential reproductive health services 182 and rape crisis counseling.183 Under long-standing Department of Health policy, a mature minor may also consent to the collection and release of forensic evidence related to the assault. 184 In addition, depending on the circumstances, a minor may be able to consent to the treatment of related injuries.185 A minor who has the capacity to give informed consent for services related to a sexual assault also has the capacity to decline them; thus, no one may force a capable minor to submit to a sexual assault exam. Q S usan, 16, is brought into the emergency room by her very angry mother, who thinks that Susan is having sex with her 18-year-old boyfriend. The mother demands that the emergency room doctors or nurses perform a \"rape kit\" on her daughter to determine whether or not she is still a virgin. Must the providers perform the examination? A N o. A minor who is capable of giving or withholding informed consent to reproductive health care cannot be forced to submit to such an examination. Medical ethics might also preclude the performance of a \"virginity test\" that has no medical purpose or benefit. Therefore, unless Susan voluntarily consents, the exam cannot take place. 186 65 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawConfidentiality A minor has a right to confidentiality as to some aspects of the care related to sexual assault, but there are important exceptions that may require disclosures in this context. A health care provider has no general duty to report crimes committed against a patient, and any such reporting, unless required by law, constitutes a confidentiality breach. When a minor is a victim of a sexual assault, however, the law may require disclosures of related information for a range of reasons. Health care providers are required to report to child welfare authorities if the circumstances surrounding the assault create a reasonable suspicion of child abuse. 187 For example, a parent or other caretaker may have sexually abused the child or knowingly allowed the child to be coerced into a sexual encounter or relationship. If the sexual assault involves gunshot wounds, life-threatening stabbings, or burns, a hospital may be required to turn over evidence of those crimes to the police. 188 If the sexual assault survivor is under the age of 16, a health care provider or social worker may be compelled to testify in legal proceedings about information gained in the course of treatment that bears on the crime against the minor. 189 Reporting obligations may also require providers to breach confidentiality when sexual assaults (or other crimes) take place at facilities where patients are receiving mental health care. 190 Health care providers are required to report to public health officials if the survivor tests positive for HIV, syphilis, chlamydia, or gonorrhea. 191 IV. TYPES OF HEALTH CARE THAT MINORS CAN RECEIVE WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT66 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Law Because the police are not bound by confidentiality rules, a minor who chooses to file a police report may lose control over how and to whom the information is disclosed. Q T racy is 15 and seeks rape crisis treatment after being attacked by a stranger. Besides reproductive health care, such as STI prophylaxis and EC, she needs care for bruises and other injuries. She does not want to involve her parents, however. Can the hospital call her parents without her permission to obtain consent to treat these other injuries? Can the hospital report the assault to the police? A I t is unclear whether the hospital may contact Tracy's parents to get their consent to treat her bruises and other injuries. Reaching out to her parents could compromise the confidentiality of the array of reproductive health care that Tracy can consent to, but the law does not explicitly grant or deny Tracy the right to consent independently to treatment for her related injuries. The hospital should counsel and encourage her to notify a parent or other responsible adult, if any, who can assist her. The hospital should not, however, contact the police unless it has Tracy's consent and the consent of her parents, if they are involved, except that the hospital is obligated to report certain injuries resulting from gunshots, life-threatening stabbings, or burns. 67 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawMental Health Counseling and Services Consent A minor's right to receive mental health treatment without a parent's consent depends on the type of treatment sought: outpatient treatment, where a minor is living at home and visits the mental health care provider for treatment only, or inpatient treatment, where a minor resides in the hospital or mental health care center . In the outpatient context, a minor's right to consent also depends on the type of facility providing service. The law applies explicitly to \"services provided in an outpatient program licensed or operated pursuant to the regulations of the commissioner of mental health.\" 192 A minor's right to consent is less clear in private, unlicensed mental health settings, and practitioners in such settings may want to consult with legal counsel about how best to offer mental health services to minors. Outpatient Treatment A mental health practitioner practicing in a facility licensed or operated by the state Office of Mental Health may provide outpatient services to a minor without parental consent if: (1) T he minor knowingly and voluntarily seeks such services, and (2) T he services are clinically indicated and necessary to the minor's well-being, and (3) ( i) a p arent or guardian is not reasonably available, or (ii) re quiring parental or guardian consent or involvement would have a detrimental effect on the course of outpatient treatment, orIV. TYPES OF HEALTH CARE THAT MINORS CAN RECEIVE WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT68 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Law(iii) a p arent or guardian has refused to give such consent and a physician determines that treatment is necessary and in the best interests of the minor.193 Outpatient mental health treatment may include the prescription of psychotropic medications based on a minor's own consent if the minor is 16 or older, the above conditions are met, and the physician obtains second opinions verifying his or her medical judgments. 194 If the conditions outlined above are not present, New York law requires the consent of a parent or guardian for outpatient mental health treatment. 195 A young person may meet with a mental health care provider without prior parental consent in order to determine whether the minor meets these guidelines. 196 A mental health care provider should document in a minor's medical record the basis for a determination as to whether the above criteria are met. 197 Q Q iao-ling is 15. She is severely depressed and wants mental health treatment. She does not want to tell her parents because she believes they will prevent her from seeking care. The physician believes that she needs to be treated. Can the doctor treat Qiao-ling? A Y es, if Qiao-ling gives her own informed consent to the treatment and the doctor determines that involving her parents would have a detrimental effect on her care. Qiao-ling cannot consent on her own to the use of antidepressants until she turns 16, however, and an independent psychiatrist must verify that she has capacity, the medication is in her best interests, and involving her parents would be detrimental to the course of treatment. 69 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawInpatient Treatment A minor 16 or over can seek admission to a hospital for inpatient mental health treatment, including medication, on his or her own, but younger teens must obtain parental consent. 198 A minor who is hospitalized for inpatient mental health treatment is ensured access to legal counsel in the following ways: The minor, like any other mental health patient, must be informed that legal counsel is available; 199 and Within three days of the minor's arrival, the facility must give notice to Mental Hygiene Legal Services regarding the minor's admission. 200 Generally, a patient (minor or adult) who has chosen to enter a mental health facility may not be kept involuntarily. However, if the institution determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the patient presents a danger to him- or herself or to others, the patient may be held for a maximum of 72 hours, during which time the facility must petition a court for involuntary commitment. 201 The court hearing must be scheduled within 72 hours of the date that the facility requests the involuntary commitment. 202 Only if the court concludes that the patient poses a real and present threat to him- or herself or others may the patient be involuntarily detained. 203 As with all other medical services, in an emergency, psychiatric treatment and medication can be made available to a minor without parental consent. 204IV. TYPES OF HEALTH CARE THAT MINORS CAN RECEIVE WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT70 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawQ C an Rahim, who is 15, consent to his own admission for inpatient mental health treatment? A N o. A minor must be 16 or older to consent to inpatient mental health treatment. Confidentiality As a general matter, when a minor consents to mental health care, information relating to such treatment may not be disclosed without the minor's permission. 205 These confidentiality provisions apply not only to providers licensed by the New York Office of Mental Health, but to any facility in which mental health services are provided, such as psychiatric centers and clinics. 206 Even when a parent gives consent to mental health services for a minor, the parent is not guaranteed access to information relating to the treatment. When a parent requests access to a minor's mental health records, minors 13 and older may be notified of the request. If the minor objects to disclosure, the provider may choose to deny the parent's request. 207 A provider is also permitted to deny a parent access to a minor's mental health records upon determining that disclosure would have a detrimental effect on the practitioner's professional relationship with the minor patient, or on the care and treatment of the minor, or on the minor's relationship with his or her parents or guardians. 208 Further, professional ethics generally dictate that mental health professionals maintain strict confidentiality in dealing with their patients, including their minor patients. 209 There are, of course, exceptions to the general rule of confidentiality. The law permits disclosures pursuant to court order; notifications 71 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Lawto legal service providers; and reports to health oversight agencies, individuals who might be endangered by a patient, researchers, coroners, prisons, other health care providers, and an array of other individuals and entities. 210 In particular, New York law requires the directors of mental health facilities to notify parents of accidents or injuries that affect the health and safety of a patient and allows parents and guardians access to facility records related to such incidents. 211 In addition, more targeted provisions of the mental health law and regulations require reporting of a wide range of misconduct in or under the auspices of certain kinds of facilities. Facilities operated or funded by the Office for People with Developmental Disabilities, 212 for example, must disclose to oversight agencies, report to a Vulnerable Persons' Central Register, and notify parents of incidents involving the physical, psychological, and sexual abuse of patients, along with many other acts and omissions that may cause harm. 213 The Central Register must, in turn, screen reports and forward those that appear to allege crimes to appropriate law enforcement agencies.214 Similar laws apply to facilities and programs operated, funded, or administered by the Office of Mental Health.215 Because of these and other reporting obligations, confidentiality protections will vary from case to case depending on many factors, such as where the incident occurred and the type of facility in which the young person is receiving treatment. Health care providers are encouraged to seek legal counsel or to contact the NYCLU with questions about whether and how general confidentiality rules apply to a particular situation at a mental health care facility.IV. TYPES OF HEALTH CARE THAT MINORS CAN RECEIVE WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT72 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawAlcohol and Substance Abuse Services Consent In general, when treating a minor for chemical dependence216 on an inpatient, residential, or outpatient basis, health care providers must take steps to involve the parents or guardians in the course of treatment and obtain consent from a parent or guardian. 217 However, a minor may be admitted for inpatient, residential, or outpatient treatment related to chemical dependence without parental or guardian involvement and consent , if: The physician determines that the involvement of the parent or guardian would have a detrimental effect on the course of treatment; or The parent or guardian refuses to consent to such treatment, and the physician believes that such treatment is necessary to protect the best interests of the minor; 218 or The provider cannot locate the parent or guardian after employing reasonable measures, in which case the program director may authorize the treatment of the minor; 219 or The parents or guardians fail or refuse to communicate with the provider within a reasonable time regarding the minor's treatment, in which case the program director may authorize the treatment of the minor; 220 or The minor is a parent, married, or emancipated.221 Any decision to treat a minor without parental consent must be documented in the patient's record and must include a form, signed by the minor patient, indicating that the minor is voluntarily seeking treatment and has been advised of the availability of help from 73 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Lawthe mental hygiene legal service and of his or her rights under the New York Mental Hygiene Law.222 When a minor is admitted without parental involvement and consent, the provider must use his or her best efforts to obtain from the minor the name, address, and telephone number of an adult who may serve as an emergency contact. The provider must then verify the existence of the emergency contact, but only after giving notice to the minor and receiving the minor's prior written consent to reach out to the emergency contact. 223 Note, however, that a facility may admit a minor patient for treatment related to chemical dependence even if reasonable efforts to identify an emergency contact have failed. 224 ConfidentialityWhen a minor obtains alcohol abuse or substance abuse services at a program or facility receiving funding from any federal department or agency, confidentiality is stringently protected. 225 Disclosure is allowed only pursuant to written consent or a court order, or in a medical emergency .226 If the minor patient acting alone consented to substance abuse treatment in accordance with the law outlined above, then the minor patient alone has the authority to consent or refuse to consent to a disclosure, including to the minor's parent or guardian. 227 If a parent or guardian provided consent to the minor's treatment, then both the minor and the parent or guardian must consent in writing to any disclosure of related information. 228 If a minor seeks substance abuse treatment in a situation in which New York law requires the consent of a parent or guardian, a program receiving federal funds may notify a parent or guardian of the minor's request only if: (1) the minor consents in writing or (2) the program director concludes that the minor lacks the capacity for rational decision-making, and communication with IV. TYPES OF HEALTH CARE THAT MINORS CAN RECEIVE WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT74 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Lawa parent or guardian would mitigate a \"substantial threat to the life or physical well-being of the minor applicant or any other individual.\"229 The general prohibition on disclosure in federally funded programs is expansive. In the absence of a court order, 230 federal law explicitly bars law enforcement from using information maintained by such a program to initiate or substantiate criminal charges or to conduct an investigation against a patient. 231 Moreover, when a patient receives any medical treatment at a drug and alcohol abuse and prevention facility - even if the treatment is unrelated to substance abuse - information relating to the treatment is confidential. 232 Q D uane is 16. He is thinking about talking to a school substance abuse counselor about his drinking problem, but he is scared that his parents will be notified. Can he receive counseling without parental consent? A P robably. Parental consent is generally not necessary for a minor to receive alcohol counseling, and many schools receive federal funding, which subjects any associated substance abuse program to strict consent and confidentiality rules. Whether or not the counselor decides to treat Duane, the counselor may not disclose information to Duane's parents without Duane's permission if the school receives federal funds. 233 If a minor seeks substance abuse treatment in a facility or from a provider that receives no federal funds, New York law guarantees the confidentiality of the associated information in accordance with the many applicable laws shielding health records. 23475 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawIV. TYPES OF HEALTH CARE THAT MINORS CAN RECEIVE WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT Emergency Care Consent A doctor may treat a minor without the consent of a parent or guardian when the doctor has determined, in the exercise of professional judgment, that an emergency exists, the minor is in immediate need of medical attention, and an attempt to secure consent from a parent or guardian would result in delay that would increase the risk to the minor's life or health. 235 One New York court has held that \"if a physician or surgeon is confronted with an emergency which endangers the life or health of the patient, or [in which] suffering or pain may be alleviated, it is his duty to do that which the occasion demands.\" 236 Q L uis is 6. He is suffering from a severe asthma attack and a teacher takes him to the hospital. His parents cannot be found. May he receive treatment? A Y es. The doctor can treat Luis's asthma attack to address his urgent need for care. Q T his time Luis broke his leg. Again, his parents are nowhere to be found. May he be treated? A Y es again. While Luis might not die from waiting, a doctor can treat him under the emergency exception because his \"pain may be alleviated\" by prompt treatment.76 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawConfidentiality When a health care provider treats a minor without parental consent to address an emergency that resulted from accidental injury or the unexpected onset of serious illness, the provider must give the minor's parent or guardian an opportunity, within 10 days, to inspect any patient information relating to such care. 237 The health care provider may, however, deny a parent or guardian access to such information if the provider determines that disclosure would have a detrimental effect on the provider's professional relationship with the minor, on the care and treatment of the minor, or on the minor's relationship with his or her parents or guardian. 238 Furthermore, a health care provider may notify a minor over the age of 12 of a parent's or guardian's request to review his or her information relating to emergency care and may deny access if the minor patient objects. 239 Transgender-Related Health Care ConsentYouth whose gender identity does not match the sex they were assigned at birth may want health care to confirm their gender identity. So far, no New York law specifically allows teens to consent on their own to trans-related health services. To the extent that a minor seeks mental health care related to gender identity, however, the general rules granting minors independent access to such care apply . 240 And as with any other health care, a married, parenting, or emancipated minor may consent independently. Confidentiality When a parent or guardian consents to trans-related health care for a minor, that parent or guardian also has the right to authorize or refuse the disclosure of information about such treatment. Conversely, when a minor consents independently to the treatment, 77 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawIV. TYPES OF HEALTH CARE THAT MINORS CAN RECEIVE WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT based on emancipation, for example, the minor will control the release of information related to the services.241 Equal Access to Health CareNew York law prohibits discrimination based on \"gender identity, self-image, appearance, behavior or expression.\" 242 Regulations issued by the state Division of Human Rights provide that discrimination based on gender identity or \"the status of being transgender\" constitutes sex discrimination. 243 In addition, discrimination based on \"gender dysphoria\" - a medical condition involving the severe distress that may result from having \"a gender identity different from the sex assigned at birth\" - constitutes discrimination based on disability; such that individuals with gender dysphoria are entitled to reasonable accommodations. 244 Trans children and teens are therefore entitled to be treated like any patient with a health care need when they seek services of any kind, including services related to their gender identity . Coverage for Low-Income MinorsFor low-income teens, Medicaid covers some trans-related health care. Sixteen- and 17-year-olds can qualify for hormone therapy if they meet certain criteria and a qualified medical professional determines that the treatment is medically necessary. 245 Minors under 16 can also qualify \"in specific cases if medical necessity is demonstrated and prior approval is received.\" 246 Medicaid will cover gender-confirmation surgery for those who are over 18 and have two letters of referral from mental health professionals; for minors under 18, surgery may be covered \"in specific cases if medical necessity is demonstrated and prior approval is received.\" 247 Children in foster care or in the juvenile justice system in New York City may qualify for trans-related health care even when Medicaid does not provide the necessary coverage. 24878 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Law V. MINORS IN FOSTER CARE79 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawV. MINORS IN FOSTER CARE A minor in foster care is entitled to consent independently to the same health care services as any other minor.249 In circumstances in which the minor may not consent on his or her own, parental consent is required if parental rights have not been terminated or surrendered. 250 If parental rights have been terminated or surrendered, health care providers may not contact the parents or seek their consent; instead, the foster care agency authorizes health services for the child. 251 No matter who consents to the treatment, minors in foster care face greater risks than others that their medical confidentiality will be compromised . This is because any medical information relating to a minor that is in the possession of a foster care or adoption agency must be released to prospective foster or adoptive parents when the minor is adopted, placed in foster care, or placed with a relative or other legally responsible person. 252 HIV-Related Information The law gives minors in foster care less protection than others with respect to the confidentiality of HIV-related information. Providers may release confidential HIV-related information to an authorized foster care agency, without permission, but they are not required to do so. 253 Foster care agencies , however, must release any HIV-related medical information of which they have knowledge to prospective foster or adoptive parents, or other responsible persons who will assume care of the child through official placements, 254 but must safeguard this information from disclosure to others. Of course, if a minor receives anonymous HIV testing, results will remain confidential.25580 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawReproductive Health Care Minors in foster care are entitled to receive health services through their foster care agencies within 30 days of the minor's request.256 Such services include confidential family planning services, such as contraceptive supplies and counseling, and minors in foster care - like all other minors - can consent to such services on their own. 257 However, because medical information obtained by foster care agencies is subject to the mandatory disclosure requirements referenced above, in order to ensure full confidentiality, a teen may want to seek care for sensitive health issues from doctors or clinics that are independent from the foster care agency. Q C lara, who is 16, is in foster care and wants to see a gynecologist to begin annual reproductive care checkups. However, she does not want her foster care agency or foster parents to know about the private medical information that her doctor will learn about her. How can she keep the information confidential? A C lara can seek treatment from an independent health care clinic or provider - such as Planned Parenthood (https://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-center), the Community Health Care Network (http://www.chnnyc. org/), or the Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center (http://www.mountsinai.org/patient-care/service-areas/ adolescent-health-center) - that is not associated with the foster care agency. Such clinics must keep her medical information confidential and cannot disclose it to foster care agencies without her prior consent. Note, however, that if Clara seeks HIV care, related information will be subject to disclosure, even if the health care provider is not affiliated with the foster care agency.81 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawTransgender-Related Health Care Medicaid covers hormone therapy for low-income teens who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, a medical condition reflecting the extreme distress that can result when a person's gender identity does not match that person's body. 258 A minor in foster care or certain juvenile justice placements in New York City may receive broader coverage, however. Even in situations in which Medicaid does not cover the services, the New York City Administration for Children's Services covers \"gender affirming healthcare,\" defined to include \"various types of medical care that transgender, transsexual, and gender non-conforming individuals may seek in relation to their gender identity.\" 259 The general guidelines for consent in the foster and juvenile justice systems apply to trans-related care, meaning that parental or agency consent will usually be required. 260 V. MINORS IN FOSTER CAREVI. PUBLIC HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE TO MINORS83 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawVI. PUBLIC HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE TO MINORS Medicaid Medicaid is a publicly funded insurance program that covers comprehensive medical services, including prenatal care, abortion, and birth control, for minors who meet income and immigration eligibility requirements. 261 A young person may get a list of community-based organizations that can help him or her apply for Medicaid or Child Health Plus (see below) by calling 1-800-698-4KIDS (1-800-698-4543) or going to the New York State Department of Health website: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/child_health_plus/where_do_i_apply.htm . EligibilityGenerally, minors receive Medicaid services through an eligible parent's Medicaid enrollment. However, some minors who support themselves in their own households or who are married, pregnant, or parenting may apply on their own for Medicaid. 262 Minors can apply independently for Medicaid, without having their parents' income counted as available to them, if: The minor is legally married, in which case, only the income of the minor and his or her spouse will count in determining eligibility; 263 The minor is 16 or older, stayed in school until age 16, does not live with or receive money from a parent or guardian, and does not live in foster care. The government may nevertheless sue the minor's parent(s)/guardian(s) for the cost of the minor's medical care; 264 The minor is 16 or 17, pregnant or a parent, and does not live with the minor's parent or guardian because no parent or guardian is available; the minor and his or her child would be at serious risk of harm if they lived with the minor's parent or 84 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Lawguardian; or it is otherwise not in the best interest of the minor and his or her child to live with the minor's parent or guardian. The government may nevertheless sue the minor's parent(s)/guardian(s) for the cost of medical care for the minor and the minor's child; 265 The young person is 18-20 and pregnant or a parent. Because Medicaid continues to treat anyone under 21 as the dependent of a parent, the government may sue the young person's parent(s)/guardian(s) for the cost of medical care for the young person, but not for the cost for the young person's child; 266 The young person is 18-20, and the parent or guardian is unavailable or cannot or does not offer a safe home for the young person. The government may sue the young person's parent(s)/guardian(s) for the cost of medical care for the young person. 267 Medicaid covers pregnant minors (and pregnant adults) at a higher income limit than applies to others. Income-eligibility levels are adjusted annually, but the 2017 threshold was set at $35,524 a year for a family of two (and a pregnant woman counts as herself plus the number of infants she is expected to deliver). 268 The coverage extends to a wide range of pregnancy-related screenings and services and continues during a 60-day postpartum period. 269 A newborn whose mother is on Medicaid is automatically covered by Medicaid through the first year of life and should be automatically enrolled. 270 The income-eligibility level for babies up to age one is the same as for pregnant women.271 An infant should receive a Medicaid card within two weeks of birth, but until then the infant can receive health care services under the mother's Medicaid card. 272 85 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawIncome-eligible pregnant minors (and adults) qualify for Medicaid in New York regardless of their immigration status, meaning that even undocumented minors can get coverage during and immediately following their pregnancies. 273 Like all other infants born to Medicaid- eligible women in the U.S., the native-born children of immigrant mothers are automatically enrolled in Medicaid and eligible for coverage from birth until at least the baby's first birthday. 274 Any pregnant woman, including an undocumented woman, who has Medicaid during her pregnancy but who loses Medicaid after the pregnancy ends (for example, because she is no longer eligible or because she fails to reapply) will probably be eligible for 24-26 months of Medicaid-covered family planning services under the Family Planning Extension Program (FPEP). FPEP is available regardless of whether the pregnancy ended in a miscarriage, live birth, stillbirth, or abortion. 275 ConfidentialityMedical services provided under Medicaid are subject to special confidentiality protections. 276 These protections apply whether the minor is enrolled independently or under a parent's Medicaid. Confidentiality may be jeopardized, however, when bills, lab reports, or managed care plan statements (such as explanations of benefits or preauthorization approvals) get sent home. The problem occurs most frequently with managed care plans. Providers and patients should check with their insurance plan about what the plan's policy is regarding sending documents home. To guard against these kinds of confidentiality breaches, minors who apply for Medicaid on their own may specify a mailing address that is different from their home address so as to avoid confidentiality breaches through billing and other correspondence. 277 VI. PUBLIC HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE TO MINORS86 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawThe Medicaid program also poses confidentiality problems with regard to electronic information sharing. New York Medicaid acknowledges that \"[t]here are certain types of care that a minor can consent/agree to without his/her parent's or guardian's agreement\" and that \"[t]he minor has a right to say who can see that information by state and federal law.\" 278 Yet the Medicaid program is unable to \"segregate Medicaid claims information based upon a type of service.\" 279 Therefore, a minor who wants to protect the confidentiality of health information relating to services to which the minor independently consented must let Medicaid know not to share the minor's entire health record, as Medicaid does not have the ability to protect discrete parts of the record. 280 Child Health Plus New York's Child Health Plus (CHP) is a publicly funded insurance program for children and adolescents age 18 and younger. 281 CHP provides comprehensive health benefits including prenatal care, abortion, and the full range of reproductive health care. 282 A minor can get information on applying for CHP by calling 1-800-698-4543 or going to the New York State Department of Health website: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/child_health_plus/. Eligibility Because CHP has a higher household income limit than Medicaid 283 and is available regardless of an enrollee's immigration status,284 there is a good chance that if a teen is not eligible for Medicaid, the teen will be eligible for CHP. Generally, minors need parental participation in order to enroll in CHP. However, married, pregnant, and parenting minors may enroll themselves and their children in CHP without a parent's or guardian's participation, and otherwise emancipated minors may also be able 87 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Lawto enroll themselves; minors in these situations would benefit from in-person assistance with the enrollment process.285 A minor may locate nearby individuals qualified to provide in-person assistance at the N.Y. State of Health website: https://nystateofhealth.ny.gov/agent/hx_brokerSearch?fromPage=INDIVIDUAL. Note that those who try to self-enroll must obtain the proper documents to verify household income eligibility. Confidentiality The medical services provided under CHP are subject to the same confidentiality rules as apply in the Medicaid program. 286 Billing may present a confidentiality problem, however, because all CHP patients must choose a managed care plan, which may send home bills, explanations of benefits, preauthorization approvals, and lab reports. For example, a New York law requires managed care plans to notify a patient in writing and by phone after the plan has made an initial determination of whether and to what extent a health service requiring preauthorization is covered (most surgical procedures require preauthorization). 287 Providers can work with their patients to find out what information their managed care plan sends home and to figure out how to avoid unintentional confidentiality breaches. Health plans must make reasonable accommodations for patients whose safety depends on receiving communications by alternative means or at alternative locations. 288VI. PUBLIC HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE TO MINORS88 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawHealth questions that minors face on a day-to-day basis are often extremely complex. Confusion about their rights can be compounded by their medical situation, their immigration status, their inability to pay for their own care, or any number of other factors. This booklet offers broad guidelines on minors' rights to confidential health care. The Reproductive Rights Program of the New York Civil Liberties Union hopes that this guide will raise awareness about minors' rights, thereby increasing the likelihood that minors will seek health care when they need it.CONCLUSION89 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Law90 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Law1 T umaini R.

Modern case law holds that malpractice is the preferred cause of action for addressing lack of informed consent, whereas assault and battery is the proper cause of action in the complete absence of consent in nonexigent circumstances. See Slandy v. Bryk , (App. Div. 2d Dep't 2008) (\"[M]edical malpractice is the gist of the wrong when an operation or procedure is performed without the informed consent of the patient to the risks involved.

Pub. Health Law \u00a7 2994-c (McKinney 2017). 13 N ew York law recognizes several practitioner-patient privileges, which generally prevent practitioners from being compelled to testify about patient confidences. N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7\u00a7 (1) a provider-patient relationship was established; (2) the information was obtained in the course of treatment; and (3) the information was necessary for treatment. See Hughson v. St. Francis Hosp. , 463 N.Y.S.2d 224, 229 (App. Div. 2d Dep't 1983). Moreover, a health care professional who discloses confidential communications without the prior consent of the patient is guilty of professional misconduct. 8 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 . revealing of personally identifiable facts, data or information obtained in a professional capacity without the prior consent of the patient or client, except as authorized or required by law. . . .\"); N.Y. Educ. Law \u00a7 6509(9) (McKinney any unprofessional conduct to be profes - sional misconduct). Unless otherwise required by law, a health care provider who commits professional misconduct by disclosing confidential information may be subject to professional and legal sanctions. For a more extended discussion of a provider's duty of confidentiality, the consequences of breaching this duty, and exceptions to the general rule of confidentiality, see infra Section III. 14 N .Y. Pub. Health Law \u00a7 2504(2) (McKinney 2017) (\"Any person who . . . has borne a child may give effective consent for medical, dental, health and hospital services for his or her child.\"). Except in certain circumstances outlined in this booklet, minors may receive medical treatment only with the consent of their parents or custodians. See Sombrotto v. Christiana W. , 852 N.Y.S.2d 57 (App. Div. 1st Dep't 2008) (reversing order that authorized administration of psychotropic drugs to minor patient over parents' objection and reviewing basis of and limitations upon parents' right to direct health care of minor children); Alfonso v. Fernandez , 606 N.Y.S.2d 259, 262 (App. Div. 2d Dep't 1993) (recogniz - ing the common law rule requiring parental consent for the provision of health services to a minor); T.D. v. N.Y.S. Office of Mental Health , 650 N.Y.S.2d 173, 19193 (1st Dep't 1996) (invalidating regulations that permitted medical research on children without the consent of a parent or guardian); In re AB , 768 N.Y.S.2d 256, 270 (Sup. Ct. 2003) (recognizing the parental right to determine or refuse treatment for minor children). T he parent who gives consent will normally be one with whom the child has a close ongoing relationship. Questions sometimes arise, however, about the legal sufficiency of the consent of a biological parent with whom the minor has no real relationship. While there is no case directly on point, the analogous case law suggests that a health care professional should be wary of relying on such consent. See Hodgson v. Minnesota , 497 U.S. 417, 43744 (1990) (detailing the harms of requiring two-parent consent for abortion, especially in families in which one parent is long absent); see also Lehr v. Robertson , 463 U.S. 248, 26162, 26667 (1983) (holding that an unwed father has no right to notice and consent 93 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawEND NOTESto the adoption of his biological child unless he has taken the available opportunities to develop parental bonds to the child). A health profes - sional should consult an attorney or the NYCLU if presented with a case in which a minor patient seeks to rely on the consent of an otherwise absentee parent to authorize medical care. 15 1 8 N.Y.C.R.R. 441.22(d) (2017) (\"Prior to accepting a foster child into care in cases of voluntary placement . . . authorization in writing must be requested from the child's parent or guardian for routine medical and/or psychological assessments, immuniza - tions and medical treatment, and for emergency medical or surgical care in the event that the parent or guardian cannot be located at the time such care becomes necessary.

Educ. Law 6509(9) (McKinney 2017). Professional misconduct is punishable by repri - mands, suspension or revocation of a license, fines, and other penalties. Id. \u00a7 6511. 53 See, e.g., Burton v. Matteliano 802 (App. Div. 4th Dep't 1982). 54 N .Y. Pub. Health Law \u00a7 18(2)(c) (McKinney 2017). Federal law reinforces that state law prohibitions on disclosure of health information 98 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Lawgovern. 45 C.F.R. 164.502(g)(3)(ii)(B) (2017) (\"If, and to the extent, prohibited by an applicable provision of State or other law, including applicable case law, a covered entity may not disclose, or provide access . . . to, protected health information about an unemancipated minor to a parent, guardian, or other person acting in loco parentis .\"). Moreover, even if a parent consented to the care, federal regulations permit (but do not require) a health care provider to deny a parent access to information if the provider determines in the exercise of professional judgment that such access is \"reasonably likely to cause substantial harm to the individual [minor] or another person.\" 45 C.F.R. 164.524(a)(3)(iii) (2017). 55 N .Y. Pub. Health (McKinney 2017). 56 4 4 5 C.F.R. 164.502(g)(3)(i)(C) (2017). 58 T his includes employees who act in concert with or as agents of the health care professional, such as receptionists. See Desai v. Blue Shield of Northeastern N.Y., 540 N.Y.S.2d 569, 571 (App. Div. 3d Dep't 474 (Crim. Ct. Bronx Cty. 2003). Confidentiality rules apply to other types of persons in certain situations. For example, social services workers are among those forbidden to disclose confidential HIV-related information. See infra notes 145146 and accompanying text. 59 F amily Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1232g(a)(1)(A), (B) (2017) (requiring schools that receive federal funding to give parents the right to \"inspect and review the education records of their children\"); N.Y. Educ. Law \u00a7 2-d(3)(b)(2) (McKinney 2017) (\"Parents have the right to inspect and review the complete contents of their child's education record.\").60 v. Falvo , 534 U.S. 426, 433 (2002). 62 See, e.g. , N.Y. Educ. Law \u00a7\u00a7 901, 903-905 (McKinney 2017) (requiring health and dental screenings and certificates as a condition of enrollment and mainten- ance of the related records in school files); 8 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 136.3(a)(2) (2017) (\"It shall be the trustees and boards of education: . . . except where otherwise prohibited by law, to advise, in writing, the parent of, or other persons in parental relation to, each student in whom any aspect of the total school health program indicates such student has defective sight or hearing, or a physical disability or other condition which may require professional attention with regard to health. . . .\"). Despite the broad language of this regulatory requirement, courts have read it to apply only to the records of mandatory health screenings. Port Washington Teachers' Ass'n v. n.3 (2d Cir. 2007) (noting that New York courts have limited the reach of the regulation to requiring notice to parents of the results of tests for sight, hearing, and sickle cell anemia, which are mandated by the authorizing legislation, N.Y. Educ. Law \u00a7 904) (citing Bello v. Bd. of Educ. 924 (4th , 534 U.S. at 43334. While FERPA exempts from disclosure records that remain \"in the sole possession of the maker thereof and which are not accessible or revealed to any other person except a substitute,\" 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(a)(4)(B)(i) (2017), this exemption may have limited utility. Health records are often shared beyond the profes - sional who makes them. Moreover, another provision explicitly exempts from disclosure to parents the health treatment records of students who are over 18 or in postsecondary educational institutions. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(a)(4)(B)(iv) (2017). This provision implies that the 99 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawEND NOTEShealth records of minors under 18 or not yet in postsecondary education are generally accessible to parents. 64 4 2 U.S.C. 290dd-2 (2017). Note, however, that this law predates FERPA, and no court had decided which statute governs in the case of a conflict over whether a disclosure to parents is mandated or prohibited. 65 4 2 U.S.C. 290dd-2(b) (2017). 66 T he concept of personal liberty grounded in the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution creates a federal right of privacy against the public disclosure of an individual's private affairs by the government. Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 598-60 & nn. 23-26 (1977) (citing Roe v. Wade , 410 U.S. 113, 152-153 (1973)). See, e.g., Sterling v. Minersville , 232 F.3d 190, 194-96 (3d Cir. 2000) (holding that the disclosure of an individual's sexual orientation by a police officer would be a violation of that individual's constitutional privacy right where there is no \"genuine, legitimate and compelling\" governmen - tal interest in disclosure) (quoting Doe v. Southeastern Pa. Transp. Auth. 290, 302-03 (3d Cir. 2000) (holding that a public school gym teacher who compelled a student to take a pregnancy test and failed to keep the test confidential violated the student's 14th Amendment privacy rights). In addition, the various professions maintain ethical standards that may counsel against disclosure. See, e.g. , Nat'l Ass'n of Soc. Workers, NASW Standards for the Practice of Social Work with Adolescents 1516 (Standard 8 - Confidentiality: \"Social workers shall maintain adequate safeguards for privacy and confidenti - ality in their relationships with youths.\"), http://www.socialworkers.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=rUt4ybE_GW4%3d&portalid=0; Nat'l Educ.

N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law \u00a7 413(1) (McKinney 2017). Therefore, if any of these professionals, in the course of their official duties, learn of information that creates a reasonable suspicion that a child is being harmed by a caregiver, the professional must report this suspicion to the State Central Register. 73 A c ustodian includes any person continually or regularly found in the same household as the child whose conduct causes or contributes to the abuse or neglect of the child. N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law \u00a7 412(3) Serv. Law \u00a7 413(1)(a) (McKinney 2017). 75 N .Y. Soc. Serv. Law \u00a7 413(1)(b) (McKinney 2017). 76 N 2017). Under these laws, a caregiver commits abuse if the caregiver (1) inflicts or allows the infliction of a nonaccidental, physical injury that causes substantial risk of serious physical or emotional harm; or (2) creates or allows the creation of substantial risk of nonaccidental physical injury that is likely to cause serious physical or emotional harm; or (3) commits or allows to be committed a sexual offense against the minor. 77 A p arent, guardian, custodian, or other person responsible for a minor's care engages in child neglect by failing to exercise a minimum degree of care, thereby causing, allowing, or creating a substantial risk of physical or emotional harm to the child, or by abandoning a child. N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law \u00a7 412(2) 2017). 78 T he term \"allows\" in the context of child neglect is intended to address the parent or legal caregiver who knew or \"should have known about the abuse and failed to exercise a minimum degree of care to prevent or stop it.\" Nicholson v. Scoppetta , 787 N.Y.S.2d 196, Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawEND NOTESApp. 2004) (holding that a battered mother may be found to have neglected her children \"not because she is a victim of domestic violence or because her children witnessed the abuse, but rather because a preponderance of the evidence establishes that the children were actually or imminently harmed by reason of her failure to exercise even minimal care in providing them with proper oversight\"); id. at 302 (\"Courts must evaluate parental behavior objectively: would a reasonable and prudent parent have so acted, or failed to act, under the circumstances then and there existing.\") (citations omitted); see also In re Christina P. , 713 N.Y.S.2d 743 (2d Dep't 2000) (finding a mother had neglected her daughter by failing to protect her from sexual abuse by the mother's paramour, about which the mother knew or should have known); In re Katherine C. , 471 N.Y.S.2d 216, 219 (Fam. Ct. Richmond Cty. 1984) (same). 79 N .Y. Soc. Serv. Law \u00a7 420 (McKinney 2017) (providing criminal and civil penalties for a mandated reporter who willfully fails to report). A mandated reporter who has reason to suspect child abuse, but who is not certain whether the surrounding circum - stances fulfill the legal definition of abuse, should nonetheless file a report and allow the Register to make the legal determination. Kimberly S.M. v. Bradford Cent. Sch. , 649 N.Y.S.2d 588, 591 (App. Div. 4th Dep't 1996) (holding that a teacher, as a mandated reporter, \"is obligated to report suspected cases of child sexual abuse based upon facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the reporter at the time the abuse is suspected and may be held liable for a breach of that duty even though it might ultimately be determined that the abuse was not committed or allowed to have been committed by a 'person legally responsible' for the child\"). 80 N .Y. Soc. Serv. Law \u00a7 419 (McKinney 2017) (immunizing mandated reporters from liability for making reports if they acted in good faith; presuming good faith of those who act within the scope of their employment and without misconduct or gross negligence). See, e.g., Rine v. Chase , 765 N.Y.S.2d 648 (App. Div. 2d Dep't 2003) (affirming dismissal of a complaint against a social worker who made child abuse reports, later found to be unsubstanti - ated, based on statements children made in therapy); Kempster v. Child Protective Servs. , 515 N.Y.S.2d 807 (App. Div. 2d Dep't 1987) (dismissing a complaint against a hospital for making a child abuse report, later found to be unsubstantiated, based on suspicious injuries to a 14-month-old baby). Courts have recognized that the grant of immunity is intended to \"encourage the reporting of child abuse situations, and thereby afford children greater protection.\" Brown v. City of N.Y. , 870 N.Y.S.2d 217, 223 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cty. 2008). This purpose would appear to be frustrated by a provision of the penal law that makes it a misdemeanor to \"[r]eport, by word or action, an alleged occurrence or condition of child abuse or maltreatment . . . which did not in fact occur or exist\" to either the statewide central register or to any mandated reporter. N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 240.50(4) (McKinney 2017). No court has resolved this tension, but due process would pose a serious obstacle to the prosecution of a person for making a good-faith report of child abuse just because it later turns out to be unfounded. 81 A ny oral or written allegation of abuse by a school employee or volunteer made to a teacher, school nurse, school psychologist, school social worker, guidance counselor, school administra - tor, school board member, or other school personnel required to hold a teaching or administrative license or certificate must be forwarded, in the form of a written report, to the school administrator. N.Y. Educ. Law \u00a7 1126 (McKinney 2017). Upon receipt of a 102 Teenagers, Health Care, and the Lawreport that gives rise to a reasonable suspicion that such abuse has occurred, the administrator must report such allegation to the child's parent(s), to the school superintendent, and to \"appropriate law enforcement authori - ties.\" N.Y. Educ. Law \u00a7 1128 (McKinney 2017). Such authorities include the local police or sheriff, but not child protective services or other organizations for the prevention of cruelty to children. N.Y. Educ. Law \u00a7 1125 (7) (McKinney 2017). Any person who, in good faith, either makes or transmits such a report is immunized from civil liability, N.Y. Educ. Law \u00a7\u00a7 1126(3), 1128(4) (McKinney 2017), and any person who willfully fails to submit a report to a school administrator or to appropriate law enforcement authorities will be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor and may be civilly liable up to five thousand dollars, N.Y. Educ. Law \u00a7 1129 (McKinney 2017). (McKinney 2017) (defining \"abused child\" to include minors whose parent or other legally responsible person \"commits, or allows to be committed an offense against such child defined in article one hundred thirty of the penal law [delineating sex offenses].\"). 83 N .Y. Penal Law \u00a7 130.20(1)-(2) (McKinney 2017) (defining sexual misconduct as engaging in sexual intercourse (meaning vaginal sex) or oral or anal sex with another person \"without such person's consent\"); N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 (McKinney 2017) (\"A person is deemed incapable of consent when he or she is . . . less than 17 years old.\"). Other \"statutory rape\" sex crimes, which are felonies and therefore carry a greater penalty, will apply when the minor is under a certain age and the minor's partner is over a certain age, even when the sexual activity is consensual. The following rape laws apply only to vaginal intercourse: Third-degree rape occurs when the minor is 16 or younger and the partner is 21 or older, N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 130.25(2) (McKinney 2017); second-de - gree rape occurs when the minor is younger than 15 and the partner is 18 or older, except that it is an affirmative defense if the defendant is less than four years older than the alleged victim, N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 130.30 (McKinney 2017); and first-degree rape occurs when the minor is younger than 13 and the partner is 18 or older, or when the minor is younger than 11 and the partner is any age, N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 130.35(3), (4) (McKinney 2017). An additional set of sex crimes, with the same age differences corresponding to the same degrees, applies to oral and anal sex. N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 130.40(2), 130.45(1), 130.50(3)-(4) (McKinney 2017). Another relevant sex crime is sexual abuse, characterized by \"sexual contact\" - meaning any touching of \"intimate\" parts. Third-degree sexual abuse (a misdemeanor) occurs when the minor is 16 or younger and the partner is more than five years older, N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 130.55 (McKinney 2017); second-degree sexual abuse (a misdemeanor) occurs when the minor is 13 or younger and the partner is any age, N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 130.60 (McKinney 2017); and first-degree sexual abuse (a felony) occurs when the minor is 10 or younger and the partner is any age, N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 130.65 (McKinney 2017). The legislature's establishment of this age division was upheld as constitutional in People v. Dozier , 424 N.Y.S.2d 1010, 1014 (App. Div. 1st Dep't 1980) (holding that even in the case of consensual sexual activity, these sexual offense statutes serve state interests such as the prevention of teenage pregnancy and physical injury as well as immature decisions relating to forced marriages, parenthood, adoption, and abortion). 84 H olding parents criminally liable for a child's sexual activity \"fails to take into account the reality that the degree of supervision a parent is able to exert diminishes as a child's freedom, independence, age, and privacy 103 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawEND NOTESincrease. In addition, it fails to recognize that the nature of parental supervision is frequently determined by the age of the parent, by culture, by religion, and by the child's gender. Moreover, the imposition of legal liability presupposes that premature sexual activity occurs only in children whose parents do not teach proper moral values or offer role models consistent with that teaching, and fails, as well, to reflect an awareness that teenage pregnancies are the product of behaviors ranging from experimenta - tion to outright defiance of parental authority.\" In re Comm'r Soc. Servs. ex rel. Leslie C. , 614 N.Y.S.2d 855, 861 (Fam. Ct. Kings Cty. 1994) (dismissing charges of abuse and neglect against the mother of a sexually active teenage girl); see also In re Philip M. , 589 N.Y.S.2d 31 (App. Div. 1st Dep't 1992), aff'd , 82 N.Y.2d 238 (1993) (noting that family court had found that a 15-year-old with a sexually transmitted disease could not be presumed to be the victim of child abuse, because the minor's age indicated that he could have been engaged in \"consensual sexual activity\"). D ata from the 2011-2013 National Survey of Family Growth show that nationally, just over 40 percent of minors have sex before their 17th birthday. Gladys M. Martinez & Joyce C.

Thus, a reading of the statutes that did not take into account the public policies outlined by the Leslie C. court would suggest that the parents of more than 406,000 New York State minors be reported on suspicion of child abuse or neglect, representing 40 percent of the total 1,016,517 teenagers aged 13, 14, 15, and 16 in New York State as of the 2010 census.

Mental Hyg. Law \u00a7 33.13 (McKinney 2017) protects the clinical records of patients and clients treated at a \"facility.\" The law defines a facility to include \"any place in which services for the mentally disabled are provided,\" N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law \u00a7 1.03(6) (McKinney 2017), and \"any provider of services for individuals with mental illness or developmental disabilities which is operated by, under contract with, receives funding from, or is otherwise approved to render services by, a director of community services pursuant to article forty-one of this chapter or one or both of the offices [i.e., the office of mental health or the office for people with developmental disabilities], including any such provider which is exempt from the requirement for an operating certificate under article sixteen or article thirty-one of this chapter,\" N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law \u00a7 33.13(a) (McKinney 2017). The clinical records of patients treated in such facilities or by such providers are shielded from disclosure, except in certain circumstances, such as when disclosure is made \"to an endangered individual and a law enforcement agency when a treating psychiatrist or psychologist has determined that a patient or client presents a serious and imminent danger to that individual.\" N.Y. Mental Hyg.

Under the relevant New York case law, psychiatrists and psycholo - gists are permitted to notify endangered individuals and will not be liable if they prove that their concern for the endangered person was reasonable, but no court has imposed on psychiatrists and psychologists an affirmative duty to report to the police or to endangered persons when a patient poses a threat of harm.

A \"rape crisis counselor\" is a person who has been certified by an approved rape crisis program as having satisfied New York State training standards ( see N.Y. Pub. Health Law \u00a7 206(15) (McKinney 2017)) and who is working in an approved rape crisis program. N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 4510(a)(2) (McKinney 2017). 92 N \u00a7 1046(a)(vii) (McKinney 2017). For example, a psychologist may not claim privilege to avoid disclosing a communication from a teenager that suggests physical abuse by a caregiver. 94 N .Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 4508(a)(3) (McKinney 2017). This exception applies to physicians, registered professional nurses, licensed practical nurses, dentists, podiatrists, chiropractors, and social workers, but not to psychologists or rape crisis counselors. In addition, in certain circumstances, a provider may be required to testify in proceedings where the confidential information relates to the use of controlled 105 Teenagers, Health Care, and the LawEND NOTESsubstances. However, the law does not clearly delineate when this exception should apply, and providers who are subpoenaed to testify under such circumstances should consult an attorney. Compare People v. Figueroa , 568 N.Y.S.2d 957, 959 (App. Div. 1st Dep't 1991) (affirming conviction for drug possession and rejecting the defendant's argument that doctor- patient privilege prevented the admission of evidence a doctor shared with police after recovering condoms containing illicit drugs from the defendant's digestive tract), with People v.

Note that even if N.Y. Pub.

Additionally, if related injuries require immediate medical attention, a health care provider can generally treat a minor without parental consent. N.Y. Pub.
