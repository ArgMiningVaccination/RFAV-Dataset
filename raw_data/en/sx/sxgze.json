What Pharmorubicin is and what it is used for Pharmorubicin is an injectio n that contains epirubicin hydroch loride. It belongs to a group of medicines called cytotoxics used for chemotherapy. Pharmorubicin causes cells that are actively growing, such as cancer cells, to slow or stop their growth and increases the likelihood that they die. This medicine helps to selectively kill the cancer tissue rather than normal, healthy tissue. Pharmorubicin is used to treat a variety of cancers, either alone or in combination with other drugs. The way in which it is used depends upon the typ e of cancer that is being treated. It has been found to be particularly useful in the treatment of cancers of the breast, ovaries, stomach, bowel and lung. In addition, this medicine can be given to treat cancers of the blood forming tissues such as malig nant lymphomas, leukaemias and mul tiple myeloma. Pharmorubicin can also be put directly into the bladder through a tube. This is sometimes used to treat abnormal cells or cancers of the bladder wall. It can be used after other treatments to try and preven t such cells from growing again. You must talk to a doctor if you do not feel better or if you feel worse. 2. What you need to know b efore you use Pharmorubicin Do not use Pharmorubicin: if you are allerg ic to epirubicin or any of the other ingredien ts of this medicine (listed in section 6) or similar chemotherapy drugs (anthracyclines or anthracenediones) Page 2 of 18 if you have infections affecting multiple organs If you have urine infection if you have inflammation of the bladder if you have invasive tumours penetrating the bladder if you hav e catheterisation problems (your doctor has problems inserting a catheter (tube) into your bladder) if you have presence of blood in urine if you have decreased ability to produce blood cells leading to low blood cell coun ts, as it can lower them further if you have previously been treated with Pharmorubicin or similar chemotherapy drugs , as previous treatment with these medicines can increase the risk of side effects if you have suffered from recent heart attack, poor func tioning of the heart muscle, sever e irregular heartbeat pattern, sudden pain in the chest, non -inflammatory disease of the heart muscle or any other severe heart trouble in the past, or are presently receiving treatment for this if you have severe liver di sease if you are pregnant or breas t-feeding Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor , pharmacist or nurse before using Pharmorubicin : if your liver or kidneys are not working properly if you have had or you are due to have any vaccination if you are c urrently suffering from acute toxi cities such as o acute inflammation of the mouth o low white blood cell count o low platelet count or o infections in general if you are currently taking or have recently taken trast uzumab (a medicine used in the treatment of cert ain cancers). Trastuzumab can rema in in the body for up to 7 month s. As trastuzumab may affect the heart, you should not use Pharmorubicin for up to 7 months after you have stopped taking trastuzumab. If Pharmorubicin is used before this time, then your he art function should be carefully m onitored. in pregnant women, there have been a few reports that Pharmorubicin has been associated with heart problems in new-borns and unborn babies, including foetal death. This will help your doctor decide if this medi cine is suitable for you. Other medicines and Pharmorubicin : Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, even those obtained without a prescri ption , particularly the following: Cimetidine (a drug usually used to treat stomach ulcers and heartburn). Cimetidine can make the effects of Pharmorubicin stronger Calcium channel blockers (medicines for the heart) Quinine drug) Antib iotics such as sulphonamide and chloramphenicol Antiretrovi ral (drugs used to treat infectio n by HIV) Diphenylhydantoin (a drug used to treat epilepsy) Painkillers such as amidopyrine derivate Page 3 of 18 Trastuz umab therapy for treatment of cancer Your doctor should avoid using pharmorubicin for up to 7 months after stopping trastuzumab when possible. If pharmorubicin is used before this time, careful monitoring of cardiac function is recommended Vaccination with a live vaccine should be avoided in patients receiving epirubicin Paclitaxel or docetaxel (drugs used to treat can cer). When paclitaxel is given pr ior to epirubicin, it may increase concentration of epirubicin in blood. However when paclitaxel and docetaxel are given together and given after epirubicin, they d id not affect concentration of epirubicin Dexverapamil (used to treat some heart conditions) Dexrazoxane (used to prevent chronic cumulative cardiotoxicity caused by epirubicin) Interferon 2b (used to treat cancers) Pregnancy, breast -feeding and fertility Pregnancy If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, a sk your doctor for advice before being given this medicine. Avoid becoming pregnant while you or your partner is being treated with this medicine. Both men and women should s eek advice on fertility preservation before tre atment. If you are sexually activ e, you are advised to use effective birth control to prevent pregnancy . Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception durin g treatment with Pharmorubicin and for at least 6.5 months after the last dose. Males should use e ffective contraception during treatment and for at least 3.5 months after the last dose . It may cause birth defects, so it is important to tell your doctor if you think you are pregnant . Breast -feeding You should stop brea st feeding before starting treatment with this medicine as some of the drug may get into your milk and possibly harm your child. Do not breast -feed whilst receiving treatment with Pharmorubicin and for at least 7 days after the last dose . Fertility Both m en and women should seek advice on fertility preservation before treatment. Men: There is a risk of sterility due to therapy with Pharmorubicin and male patients should consider storage of sperm before treatment. Men should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3.5 months after the last dose. Women: Pharmorubicin may cause lack of menstrual cycles or premature menopause in premenopausal women. Women of childbearing potential should be advise d to use effective contraception during treatment with Pharmorubicin and for at least 6.5 months after the last dose. Driving and using machine s There are no special precautions, as long as you feel fully recovered following your hospital treatment and yo u have discussed this with your doctor. Pharmorubicin may be prepared with a solution that contains sodium This medicinal product may be prepared with a solution that contains sodium. Tell your doctor if you are on a low salt (sodium) diet. Pharmorubicin contains sodium Page 4 of 18 Pharm orubicin 10 mg/5 ml (2 mg/ml) solution for injection or infusion contains 17.7 mg of sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 5 ml vial. This is equivalent to 0.9% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. Pharmorubicin 20 mg/10 ml (2 mg/ml) solution for injection or infusion contains 35.4 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 10ml vial. This is equivalen t to 1. 77% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium f or an adult. Pharmorubicin 50 mg/25 ml ( 2 mg/ml) solution for injection or infusion contains 88. 5 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in 25 ml vial. This is equivalent to 4 .4% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an a dult. Pharmorubicin 200 mg/100 ml (2 mg/ ml) solution for injection or infusion contains 354 m g sodium ( main component of cooking/table salt) in 100 ml vial. This is equivalent to 17.7% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult . 3. How to use Pharmorubicin If you a re prescribed Pharmorubicin it will only be given to you by do ctors or nurses experienced in giving chemotherapy. This medicine will normally b e given to you by a doctor or a nurse through a drip (infusion) into a vein. Your doctor will decide what dose t o give and the number of days' treatment you will receive depe nding on your condition. The dose is decided by taking into account the conditio n you have, your height and weight. From your height and weight the doc tor will work out your body surface area, and it is this that your dose is calculated from . Pharmorubic in can also be put directly into the bladder to treat bladder cancer, or to help p revent it returning. The dose depends on the type of bladder cancer you have. When this medicine is injected directly into the bladder, you will be instructed no t to drink an y fluid for 12 hours before treatment to avoid dilution of the medicine with urine in your bladder. While one course of treatment may sometimes be enoug h, more often your doctor will advise fur ther courses in three or four weeks' time. It may take several courses before your illness is under control and you feel better. Regular checks by your doctor during Pharmorubicin treatment During treatment your d octor will be making regular checks of yo ur: Blood - to check for low blood cell counts t hat may need treatment Heart function - heart damage can occur when high doses of Pharmorubicin are given. This may not be detected for several weeks, so regular test s may be required during this period Live r - using blood tests to check that this medicine is not affec ting the way it functions in a harmful way Blood uric acid levels - Pharmorubicin may increase uric acid levels in the blood , which might cause gout. Ano ther medicine may be given if your uric a cid levels are too high Page 5 of 18 If you receive high dose s of Pharmoru bicin High doses can worsen side effects like sores in the mouth or may decrease the number of white blood cells (which fight infection) and platelets ( these help the blood to clot) in the bloo d. Should this happen, you may need antibiotics o r blood trans fusions. Mouth ulcers can be treated to make them less uncomfortable as they heal. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask y our doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 4.

Presentation: Sterile, red, mobile solution containing 10 mg, 20 mg, 50 mg and 200 mg of epirubicin hydrochloride as a 2 mg/ml solution in 0.9% sodium chloride solution. Uses: Pharmorubicin has produced responses in a wide range of neoplastic conditions including breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal of epirubicin has been found to be beneficial in the treatment of superficial bladder cancer, carcinoma -in-situ and the prophylaxis of administration: Intravenous administration: Pharmorubicin is not active when given orally and should not be injected intramuscularly or intrathecally. Pharmoru bicin solution should be administered only under the supervision of a qualified physician experienced in antibl astic and cytotoxic therapy. Treatment with h igh dose Pharmorubicin in particular requires the availability of facilities for the care of possibl e clinical complications due to profound myelosuppression. It is advisable to give the drug via a freely -runni ng I.V. saline infusion after checking that t he needle is well placed in the vein. This method minimises the risk of drug extravasation and makes sure that the vein is flushed with saline after the administration of the drug. Extravasation of Pharmorubicin from the vein during injection may give rise to severe tissue lesions, even necrosis. Venous sclerosis may result from injection into small vessels or repeated injections into the same vein. Conventional doses: When Pharmorubicin is used as a single agen t, the recommended dosage in adults is 60 -90 mg/m\u00b2 body area; the drug should be injected I.V. over 3 -5 minutes and, depen ding on the patient's haematomedullary status, the dose should be repeated at 21 -day intervals. Dose modification (reduction) followi ng signs of toxicity (specifically severe neu tropaenia/neutropaenic fever and thrombocytopaenia, which could persist on Da y 21 after the first dose) could be required or the following dose could be delayed, as in cases of liver impairment. High doses: Pharmorubicin as a single agent for the treatmen t of lung cancer at high doses should be administered according to the follow ing regimens: small cell lung cancer (previously untreated): 120 mg/m\u00b2 day 1, every 3 weeks. non-small cell lung cancer (squamous, lar ge cell, and adenocarcinoma previously untrea ted): 135 mg/m\u00b2 day 1 or 45 mg/m\u00b2 days 1, 2, 3, every 3 weeks. Page 10 of 18 breast cancer: in the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer patients with positive lymph nodes, intravenous doses of epirubicin ranging from 100 mg/m\u00b2 (as a single dose on day 1) to 120 mg/ m\u00b2 (in two divided doses on days 1 and 8) every 3 -4 weeks, in combination wit h intravenous cyclophosphamide and 5 -fluorouracil and oral tamoxifen, are recommended. The drug should be given as an I.V. bolus over 3-5 minutes or as an infusion up to 30 minut es. Lower doses (60 -75 mg/m\u00b2 for conventional treatment and 105 -120 mg/m\u00b2 for high dose schedules) are recommended for patients whose bone marrow function has already been impaired by previous chemotherapy or ra diotherapy, by age, or neoplastic bone marrow infiltration. The total dosage per cycle may be divided over 2 -3 successive days. When the drug is used in combination with other antitumour agents, the doses need to be adequately reduced. Since the major rou te of elimination of Pharmorubicin is the hep atobiliary system, the dosage should be reduced in patients with imp aired liver function, in order to avoid an increase in overall toxicity. Moderate liver impairment (bilirubin: 1.4 -3 mg/100 ml) requires a 50% reduction of dose, while severe impairment (b ilirubin 3 mg/100 ml) necessitates a dose reduction of 75%. Moderate renal impairment does not appear to require a dose reduction in view of the limited amount of Pharmorubicin excreted by this route. Intrave sical administration: Pharmorubicin may be gi ven by intravesical administration for the treatment of superf icial bladder cancer and carcinoma -in-situ. It should not be used in this way for the treatment of invasive tumours which have penetrated the bladder wall where systemic therapy or surgery is mo re appropriate. Epirubicin has also been successfully used int ravesically as a prophylactic agent after transurethral resection of superficial bladder tumours in order to prevent recurrences. While many regimen s have been used, the following may be helpfu l as a guide: for therapy, 8 x weekly instillations of 50 mg/5 0 ml (diluted with saline or distilled sterile water). In the case of local toxicity (chemical cystitis), a dose reduction to 30 mg/50 ml is advised. For carcinoma -in-situ, depending on the individual tolerability of the patient, the dose may be increased up to 80 mg/50 ml. For prophylaxis, 4 x weekly administrations of 50 mg/50 ml followed by 11 x monthly instillations at the same dosage, is the sched ule most commonly used. The solution should be retained intravesically for 1 hour. To avoid undue dilution with urine, the patient should be instructed not to drink any fluid in the 12 hours prior to instillation. During instillation, the patient should b e rotated occasionally and should be instruct ed to void at the end of the instillation time. Contraindicat ions: Hypersensitivity to epirubicin or any other other anthracyclines severe arrhythmias Page 11 of 18 previous treatments with maximum cumulative doses of epirubicin and/or other anthracyclines and anthracenediones (see sectio n 4.4) patients with acute infection s unstable angina pectoris myocardiopathy Intravesical use: urinary tract infections inflammation bladder haematuria invasive tumours penetrating the bladder catheterisation problems Warnings & Precau tions (refer to the SPC, section 4.4 - speci al warnings & precautions for use, for further information) General Epirubicin should be administered only under the supervision of qualified physicians experienced in the use of cytotoxic therapy. Patients sh ould recover from acute toxicities (such as s tomatitis, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and generalized infections) of prior cytotoxic treatment before beginning treatment with epirubicin. While treatment with high doses of epirubicin (e.g., 90 mg/m2 every 3 to 4 weeks) causes adverse events gener ally similar to those seen at standard doses (< 90 mg/m2 every 3 to 4 weeks), the severity of the neutropenia and stomatitis/ mucosal inflammation may be increased. Treatment with high doses of epirub icin does r equire special attention for possible clinica l complications due to profound myelosuppression. Cardiac function - Cardiotoxicity is a risk of anthracycline treatment that may be manifested by early (i.e., acute) or late (i.e., delayed) events. The risk of developing CHF increases rapidly with inc reasing total cumulative doses of epirubicin in excess of 900 mg/m2; this cumulative dose should only be exceeded with extreme caution (see section 5.1 - pharmacodynamic properties, clinical studies). Cardiac f unction should be assessed before patients un dergo treatment with epirubicin and must be monitored throughout th erapy to minimize the risk of incurring severe cardiac impairment. Given the risk of cardiomyopathy, a cumulative dose of 900 mg/m2 epirubicin should be exceeded only with extreme caution. Heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II -IV) has been observed in patients receiving trastuz umab therapy alone or in combination with anthracyclines such as epirubicin. This may be moderate to severe and has been associated with death. Trastuzumab and anthracyclines such as epirubicin should not be used currently in combination except in a well -controlled clinical trial setting with cardiac monitoring. Patients who have previously received anthracyclines are also at risk of cardiotoxicity with trastuzumab treatment, although the risk is lower than with concurrent use of traztuzumab and anthracyclines. Page 12 of 18 The reported half -life of trastuzumab is variable. The substance may persist in the circulatio n for up to 7 months . Therefore, physicians s hould avoid anthracycline -based therapy for up to 7 months after stopping trastuzumab when possible. If this is not possible, the patient's cardiac function should be monitored carefully. If symptomatic cardiac failure develops during trastuzumab therapy after epirubicin therapy, it should be treated with the standar d medications for this purpose. There have been sporadic reports of foetal/ neonatal cardiotoxic events including foetal death following in utero e xposure to epirubicin (see section 4.6). (Please refer to the SPC, section 4.4 - special warnings & precautions for use, for further information) Haematologic toxicity - As with other cytotoxic agents, epirubicin may produce myelosuppression. Haematolog ic profiles should be assessed before and dur ing each cycle of therapy with epir ubicin, including differential white blood cell (WBC) counts. Secondary leukaemia - Secondary leukaemia, with or without a preleukaemic phase, has been reported in patients tr eated with anthracyclines, including epirubic in. Gastrointestinal - Epirubici n is emetigenic. mucosal inflammation /stomatitis generally appears early after drug administration and, if severe, may progress over a few days to mucosal ulcerations. Liver function - The major route of elimination of epirubicin is the hepatobiliary system. Serum total bilirubin and AST levels should be evaluated before and during treatment with epirubicin. Lower doses of epirubicin are recommended in patients with elevated bilirubin o r AST levels. Renal function - Serum creatinine should be assessed before and during therapy. Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with serum creatinine >5 mg/dL. Effects at site of injection - Phlebosclerosis may result from an injectio n into a sm all vessel or from repeated inject ions into the same vein. Following the recommended administration procedures may minimize the risk of phlebitis/thrombophlebitis at the injection site (see section 4.2). Extravasation - Extravasation of epirub icin during intravenous injection may produce local pain, severe tissue lesions (vesication, severe cellulitis) and necrosis. The adverse effect of extravastation of anthracyclines may be prevented or reduced by immediate use of a s pecific treatment e.g . dexrazoxane (please refer to relevant labels f or use). The patient's pain may be relieved by cooling down the area and keeping it cool, using hyaluronic acid and DMSO. If extravasation occurs the patient should be monitored closely d uring the subsequent per iod of time, as tissue necrosis at the extrav asation site may occur after several weeks from the extravasation episode. Other - As with other cytotoxic agents, thrombophlebitis and thromboembolic phenomena, including pulmonary embo lism (in some cases fata l), have been coincidentally reported with th e use of epirubicin. Tumour -lysis syndrome - Epirubicin may induce hyperuricemia because of the extensive purine catabolism that accompanies rapid tibility infections - Administration of live or live - attenuated vaccines in patients immunocompromised by chemotherapeutic agents including epirubicin, may result in serious or fatal infections (see section 4.5). Vaccination with a live vaccine should b e Page 13 of 18 avoided in patients rec eiving epirubicin. Killed or inactivated vaccines may be administered; however, the response to such vaccines may be diminished. Reproductive system - Epirubicin can cause genotoxicity . Men and women treated with epirubicin shoul d adopt appropriate contr aceptives during and for a period after treatment with epirubicin (see section 4.6). Intravesical administration of epirubicin may produce symptoms of as dysuria , polyuria, nocturia, stranguria, haematuria, bladder discomfort, necrosis of the bladder wall) and bladder constriction. Intra -arterial administration of epirubicin (transcatheter arterial embolization for the localized or regional therapies of primary h epatocellular carcinoma or liver metastases) may produ ce (in addition to systemic toxicity qualitatively similar to that observed following intravenous administration of epirubicin) localized or regional events which include gastro -duodenal ulcers (probabl y due to reflux of the drugs into the gastric artery) and narrowing of bile ducts due to drug -induced sclerosing cholangitis. This route of administration can lead to widespread necrosis of the perfused tissue. Excipient with known effect This medicinal p roduct may be further prepared for administra tion with sodium containing solutions (see section 4.2 and 6.6) and this should be considered in relation to the total sodium from all sources that will be administered to the patient. For addit ional warnings a nd precautions for other routes of administra tion refer to the SPC section 4.4 - special warnings & precautions for use. Interactions: Epirubicin is mainly used in combination with other cytotoxic drugs. Additive toxicity may occur especia lly with regard to bone marrow/haematologic and gastro -intest inal effects (see section 4.4). The use of epirubicin in combination chemotherapy with other potentially cardiotoxic drugs , as well as the concomitant use of other cardioactive compounds (e.g., calcium channel b lockers), requires monitoring of cardiac func tion throughout treatment. Epirubicin is extensively metabolized by the liver. Changes in hepatic function induced by conc omitant therapies may affect epirubicin metabolism, pharmacokinetics, therapeutic effica cy and/or toxicity (see section 4.4). Anthra cyclines including epirubicin should not be administered in combination with other cardiotoxic agents unless the patient's cardiac function is closely monitored. Vaccination with a live vaccine should be avoide d in patients receiving epirubicin. Killed or inactivated vaccines may be administered; however, the response to such vaccines may be diminished. Cimetidine increased the AUC of epirubicin by 50% and should be discontinued during treatment with epirubici n. When given prior to epirubicin, paclitax el can cause increased plasma concentrations of unchanged epirubicin and its metabolites, the latter be ing, however, neither toxic nor active. Increase of myelosuppression may occur in patients receiving combin ation therapy of anthracycline and dexrazoxan e.

Page 16 of 18 Pregnancy There are limited amount of data from the use of epiru bicin in pr egnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Experimental data in animals suggest that epirubicin may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Avoid the use of epirubicin during the 1st t rimester. Available human data do not establish the presence or absence of major birth defects and miscarriage related to the use of epirubicin during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. If epirubicin is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant wh ile taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the foetus. There have been sporadic reports of foetal and/or neonatal transient ventricular hypokinesia, transient elevation of cardiac foetal from susp ected anthracycline -induced cardiotoxicity following in utero exposure to epirubicin in 2nd and/or 3rd trimesters (see section 4.4). Monitor the foetus and/or neonate for cardiotoxicity and perform testing consistent with community standards of care. Epirubicin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. Breast -feeding It is not known whether epirubicin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs, including other anthracyclines, are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from epirubicin, lactating women shou ld be advised not to breast -feed during treatment with epirubicin and for at least 7 days after last dose . Impairment of fert ility Epirubicin could induce chromosomal damage in human spermatozoa. Men undergoing treatment with epirubicin should seek advice on sperm preservation due to the possibility of irreversible infertility caused by therapy. Epirubicin may cause amenorrhoea or premature menopause in premenopausal women. Women of childbearing potential/ Contraception in males and females Women o f child -bearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during treatment and to use effective contraceptive methods d uring treatment and for at least 6.5 months after last dose. Men undergoing treatment with epirubicin should be advised to use effective contraceptive methods during treatment and for at least 3.5 months after the last dose. Refer to SPC section 4.6 - pregnancy and lactation, for further information. Effects on ability to drive and use machines There have been no reports of particular adverse events relating to effects on ability to drive and to use machines. Overdosage: Acute overdosage with epirubici n will result in severe myelosuppression (mainly leucopoenia and thrombocytopenia), gastrointestinal toxic effects (mainly mucosal inflammation ) and acute cardiac complications. Latent cardiac failure has been observed with anthracyclines several months to years after Page 17 of 18 completion of treatment (see section 4.4). Patients must be carefully monitored. If signs of cardiac failure occur, patients shoul d be treated according to conventional guidelines. Treatment: Symptomatic Epirubicin cannot be removed by dialys is. Pharmaceutical precautions: The following protective recommendations are given due to the toxic nature of this substance: Personnel should be trained in good technique for handling. Pregnant staff should be excluded from working with this drug. Perso nnel handling Pharmorubicin Solution should wear protective clothing: goggles, gowns, and disposable gloves and masks. All items used for administration or cleaning, including gloves, should be placed in high -risk waste - disposal bags for high -temperature i ncineration. Spillage or leakage should be treated with dilute sodium hypochlorite (1% available chlorine) solution, preferably by soaking, and then water. All cleaning materials should be disposed of as indicated previously. Accidental contact with the s kin or eyes should be treated immediately by copious lavage with water, or soap and water, or sodium bicarbonate solution; medic al attention should be sought. Discard any unused solution. Incompatibilities Prolonged contact with any solution of an alkali ne pH should be avoided as it will result in hydrolysis of the drug. Pharmorubicin should not be mixed with heparin due to chemi cal incompatibility which may lead to precipitation when the drugs are in certain proportions. Pharmorubicin can be used in com bination with other antitumour agents, but it is not recommended that it be mixed with other drugs. Shelf life Glass vials - three years from time of manufacture.
