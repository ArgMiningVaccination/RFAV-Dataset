Chlorocresol Topical, parenteral cyclodextrin(s) in each <dosage unit><unit volume> <which is equivalent to x mg/<weight><volume>>. Do not use in children less than 2 years old unless recommended by your doctor. Cyclodextrins (CDs) are excipients which can influe nce the properties (such as toxicity or skin penetratio n) of the active substance and other medicines. Safety as pects of CDs have been considered during the development and safety assessment of the drug product, and are clearly stated in the SmPC. There is insufficient information on the effects of CDs in children < 2 years old. Therefore, a case by case judgement should be made regarding the risk/benefit for the patient. Based on animal studies and human experience, harmf ul effects of CDs are not to be expected at doses belo w 20 may digestive problems such as diarrhoea. At high doses cyclodextrins can cause reversible diarrhoea and cecal enlargement in animals. Annex to the European Commission guideline on 'Exci pients in the labelling and package leaflet of medi cinal products for human use' (SANTE-2017-11668) EMA/CHMP/302620/2017/EN Rev. 1 Page 5 of 19Name Updated on Route of Administration Threshold Information for the Package Leaflet Comment s mg/kg/day and use for > 2 weeks If you have a kidney disease, talk to your doctor before you receive this medicine. In children less than 2 years, the lower glomerular function may protect against renal toxicity, but ca n lead to higher blood levels of cyclodextrins. In patients with moderate to severe renal dysfuncti on accumulation of cyclodextrins may occur. Dimethyl sulphoxide Topical Zero May be irritant to the skin. Ethanol 22/11/2019 Oral Parenteral Inhalation Zero This medicine contains x mg of alcohol (ethanol ) in each <dosage unit><unit volume> <which is equivalent to x mg/<weight><volume>><(y% w/<w><v>)>. The amount in <dose><volume> of this medicine is equivalent to less than A ml be er or B ml wine. The small amount of alcohol in this medicine will not have any noticeable effects. Where ethanol is present as a processing agent (for example in tablet coating) or extraction solvent an d is evaporated off (under the level of ICH Q3C) there i s no need to mention ethanol in patient information. To calculate the equivalent volume of beer and wine , assume the ethanol content of beer to be 5% v/v (al cohol by volume, ABV), which is equivalent to 4% w/v, and of wine to be 12.5% v/v or 10% w/v (the specific gravi ty of ethanol has been approximated as 0.8). Volumes of beer and wine (A and B) should be rounde d up to the next whole number. Annex to the European Commission guideline on 'Exci pients in the labelling and package leaflet of medi cinal products for human use' (SANTE-2017-11668) EMA/CHMP/302620/2017/EN Rev. 1 Page 6 of 19Name Updated on Route of Administration Threshold Information for the Package Leaflet Comment s To calculate the equivalent volume of beer and wine , assume the ethanol content of beer to be 5% v/v (al cohol by volume, ABV), which is equivalent to 4% w/v, and of wine to be 12.5% v/v or 10% w/v (the specific gravi ty of ethanol has been approximated as 0.8). Where relevant, the interactions of ethanol should be stated in the SmPC (section 4.5). Suggestion for information in the SmPC: A dose of (select maximum dose) of this medicine administered to (a child A years of age and weighin g B kg or an adult weighing 70 kg) would result in exposur e to C mg/kg of ethanol which may cause a rise in blood al cohol concentration (BAC) of about D mg/100 ml (see Appen dix 1 of report EMA/CHMP/43486/2018). For comparison, for an adult drinking a glass of wi ne or 500 ml of beer, the BAC is likely to be about 50 mg /100 ml. Co-administration with medicines containing e.g. propylene glycol or ethanol may lead to accumulatio n of ethanol and induce adverse effects, in particular i n young children with low or immature metabolic capacity. When a dose is given over prolonged period (e.g. by slow infusion over several hours), the rise in BAC will be less and the effects of ethanol may be reduced. In such cases the package leaflet and SmPC should include a state ment such as: Because this medicine is usually given slo wly over XX hours, the effects of alcohol may be reduce d. This medicine contains x mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each <dosage unit><unit volume> <which is equivalent to x mg/<weight><volume>><(y% w/<w><v>)>. The amount in <dose><volume> of this medicine is equivalent to A ml beer or B ml wine. The amount of alcohol in this medicine is not likel y to have an effect in adults and adolescents, and it s effects in children are not likely to be noticeable . It may have some effects in younger children, for example feeling sleepy. The alcohol in this medicine may alter the effects of other medicines. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine. If you are addicted to alcohol, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine. 15 mg/kg per dose Oral Parenteral Inhalation 22/11/2019 Ethanol Annex to the European Commission guideline on 'Exci pients in the labelling and package leaflet of medi cinal products for human use' (SANTE-2017-11668) EMA/CHMP/302620/2017/EN Rev. 1 Page 7 of 19Name Updated on Route of Administration Threshold Information for the Package Leaflet Comment s Ethanol 22/11/2019 Cutaneous Zero This medicine contains x mg alcohol (e thanol) in each <dosage unit><unit volume> <which is equivalent to x mg/<weight><volume>> (y% w/<w><v>). It may cause burning sensation on damaged skin. In neonates (pre-term and term newborn infants), hi gh concentrations of ethanol may cause severe local reactions and systemic toxicity due to significant absorption through immature skin (especially under occlusion). The corresponding warning in the SmPC/P L should be added if appropriate. Depending on the product and concentration of ethan ol, the warning \"flammable\" may be necessary. Inclusion of warnings on use near an open flame, lit cigarette o r some devices (e.g. hairdryers) should be considered. See comments above.

Information relates to a threshold based on the tot al amount of sodium in the medicinal product. It is especially relevant to products used in child ren or in patients on a low sodium diet, to provide informati on to prescribers and reassurance to parents or patients concerning the low level of sodium in the product. Sodium 09/10/2017 Oral, parenteral 1 mmol (23 mg) per dose This medicine contains x mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each <dosage unit><unit volume>. This is equivalent to y% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. For parenterals with variable (e.g. weight-based) d osing sodium content may be expressed in mg per vial. Proposed wording for SmPC: \"This medicinal product contains x mg sodium per <dosage unit>, equivalent to y% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.\" Sodium 09/10/2017 Oral, parenteral 17 mmol (391 mg) in the maximum daily dose Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you need <Z> or more <dosage units> daily for a prolonged period, especially if you have been advised to follow a low salt (sodium) diet. This applies only to products for which the labelle d posology allows the product to be taken on a daily basis for > 1 month or repeated use for more than 2 days every week. 17 mmol (391 mg) is approximately 20% of the WHO adult recommended maximum daily dietary intake of 2 g sodium and is considered to represent 'high' sodium . This is also relevant for children, where the maxim um daily intake is considered to be proportional to ad ults and based on energy requirements. <Z doses> reflects the lowest number of dosage unit s for which the threshold of 17 mmol (391 mg) of sodium i s reached/ exceeded.
