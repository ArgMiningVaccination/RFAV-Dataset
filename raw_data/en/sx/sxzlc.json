The AO will work directly with artists who practice traditional art forms. The forms of traditional expression can include but are not limited to: crafts, music, dance, ritual, and technical skills. This program centralizes local artists and their artistic processes as vehicles for community vitality. This funding opportunity recognizes that artists are integral to healthy communities, and that the arts are a societal cornerstone that brings people together, builds community, and fosters social progress. Eligible Request Amounts The AO grant will fund up to $1,000,000 per year for two years for the following purposes: - Program design and implementation costs of up to 30% can be used for program design and implementation, including up to 10% to support administrative costs and 20% for staff salaries for artists and culture bearers to implement required program activities (see \"Administering Organization Requirements,\" above). - The CAC is proposing to serve one AO for this program. However, if it is determined that multiple applicants will meet the requirement of implementing statewide and engagement strategies to priority communities and trusted culture bearers, the CAC will consider distributing awards to multiple AOs. - Funding is contingent upon availability of funds and passage of the state budget for 2023-24 and 2024-25. Funds will be paid out at $1,000,000 during the first program year and $1,000,000 during the second program year, contingent on passage of the state budget for each year. Matching Funds This program does not require matching funds.
