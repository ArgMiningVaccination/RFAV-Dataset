However there really is no substitute for optimal nutrition. Colorful plant based foods, specifically fruits and vegetables, are the cornerstone to an anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant rich diet. It is well known that fruits like oranges and grapefruit are very high in anti-oxidants like vitamin C and that vegetables like carrots are rich in Vitamin A. However, there is so much to be said about the synergistic properties of all of these powerful plants. Seemingly every week, modern science learns more about the powerful anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant potential of combining these foods. COVID-19 fears have everyone asking, \"What I can do to protect myself from the coronavirus?\" Sadly, there is no cure for COVID-19. Therefore, the best things you can do are to minimize contact to reduce the risk of exposure, and to strengthen your immune system so that your body has the tools to fight any infection (not just a coronavirus). During this critical time, it is more important than ever to: Avoid processed and junk foods that cause inflammation and harm your immune system, Stock up on immune boosting food Immune boosting smoothies are a great way to \"inject\" a daily dose of phytonutient protection. Put away the junk foods, and leave your blender on the countertop as a constant reminder to take your daily dose. This is part of how my family and I are fighting this pandemic. In fact, even before coronavirus got to the U.S. , daily smoothies were a staple in my household. I cannot think of a better way to ensure adequate intake of all the colors of the rainbow on a daily basis. Here are just a couple recipes from Case Integrative Health to get started on your path to amping up your phytonutrient protection, and immune and anti-oxidant boosting potential. These include many foods high high in vitamins and anti-oxidants from my previous post, [Reducing Coronavirus Risk](https://www.caseintegrativehealth.com/post/protecting-yourself-from-coronavirus). Although I generally promote smoothies heavier in veggies rather than fruits, this smoothie is weighted more heavily in fruits so that even the younger ones may stay consistent with this prescription. All-In-One Ingredients 1-2 handfuls of organic greens like spinach and kale (high in Vitamin A and bioavailable B vitamins) 1/2 pink grapefruit (high in Vitamin C) 1 handful of fresh or frozen organic strawberries (high in Vitamins A and C and anti-oxidants) 1/2 cup chopped mango (high in Vitamin A and antioxidants) 1/4 cup orange juice 1/4 cup water 1-2 tsp pumpkin seeds (high in zinc) 1 tsp Nordic Naturals Arctic Cod Liver oil (rich in omega 3 fatty acids, Vitamin A and Vitamin D) 1000-2000 IU Liquid Vitamin D3 + K2 Blend all ingredients except for the cod liver oil and liquid vitamin D3. After well blended, gently mix in the vitamin D3 and cod liver oil. Blueberry Smoothie Ingredients 1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries 1/2 banana 1 cup frozen cauliflower florets 1/2 avocado 1 cup water, plus more as needed 1 TBS lemon juice 2 TBS ground flaxseed Optional: 1-3 TBS hemp protein Combine all ingredients in a high speed blender and blend until smooth and creamy.
