It is not a product of a systematic review. Readers are encouraged to consider the information presented and reach their own conclusions. Every orthopaedic surgeon has an ethical and professional oblig ation to stay abreast of the accelerating knowledge expansion occurring in the musculoskelet al sciences. The covenant that exists between surgeon and patient, and between the profession and society, requires the acceptance of this obligation. The rate of growth of scientific knowledge and clinical experience in our specialty places an extraordinary responsibility on each Ac ademy Fellow to maintain his or her knowledge base. However, the Academy believes that each orthopaedist must devel op his or her approach to knowledge maintenance in an organized and explicit manner to ass ure that it addresses content in all areas in which care is provided. Moreover, specific areas o f study identified by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education as essential to maintain ing physician competence should be used as an overall plan of study. They include: a. Patient Care that is compassionate, appropriate and effective for the treatment of health problems and the promotion of health b. Medical Knowledge about established and evolving biomedical, clinical and cognate (e.g. epidemiological and social-behavioral) sciences and the applica tion if this knowledge to patient care c. Practice-Based Learning and Improvement that involves investi gation and evaluation of their own patient care, appraisal and assimilation of scientific evid ence, and improvements in patient care d. Interpersonal and Communication Skills that result in effecti ve information exchange and teaming with patients, their families and other health professi onals e. Professionalism, as manifested through a commitment to carryi ng out professional responsibilities, adherence to ethical principles, and sensitiv ity to a diverse patient population f. Systems-Based Practice, as manifested by actions that demonst rate an awareness of and responsiveness to the larger context and system of health care and the ability to effectively call on system resources to provide care that is of optimal val ue. For more information on these \"six-competencies,\" see www.acgme.org . In addition to these six competencies, the Academy believes tha t Surgical Skills, that result in competent effective surgical care of patients with disorders of the musculoskeletal system, is a seventh core competency for orthopedic surgeons with a surgical practice. As an organization devoted to the education and continuing prof essional development of orthopaedic surgeons and others, the Academy makes available cu rrent, comprehensive, specialized educational materials to enhance their knowledge an d to facilitate the provision of improved patient care. The Academy's commitment to excellence i n education is enduring and substantive. Every orthopaedist should make a similar commitmen t. \u00a9March 1991 American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons\u00ae. Reviewed May 1996. Revised August 2003 and September 2007. Reviewed June 2012.

In an effort to ensure balance and avoi d commercialism, the Academy requests that course faculty use generic terminology in their presentations. Course Directors are requested to provide commentary and add balance if \"name- brands\" or \"only one way\" to perform surgery are included in faculty presentations. Our goal is to avoid commercialism in Academy programs. CME Policy Sept. 19, 1997 FDA Classification of Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals It is the orthopaedic surgeon's responsibility to know the FDA clearance status of any medical device or pharmaceutical used in the treatment of patients. These uses may be described and taught in presentations made during Academy Continuing Medical Education (CME) events and in \"enduring materials\" (e.g. publications, videos, electronic media products). The purpose of this policy is to guide Academy course directors and faculty members in CME events as well as authors and presenters of enduring materials in presenting information about the FDA clearance status of medical devi ces or pharmaceuticals for the uses described in their presentations and materials. The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended, establishes the basic legal framework controlling the activities of producers of food, drugs, cosmetics and medical de vices. The most comprehensive set of amendments to this Act occurred in 1976. The 1976 Medical Device Amendments (\"Amendments\") created a complex system for regulating the development, introduction, and marketing of medical devices. These Amendments requi re the FDA to classify or categorize all medical devices according to their safety and effectiveness. These classifications may vary for a medical devices based upon their \"intended use.\" The Amendments create three classes of devices: Class I Includes uses for those devices presenting little risk to the public and which are generally recognized as being both safe and effective. Neither quality and performance standards nor FDA pre -marketing regulatory approval are necessary. This classification is sub ject to minimal FDA oversight. This oversight includes only those general regulatory controls available to the FDA to assure safety and effectiveness (e.g., registration, listing and compliance with safety controls). Examples of Class I devices include ca st materials, crutches and wheelchairs. Class II Includes uses for those devices determined by the FDA to offer some additional risk to the public above Class I devices, for which the above mentioned regulatory controls are not sufficient to assure safet y and effectiveness, but for which sufficient information exists to develop performance standards. Device uses falling into this category must comply with the general requirements for Class I devices and, in addition, any other performance standards devel oped by the FDA. Examples of Class II devices include intramedullary nails, bone screws and plates when used for long bone fractures, and cemented hip replacements. Class III Includes uses for those devices for which general regulatory controls are not sufficient to assure safety and effectiveness, which may offer a substantial risk to the public and for which there is not sufficient information to establish a performance stand ard. Class III devices are generally considered to be \"new\" medical device uses requiring a showing of safety and effectiveness through a pre- market approval prior to labeling for the intended use. Class III devices may also be approved for certain intended uses if determined to be \"substantially equivalent\" to a pre -Amendment device. Examples of Class III devices currently (9/97) include ligament replacements and bone substitutes. Annual Meeting/CME Courses Educational Program 1. Faculty Responsibility All Annual Meeting speakers and CME course faculty members are responsible for knowing the status of FDA clearance of medical devices and pharmaceuticals for the uses discussed, described, or demonstrated in their educational presentations. Faculty member s who do not know the FDA clearance status of a device or pharmaceutical for the uses discussed, described or demonstrated can determine such status by examining the product package labeling, by contacting a sales representative or the regulatory affairs d epartment of the manufacturer of the device or by contacting the FDA at 1 -800-638-2041. 2. Use of Generic and Trade Names It is important that Academy courses provide a balanced view of therapeutic options for the treatment of musculoskeletal patients. Faculty use of generic names to describe a device or pharmaceutical creates a sense of impartiality and is strongly encouraged. When a trade name is used in a presentation, the faculty member should, when possible, list or cite other similar devices or pharmaceuticals from other companies. 3. Discussion of Investigational Use of Medical Devices or Pharmaceuticals Medical devices or pharmaceuticals not cleared by the FDA for an intended use are required by law to be labeled \"for investigational use\" if there is an existing IDE application for study of the intended use. When these investigational intended uses are d iscussed or described during an educational program, the faculty member shall disclose that the device or pharmaceutical is classified by the FDA as investigational with respect to the intended use. Results of scientific studies known to the faculty membe r relating to the described intended use should be discussed if doing so will not adversely affect the study or violate some other regulatory requirement (e.g., securities law). 4. Discussion of \"Off Label\" Use of Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals Some medical devices or pharmaceuticals not cleared by the FDA or cleared by the FDA for a specific use only may be used \"off -label\" (i.e., a use not described on the product's label) if, in the judgment of the treating physician, such use is medically ind icated to treat a patient's condition. \"Off label\" uses of a device or pharmaceutical may be described in Academy CME events so long as the lack of FDA clearance for such uses is also disclosed. Results from scientific studies known to the faculty member relating to the described intended use should be discussed if so doing will not adversely affect the study or violate some other regulatory requirement. 5. Academy CME Surgical Skills Events a. Faculty at Academy CME surgical skills events may demonstrate and conduct laboratory exercises using devices for uses for which the device has been cleared by the FDA. b. Faculty at Academy CME surgical skills events may demonstrate \"off label\" uses of devices if practice patterns develop and such use has become an accepted standard of practice, but only if the course director determines there is appropriate rationale for demonstrating such \"off label\" use. The lack of FDA clearance for a device in such use must be disclosed. Demonstration and laboratory exe rcises that include \"off -label\" uses of a device must receive c. approval from the Academy's Committee on Surgical Skills Education or Instructional Course Committee prior to the presentation at the course. The course director is responsible for submitting the request for the demonstration of an \"off -label\" use of a device. Annual Meeting/CME Event Exhibits 1. Technical Exhibits or Displays of Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals Exhibitors of medical devices or pharmaceuticals at the Academy's Annual Meetin g or other CME event must maintain at the exhibit information regarding the FDA status of each device displayed. Exhibitors are reminded of the current FDA policy prohibiting them from promoting intended uses not cleared by the FDA. 2. Signage at Technica l Exhibits or Displays of Devices or Pharmaceuticals Exhibitors of medical devices or pharmaceuticals at the Academy's Annual Meeting or other CME event shall place signage next to the product display indicating the FDA cleared labeling of the product. 3. Discussion of Off -Label Uses of Devices or Pharmaceuticals Prohibited at Technical Exhibits or Displays Exhibitors of medical devices or pharmaceuticals at the Academy's Annual Meeting or CME event are reminded of the current FDA policy prohibiting them from promoting \"off -label\" uses of such devices or pharmaceuticals. 4. Discussion of Investigational Devices or Pharmaceuticals at Technical Exhibits or Displays Exhibitors of medical devices or pharmaceuticals approved for investigational study at t he Academy's Annual Meeting or other CME event shall maintain at the exhibit information regarding the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) record of such devices or pharmaceuticals. An exhibitor may make reference to an IDE only in the context of obtai ning investigators.

In other words, person who testifies at a trial because he or she has special knowledge in a particular field.

You will be more relaxed and appear more confident if you are prepared Remember how hard you worked on your report?Be Prepared !!! Hold a pre-depo conference with retaining counsel - You will likely be asked about this at your deposition Did the meeting cause to change your opinions? Don't be defensive - Find out how much detail, retaining counsel wants - Take all reasonable steps to make sure you are preparedBe Prepared !!! Make sure your file is organized so that you have easy access to information you believe is important - looks good, too! -When were you first asked to be an expert? - Were you contacted by phone? - When did you receive the medical records?- Did you receive additional information? Know Your Report You will be questioned about notes, highlighting, etc. Be transparent - - It may be impractical not to take notes when you are preparing - Discarding notes when the report is written May look like cover-up - Make notes on Post-Its and removing them What if you forget to remove one?

Impeachment So why was the opposing attorney your friend in the discovery deposition? The word \"impeachment\" derives from Latin roots expressing the idea of becoming caught or entrappedImpeachment Testimony at a deposition is under oath Difficult to change your answers at trial -\"But Dr., isn't it true that in your deposition on --- you stated that.... Let me read that statement to you....\" Impeachment You reviewed all the medical records in this case, didn't you? - \" I reviewed the records that were provided to me by counsel.\" - Did you ask for any additional records? Why not?Impeachment Did you review any depositions in this case? -Are depositions considered part of the medical record? Impeachment using prior testimony -May have to defend prior testimony - Info is easily accessible to attorneysImpeachment Do not fall into the trap of allowing opposing counsel to characterize your opinion inaccurately - LISTEN! Tell the truth Admit to a mistake - eg. Previous testimony or new information availableIf Impeachment Fails On to tryingtodiscredityou by appearancePressure You the Expert Remain calm Avoid sarcasm Avoid being defensive Previous testimonyPressure You the Expert - If you have an established track record regarding certain opinions - eg. The accident did not cause the disc herniation/ DDD, etc, but the condition may have become symptomatic as a result, do not change your firmly held and previously testified to opinions for the purposes of a single depo (or other testimony) - Is it possible that in this case, the accident did cause the disc herniation? Composure Some questions will be difficult Concentrate and answer the question that has been asked \"No\" responses, if they are true and accurate are not a reason to panic or guess You are an expert, not an advocate Do not volunteer information because you are flustered Don't joke, argue, lose your temperDon't Fight The Cross Examiner If You Tell the Truth Be simple and direct -You are testifying under oath - You have a legal, ethical and professional obligation to tell the truth Accurately report findings, including info chosen for record reviews; be careful about interpreting other's notes in the record reviewIf You Tell the Truth Life as an expert witness is good Parting Suggestions Be professional, not casual Dress appropriately Be prepared Stay calm Avoid arguments with opposing counsel -Sets inappropriate tenor Avoid participating in any dispute between counselTake Home Be honest Be professional Be prepared melhorn@onemain.comAmerican Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons In appreciation and acknowledgment of Paul F Waldner J.D.

An Expert Witness May depend upon medical records and test reports. May rel ate what patient told you (though hearsay) and told others May provide an opinion based upon expert's education, training, and experience. Courtroom Rules Do not abide by a judge's directions, the jury will be told to disregard what you say Your entire te stimony may be stricken, which ends your usefulness to the attorney who retained you. At worst you will be in contempt of court, and face a fine or jail. This will influence your future as an expert. Presenting Your Opinion Know the case Know the case Know the case Juries quickly recognize a doctor who had not done his homework Know the case better than either attorney You are the expert - show it. \"The reference is on page..\" \"Are you talking about the first or second MRI?\" Always ask for ALL the recor ds. Know the theory of the case It may not be your theory It must coincide with the attorney's. Confirm the attorney who retained you knows what you will be saying, and you know what he will be pleading.
