An integrative treatment plan ensures full-body healing so that you can achieve optimal health and physical performance. Consistently rated as one of the best chiropractors in Denver, CO, Dr. Reinhardt is committed to a holistic approach for his clients. What Is a Holistic Approach in Medicine? The holistic approach to healthcare provides a complete form of care rather than treatment for one specific symptom. It means mental, emotional, and spiritual healing as much as it does physical healing. Holistic doctors understand that pain doesn't exist in isolation but is deeply influenced by an individual's overall well-being. Holistic care is dedicated to the patient's long-term health and wellness. Health professionals with holistic training treat not just pain but also the underlying causes. By addressing both treatment and prevention, holistic medicine is able to restore general health and peace of mind. What Does a Holistic Approach Mean in Chiropractic Care? Holistic chiropractic care combines techniques like joint adjustment, massage, exercise, ultrasound therapy, nutritional advice, and weight loss management to create a wellness plan unique to each individual. This type of full-body healing strategy targets the root causes of a condition and provides freedom from persistent negative symptoms like pain and fatigue. Holistic chiropractic treatment can be used together with conventional therapies. It can help to eliminate the unwanted side effects of medications and operative procedures, easing the recovery process as a result. How Do Holistic Approaches Differ From Other Chiropractic Care Methods? In general, chiropractic treatment involves manual manipulations or adjustments to the spine. Using precise manipulation of joints and muscles, chiropractors restore good communication between the brain and the rest of the body through the spine. Patients enjoy significant relief from pain and improved mobility with continued chiropractic care. What makes holistic chiropractic care unique is the personalized treatment every individual receives. Holistic treatments do not use a one-size-fits-all system but tailor medical care to suit a person's particular needs. Holistic chiropractors understand that the causes and characteristics of pain are different for everyone and are best treated as such. By combining effective physical therapies and practical lifestyle guidance, patients can enjoy better recovery results and lessen the likelihood of future complications. How a Holistic Chiropractor Can Improve Your Health Chiropractic care has been shown to improve flexibility, muscle strength, range of motion, and even general neurological health. Holistic chiropractors closely assess problem areas and then determine how pain might be impacting other areas of the body. Here are some of the most well-known benefits of quality chiropractic care: Easing neck and back pain Proper chiropractic treatment can relieve deep-rooted pain in the back or neck and can even act as an alternative to invasive surgeries. Holistic chiropractors offer medication-free solutions that can help ease chronic pain and improve scoliosis symptoms. Reducing inflammation Inflammation is one of the most common factors responsible for pain in the neck, upper and lower back, and joint tissues. Chronic inflammation is also associated with heart conditions and cancer. Chiropractic adjustments of the spine have been shown to lower inflammation and can therefore protect you from various inflammation-related diseases. Relieving chronic headaches Both migraines and tension-related headaches can be caused by the incorrect alignment of the nerves or muscle tension in the neck. Expert chiropractors can make adjustments to the spine and neck to reduce headache symptoms. Protecting connective joint tissues Osteoarthritis is a common condition that causes joint pain and stiffness as the connective tissues deteriorate. Chiropractic care can reduce arthritis symptoms by realigning bones to facilitate easier movement. Improving symptoms of neurological conditions As chiropractic care restores the complete functioning of neck joints and muscles, it improves blood flow to the brain. It can also enhance the flow of the cerebrospinal fluid, which serves important functions protecting and nourishing the brain and spine. Helping to improve posture Chiropractic treatments help correct poor posture and lessen pressure on nerve endings that might be causing pain. Spinal manipulations are especially beneficial if poor posture is caused by too much sitting or standing. Reducing the need for opioid and over-the-counter medications to manage pain Holistic chiropractors can be particularly helpful in lowering patients' dependence on medications. Most pain-relief medications that are prescribed by general practitioners can produce unwanted side effects like nausea, fatigue, and anxiety. Chiropractic care not only minimizes the need for opioid medications but is also more cost-effective in the long-term. In addition to treating chronic pain and improving mobility, holistic chiropractic care is a highly effective way to improve the overall quality of life. The primary goal of holistic treatments is to bring your musculoskeletal and nervous systems back into balance so that you enjoy a fuller and richer life. Lower blood pressure Chiropractic care has been shown to have the same effect as some of the medications that are commonly prescribed for hypertension or high blood pressure. Regular chiropractic treatments provide long-term benefits and can stabilize blood flow throughout the body. Improved digestion With the precise realignment of nerve bundles in the spine, the nerves in the gut are also revitalized. Chiropractic care lowers the incidence of gastrointestinal diseases by strengthening the brain-gut connection. Stronger immune system The body's immune and nervous systems are intimately linked and work together to keep you healthy. Through chiropractic adjustments, your practitioner can boost your immunity by stimulating nerves that communicate directly with the immune system. Reduced stress Chiropractic treatment also advances emotional well-being by reducing stress, easing muscle tension, and promoting relaxation. It is an effective therapy for sleep disorders and also supports mood stability. Enhanced athletic performance Given how many other direct benefits chiropractic care has for well-being, it's no surprise that it boosts athletic competence. Regular visits to the chiropractor improve the body's agility and elevate overall energy levels.
