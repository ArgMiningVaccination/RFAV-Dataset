Crystals are healing tools that provide emotional and mental support. They can be used to anchor us to healthy energies such as hope, courage, patience and willpower. Crystals have been associated with specific body parts for thousands of years. Crystal healing isn't \"new age\" - it is a very ancient practice that is [older than medicine or religion](https://moonrisecrystals.com/ancient-origin-of-healing-crystals/). Crystals can be used as talismans (objects that evoke good energy) and amulets (objects that protect against bad energy). Healing the body is rarely easy or fast. It may require lifestyle changes and/or modern medicine. Your healing journey may go smoothly, or it may be a bumpy and twisty road. Every healing journey has its unique challenges and will impact us psychologically. A wise person takes care of both the physical body and the emotional soul that lives inside it. In terms of practical use: you might hold a stone for comfort on the way to the hospital or back at home while recovering. Or, you might choose a crystal to help you focus while making healthcare plans and goals. A crystal can serve to remind you to stay committed to healthy habits or to stay upbeat when faced with difficult circumstances. At another time, you might need to hold a crystal while crying or feeling demoralized, because sometimes those hard moments are part of the journey too. You can put a single stone in your pocket, or create a medicine bag or grid to combine the power of multiple stones. There is no \"right way\" to use healing crystals. But pay close attention to what makes you feel grounded and supported. Crystals can be used to focus the mind-body healing connection. But they do not replace professional medical care. Your body, health, and life is precious. Please use wisdom when considering crystal therapies for healing.
