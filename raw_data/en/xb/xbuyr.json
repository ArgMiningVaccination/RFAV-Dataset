The purpose of the SCSN and Comprehensive Plan is to provide a collaborative mechanism to identify a nd address significant HIV care issues related to the needs of people living with HIV/AIDS (P LWHA) and to maximize coordination, integration, and effective linkages across the Ryan White Pa rts related to such issues. The SCSN and Comprehensive Plan must identify broad goals rela ted to the needs of PLWHA, identify critical gaps in life-extending care needed by PLWHA both in and out of care, and describe cross-cutting issues for the Care Act Parts. The Comprehens ive Plan portion of the document must describe a plan for the organization and delivery of health a nd support services in South Carolina. The plan must include appropriate stra tegies, goals and timelines. Contributions Many individuals from a wide variety of orga nizations across the state of South Carolina contributed to the developmen t of the South Carolina Ryan White Statewide Coordinated Statement of Need and Comprehensive Plan for 2009. The Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) st aff members that were instru mental in the process are: Dr. Wayne Duffus, Medical Director, STD/HIV Division Dr. Andre Manager, STD/HIV Division Susan Fulmer, Planning Coor dinator, STD/HIV Division Katrina Gary, Ryan White Quality Mana Division Roshan McDaniel, Evaluation Noreen O'Donnell, Ryan White Pr ogram Manager, STD/HIV Division Jacob Ramsey, Statistical and Re search Analyst, STD/HIV Division Leigh Williamson, Ryan White Program Coordinator, STD/HIV Division Professionals from other agencies who actively part icipated in providing i nput and feedback into the process and the completed document and who will be essential in the implementation of the plan are: Karen Bates, SC-C2EA Sharon Black, CareSouth Carolina Troy Bowers, PALSS Lane Brafford, Cata wba Care Coalition Aaron Creech, AID Upstate Luis Cruz, Mecklenburg County Teresa Davis, Sandhills Medical Foundation Pat Derajtys, University of South Carolina Ann Derrick, Cooperative Ministry 5 Consuela Drayton, Medical University of South Carolina Atensia Earp, PALSS Wanda Gardner, USC Pediatrics Christine Gordon, HH-Edisto and HH-Lower Savannah Mahogany Graham, SCHAC Andy Hall, AID Adrena Harrison, AETC Johanna Tracey Lembo, USC Hope Health MUSC Jennifer McDaniel, Catawba Pam McKnight, Lowcountry Health Care Systems David Napp, Facilitator Aaron O'Brien, Roper Nancy Raley, USC DOM Aishah ACCESS Network Valetta Rhinehart, Mecklenburg County Susan Rodriguez, Lowcountry AIDS Services Anna Katherine Rye, University of South Carolina Ralph Rynes, LRADAC Stacy W.

Process The SCSN and Comprehensive Plan were develope d collaboratively with the input of a broad spectrum of HIV/AIDS stakeholders in South Carolina. Two full-day participatory meetings were convened on September 17, 2008, and November 7, 2008, in Columbia, S.C. The first meeting included a discussion of the SCSN process and purpose. Participants provided input regarding cross cutting barriers and gaps in HIV care. The second meeting was used to identify the goals, objectives, and strategies described in this plan. An external consultant designed and 6 facilitated both meetings. The actual combin ed SCSN and Comprehensive Plan document was drafted by DHEC staff using historical resour ces, surveillance data , program management experience and all of the comm unity input received during the two stakeholder meetings. Introduction Part B of Title XXVI of the Public Health Se rvice (PHS) Act, as amended by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006 au thorizes the federal Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to award formula- based grants to states to improve the quality, availability, and organization of health care and support services for persons and families with HIV disease. Part B of Title XXVI of the PHS Ac t was previously referred to as Title II of the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emerge ncy (CARE) Act, the predecessor statute. The legislation governs the Ryan White program, which is administered by the Division of Service Systems (DSS), HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB), within HRSA. There are five Parts under the Ryan White legislation. The South Carolina De partment of Health and Environmental Control (SC DHEC) is responsible for the administration of the Part B pr ogram in South Carolina. The Part B program in each state, as designated by the Ryan White legislation, is responsible for the development of a Statewide Coordinated Statem ent of Need (SCSN) and Comprehensive Plan for all entities in the state receiving Ryan White assistance. Executive Summary The 2009 Statewide Coordinated Statement of N eed (SCSN) and Comprehensive Plan (CP) summarizes HIV-related service needs and barr iers across South Carolina, and presents goals and strategies for its evolving HIV servic e continuum. This document, an update of the SCSN and CP submitted in 2006, has been prepared in accordance with th e legislative mandate in the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006 and accompanying guidelines issued by the federal Health Res ources and Services Administration (HRSA). A multi-step process was employed to prepare this document. For the development of the SCSN a comprehensive review of existing Ryan White services in South Carolina was conducted along with a review of the HIV epidemiological data fo r the state. A stakeholder meeting was held to gather input regarding the barrie rs and gaps in the current care system. All of the above information is summarized and organized in sepa rate Sections of the SC SN, as outlined in the Table of Contents. Additionally, at the time of this writing, a Ryan White Part B needs assessment effort is in process and this docum ent will be amended to include the information gained from that project. The Comprehensive Plan was prepared based on the data and information gathered through the SCSN process, a review and understanding of HR SA's Quality Management requirements and input gathered during a stakeholder meeting desi gned to develop strategies and activities to address the barriers and gaps in care. The final steps of the process included presenting the draft document to the South Carolina HIV Planning Council (HPC), the inte grated prevention and care pla nning body in the state. 7 The needs identified in this document are prem ised on the epidemiological profile of South Carolina, which, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has ninth highest rate of HIV in the United States. The needs most commonly identified for HIV infect ed persons can be broadly summarized in the following broad categories: Comprehensive health care Dental care Housing and related support services Substance/Alcohol abuse-related services Mental health services Linguistically and culturally compet ent services in all settings Case management and supportive services that enable linkage with and retention in care, and compliance with medication regimens, em phasizing in particular: transportation, food/nutrition services, legal as sistance, entitlements/benefits assistance, family support, peer education and support The Comprehensive Plan, contained in Section III of this document, includes broad goals, principles and strategies for e ngaging and retaining all HIV infected persons in early, high quality care and services. In gene ral, the goals address the need to: 1) ensure access to medical care 2) ensure quality of medical care and 3) ensure retention in care. The Comprehensive Plan describes numerous strategies to further all of the objectives associated with the three broad issue areas and goals. 8 SECTION I: Where Are We Now: What Is Our Current System of Care? Description of the Ryan White Part B Program The SC Department of Health and Environm ental Control (DHEC) is the state agency responsible for managing and administering the Ry an White Part B program for the state. The STD/HIV Division in the Bureau of Disease Control receive s the funding and manages the Program. The Program Manager, the ADAP Di rector, a Program Coordinator, a Quality Management Coordinator and the Ryan White Da ta Manager are the key personnel involved in administering the Ryan White Pa rt B program. Contracts are aw arded to service providers on a five-year, competitive cycle and once awarded are renewable annually. Fiscal responsibilities are implemented primarily by DHEC`s Health Services Operations unit. This includes managing service provider contracts, dis bursing funds, monitoring budgets, etc. Using this system, DHEC has been able to process/disburse fund s to contractors in a timely manner. DHEC awards contracts to HIV service providers in 11 regions of the state. The model of service delivery varies by region, depending upon the number and type of community partners within each region. In two regions of the state, the Ryan White Part B providers provide medical and support services through university based me dical clinics and CBO partners. In other regions of the state, the Part B providers work in synchronicity with the Pa rt C providers so that the part B provider is primarily tasked with providing supportive services while the Part C provider focuses on medical care, e ffectively sharing pati ents between the orga nizations. In two regions the Part B and the Part C provider are actually the same organization, thereby making available a virtual one-stop shop fo r PLWHA. Finally, there is at least one region of the state where the Ryan White Part B provider provides a ll of the supportive services and contracts for medical care with a network of physicians. The AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) supp lies medications to PLWHA who are income qualified and assists clients in paying health insurance premiums co-pays and deductibles. DHEC monitors service provider performance, both fiscally and programmatically. Service providers develop budgets based on local pr ioritization of needs following Ryan White guidelines. The budgets are submitted to the ST D/HIV Division for appr oval. Upon contract award, fiscal reports are required from each serv ice provider on a quarterly and annual basis. Service providers receive fiscal reports fr om subcontractors on a monthly basis. Programmatic monitoring is conducted in a numb er of ways, including mandatory participation in Ryan White Part B Peer Review Committee m eetings held at least quarterly. During these meetings, statewide standards and guidelines for activities such as clini cal quality management, case management are developed and agreed upon. Programmatic progress reports, based on information collected in HRSA's Ryan White Program Data Report (RDR) and the information necessary to complete the semi-annual progress report to HRSA, are re quired to be submitted semi-annually. 9 South Carolina HIV/AIDS Epidemiological Profile Emerging Epi Trends Affecting HIV Care a nd Service Delivery in South Carolina Rising HIV infection rates coupled with inadequate funding, res ources and infrastructures have resulted in a disparate situation in our public health care systems in the South, including the state of South Carolina. The impact of HIV/AIDS on populations that also di sproportionately reflect vast poverty and inadequate support continues to fuel the challenges of reducing new infections, identifying infections as early as possible and providing ad equate care and treatment. Four out of ten Americans living with AIDS re side in the South. The South has the highest number of people living with and dying from AIDS in the United States, and of the 15 states with the highest rates of new diagnoses, nine are in the South. Thes e facts and trends are reflected in the HIV care system within the state of South Carolina - a care system that has been consistently under-funded throughout th e years. Providers in South Carolina are challenged with caring for increasing numbers of patients in th e face of reduced budgets and the overwhelming backdrop of the stigma that surr ounds HIV/AIDS in the Bible Belt. In the United States, as well as in South Carolina, the HIV/AI DS epidemic disproportionately affects African-Americans compared with people of other races and ethnicities. In 2007, there were more than 14,600 people reported to be liv ing with HIV infection (including AIDS) in South Carolina. According to recent data, Sout h Carolina ranked third in the country for the proportion of people living with AIDS who are Af rican-American (72%). The rate of people living with HIV/AIDS per 100,000 is almost six times higher for black males than for white males. While race and ethnicity are not themse lves risk factors for HIV infection, African Americans are more likely, due to many years of institutionalized racism, to face challenges linked with HIV risk such as pove rty, substance abuse, denial a nd stigma. These factors present challenges to the care providers around cultural co mpetence and sensitivity. All providers within the care system must address these issues in orde r to promote increased access to and retention in HIV medical care and treatment. African-American men account for 15% of the state's population. However, in South Carolina African-American men account for 47% of the people living with HIV/AIDS and 49% of the people recently diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. Am ong African-American men recently diagnosed with reported risks, most cases (68 percent) were attributed to se xual contact among men who have sex with men (MSM). Heterosexual cont act accounts for 26% of all newly reported HIV/AIDS cases in men. About six percent of new cases reported injectin g drug use (figure 2). There are more than 6,900 African-American me n living with HIV/AIDS in South Carolina. More than 2,600 of those men repor ted sexual contact with other me n as the primary risk factor. The majority of those men (48%) are between 30-44 years of age. Recent years have revealed a growing Latino pop ulation in South Carolina and an increased number of HIV infections among Latinos. Latino s represent 2% of South Carolina's population and they represent 2% of those living with HI V/AIDS in South Carolina. However, Latinos 10 represent 5% of new HIV infections in South Ca rolina therefore, despite the relatively small proportion, this increasing trend cann ot be ignored. Again, the care system must be enhanced to be able to reach out to the Latino population. Following is a summary of the South Carolina HIV Ep idemiological Profile. It is included in its entirety as Appendix 1. South Carolina has experienced a 5% increase of persons living with HIV/AIDS from the end of calendar year 2005 to 2006. At the end of 2 006, there were 14,122 persons estimated to be living with HIV (including AIDS) in South Caro lina (Fig. 1), excluding persons diagnosed in other states who now live in the state. At the end of 2006 there were 7,026 people living with AIDS, 6,648 living with HIV ( non-AIDS), and 1,329 new AIDS cases diagnosed for 2005/2006. For most demographic categories, the proportion of cases is essentially similar for each these disease indicators. African Am ericans continue to be disproportionately impacted with HIV, especially African American me n. Nearly three of four pers ons living with HIV, AIDS and newly reported with AIDS are African Ameri can, and about 25% are white/Caucasian. Two percent (2%) of persons living with HIV and AIDS are Hispanic, slightly lower than new (incident) AIDS cases (3.5%). Figures 1 & 2 below show the growing number of persons living with HIV disease (including AIDS) by race/ethnicity and gender. Note: S.C.'s Epi Profile data used for Figures 1 - 5 analyzes HIV disease tr ends using the total of HIV cases including persons with AIDS, which differs slightly from th e data in Attachment 4. Men comprise the majority of living and incident cases; over one third (34%) of persons living with HIV (non-AIDS) are women, compared to 28% of persons living with AIDS. This may be a result of the past decade shif t of the epidemic to women, or more women are being diagnosed in earlier stages of disease than men. The hi gher proportion of wome n living with HIV (non- AIDS) compared to incident and prevalent AI DS cases may also be due to more women accessing HIV care and receiving antivirals, dela ying or preventing onset of AIDS defining conditions.

South Carolina has observed an increasing case rate among persons aged 20 - 24 years for HIV/AIDS cases newly reported dur ing 2005/2006 (Fig. 4). Nearly 800 persons are newly diagnosed with HIV (i ncluding AIDS) in South Carolina annually. Figures 3 & 4 below, from S.C. Epi Profile da ta, compare the numbers of recently diagnosed cases of HIV (including AIDS) in South Carolina during 2005 and 2006. There are no significant changes noted for most demographic cat egories for the two years. As noted above, there are more cases diagnosed among younger persons (20 - 24 yrs.); 57% of new cases in this age group are African American men. The predom inant exposure category reported was male-to- male sex. By exposure category, the HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Carolina continues to be primarily men who have sex men and heterosexual (each about 40% of prevalent and incident cases among persons with reported risk). Injecting drug use is not a major transmission category in SC, comprising 18% of persons living with HIV/AI DS. Comparing recently diagnosed HIV/AIDS cases by exposure category (Fig. 5), shows similar proportions for 2005 & 2006. Compared to living cases, injecting drug use accounts for 9% of new diagnosed cas es with risk reported. Fig. 5 Number of S.C.

At that time there were only three Ryan White service providers in the community and an AIDS Drug Assistance Program managed by DHEC. Th at year the service providers served 193 people living with HIV/AIDS and the ADAP, with a formulary that included only AZT, served 301 people. The state's care system has expanded and evolved over the past two decades to meet the needs of the changing epidemic. Currently there are 18 Part B service providers, 10 Part C service providers, 6 Part D service provi ders and an ADAP with over 60 drugs on the formulary. Total HRSA funding in the state for PLWHA is almost $35 million. The service providers continually adjust their services in response to the needs of the PLWHA in the state. For example, due to the increased proportion of women infected with HIV, South Carolina's care system responded with the creati on of a women's clinic at the University of South Carolina using both Part B and Part D funding. The USC women's clinic also links infants born to pregnant women to pediatric care. Additionally, at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston the Part B and Pa rt D programs work toge ther to ensure that women who are bringing their perina tally infected children to the pe diatric clinic can be seen in the adult HIV clinic on the same day. Approximately 30% of the HIV epidemic in Sout h Carolina is located in extremely rural areas with little or no access to public transportation. The care system ha s evolved to serve the current demographics of the epidemic; Ryan White care pr oviders continue to crea te innovative ways to address transportation issues - par ticularly in rural areas. Ryan White care providers assist with transportation through gas vouchers, bus tokens, volunteer drivers, contracts with rural transit authorities and coordination with the Medicaid van services. Finally, care providers have responded to the disproportionate impact of the HIV disease on African Americans by providing cult urally appropriate care. Culturally competent staff are hired and trained in order to provide optimal care and services to various minority and vulnerable populations. Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI) fu nding was first received from HRSA in 2001 ($162,085) for the purpose of providing education a nd outreach services that are intended to increase access for racial and ethnic minorities to ADAP or other prescription drug assistance programs. While MAI funding has remained steady with only a slight increase by 2008 ($176,539), through the leveraging of resources South Carolina is ab le to provide the following MAI services in selected areas of the state: Transitional Case Management to Link Ex-Offenders to HIV Care; Health Promoters for Adherence Support; and Short-Term Case Management to Link Newly Diagnosed to HIV Care. 13 Statewide Coordinated Statement of Need Participation and Input This SCSN was developed collaboratively with input from a wide vari ety of stakeholders including PLWHA, providers, public agency repr esentatives, Ryan White funded programs, and state agencies. DHEC is currently working to es tablish stronger relati onships with the state Medicaid agency and the state Mental Health provider. On October 15, 2008, a consumer Town Hall Forum was held in Columbia, South Carolina as a mechanism for PLWHA to express their need s and voice their opinions about HIV care and prevention services being delivered in South Carolin a. The results of that forum are included in the description of need section. In addition to the information gathered from th e stakeholder meeting and the Town Hall Forum, SC DHEC has contracted with Public Consu lting Group to conduct a consumer survey of the eleven Ryan White Part B providers that are under direct contract with DHEC. The survey is designed to assess barriers to ca re and gaps in services for PLWHA who seek care at Ryan White Part B agencies across the state. At the time of this writing the survey team is conducting surveys at agencies across the state. We exp ect to receive the full results of the survey by February 2009 and these results will be submitted as an amendment to this document. Legislative Requirements As a part of the SCSN, we are asked to describe the efforts we have taken to meet the new Ryan White legislative requirements in our state. The Ryan White care system in South Carolina has long been operating with limited resources a nd inadequate funding. Therefore, the new legislative requirements of the HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernizati on Act of 2006 have not had an impact on service delivery in South Carolina. We continue to maximize our resources and prioritize medical care and core services over su pport services. South Carolina has developed and implemented a Quality Management program that will allow the measurement of common outcomes for all pr oviders across the state. The Quality Management program is described in deta il in Section IV of this document. Unmet Need Analysis An unmet need analysis is conducted each year in South Carolina to determine the number and type of people who are not in care. This data al lows us to establish outreach programs that target particularly those who have fallen out of the care system. The unmet need analysis is conducted using a databa se of all CD4 and Viral Load tests that were performed throughout the year. South Carolina mandated reporting of all CD4 and viral load tests effective January 2004. During the first si x months of 2004, surveill ance staff worked to assure that all laboratories were reporting completely. With a laboratory based reporting system, we feel confident that we are not missing any individuals because of failure to report. Each year 14 we are able to conduct an assessment of the data base to determine the number of individuals who accessed care during the year. The following are th e results of the assessment for calendar year 2007. Population estimates: a) number people living with HIV/ non-AIDS who know their status = 6,963 b) number people living with AI DS who know their status= 8,502 Estimates of people in care: a) estimate of number and percent of PLWH/non-AIDS/aware who received HIV primary medical care = 3,049 (44%) b) estimate of number and percent of PLWA who received HIV primary medical care = 5,760 (68%) Estimates of unmet need: a) estimate of number and percen t of PLWH/non-AIDS/aware who did not receive HIV primary me dical care = 3,914 (56%) b) estimate of number and percent of PLWA who did not receive HIV primary medical care = 2,742 (32%) To summarize the unmet need data, as expecte d, a larger percentage of AIDS patients seek medical care, 68% versus 44%. A larger number of females (61%) than males (55%) seek medical care. Blacks seek medical care most often (58%) followed by whites (56%) and Hispanics (45%). Urban patients seek car e less often (56%) than rural (58%). Description of the Ryan White Care System in South Carolina There are 11 primary Part B service providers throughout the state. Th ere are 46 counties in South Carolina with three prim ary distinct regions - the Upstate, the Midlands and the Lowcountry. Each county is served by one of the 11 Part B service providers depending on geographic proximity to the serv ice provider. While many patient s in the outlying rural areas must travel to receive services, there are more and more options for care closer to home. For example, the University of Sout h Carolina that hosts a full time Ryan White clinic in Columbia also provides medical care in rural Sumter County one day ea ch week. Also, Catawba Care Coalition, the Ryan White service provider based in Rock Hill, offers clinical services at sites in Chester and Lancaster counties. There are currently 10 Ryan White Part C servic e providers in South Carolina with only one region (Upper Savannah) lacking acc ess to a Part C provider. Th e Ryan White Part C providers have formed strong partnerships with Part B providers in severa l regions of the state. We continue to promote effective working relationships among all th e Ryan White Parts in each region of the state. As a result of these str ong partnerships we have been able to maximize resources and prevent the duplication of services. There are 6 Ryan White Part D service providers in South Carolina - 4 medical clinics (three pediatric clinics and one women's clinic) and two community-based organizations that employ 15 consumer advocates. The Part D providers fo cus on caring for women and children. Services include primary medical care, medica l case management and peer advocacy. The map below indicates the location of each Ry an White provider with an overlay of the number of PLWHA in each region of the state. It should be noted th at HIV services have followed the HIV epidemic in South Carolina.

The ADAP formulary includes over 60 medications and the program serves over 3,000 clients annually. Specific local service provider services that have been identified for funding in FY 2009, based on the Needs Assessment efforts and the statewid e Comprehensive Plan include (but are not limited to): Ambulatory/Outpatient Medical Ca re, Medications, Oral He alth, Mental Health Services, Substance Abuse Services, Medical Case Management, Treatment Adherence/Compliance, Housing, Nutrition, Tr ansportation, and Health Education/Risk Reduction. During 2008, the program has reviewed serv ice priorities with each Ryan White Part B service provider to demonstrat e that at a minimum 75% of f unds are being expended on core services. The services that will be provi ded in FY 2009 will address the needs of the emerging rural, impoverished, men who have sex with men (M SM) and Hispanic communities in South Carolina. Providing satellite serv ices in the rural ar eas, including medical care, transportation, medical case management, outreach and education, mental health services and substance abuse services will empower these groups to enter and maintain care services. The Ryan White Parts B, C and D service providers provide an array of services that will help clients establish and maintain medical care comp liance. Treatment adherence counseling is an integral part of medical and s upportive services and all Ryan Wh ite patients receive treatment adherence messages in the clinic al and support services settin gs. Health Education/Risk Reduction services and Medical Tr ansportation services also ensure that clients will remain engaged in HIV/AIDS primary medical car e and adherence to HIV treatments. South Carolina provides services to women, in fants, children and youth in excess of the proportion to the percentage of the AIDS cases represented by each population. Ryan White Part B providers of care have typically exceeded ever y population with the exception of children ages 2-12 years and youth ages 13-24 si nce these populations are covered through Medicaid. Data from Medicaid and Ryan White Part D document service provision to this population. The following table illustrates the numbers served in each category and the related expenditures for South Carolina's Ryan White Part B program for 2007. 17 Documented State of South Carolina Pa rt B Expenditures by WICY Subgroup in FY2007 Subgroup Total Required Expenditures* Expenditures From ADAP & Part B**Expenditures From Medicaid*** (CY 2007) Total Women from HRSA/CDC estimates of PLWA in SC ** documented Part B expenditures calculated from nu mber of individuals served by subgroup for FY 2007.

In calendar year 2007 ther e were 3,233 PLWHA in South Carolina served by Medicaid with expenditures of almost $50 million. A complete chart describing Sout h Carolina's HIV services netw ork is included as Appendix C of this document. Ryan White Data Summary The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Data Report (RDR) is an annual report that captures information regarding the services provided by all Ryan White funded entities. The RDR is divided into sections including: service provider information; client information; service information; HIV counseling a nd testing; and medical inform ation. Providers report on all clients who received services eligible for Ryan White Parts A, B, C or D funding regardless of the actual funding source used to pay for those se rvices. The South Carolina Ryan White Part B contractors complete the RDR forms and submit them to DHEC. DHEC assembles all of the reports and submits the data to HRSA. Ryan White Parts C and D providers submit their RDR data directly to HRSA. For the purposes of this document, we used 2007 RDR data to produce the following summary data tables. The first table is a demographic breakdown of people served through South Carolina's Ryan White care system in calendar year 2007. It should be noted that the demographics of the clients in the RW care system closely mirror the demographics of the HIV epidemic in South Carolina. 18 Note : The data in this table does not include data from Sandhills Medical Foundation and CareSouth Carolina. Both agencies are Ryan White Part C providers that did not respond to this particular data request. It should also be noted that the data is unduplicated among all Part B providers and four of the eight Part C providers that submitted data. There may be some duplication due to the four Part C providers and the 4 Part D providers that do not use the Provide Enterprise data system as endorsed by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control for its Part B contractors.

The table below provides a tally of the types of stak eholders in attendance. Stakeholder Attendance Stakeholder Attendance PLWHA 5 Part B + C 3 Part A 1 Part B + D 1 Part B 10 DHEC 8 Part C 6 ADAP 1 Part D 3 Alcohol / Drug 1 AETC 1 An external consultant, David Na pp of Practical Applications of Public Health, was contracted by DHEC to design and facilitate the meeting, and produce this report . During the meeting, participants reviewed the need s identified in the 2006 SCSN and engaged in a series of small group discussions and report outs focusing on two key questions: 1. What makes it difficult for PLWHA w ho are in care to stay in care? 2. What makes it difficult for PLWHA who ar e not in care to ente r the care system? Small group reports and the ensuing discussi on with the large group was audio taped and transcribed. Transcripts were revi ewed by the consultant to identif y the issues described in this report and representative quotes we re selected for inclusion here in to illustrate key issues. Although the primary purpose of the meeting was to identify needs, participants occasionally offered suggestions for solutions or made obser vations about how some issues have improved. These comments are also included in this report and provide a spri ngboard for subsequent development of the Comprehensive Plan. Barriers for PLWHA in Care The following barriers were identified as being common across services for PLWHA in care. Three categories of barrier s are described below. They are not listed in priority order. 1. Client-related barriers: thes e barriers include characteristi cs of clients that impeded access to care 2. State and local care system barriers: these barriers describe system characteristics that impeded access to care 3. Federal-level barriers: these barriers includ national issues that affect the state and local care system 21 1. Client-Related Barriers Lack of transportation is a wide-spread barrier to health care for many people in South Carolina, including PLWHA. Transportation barriers limit access to and compliance with services for PLWHA, especially in rural areas of South Carolina where the public transportation infrastructure is non-existant. This issue is part icularly salient given th e recent dramatic increase in gasoline prices, which affect s individuals with their own mean s of transportation as well as agencies that provide tr ansportation assistance. \"Transportation is actually much bigger t han HIV and has to be placed in a much wider context as far as disparity and in equality. We need to be looking at transportation for everybody because that has come up every single year we talk about barriers in care, and if we did the same exercise ten years ago, housing and transportation, I'm sure, would be on the top of the list. But we need to figure out housing for everybody, transportation for ever ybody, which of course affects our patient population.\" Lack of housing hinders clients' ability to access and comply with HIV-related services and treatment because of the relati ve priority and immediacy indi viduals place on securing safe, stable housing versus seeking hea lth care, especially if they ar e asymptomatic. Inadequately housed PLWHA have difficulty with receipt and storage of and complianc e with medications. As cited in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, poor livin g conditions, including overcrowding and in extreme cases, homelessne ss, undermine safety, privacy and efforts to promote self- respect, human dignity and the attendant responsible sexual behavior. Also mentioned in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the fact that the lack of stable housing directly impacts the abil ity of people living in poverty to reduce HIV risk behaviors and homeless and unstably housed persons are two to six times more likely to use hard drugs, share needles or exchange sex than similar persons with stable housing. \"It's not just homelessness t hat is an issue but back to y our Maslow's hierarchy of needs in that people are looking for a pl ace to live before maybe they're getting into care.\" Many clients have unmet mental health and substance abuse needs which impact their ability to stay in the care system. These barriers are pa rticularly salient given the limited financial and organizational resources available to address th ese needs. Ryan White providers have limited resources to provide mental hea lth and substance abuse counseli ng on site and the overall state system of care for people with mental health a nd substance abuse issues is lacking. Without an overall change in the statewide system, clients w ill continue to struggle with these issues that prevent their access to and retention in HIV care. \"There are times when our clients come out of care and we don't know about it, and they might be dealing with some ment al health issues or substance abuse issues that will force them to be noncompliant and drop out of care.\" 22 Older clients who have been HIV+ for a long time may be fatigued with the long-term process of managing their illness, similar to the way pe ople may tire of managing other chronic illnesses such as diabetes or hypertension. \"We hear from clients a lot, particularl y those clients that are maybe 65 or 70 years old that 'I've be en doing this my whole life, I'm just tired of going through the process. I'm tired of going to the doctor all the time. I'm tired of having to worry about it.' And you can't blame them in a way. I think it's the same with other chronic illnesses, like diabetes. That 's why we've got fatigue and it can be a barrier to staying in care if they're tired of it.\" Clients do not always understand the administrative requirements necessary to access Ryan White services and may find the paperwork and eligibility process burdensome and confusing. Other clients may feel a sense of entitlement with regard to the types or level of services and assistance they believe shoul d be available to them. \"It's hard getting clients to understand wh y it's important to go get this form and why this has to be completed and how it has to be completed and to understand the steps of the system to get ADAP or patience assistance.\" \"We have clients that don't even know about Ryan White services. But then you have to balance telling them what you can provide versus other clients who feel this sense of entitlement. So it's a juggli ng act between telling them what you can provide and making sure that th ey're not abusing the system.\" The client related barriers to care are inadequate transportatio n, inadequate housing, umet mental health and substance abuse need s and burdensome administrative requirements. While these needs are not new to South Carolina, they rema in strong barriers for individuals living with HIV/AIDS to enter and remain in care. 2. State and Local Care-System Barriers Lack of Spanish speaking providers and translation services makes it difficult to meet the needs of an increasing population of Hispanic clients. Recent statistics have indicated that South Carolina has the fastest growing Latino population in the nation. Latinos re present 2% of South Carolina's population and they represent 2% of t hose living with HIV/AIDS in South Carolina. However, Latinos represent 5% of new HIV infec tions in South Carolina therefore, despite the relatively small proportion, this increasing tre nd cannot be ignored. Currently available translators may not all have sufficient medical background to convey complex information about HIV care. \"We have Hispanics that come into care and because of the language barrier we don't have an interpreter or ability to support their understanding of what's going on with them and they wind up moving out of care, going maybe somewhere new and we don't have information on that.\" 23 \"We have quite a few Hispanic clients and I wonder when I'm speaking if that translator is telling that person what I'm saying. I don't know if they're not understanding because that translator is just basically repeating what I'm saying and not really having the medical background to back that up. To me that seems like the language barrier and that's why they're not understanding.\" There are insufficient financial and or ganizational resources to address the mental health needs of PLWHA, which impact access to and complian ce with many types of services. As mentioned above, the State mental health system is ove r-burdened and under-funded and only provides care to people with severe and persistent mental illness. For clients who suffer from varying levels of depression (that prevent them from accessing care a nd remaining in care), Ryan White providers must identify other funding sources to pr ovide adequate mental health services. \"I know a provider who reached out to the mental health agency and what she's gotten back is that they do not have the time, do not have the energy, don't have the staff, and don't have the personnel. They can barely do what they need to do let alone talk about HIV.\" \"There is a lack of mental health repres entation in the HIV care system. We've got people who are doing mental health services, but when it comes to the South Carolina Department of Mental Health, there is not a person who is the HIV person or who can come and represent that agency.\" Real and perceived stigma about HIV, sexual orientation, me ntal health, and substance abuse impacts the availability and accessib ility of services as well as cl ients' willingness to access care. \"Social conservatism is more pronounced in the S outh compared to the rest of the nation. Shame and fear of stigmatizing reactions on the part of others may lead to reluctance to seek testing and treatment for HIV or other STDs. Men who have sex with men (MSM) may be less likely to be open about their sexual behaviors in such co mmunities and may concurrently be sexually involved with women, who in turn may be unaware of the risk posed to them by their partners' MSM behaviors. Anecdotal evidence across the South indicates that the prominence of the church, with its sexual prohibi tion, intensifies fear of stigma . (Southern AIDS Manifesto: Updated 2008)\" The informants for this report indicat ed that stigma is the number one barrier to accessing anything to do with HIV. \"Stigma is just huge about not wanting to come to an AIDS clinic where it says 'HIV Clinic' or is perceived as the HIV clinic.\" \"There's still this undercurrent of ho mophobia among providers; there's still an undercurrent, or at least a perceived undercurrent.\" Opportunities for peer involvement to serve as adjunct service providers have been limited by the shift toward medical case management. In a ddition, peers may not always be appropriately matched to opportunities to be involved and their role may not always be valued by all providers 24 within their care system. Lack of adequate Ry an White funding prevents service providers from being able to provide quality, e ffective peer-based services. \"Peer educators are still underutilized and under funded. And the move to medical case management put new standards on anything that was kind of in a case management category, which peers could somewhat have done.\" Incarceration can cause a disruption in care for PLWHA who do not disclose their HIV status and, upon release from prison or jail, clients ma y not prioritize accessing care relative to their other needs or interests. S outh Carolina has a discharge pl anning process for those who are coming out of the state correctional system but th e local jail system is fractionated with not one clear policy on treatment and li nkage to care for PLWHA. \"Folks who get arrested while they'r e in care can have an interruption in services. For some folks, they'll go in there and say, 'you know, I'm HIV+, and I'm in care'. But a lot of folks will no t say anything, and so there's disruption in care.\" \"For folks in incarceration is there a system in terms of linkage to prepare someone who has all those other things that you have to worry about? Are you really going to go into medical ca re after release from prison?\" State and local care systems are rendered less than effective by the shifting demographic and influx of Spanish speaking HIV infected clie nts. The language barrier in a state that has not previously experienced non-English sp eaking clients has presented new hurdles. Mental health continues to be a concern as infection in psychiatric consumers continues to rise. The HIV rates among persons with serious mental illness are much higher than the estimated .6% prevalence in the genera l U.S. population (Meed & Weiss, 2007). The overburdened systems in South Carolina are no exceptions. The institutionalized issues of real and perceived stigma associated with HIV infection continues to be a tremendous barrier to getting and keeping individuals in care. Incongruent opportunities for peer involvement have excluded thos e individuals that are most lik ely to be effective treatment adherence coaches. Finally, the corrections sy stems include a myriad of correlations to the interruption of treatment. 3. Federal-Level Barriers Federal emphasis on primary care has limited the state and local system's capacity to provide support services such as housing and transportation that are ofte n prerequisite to addressing clients' medical care needs. S outh Carolina is bound by the Ryan White legislation to spend at least 75% of Ryan White funds on HRSA's core services. While South Carolina Ryan White providers have always focused on the core servi ces - even before it was legislatively mandated, this focus has come at the expense of important support services. 25 \"Administrative barriers come from wa y above the care providers and one of those issues is the move away from s upported services towards primary care services. Of course this is a good thing but it does cut down a lot of these things that are on our list of barriers, such as housing, transportation, and all these huge barriers. HRSA is actually tellin g us, 'forget about those, concentrate on primary care.' Well, how do we do that when we don't address the support needs? Administrative requirements from federal funders relate d to quality improvement and accountability has placed an increasing administra tive burden on the care system, which takes time and resources away from addressing client needs. For example, the lack of data infrastructure and personnel dedicated to managi ng agency data often results in front line staff (case managers and case manager supervisor s) becoming over-burdened, stretched and burned out because they are fulfilling bot h roles. South Carolina has a very streamlined and efficient approach to data collection and reporting but it still require s the dedication of significant personnel resources to manage an agency's quality ini tiative and ensure comp liance with all of the federal requirements. \"There's more and more focus on data collection, quality improvement, and getting things to where they're supposed to be that the time spent on actual case management and talking to the patient is diminished. So how the heck are we supposed to do all this extra stuff with le ss time and less people and less money! It just seems like you're in a rat race, like a hamster going around in a wheel.\" National funding and research priorities are not aligned with the growing epidemic in the Southeast region of the United States. As cite d in the Southern AIDS Manifesto: Update 2008, \"rising infection rates coupled with inadequate funding, resour ces, and infrastructures have resulted in a disparate and catas trophic situation in our public h ealth care systems in the South. Characterized by pervasive poverty, lack of adequa te services and infras tructures, unemployment and uninsured individuals, the South is faced wi th a crisis of having to provide medical and support care for increasing numb ers of infected individuals without adequate funding.\" \"The money is not following the disease. The epi map of the United States shows that the disease is concentrated in the South, but the funding has not followed that as of yet. So our ability to provide all these services - transportation, housing and on and on - is tied to that funding.\" \"There's a federal project finding out why people are not in care. There are five states participating. They're all northeast ! But people in the Northeast and their barriers are not the same as the barriers in the South. If th e majority of the epidemic is in the South and they're findi ng out the barriers in the North, then there's nothing in the data that's going be relevant to help me do my job. So right away, you see just how the direction of the federal funding and thought pattern and attitudes are focused.\" 26 \"Flat based funding coupled with CDC rescission for multiple years has resulted in all programs across the country being forced to make choice s between needed servi ce. While the funding levels for many southern states has increased and some may argue that is a bit more equitable in terms of distribution, the fact remains that the ov erall funding for every st ate is inadequate. The impact of these shortages results in higher ca ses of HIV and STD and less access to care and treatment. (Southern AIDS Manifesto: Updated 2008)\" Barriers for PLWHA Not in Care The following barriers and gaps were identified as being common across services for PLWHA not in care. Two categories of barriers are descri bed. They are not listed in any priority order. 1. Client-related barriers include characteristics of client s that impeded access to care 2. State and local care system barriers describe system characteristic s that impeded access 1. Client-Related Barriers Clients who have previously been in care and dropped out may find the administrative process to re-enter the care system to be burdensome or confusing. As with many health care programs, there are multiple documentation requirements for clients to access Ryan White care and services. Providers must ha ve enough personnel resources to be able to assist clients in navigating the paperwork requirements. \"Just dealing with differen t processes of coming back in to care can be hard. If you've been out of care you still have to go through case management and do the forms and stuff and it's like the beginning all over again, so th at part can be a problem.\" \"I've got ten ADAP applications permanently on my desk waiting for that income statement that the client has to get to me. They know where to go and get what they need. But they don't want to turn it in because if their income has changed, they don't want to lose their benefits. And sometimes it may be an unfounded fear. Maybe they actually ar e eligible for more benefits than they think, but any change is very stressful. Another reason is that Social Security Admini stration is the most difficult federal agency to de al with that there is, even worse than the IRS. You have to go down there, take a number and wait in line all day.\" Feeling of personal failure may make it difficult for some clients who have dropped out of care to re-enter the care system \"Sometimes patients may identifying with their case manager or the staff and then when they miss an appointment, they feel like they're letting the clinic staff down or their provider down, so they stay out and say, 'no, I'll go next time', and next time turns into one month, three months, and then they're just out of care. That's something that occurred in our clinic. It's not an excuse but it's just they put it on 27 themselves and just stay out.\" Clients' fear of their diagnosis and denial about their HIV status may prevent them from accessing care. \"When someone tests initially and they don't come back for their results that's another reason why people are not in care , because they don't really know their status. So the barrier is a fear of knowing, basically, if they have HIV or AIDS.\" Asymptomatic clients may not feel compelled to seek se rvices, especially in light of the shift toward thinking of HIV as a long-term chronic illness. \"Although there is an attitude of fatalism because there is no cure, we think also that because HIV is becoming more of a chronic disease and more manageable and treatable, that the opposite of that may be occurring now; that there's more complacency. Clients think, I don't n eed them right now, I don't feel bad, and they'll be there when I do need them, so I'm not going worry about getting into care at this point.\" \"In this country as a whole, as far as healthcare is concerned, prevention's just not a priority. People should know that they shouldn't eat x, y and z because they're going to get heavy and get heart disease and diabetes. Prevention in the HIV community is the same th ing. People think, I feel fin e now, I'll just wait until later, until I get sick, and then they can take care of me and fix me up.\" Fear of domestic violence may prevent clients from accessing care because they do not want to disclose their status to their partner. \"Fear of violence and domestic violence can be an issue. For a lot of folks we need to find out if there are any situations that could cause them to avoid coming into care for fear of a domestic violence situation.\" Clients may not access care because they believe religion or other \"therapies\" will heal them. A lot of people will say that, \"God will heal me; God will take care of me.\" Clients may find the medical system is overwhelming and drop out of care. \"The fear of the medical community and the pr ocess in general, just that it is an unknown. If you haven't been in medical care, this whole system that you're entering into is unknown, and you're not co mfortable with that, so you're less likely to go.\" Other issues identified in the 2006 SCSN that particip ants felt were still salient include: Substance abuse and mental health problems 28 Competing priorities, po verty, and homelessness Depression with feelings of helplessness and hopelessness Attitude of fatalism because there is no cure Fear of breaches in confidentiality Fear of losing kids or being deported for undocumented individuals Client not understand ing the difference between HIV, AIDS, and disease management Clients not knowing wh ere to go for help Language barriers and health illiteracy As illustrated above, there are a broad variety of reasons an individual may not be in care ranging from paperwork to denial to domestic violence. For every individual not in care there is an unique barrier or set of barriers, real or perceived, keeping th em from accessing care. The Ryan White care system in South Carolina must be fl exible and creative enough to address these needs in order to ensure optimal health for all PLWHA and the public health of the state. 2. State and Local Care-System Barriers Clients may not feel comfortable engaging with a care system that appears to be different from their own culture, race, ethnicity, sexual orie ntation, and/or language. South Carolina HIV providers must continue to recrui t, hire, train and retain cultura lly competent staff in order to provide optimal and relevant services to those in the care system. \"We may lose people just because the providers may not mirror the population. Our example was a white person goes into the clinic and everybody in there is black and they think, 'oh, gosh, I don't fe el welcome here,' and they don't come back. Or the opposite, because you may be a woman, and you go in, they're all male. Or a male goes in and you have a lot of women there.\" \"Whenever I go for services, as a consum er, whether I'm going to an agency that does case management or I'm going to the doctor, I rarely see any materials out in Spanish. There's a really great suppl ement for newly diagnosed people that POS released in English and Spanish, and I read the thing, and I thought, 'God, this is good. I wish somebody had given me this when I was first diagnosed ten years ago'.\" Stigma about HIV among providers and community at large can discourage clients from accessing care. Again, stigma is the backdrop behi nd all of the issues of access to and retention in care and must be addressed both indi vidually and on local and statewide levels. \"With the MSM upward trend in infections it could be that people feel there's an underlying homophobia in the community wi th providers that may be keeping some people out of care.\" 29 \"In all our clinics we find people that don' t come to our speci fic clinics because they know somebody who works there or they know somebody who's a patient there and they want to be anonymous about being positive.\" \"Stigma is still the number one barrier to accessing anything to do with HIV.\" Other issues identified in the 2006 SCSN that particip ants felt were still salient include: Lack of transporta tion to services Bad first experience with the care system during post-test counse ling or DIS contact Poor linkages between receiving a positive test and referral for services Poor linkages between jail discharg e and the HIV care service system Long waiting times for appointments or in waiting room Experiences of being treated with disres pect by providers or other agency staff Side effect of medications Potential Solutions As a pre-cursor to the comprehensive plan, the fo llowing is a list of s uggestions from meeting participants for solutions to the barriers descri bed earlier as well as obs ervations about how some issues have improved. These comments are included here as direct quotes to provide initial ideas for subsequent development of the Comprehensive Plan. Address language barriers \"Maybe they need to have some sort of training for our interpreters that do something about HIV so they can re ally get the medical background and understand the gist of what we're trying to get across.\" \"PSA is an interpreter qua lification program through D SS. It's three-parts; you have to take a qualificati on test, two-day class an d then a final test.\" \"We don't speak Spanish, and so one of the th ings that we try to do is to have them go to Spanish classes for staff to try to train staff in Spanish.\" Use peer educators \"Client empowerment is important. If the consumer is educated and empowered to take charge of their own healthcare, then they will ask questions of the physician while they're there and not de pend on the doctor to read their mind and know what's going on with them. That's th e perfect thing for a peer educator to do.\" 30 Provide mental health services \"I have seen in the past three years mo re and more providers coming up with solutions to mental health and not rely ing on the state infrastructure and the Department of Mental Health infrastructu re. And so I think there have been some success stories in some regions in the state, where they have either done what you're talking about, sharing the provider, or a part-time provider or someone on staff, et cetera.\" \"We as a group have to come up with some sort of way to organize ourselves to deal with those mental he alth issues. We have to pool our resources together and contract with a mental health specialis t so she's somewhere for two days and then she's somewhere else for another two days.\" Ensure linkage to care \"The linkage between general discharge (from prison) and the HIV care service system has been improving and we would like to acknowledge that's one area on this list that we felt like its getting better.\" \"I will say that also we've made some st rides in this area (getting people from testing to care) with some specially funded projects th at are just for linkage-to- care. So we're making gains in that area too. \" Reduce turfism \"Turfism has improved from 2006 to now. We don't have quite as much turfism in this state, and one reflection of that wa s the ADAP task force that helped to get more money to end our waitlist from our state government. And another thing is the care and support work through th e HIV planning council and working on a case manager best practices sort of thing so that one case manager will be able to benefit from something t hat another has learned.\" Increase public awareness \"All of us as a state need to do some thing about HIV like some of the bigger states do, like California or New York or whatever. Like get together and have a state AIDS day where everyone can partic ipate all in one da y and just get the message out there. Because some of the bigger cities have that, but like in smaller areas where I am, there is nothing like that being done whatsoever. I mean, on World AIDS Day we do try to do stuff but it's not really being done on a really large-scale, community type of effort where it's on TV, wh ere it's on the radio, where it's in the newspaper, where it's in places where people who are at-risk go. Because they're not going to read the ne wspaper and they're not going to listen to NPR or whatever. We need to get into th e community especially in those smaller areas like where I am.\" 31 Improve cultural competence \"We need more cultural sensitivity traini ngs, especially if HRSA directs us to focus more on African American MSM.\" Broaden clinicians' frame of reference \"And that's what we have to do is educat e our doctors as well, to be social workers, case managers, to an extent, fo r the time period that they've got (with their client\" The potential solutions articulated by the stake holders are the foundation for the development of the Comprehensive Plan. While some of the ne eds and associated solutions do not fit neatly within one particular issue area, improvements in these cross-cutting issues (transportation, language and cultural barriers, linkage to care) wi ll make substantial contributions in refining the current care system for the better. Consumer Town Hall Forum The Consumer Town Hall Forum was held on October 15, 2008, from 6:30-9:00 pm at the Radisson Columbia Hotel and Conference Center . Forum participants were recruited by members of the South Carolina HIV Planning Council through word of mouth, scholarship applications to attend the South Carolina HIV/ STD Conference, and a Promotional Flyer. In order to be eligible to partic ipate in the Forum discussion, indi viduals were required to be HIV positive and reside or be a student in South Carolina. The demographics of the Town Hall Forum participants differ in some ways from the overall population being served through the Ryan White care system. The participants had higher levels of education and were more likely to be stable housed and work full time than the general Ryan White population in South Carolina. The differen ce in backgrounds and experiences is the likely explanation for the difference in input. The pa rticipants in the Town Hall Forum were more focused on quality of care issues than access to care. The foll owing graphics illustrate the backgrounds of the participants.

Reported Job Situation of Participants (n=50) 0 5 10 15 20Full-timePart-timeUnemployedDisabilityVolunteerStudentOtherJob Situation Number of Participants During the Town Hall forum, three questions speci fic to HIV care and treatment were posed to the participants. Following are the questions and a summary of the discussion that resulted. 1. What HIV care services are most important to you? Consumers identified medical care, medications, \"other\" non-HIV specific medications and care, and health insurance as their most importa nt HIV care services. Throughout the Forum discussion, consumers indicated the value of each of these services while also expressing difficulties in obtaining them in various ci rcumstances. Of the \"other\" non-HIV specific medication and care, mental health care wa s stressed as an area of great need. Main Points Participant Comments Medical care Medical care...I want to live. Medications A lot of us are taking medications other than our HIV antiretrovirals...and a lot of us are aging...so there's all these other medicines that ha ve nothing to do with HIV. They're new...I don't think enough has been done to see what the long term effect s of HIV drugs are and the interactions with these other drugs. Other related care services (e.g. diabetes care and medications; mental health care and medications; eye care; oral health care) I have a problem with depression, and I'm sure a lot of us here do...ADAP doesn't cover those drugs. If I have no insurance, you are where you are and you can't work anymore and it's just hard... Oral care...your teeth will kill you 37 Eye care...I have the onset of diabetes and I have to get my eyes examined, not just as a regular reading but they have to examine it to see if I'm losing vision. Health insurance Right now I'm trying to hold onto COBRA that I can't really afford and I can't fin d anybody to pick up the premiums for me...for halfway decent care, I have to have some type of private insur ance. If I don't, I have the trouble of being a number on a waiting list. 2. What, if any, problems have you encount ered in seeking HIV-related care services? Consumers spent a great deal of time discussi ng problems they had encountered seeking HIV- related care services in South Carolina. In pa rticular, consumers discu ssed challenges with their care providers, including being treated or seen by their provider only as a person with HIV, not being treated by the same providers , not trusting their providers, and/or not feeling that their providers were fully knowledgeable about, or forthcoming with th em, regarding the side effects of HIV medications. Additionally, consumers expre ssed frustration with the lack of coverage for \"other\" medications, access limitations for person s living in rural areas, children aging out of care, and long term community care. Main Points Participant Comments Treated only as HIV+ individual and not as whole person A lot of times, I have found mental health professionals or mental health doctors look at... a person with HIV, the first thing that comes to their mi nd is that, \"oh you're just depressed because you have HIV\"... are they trying to treat the person or trying to treat the person 'cause they have HIV? It (examination) seems like it should be more personal, more questions beyond HIV questions Lack of continuity in care, lack of time with provider and limited relationship with provider Every time I went for mental health, I saw a different doctor and how could I build a relationship and become comfortable seeing a differen t person every time? And how would they know me? So I got tired of going... Session is only 15 minutes long, they tell me to come back in 5 or 6 months...doesn't do any good. Concerns about credibility of provider; lack of trust with provider; and lack of accurate non-HIV-related diagnoses by providers I appreciate my doctors...but there are times when I do question their credibility...they 're not reaching the right diagnosis...are they able to do referrals if they're not sure? Drug companies help us out, but docs pay more attention to them than us. If they paid more attention to us rather 38 than the drug companies...That's where their money is coming from. First time I tried to go for disability, each doctor kept on saying, \"I don't see anything wrong with you...\" and just recently, I was let go from my job...because I couldn't complete my work. They diagnosed me as depressed for years and come to find out I was bipolar. They (doctors) were confused... I get treated at the VA and every time I go down there, they give me a different medication for depression. Providers not being knowledgeable or forthcoming about all of the side effects of HIV medications They don't go in depth to see... what they're doing to the organs in the rest of our body...if you're on the medications too long, they take you off. Why fix something that's not broken? ...They don't tell you about the side effects you're going to go through. Lack of coverage for \"other\" medications I was first diagnosed and I was on AZT. Not a month after that I was diagnosed and hospitalized because of diabetes. They said it was an on-set from the medication because it messed up my pancreas. In New York, ADAP covered that. What about on-set illnesses? ADAP says we only cover medication for the HIV antiretrovirals. I don't understand that! Lack of access to medical service alternatives (e.g. health care providers) What can you do when you're in a community with only one center for you? One infec tious disease doctor - what are you going to do if you can't change? Now you have to get transportation to another county to go get a doctor. Who is going to pay for it? In rural areas, they don't have good docs like some of us do. Children aging out of care services I have an 18 year old that's pre-natal infe cted and he's about to turn 19. He's going to exit out of Title 4 and Title 2 services and with budget cuts, my son is going to lose a lot of benefits. Where's that going to leave me? Long-term community care When I went to sign up for long-term community care, they wanted me to sign over my ri ghts to everything I own in the case of my death. Why should I have to sign over everything to receive their serv ice? I don't think that's right. 39 3. What would be the single most important change you would suggest in improving HIV care services in South Carolina? In order to improve HIV care services in Sout h Carolina, consumers recommended that persons living with HIV, especially in rural areas, have access to the same services as those living in larger cities in the state. In addition, consumers strongly r ecommended that education/training opportunities regarding HIV meds, how to talk to doctors/health care providers, and how to be \"educated consumers\" when it comes to their over all health care be prov ided to persons living with HIV. Consumers also recommended that e ducational materials that physicians/health care providers use, regarding HIV di sease and HIV medications, not in clude a lot of medical jargon and take into consideration the lower reading/literacy levels of some consumers. Similarly, consumers recommended that providers be tr ained in how to communicate with their HIV positive patients using less medical jargon, how to be better listeners, and how to \"meet consumers where they are.\" Main Points Participant Comments Availability of/Access to services In my agency, x-ray services are not available in our building for our consumers. Education for PLW HIV to become better health consumers/advocates for one another Education, and we want to be educated. I didn't have to start taking meds until 16 years into my diagnosis and it floored me. I was not ready and I didn't even know I could say no...I wasn't informed, I was out there speaking all over the place, but there was still a level of information I didn't know about HIV care and I didn't know I had a right to say I'm not ready to do this right now. They scare us so bad... Complain, but also do... If you know someone doesn' t have a good doc, try to help them get somewhere else. I decided I wasn't going to let somebody tell me what meds I was going to take. He said this is what you're going to take and this is what you're going to do. No, no, no...I'm a customer, remember, I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do. As a consumer, that's what we must do ...work in a partnership. We are ultimately responsible for self and I challenge you that if you stay informed and you doctor's know you're informed, you'll get better re sults. It's ok to change doctors... 40 We let our condition make us feel weak. We were bold before, be bold now. Nobody will take care of you better than you. About 40% of my clients haven't finished high school. The age range is between 22 and 35...The system has failed that generation, not everybody has the intellectual background to be knowledgeable and even if they had the resources they may not know how to express themselves. Medical-based materials produced in layman's terms; use lay terms with clients If we can somehow explain in laymen form to doctors that all these medical terms and th ese medical brochures that doesn't really say what I want it to say...I can't breathe and there's something in there I got to blow out. Together, we can get us and doctors to move to another level. Education for health care providers (including ER doctors) so they can do a better job of \"meeting clients where they are\" and listen to their clients Physicians don't recognize wh ere people are coming from. SC has one of the highest rates of illiteracy in this country and they give pamphlet and say th is is going to explain everything you need to know. It 's not an easy thing to say you have a reading disability, and they'll just take it and say thank you. Same with givi ng websites, wh en you live 20 miles out of town and serviced by some rural telephone company you may not even have internet service and where are you going to get a co mputer when you're living on $637 per month? You need to reach them where they are. You won't do that if yo u don't meet them where they are. How do they think we feel as people that are sick and asking them to help us and they're not listening to nothing that's going on with us? We as consumers need to ha ve a session with our docs to allow us to sit down and talk to these docs and let them know what's going on. If we can do it as a group. We need to be heard. Overall, the input received was very valuable an d the recommendations that resulted from the Town Hall Forum are, in part, incorp orated into the Comprehensive Plan. 41 SECTION II: Where Do We Need to Go : What is Our Vision of An Ideal System? Shared Values and Vision for System Changes Throughout the stakeholder meetings that were held in preparation for the development of this document, common themes and ideas around the id eal care system consistently emerged. The following concepts represent the shared values of the South Carolina Ryan White care system stakeholders: Comprehensive continuum of care Accessible, appropriate, cons istent and affordable care Collaborative work among service providers Services rendered without fear or stigmatization Privacy and confidentiality Ownership and self determination Dignity and respect Continuous improvement Using all of the above concepts as a backdrop, based on local HI V epidemiological trends and considerations of the most vulne rable populations in our state, th e shared vision for an HIV care system is to establish and maintain a system of HIV care that provide s broad access to quality HIV services including mechanisms that retain pe ople in care. To this end, there are three broad, long-term goals in three primary issue areas. Th e goals and issue areas, which will guide priority setting, are as follows: 1) Access to Medical Care Issue Statement: The Health Resources and Se rvices Administration requires providers to addresses the health needs of pers ons living with HIV disease, in part, by providing services that enhance access to care . Goal: Improve the ability of PLWHA to access health care in South Carolina. 2) Quality of Medical Care Issue Statement: The Health Resources and Services Administration is committed to improving the quality of care and services and ultimately the quality of life for people living with HIV and AIDS. This commitment is made evident by the requirement of a Quality Management Program in each state. Goal: Ensure quality of health care services provided for Ryan White patients in South Carolina. 42 3) Retention in Care Issue Statement: The Health Resources and Se rvices Administration requires providers to addresses the health needs of persons living w ith HIV disease, in part, by providing support services that enhance retention in care . Goal: Improve client retention in HI V medical care and support services. It is important to state that these goals and th e resulting program initiatives are contingent on the continuation of dedicated federal, State and loca l resources that are commensurate with the level of need across the state. If drastic changes in resources occur, extremely difficult choices will need to be made to the overall plan, goals an d objectives, resulting in program reductions and service disruption. The following principles guide the development and implementation of program models to achieve the above goals: The care and service continuum must be acces sible to individuals and families in urban and rural areas regardless of their ability to pay. Funding mechanisms should be creative and focus particularly on the needs of poor communities. Methods for routine assessment of the outcome of care and services must be in place for all HIV service providers. C ontinuous quality improvement facilitates measurement of service outcomes, while fostering on -going self-assessment and improvement. Policy and program design must reflect input from a broad range of people affected by HIV/AIDS, including persons living with HIV and health and human service providers engaged in direct care. Communities of color must be central to this collaboration, given the disproportionate impact of HIV on persons of color in South Carolina. Peer education and support is a key component of servi ce delivery and leadership development. Confidentiality protections must be in pl ace, providing the basis for assuring personal privacy and anti-discrimination safeguards. 43 SECTION III: How Will We Get There: How Does Our System Need to Change to Assure Availability of and Accessibility to Core Services? Comprehensive Plan With limited resources available for services for PLWHA in South Carolina, a comprehensive plan (including goals, objectives and activities) has been de veloped that focuses on three essential issues related to HIV care and treatm ent: 1) access to medical care, 2) quality of medical care, and 3) retention in medical care. The goals, objectives, and activities for each issue area are outlined below. 1. Access to Medical Care Issue Statement : The Health Resources and Services Administration requires providers to addresses the health needs of pers ons living with HIV disease, in part, by providing services that enhance access to care . Goal: Improve the ability of PLWHA to access health care in South Carolina. Objectives Activities a. Decrease the proportion of PLWHA who are not in care by 2% annually through January 2012 Collect intake data about w hy clients dropped out of care in the past and are now coming back into care, and use this information to develop individualized agency plans to proactively address barriers to care. Collaborate with other Ryan Wh ite Parts in each region to identify clients who have dropped out of care and work together to get them back into care. Increase cooperation between medical case managers and disease intervention specialists (e .g., establish MOA) to identify clients who have dropped out of care and get them back into care. Use Peer Health Navigators to provide transportation, education and outreach to clients. Educate private pr actitioners about HIV and the Ryan White care system. Incorporate outreach into a ll job duties (home visits, telephone calls, testing, medi cal case management, etc.) Increase marketing materials for Ryan White care system. Train/empower consumers to be \"educated consumers\" regarding their own health car e, navigating the health care system and in how to communicate with providers. b. Increase the number of Ryan White case managers trained Develop and implement a formal Ryan White Medical Case Management Certification program in South Carolina. Offer training to all Ryan White Parts so medical case 44 through the Ryan White case management training system by 2% annually through January 2012. managers can benefit from learni ng about other service delivery models. Coordinate peer training opportunities among agencies using seasoned, certified medical case managers as mentors. c. Increase the number of patient mental health visits by 2% annually through January 2012. Utilize private mental health providers for services for PLWHA. Ensure that ADAP continues to carry anti-depressants on the formulary. DHEC should mandate that a ce rtain percentage of funds provided to Part B provider must be spent on mental health services. Develop a standard mental health screening tool for all service providers. d. Increase the number of patient substance abuse treatment visits by 2% annually through January 2012. Develop a standardized substa nce abuse screening tool for use by all service providers. Provide medical case manageme nt training that includes materials on how to conduct a thorough psychosocial assessment. Create a comprehensive defi nition of substance abuse treatment. Develop better mechanisms to couple mental health and substance abuse counseling services. Establish contracts between service providers and community agencies that can pr ovide substance abuse treatment services. Establish support groups for HIV infected substance abusers. Develop peer outreach progr ams for PLWHA substance users. e. Increase the proportion of clients who are stably housed by 2% annually through January 2012. Increase the number of budge ting and financial workshops for clients. Ensure clients enrolled in housing case management have solid service plans with specific objectives on budgeting and financial management. Develop relationships with local housing experts (providers, landlords, developers ) to increase availability / stability of housing for PLWHA. 45 2. Quality of Medical Care Issue Statement : The Health Resources and Services Administration is committed to improving the quality of care and services and ultimately the quality of life for people living with HIV and AIDS. This commitment is made evident by the requirement of a Quality Management Program in each state. Goal: Ensure the quality of health care services provided for Ryan White clients in South Carolina. Objectives Activities a. Achieve 100% participation in the South Carolina Ryan White Quality Management program by January 2010. Identify the benefits to provi ders of participation in the QM program and \"market\" the pr ogram to providers in these terms so it is not viewed only as an administrative expectation/ requirement. Encourage and foster participation on the statewide Quality Management Steering Committee from agencies that in the past have not submitted data. Provide on-going training in QM indicators for all providers. b. Increase the number of patients with at least two medical visits per year, one visit in each six month period of the year, by 2% annually through January 2012. Proactively contact clients to remind them of appointments, ensure providers are conducting client follow-up afterwards, and if client is a no-show, then call and/or send letter within three days to reschedule appointment. Increase emphasis on client treatment adherence by decreasing medical case manage ment case loads; case loads may be reduced by allocating sufficient resources to MCM and considering alternative f unding sources like HOPWA. Generate buy in from execu tive directors at provider agencies about the critical need for medical case management. Provide AETC training for pr oviders on PHS guidelines. Develop basic educational materials about primary care, policies, and procedures for all Ryan White clients. Train/empower consumers to be \"educated consumers\" regarding their own health car e, navigating the health care system and in how to communicate with providers. Train providers in how to better meet the needs of consumers, by listening to and effectively communicating (using less medical jargon) with consumers. c. Increase the proportion of female patients who receive PAP smears by Integrate women's health care services into regular HIV clinic visits, educate clients on the need and importance of PAP, prepare women mentally for PAP, implement flow sheet 46 2% annually through July 2012. tracking, ensure adequate time is scheduled for PAP to be conducted during medical visit, and implement an appointment reminder mechanism (e.g., letters, calls). Schedule PAP clinic and ID clinic appointments on same day. Contract with provider to provide PAP smears. Ensure transportation assistance is available for clients Collaborate with the Best Chance Network. Include PHS guidelines for care as part of provider contract Obtain medical record if client has PAP with another provider. Have female providers available to treat women. Ensure that PAP smears are entered into the database. d. Increase the proportion of patients who receive a CD4 test every six months by 2% annually through July 2012. Ensure case managers assess CD4 test (and all other PHS guidelines) at midyear review with clients and follow up with providers if CD4 test and other needed labs are not being done. Include PHS guidelines for pr ovision of care as part of provider contract Make sure that CD4 test and viral load are included as basic part of monitoring c lients with HIV infection. Ensure labs can be performe d on site and during medical visit. e. Increase the proportion of patients seen by an oral health provider annually by 2% annually through July 2012. Collaborate with community dent al and oral health clinics to facilitate client access to oral health treatment and prevention services. Ensure that medical providers and case managers prioritize the assessment of client dental needs and stress the importance of oral health preventive care to avoid costly intensive dental services that strain limited budgets. 47 3. Retention in Medical Care Issue Statement : The Health Resources and Services Administration requires providers to addresses the health needs of persons living w ith HIV disease, in part, by providing support services that enhance retention in care . Goal: Improve client retention in HIV me dical care and support services. Objectives Activities a. Ensure 75% retention in care rate for Ryan White providers in South Carolina annually through January 2012. Develop a peer-based buddy sy stem and match clients at risk for dropping out of care with a supportive buddy. Address client needs for subs tance abuse services, mental health care, and other related i ssues that can improve retention in care. Provide intensive medical case management with new clients. Emphasize that case mangers can assist clients staying in care. Educate clients on range of available core and support services. Consider providing one location with bundled services (i.e., one stop shopping) to combine ID visits, PAP clinic, mental health visits, etc. Ensure transportation assistan ce is available for clients. Contact all clients on caseload monthly to maintain connection. Offer sensitivity/customer serv ice training for providers / staff Reduce turnover in case manage rs and cross-train staff. b. Increase the number of visits for medical case management by 2% annually through January 2012. Schedule medical case management visits to coincide with medical clinic visits so a sepa rate appointment is not need. Encourage active communication between providers and medical case managers. Ensure transportation assistan ce is available for clients. Increase outreach, targeting clients dropped out of care. Contact all clients on caseload monthly to maintain connection. c. Increase the proportion of patients on ARV therapy that receive treatment adherence counseling by 2% annually through Develop and implement the use of a tool providers can use to assess client readiness for medication treatment adherence. Assess and address barriers to case managers providing treatment adherence counseling (e.g., knowledge of ARV drugs, dosing, side effects, and drug inte ractions; and time required to 48 January 2012. provide education comple te applications, and conduct patient assessment). Train case managers on medi cations, side effects, and issues related to treatment adherence. Educate clients about importanc e of treatment adherence. Hire staff positions dedicated to adherence counseling. d. Increase the proportion of clients with a complete annual psychosocial assessment by 2% annually through January 2012. Train case mangers to conduct a comprehensive psychosocial assessment with clients. Prescreen charts the day before client visit to see if a psychosocial assessment is needed Ensure case managers remind clients in advance (via phone or letter) of the need to c onduct their annual psychosocial reassessment. Reduce the duration of reassessment process by establishing \"no changes to re port\" area on certain parts of form. e. Increase the number of clients with a service plan that has been updated in the past six months by 2% annually through January 2012 Develop a system for monitoring when service plan reviews are completed, run reports to determine which clients need to update their service pla n, and discuss these cases with case managers during supervision meetings. Continue to train MCMs ar ound the approach to using service plans. Encourage client participati on and buy-in in developing service plans. Cross-Cutting Issues/Summary During the course of developing this plan, PLWHA, providers, and other stakeholders emphasized the need to address ce rtain cross-cutting issues that do not neatly fit within only one of the above three issue areas. Fo r example, language and cultural ba rriers, lack of transportation, and stigma associated with HIV infection and HI V-related risk behaviors must be addressed to achieve the above stated goals related to access, quality, and retention in medical care. Improvements in these cross-cutting areas will make substantial contributions to achieving all of the goals and objectives outlined in this compre hensive plan. HRSA's emphasis on core services, however, does not easily permit use of funds to address these issues as they are somewhat tangential to the direct provisi on of medical services. It ca n be challenging to articulate measurable objectives for these issues and data are often not readily avai lable to quantitatively monitor improvements in cultural competenc y, transportation access, or community-wide dimensions of stigma. Nonetheless, South Caroli na is committed to addressing these issues as best as possible and encourages collaboration among care system st akeholders to address these issues in service to achieving the goals of this comprehensive plan. 49 SECTION IV: How Will We Monitor Our Progress? Using Data For Evaluation Monitoring progress in meeting the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan is the key to ensuring access to care, quality of care a nd retention in care within the Ryan White HIV care system in South Carolina. All of South Carolina's Ryan White providers currently collect and submit program data to HRSA in the form of a Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Data Report (RDR). The RDR is an annual report that captures information regardin g the services provided by all Ryan White funded entities. The RDR is divided into sections including: service provid er information; client information; service information; HIV counse ling and testing; and medical information. Providers report on all clients who received services eligible for Ry an White Parts A, B, C or D funding regardless of the actual funding source us ed to pay for those services. The South Carolina Ryan White Part B contractors comple te the RDR forms and submit them to DHEC. DHEC assembles all of the reports and submits th e data to HRSA. The Ryan White Parts C and D submit their data directly to HRSA. Beginning in 2009 all Ryan White providers will be required to submit Clie nt Level Data (CLD) to HRSA in the form of a Ry an White HIV/AIDS Program Serv ices Report (RSR). The RSR includes three components: the Grantee Report, the Service Provider Report and the Client Report. It is the Client Report, or CLD, th at requires service providers to submit one de- identified record for each Ryan White client se rved. Each record will include information on demographic status, HIV clinical information, HI V-care medical and support services received at the service provider and the client s' unique encrypted identifier. At the same time that Ryan White providers in South Carolina submit their CLD to HRSA, they will submit a similar client level dataset to DHEC as a part of the Quality Management program. Access to all of the data and one hundred percen t participation in the data submission process will allow DHEC to monitor the progress made in achieving the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan. DHEC is in the process of developing a secure portal for data submission and a database for analyzing the data once it is submitted. Description of South Carolina' s Quality Management Program Central to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control's mission, values, and strategic plan is the goal to impr ove access to high quality healthcare. The purpose of the quality management program is to set fo rth a coordinated approach to quality assessment and process improvement within the SC Depa rtment of Health & Environmental Control (DHEC), STD/HIV Division, and HIV Care & Support Programs. The STD/HIV Division is dedicated to ensuring the highest quality of HIV medical care and support services for people living with HIV/AIDS in the state of Sout h Carolina. The mission of the HIV Quality 50 Management Program is to ensure that all people living with HIV/AIDS in South Carolina receive the highest quality of Ryan White f unded primary medical car e and support services. During FY 2007 DHEC initiated th e statewide Quality Manageme nt Program through technical assistance from the National Quality Center in New York. The technical assistance began in December 2006 and since then DHEC has made great progress in developing and implementing a Quality Management Program for the state of South Carolina. Activities associated with the development of the program include the formation of a Quality Management Steering Committee, the development of a Quality Management Plan that defines the core quality measures for the state, and pa rticipation in the NQC Training of the Trainers program in June 2007 in New Orleans in Sept ember 2007 in Orlando and in May 2008 in New York City. All Ryan White Parts (B, C, D) are participating in the process and are represented on the Statewide Quality Management Steering Committee. We rolled out the Quality Management Program at a December 2007 SC Ryan White All Parts meeting and our initial data collection period began in January 2008. The specific statewide indicators that were selected for monitoring are as follows: 1. Number (Percentage) of patients with at least two (2) visits pe r year, one visit in each six- month period of the year. 2. Number (Percentage) of adolescents > age 13 years & adult clients with HIV/AIDS CD4 <350 or viral load >100,000 th at are prescribed HAART. 3. Number (Percentage) of female patients/ clients with at least one annual Pap test. 4. Number (Percentage) of patients seen (refe rred AND with complete d visit) by an oral health provider annually. 5. Number (Percentage) of patient s with an annual syphilis test. 6. Number (Percentage) of patie nts with a CD4 and viral lo ad test every six months. 7. Number (Percentage) of patient s with CD4< 200 (or age adjust ed for risk as clinically indicated for children) who are prescribed Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) Prophylaxis. 8. Number (Percentage) of pregnant wome n prescribed antiretroviral therapy. 9. Number (Percentage) of patie nts/clients with a complete psychosocial assessment in the past year. 10. Number (Percentage) of clients screen ed for HIV knowledge every six months. 11. Number (Percentage) of client s with a service plan that ha s been updated in the past six months. 12. Number (Percentage) of client s with a service plan that ha s been signed in the past six months. 13. Number (Percentage) of patient s with CD4 < 50 (or age adjust ed for risk as clinically indicated for children) who are prescribed MAC Prophylaxis (rifabut in, clarithromycin, azithromycin or other). 14. Number (Percentage) of client s with HIV infection who have been tested for Hepatitis B virus infection status. 15. Number (Percentage) of clie nts with HIV infection who ha ve completed the vaccination series for Hepatitis B. 51 16. Number (Percentage) of client s with HIV infection who have been tested for Hepatitis C virus infection. 17. Number (Percentage) of clie nts with HIV infection prescr ibed antiretroviral (ARV) who receives adherence counseling during a ppointments 6 months (or less) apart. 18. Number (Percentage) of clie nts with HIV infection prescr ibed antiretroviral (ARV) who receives risk reduction counseling during a ppointments 6 months (or less) apart. Based on the new HRSA Client Le vel Data (CLD) requirements that go into effect in January 2009, we have revised the submission date for Quality Management data to July 2009. The primary Quality Management goal for FY 2009 is to further develop a systematic, state-wide process for planning, desi gning, measuring, asse ssing and improving pe rformance with the following components: 1. Develop a planning mechanism incorporating baseline data from external and internal sources and input from leadership, sta ff and patients. Clinical, operational and programmatic aspects of patient care will be reviewed. 2. Emphasize design needs associated with new and existing services, patient care delivery, work flows and support systems whic h maximize results and satisfaction on the part of the patients and their families, physicians and staff. 3. Evolve and refine measurement systems for identifying trends in care and sentinel events by regularly collecting and recordi ng data and observati ons relating to the provision of patient care across the continuum. 4. Employ assessment procedures to determine efficacy and appropriateness and to judge how well services are delivered and whethe r opportunities for improvement exist. 5. Focus on improving quality in all of its dimensions by implementing multidisciplinary, data driven, project teams and encour aging participatory problem solving. 6. Promote communication , dialogue and informational exchange across the STD/HIV Division and throughout Regional Committees, with regard to findings, analyses, conclusions, recommendations, actions and evaluations pertaining to performance improvement. 7. Strive to establish collaborative relationships with diverse stakeholders and community agencies for collectively promoti ng the general health and welfare of the community served. With the receipt of statewide data during the summer of 2009 we will be able to establish true baseline data for our Ryan White services. Th e second cycle of data s ubmission in January 2010 will give us the data we need to determine prio rities for service quality improvement by provider, region and state. To date most of our effort s around Quality management have been focused on infrastructure development but with the submissi on and analysis of data in the coming year we can begin our quality improvement efforts in earnest. 52 APPENDIX A 53 Epi Profile Executive Summary Since 1986, more than 22,400 persons have been diagnosed with HIV infection (including AIDS) in South Carolina through December 2007. During 1985 - 1990, an average of 848 cases were diagnosed each year. In the subseque nt three years (1991 - 1993), newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS cases averaged 1,310. The increase during th is period was in part due to the artificial rise in AIDS cases as a result of the change in case definition in 1993. For the past five years, the annual number of new cases has been about 805. Many more persons are infected but have not been tested. Some of the changes over time in numbers of new cases are largely the result of reporting patterns or targeted testing ini tiatives. The initial steep rise in the epidemic reflects the early years when less was known about the transmission of HIV and effective medical treatments did not exist. As a result, infection rates increas ed and more HIV-infected individuals went on to develop AIDS. Most experts believe that when more was learned about HIV and the behaviors involved in its spread, effec tive prevention strategies reduced the overall number of new infections, and medical treatment, for some indi viduals, postponed the onset of AIDS. In more recent years, however, there is concern nationa lly that the epidemic may grow particularly among young men who have sex with men. Since 1994, new anti-retroviral drugs and strengthened care services have contributed to a decline in overall AIDS deaths. This decline is illustrated by the 249 deaths in 2005, a 58% drop from the 590 deaths in 1994. It is important to note that despite the decline in deaths due to AIDS and the apparent stabilization of the number of new HIV/AIDS cases diagnosed annually, the prevalence of HIV infection (the number of persons estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS) is significantly incr easing. The number of persons living with HIV/AIDS at the end of each year has increased 67% from 1997 to 2007. It is also important to note that there are differences among certain populations in th e number and rate of new and prevalent infections, as this profile will indicate . Figure 1 shows total incidence (the number of new cases within a specified time period), deaths and prevalence of HIV/AIDS cases in South Carolina since 1988. Figure 1.

Number of Cases 54 The epidemic in South Carolina is primarily driven by sexual exposure, primarily among men who have sex with men and hetero sexuals at risk. In jecting drug use appear s to be diminishing as a risk for HIV. African-Americans are disproportionately aff ected by HIV/AIDS and are over-represented among all risk populations. Overview of Chapter The purpose of this Epidemiologic Profile is to provide information to the SC HIV Prevention Community Planning Group (CPG) on the number an d characteristics of persons becoming HIV infected in order to target and prioritize HIV prevention activities. This chapter of the SC HIV Prevention Plan include s a list of definitions and describes the data sources used, the limitations of each data type, and presents the data in order to answer the following questions: 1. What are the socio-demographic ch aracteristics of the population? 2. What is the impact of HI V/AIDS on the population? 3. Who is at risk for beco ming infected with HIV? 4. What is the geographic distribution of HIV infection? * 5. What are the patterns of service utiliz ation of people living with HIV/AIDS? 6. What are the characteristics of persons who know they are HIV-positive but who are not in HIV primary care? These questions will be explored through analyses of cumulative living (prevalent) and newly diagnosed (incident) HIV/AIDS cases; a descrip tion of seroprevalence data from HIV counseling and testing sites and other stud ies; a summary of other risk behavior profiles and community- based HIV risk assessment inform ation; and a discussion of related sociodemographic, health and risk behavior indicators. *Note: geographic distribution will be disc ussed within questions 2 and 3 for each population/risk described. Definitions AIDS - Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, the end stage of HIV infection characterized by life-threatening or seve rely disabling disease. HIV - Human Immunodeficiency Virus, the cause of HIV infection. 55 HIV/AIDS - Includes those persons with HIV inf ection, as well as those who have progressed to AIDS. Unless noted, most HIV data in this profile includes persons diagnosed with AIDS. HIV Only - Includes only persons with HIV infec tion who did not develop AIDS within 365 days of report of positive HIV test. Incidence- The number of new HIV/AIDS cases newl y diagnosed and reported each year. Incidence cases may be combined in two or three year periods. Incidence Rate - Number of new cases occurring dur ing a period of time, divided by the annual average population, multiplied by 100,000. It is a measure of the frequency with which an event (e.g. new HIV/AIDS cases) occurs in a population over a pe riod of time. It is also a measure of risk of getting the disease. Prevalence - The number or proportion of persons estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS at the end of a particular period of time (e.g. year). Prevalence Rate - Total number of living HIV/AIDS cases (both old and new cases) during the year of report, divided by the annual average population multiplied by 100,000. It is the proportion of persons in a populatio n who have a particular diseas e or attribute at a specified point in time (or specif ied period of time). Rates are used to: measure the frequency of disease (in this case, HIV/AIDS) or other outcomes of interest, describe the distribution of diseas e occurrence in human populations, allow comparison of the risk of disease or burden of diseas e across populations, characterize the risk of di sease for a population, and identify determinants of disease. They may also be used to help: prioritize prevention programs among competing causes, identify target groups for intervention, acquire funding for resources, and compare events across geopolitical boundaries. 56 TYPES AND QUALITY OF DATA Because no one epidemiologic data set will pr ovide a complete picture of HIV/AIDS in the community, or the state for that matter, we ha ve assembled data from several categories and sources. Data from a variety of categories provide a more accurate picture of past, present and future HIV/AIDS infection trends. Keeping in mind that not all data are equal, data sources must be considered in the context of their objecti ves, strengths and limitations; who the target populations are; how the data were collected; and the validity of the data. As described above, several data sets are used to illustrate the South Carolina populations diagnosed with HIV/AIDS and to characterize the nature of risk-taking. All of these data sets share limitations or have similar types of bias introduced, in that most are reported by third parties, largely providers, who must seek information from the affected individual as to illness, transmission mode, and demographic characterist ics. These reports are limited both by the willingness of providers to ask about these factors and that of clients to report on personal behaviors. These data are also limited in their ability to br oadly characterize populations. For instance, STD (sexually transmitted disease) or HI V/AIDS case report data can only characterize persons with STD or HIV who seek treatment, or data on estimated condom use among women can not characterize all women but only those who agree to partic ipate in selected behavioral surveys. Individuals who seek treatment for ST D (and who are offered HIV testing) may be very different from those individuals wh o do not. However, each of the data sets referred to in this profile provide information to describe the rela tive risk and impact of this disease on the people of South Carolina. The following summarizes data sources, and li mitations, used by the data working group to complete the South Carolina Epidemiologic Profile of HIV/AIDS. Selected Data Source Description and Limitations: Department of Alcohol and Other Drug A buse Services (DAODAS) SC Treatment Needs Assessment: Household Telephone Survey Data The purpose of the survey was to collect data on the prevalence of use of alcohol, marijuana, hallucinogens, cocaine, and heroin; to identify treatment needs relate d to use of these substances; and to determine the background ch aracteristics associated with different patterns of use. The state was stratified into four regions and w ithin each stratum a random sample of telephone numbers were selected using random digit dialin g (RDD). The questionnaire was based largely on the National Technical Center's Telephon e Substance Dependence Needs Assessment Questionnaire, which is \"designed to be the centerpiece of a needs assessment of treatment services that state or territories may conduct as part of th eir substance abuse pl anning activities. Trained staff conducted interviews. A total of 10,324 inte rviews were completed as part of the study by residents 18 years of age and older. Advantages to conducting a telephone survey compar ed to face-to-face interviews are as follows: 1) it costs three times less; 2) able to collect data from a significantly large number of 57 individuals, resulting in smalle r standard errors for the overall estimates of use of various substances and a larger number of i ndividuals with rare characteristics. Limitations include: population coverage-coll ecting data by telephone limits the potential respondents to those living in households and excl udes individuals, such as the homeless, those in correctional facilities, and those in treatment facilities who may be more likely to experience problems with alcohol and other drugs. Mo reover, according to 2000 census data, 4.2% of households in South Carolina do not have teleph ones and, consequently, had no chance of being included in the study. Secondly, underreporting-i n general, respondents' concerns over confidentiality produce unde restimates of reports of sensitive behaviors such as those considered in this study. Despite these limitations, teleph one surveys can provide comparatively reliable estimates of substance use and characteristics a ssociated with such use and they have been regarded as an effective means for collec ting such data from the general population. HIV Counseling and Testing Program Data from SC-DHEC Clinics Counseling and testing data, wh ile highly informative about pe rsons who seek counseling and testing, does not tell us anything about people who do not seek testing or choose not to test. All states provide HIV counseling and testing services and maintain data to quantify HIV counseling and testing services delivered in publicly-funded sites and to determine the characteristics of persons receiving those services. These data are used by prevention programs to plan and target services for high-risk individuals . The type of data collected in South Carolina include the counseling and testing site t ype, number of clients tested and number positive for each risk group, number tested, number positive by type of test site, and number tested and number positive by race/ethnicity gender, and age grou p. Clients receive confidential counseling and testing in each of the 46 county health department clinics. Note: in 2001 counseling and te sting was also provided by comm unity organizations but data from these sites were not available for this report. The counseling and testing data sy stem is standardized and has b een in place for several years. Data in this Epi-Profile reflect number of indi vidual clients tested during a specific period of time. Persons who received multiple tests during the report period are only counted once. It includes persons tested in family clinics, ma ternity clinics, TB, ST D clinics and persons voluntarily requesting services or referred through partner counse ling services. Approximately one third of the total of newly diagnosed and re ported persons with HIV in fection each year are from SC-DHEC counseling and testing sites. Persons tested in other settings, such as physician offices, hospitals, state facilitie s, etc. are not included in the DHEC counseling and testing database. To determine a client's level of risk, each person is assigned a risk status (e.g. injecting drug use, male to male sex, heterosexual with known risk). Since most clients acknowledge multiple risks, risk status is determined by usi ng the CDC's hierarchy of risk. Th is process assigns the client's \"highest\" risk. The highest possi ble risk in the hierarchy is se x with a person with HIV/AIDS, while the least significant risk is \"no acknowledged risk \". A person is only represented in their highest risk category regardless of how many risks the client acknowledges. This CDC risk hierarchy can limit interpretability of data; it also does not reflect associated risks such as other non-injecting substance use, i.e. crack-cocaine. 58 Counseling and testing data in South Carolina and nationally is distinct from blinded, HIV seroprevalence surveys which generate an estima te of HIV seroprevalen ce that is unbiased by client self-selection. The DHEC counseling and testing system only includes clients who seek out counseling and testing services or agree to be tested after c onsultation with a counselor at a clinic site. However, for those clinic sites in which clients can obtai n services other than counseling and testing for HIV, and in which all or nearly all clients actua lly receive HIV testing, (for example, maternity and STD clinics), data fo r those sites approximates the reliability of the blinded surveys. For example, the annual percentage of HIV positive tests is consistently 0.1% in DHEC maternity clinics where an estimated 80-90% of clients receive HIV testing. This rate is very similar to the blinded childbearing wo men seroprevalence survey rate of 0.19%, which tests a representative sample of a ll live births in the state. SC-DHEC, HIV/AIDS Reporting Surveillance System (HARSS) All health care providers, hospitals, and laborat ories in South Carolina are required to report persons diagnosed with confirme d HIV infection and/or AIDS. Each year approximately one- third of new cases are reported from county hea lth departments, one-thi rd from hospitals, one- fifth from physicians, and the re mainder from state/federal f acilities (including prisons) and laboratories. HARS monitors the incidence an d demographic profile of HIV/AIDS; describes the modes of HIV transmission among persons with HIV/AIDS; guides the development and implementation of public health intervention and prevention programs; and assists in evaluating the efficacy of public health interventions. It is the principal sour ce of knowledge regarding trends in the number and characteristics of HIV-in fected persons. It includes persons in all age, gender, race/ethnic, and mode-o f-HIV-exposure groups; and it provid es a historical perspective in trends dating to the earliest r ecognition of the AIDS epidemic. This profile primarily presents data on the total infection/disease spectrum: HIV infection including AIDS (not AIDS alone). Because of the long and variable period from HIV infection to the development of AIDS, trends in AIDS cases data do not represent recent HIV infections or all HIV-infected persons. AIDS surveillance data do not represent persons whose HIV infection is not recognized or diagnosed. AIDS cases have declined nationwide; however, because AIDS surveillance trends are affected by the inciden ce of HIV infection, as well as the effect of treatment on the progression of HIV disease, future AIDS trends cannot be predicted. Because trends in new diagnoses of HIV infection are affected when in the course of disease a person seeks or is offered HIV testing, such tr ends do not reflect the total incidence of HIV infection in the population. In a ddition, because all HIV-infected persons in the population might not have had the infection diagnosed, these data do not represent total HIV prevalence in the population. Interpretation of these data is comp licated by several factors, ranging from a person having both HIV then AIDS diagnoses in the same year, varying time between reporting HIV and AIDS cases, and numerous reasons why the number of new HIV diagnoses changed (increased, decreased, or stable). Some data is provided on HIV infection-only (p ersons reported with HIV infection who do not have an AIDS diagnosis within 365 days of being diagnosed with HIV). This data, while highly dependent on persons seeking or receiving HIV tes ting early in their infec tion stages, provide an 59 opportunity to compare persons pres umably infected more recently with those infected as long as ten or so years ago (AIDS diagnosis). Risk categories are assigned similar to the me thods described above in HIV Counseling and Testing. There are some slight differences in the type of categor ies between HIV/AIDS surveillance reports and HIV Counseling and Testi ng reports. In South Carolina, about 33% of adult/adolescent HIV infection/AIDS cases re ported in 1998 did not have risk categories reported. These cases are defined as \"No Identi fied Risk\"- NIR). The proportion of NIR cases has been increasing nationally as well. The primary reason for incomplete risk information (NIRs) is that reports from labor atories do not include risk, and an increasing proportion of cases result from heterosexual transmission but are not able to be defined in CDC's definition of heterosexual transmission. For example, persons who report having multiple heterosexual partners or who have sex for m oney/drugs but the status of thei r partners is not known, are not classified as \"heterosexual\", they are \"No Identif ied Risk\". South Caro lina has received funding from CDC to conduct a special pr oject to collect and define i ndicators of behavioral risk, particularly to define high risk heterosexual be haviors. Indicators include multiple heterosexual and same sex partners, drug use, evidence of bl ood transfusion or hepatitis, history of sexually transmitted disease, or exchange of money or dr ugs for sex. This project will provide more useful risk information for pr evention planning in the future. SC-DHEC, Sexually Transmitted Diseases Management Information System (STD*MIS) Health care providers and laboratories are requ ired by law to report certain sexually transmitted diseases (including syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, chancroid, hepatitis) to SC-DHEC. A sexually transmitted disease, other than HIV infec tion, represents a visible and immediate health problem that stems from unprotecte d intercourse with an infected partner. Research from several studies strongly indicates that STDs increase the possibility of acquiring and transmitting HIV infection. The emerging problem of heterosexual HIV transmission in the South closely parallels that of syphilis and gonorrhea. Gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia incidence and prevalence data are used by programs to: 1) monitor local, and state trends; 2) iden tify high-risk groups and geographic areas in wh ich unsafe sexual behaviors occur, 3) guide the development and implementation of public health intervention and prevention programs; and 4) assist in evaluating the efficacy of pub lic health interventions. Considering the short incubation periods for thes e infections, gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia incidence represent rece nt consequences of unsafe sexual be havior and point to populations who are potentially at very high risk for acquiring an d transmitting HIV infection. Unfortunately, an often unrecognized aspect of STDs , including bacterial STDs, is how frequently persons with these infections have no symptoms or do not recognize symptoms. Most studies of STDs are conducted in health-care settings specifically fo r persons who do recognize symptoms; therefore, these studies usually overestima te the proportion of infected persons who are symptomatic. Studies of STD screening in nonhealth-care setti ngs (e.g., jails, workplaces, and communities) or health-care settings where ST D treatment is not the primar y function (e.g., family-planning clinics) suggest that most persons with gonorrhea or chlamydia are asymptomatic. Limitations: STD data lack much information that would help to better understand HIV risk, such as mode of transmission. Also, bias is in troduced for some diseases, such as chlamydia, 60 where screening of asymptomatic pe rsons is done much more frequently in women than in men. For example, all women <25 years attending fam ily planning and STD clinics in county health departments are routinely screened for chlamydia a nd gonorrhea. Also, there may be bias in that the majority of reports are from public clinic s; the personal nature of STD's may affect providers' willingness to report. This may account, in part, for the disparity of some STDs to occur at much higher rates among African-Americans who are more likely to seek care in public clinics, where there is mo re complete reporting. South Carolina Statistical Abstract, 2006 An annual publication of the South Carolina Stat e Budget and Control Board, Office of Research and Statistics. This state document provides a comprehensive, single-source reference of demographic and economical data pertinent to S outh Carolina. Statistics providing information on factors impacting the state's social and econo mical development are compiled from in-house data bases as well as a variety of federal, state, local, and private sources. In order to complete the epidemiologic profile, sociodemographic da ta from sections State and County Rankings, Education, Employment, Housing, Income, and P opulation were used. The abstract depends heavily on the US Bureau of the Census data from 2000. As a result of this, data may not represent the current situ ation in South Carolina. South Carolina Vital and Morbidity Statistics, 2006 Its purpose is to provide basic reference data for a variety of users. The primary uses of the report were to enumerate and characterize mortalit y attributed to HIV infection. The data were also used to compare trends in HIV infection mo rtality with other leading causes of death and to characterize the impact of HIV infection on mo rtality. Data on causes of death are based on information recorded by hospitals, physicians, co roners, midwives and funeral directors. Recorded information may be inaccurate or in complete due to underrep orting of certain causes of deaths, the number of HIV-related deaths and the conditions may be underestimated. Vital statistics data are not as timely as AIDS case reports due in part to processing time. Youth Risk Behavior Sur veillance System (YRBSS) The Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) was developed cooperatively by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), several federal agencies and state departments of education to measure the extent to which adolescen ts engage in health ri sk and health enhancing behaviors. The survey is a 99-ite m questionnaire administered to 6 th-12th graders in the public school system. Samples are randomly selected based on school size (small, medium and large). Of the 99 items, 11 are on tobacco use, 5 on alcohol use, 4 on marijuana use, 9 on cocaine use, 8 on sexual behaviors for pregnanc y, HIV/AIDS and other STD ris k, 2 on HIV/AIDS Education, 1 on HIV/AIDS testing and 2 on HI V/AIDS risk perceptions. Th ere are 367 private K-12 schools in South Carolina (SC St atistical Abstract, 2003). However, none of them are included in the survey. Also, while schools are randomly selected for participation some may choose not to participate. This survey relies heavily on surveillance method s and self-reports; so it really depends on how well respondents understand the question and how well they can accurately and honestly answer the question. However, the data are edited, checke d and weighted. These data are representative of only public high school students in grades 6-12 in South Carolina. 61 Ryan White Program Data Report The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Data Report (RDR) is an annual report that captures information regarding the services provided by all Ryan White funded entities. The RDR is divided into sections including: service provider information; client information; service information; HIV counseling a nd testing; and medical inform ation. Providers report on all clients who received services eligible for Ryan White Parts A, B, C or D funding regardless of the actual funding source used to pay for those se rvices. The South Carolina Ryan White Part B contractors complete the RDR forms and submit them to DHEC. DHEC assembles all of the reports and submits the data to HRSA. Question #1: What are the sociod emographic characteristics of the population? The HIV epidemic in the United States, and in South Carolina, is a composite of multiple, unevenly distributed epidemics in different regions and am ong different populations. These populations may comprise persons who practice similar high-risk behavior, such as injecting drugs or having unprotected sex with an infect ed person. Although race and ethnicity are not risk factors for HIV transmission, they are mark ers for complex underlying social, economic, and cultural factors that affect persona l behavior and health. Low soci oeconomic status is associated with increased disease morbidity and premature mo rtality. Unemployment status is correlated to limited access to health care services, resulting in increased risk for disease. This section provides background information on South Carolin a's populations and cont extual information, i.e. education, poverty level, housing, etc, for assessing potential HIV impact. The social, economic, and cultural context of HIV infection must be considered when funding, designing, implementing and evaluating HIV preven tion programs for diverse populations. The State South Carolina lies on the southeastern seaboard of the United States. Shaped like an inverted triangle, the state is bounded on the north by No rth Carolina, on the southeast by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the southwest by Georgia. It ra nks 40th among the 50 states in size and has a geographic area of 30,111 square miles. South Ca rolina has a diverse geography that stretches from the Blue Ridge Mountains in the northwest corner to the b eaches along the Atlantic coast in the southeast. There are 46 counties and they ar e divided into 8 public he alth regions. Columbia, located in the center of the state, is the capital and the largest city. There are 3 metropolitan areas with a population of 500,000 or more: Colu mbia, Charleston and Greenville areas. The state is crisscrossed by interstate highways that li nk it with every part of the country, including I- 95 extending north-south across the center of the state from New Yo rk to Florida and I-26 from Asheville, North Carolina to Charleston, South Ca rolina, and I-20 that extends east-west across the state from Florence, South Caro lina to Atlanta, Georgia. Ma nufacturing is the state's leading industry, followed by tourism and forestry. 62 Populations Based on projected population estimates, in 2007, the total number of South Carolinians was 4,299,600. Of this to tal, 65% were Caucasian, 29% were African-American, 0.3% was Native American/Alaskan, 1.1% was Asian and Pacific Islander, and 4% were of Hispanic origin . Fifty-one percent were female and forty-nine percent were male. Sixty-five percent of the population distribution in South Ca rolina is defined as metropolitan, 35% is non-metropolitan. The proportion of persons who completed a bachelor's degree or higher is 23%, lower than the U.S. proportion of 28%. (Figure 2) Education & Earnings Despite the economic strides it has made in recent years, South Carolina remains among the states with the highest percenta ge of persons who live below th e poverty level (11th of fifty states and District of Columbia). Educational attainment is strongly correlated with poverty, and South Carolina continues to rank low in percent of persons over 25 years of age who have bachelors' degrees or higher (36th of fifty states and District of Columbia). Nearly twenty percent (19.2%) of the population has less than a high school education. Educational attainment and earnings are directly related. The more education a South Carolinian has, the more money he/she is likely to earn. However, if we compare across gender and racial lines, there are inconsistencies. White males clearly attain the highest incomes. The income gap between whites and blacks is higher for each education level, but particularly increases for pe rsons with bachelors degrees or more. Income for whites is 1.5 times greater than blacks for pers ons with bachelors and masters degrees, and is 2.1 times greater than blacks for persons with doctorates.

Whites earned 18% above the state's average per capita income. (Figure 4) Poverty Level Based on 2006 Census data, approximately 15.7% of South Carolinians lived below the poverty level (ranking 12th in the US); and 11.9% of S outh Carolinian families lived below the poverty level. Twenty-nine percent of Black South Carolinians were below poverty in 2006, compared to 22% of persons of Hispanic descent, 10% among Whites and close to 16% of persons categorized as other, which includes Asian, Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans. (Figure 5) Insurance/Access to Primary Care Sixteen percent (16%) of South Carolinians do not have health insurance coverage. A significantly higher proportion of persons in the state do not have access to a primary care provider (35.8%) compared to the total U.S. population (17.1%) (Figure 6). Over 95% of counties are designated all or part medically underserved areas and all or part health profession shortage areas (1999).

The median household income in 2007 was $42,561 vs. the US median income of $49,901. Housing According to the US Census, in 2007, 70% of the state's homes were owned. The SC Council on Homelessness estimates 6,759 persons are homeless in South Carolina. Summary South Carolina, as many southern states, ranks high for poverty, low educational attainment, and uninsured population compared to other US stat es. These factors can affect one's ability to access prevention and health care services and ad here to regimens for treatment and care of diseases that may lead to more severe consequences. Question #2: What is the impact of HIV/AIDS on the population? In the United States, HIV/AIDS remains a significant cause of illness, disability, and death, despite declines in new AIDS cases and d eaths from 1995 to 2007. Current surveillance provides population-based HIV/AIDS data for tracking trends in the epidemic, targeting and allocating resources for preven tion and treatment services, an d planning and conducting program evaluation activities. In South Carolina, AIDS cases have been reported since 1981, and confirmed cases of HIV infection have been reportable since Februa ry 1986. During the calendar year of 2006, according to the CDC HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report, South Carolin a ranked 9th among states and the District of Columbia with an AIDS case ra te of 16.3 per 100,000 population. During this same time period, South Carolina also ranked seventh among states and the District of Columbia with an AIDS case rate of 12.5 per 100,000 for female adolescent/adult AIDS cases. The epidemic is continuing to grow with an average of 65 cases of HIV infection repor ted each month during the past year. As of December 31, 2007, there were 22,489 persons cumulatively reported with HIV, and of them, 17,394 have been diagnosed with AIDS. South Carolina has experienced a 67% increase of all persons living wi th HIV/AIDS from 1997 to 2007. More dramatic, there has been an increase of 81% in the number of women living at the end of 2007 compared with the number living in 1997. This section summarizes the overall toll of the epidemic in South Carolina based on total reported HIV/AIDS cases and deaths. 65 Gender Figure 7 shows the impact of HIV on the men and women in South Carolina. Men unequivocally are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS. They make up 49% of South Carolina's total population, but comprise 69% of persons living with HIV (prevalence). HIV-only diagnosed cases during the two-year period 2006-2007 gives an estimate of more recent infections or potentially emerging populations. Figure 8 shows the rate per 100,000 population for males and females diagnosed with HIV/AIDS each year. During 1997 - 2007 the case rate for fe males appears to be slightly decreasing. For males, the rate had declined prior to 1998, when the rate increased due to screening in the state correctional facilities. With the exception of 1998, the ratio of men to women has averaged about 2 to 1 during the past three years, where previously it was more than 3 to 1. Race/Ethnicity African-Americans are disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS in South Carolina. They comprise 30% of the state's total population, yet 73% of the total persons living with HIV are African-American. Two percent (2%) of total cases are Hispanic, who comprise the same proportion of the state's population (Figure 9). Figure 8 : HIV/AIDS Case Rate per 100,000 for Males and Females, 1991 - 2007 010203040506070 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 Year of DiagnosisMales FemalesCase Rate per 100,000 Figure 9: Proportion of Persons Living with HIV/AIDS by Race/Ethnicity, 2007 Black 73% White 24%Other <1% Hispanic 2%Figure 7: Disproportionate HIV Total Estimated Living With HIV/AIDS, 2007No.(%) SC Population* 67 men comprise 15% of the state's population, yet 47% of the total prevalent HIV/AIDS cases in 2007. African-American women, similarly, comprise 17% of the population, yet 26% of prevalent cases. More recent infections (HIV-Only Diagnosis) during 2006 - 2007 reflect a slight increase among African-American men and a slight decrease among African-American women relative to the proportion of persons living with HIV in 2007 (Figure 10). Each year the number of all persons living with HIV/AIDS continues to grow. Case rates per 100,000 by race and gender show the disparate burden of HIV among African-Americans. As Figure 11 shows, the rate per 100,000 population in 2007 is six times higher for black males than for white males, and twelve times higher for black females compared to white females. An increase in the case rate for black men in 1998 reflected a large number of new cases reported as a result of a Departme nt of Corrections screening. While the overall number and rate of newly diagnosed persons with HIV/AIDS each year is stable, there are differences among race/gender populations. (Figure 12) The case rate per 100,000 population among white men in South Carolina has on average remained relatively stable during the past five years (2003-2007). Recently, the rate for African-American women in S.C. decreased 30% from 2003 to 2007. As stated previously, the case rate among African-American males increased in 1998-1999 due to correctional facility screening; however, overall the rate have remained stable during the past five years.

They make up 37% of the total population yet they represent about 52% of prevalent and 69% of HIV-only diagnosed cases. (Figure 13) Figure 14 shows the HIV/AIDS case rates per 100,000 population by year of diagnosis for selected adult/adolescent age groups for the past seventeen years. The rates are highest for persons 20-24 years of age, followed by those 25-44 years. Risk Exposure Men who have sex with men (MSM) comprise the greatest proportion of persons living with HIV/AIDS at the end of 2007 with known risk factors (41%), followed closely by heterosexuals (39%). Eighteen percent (18%) are injecting drug users (Figure 15). Other risks include blood transfusions, hemophilia, and perinatal transmission. Of the total estimated number of persons living with HIV/AIDS in 2007, 24% had no risk identified (not reflected in Figure 15).

The proportion of cases due to heterosexual transmission was 40%, men who have sex with men accounted for 50% and IDUs made up 9%. Thirty-two percent (32%) of these cases had no risk identified (not reflected in figure 16). Note: The primary reasons for risk exposure information not reported were explained in the Introduction, South Carolina HIV/AIDS Surveillance System section. Over time, the proportion of cases with no risk identified in a given year decreases when risks are determined through foll ow-up surveillance activities. For example, during 2000 there were 312 cases origina lly reported with no risk; as of December 2001, risks were determined for 249 of the 312 cases. The race/gender profile of 2007 cases originally reported with no risks is relatively close to the total proportion of HIV/AIDS cases by race/gender (Figure 17). During 2006 - 2007, 70% of males diagnosed with HIV/AIDS were African-American. Among African-American males with reported risk factors, most cases were attributed to male to male sexual contact (67%) and heterosexual contact (26%). Injecting drug use is more commonly reported among white males (15%) than among black males (6%). Among white men, Figure 17: Comparison of No Risk Identified Cases with Total S.C.

Heterosexual contact was the most common reported risk for all women (89%). Injecting drug use is more commonly reported among white women (27%) than among black women (6%).

Both men and women expe rienced decreases over time in the proportion of total cases with ri sk reported among injecting drug us ers. During 1996 - 1998 to 2005 - 2007, there was a 62% decrease in the pr oportion among injecting drug use among men and a 36% decrease among women. The proportion of heterose xual risk increased 5% for men and increased 7% for wome n during the same time periods.

Over 60% of counties have prevalence rates >600 per 100,000 for African-Americans, as reflected in Figure 22. Annual case rates in counties of more recently diagnosed African-American persons during 2005 - 2007 reflect essentially the same counties as highest prevalence rates. Richland County has the highes t annual case rate (Figure 23). Counties with highest prevalence rates among white persons include more urban areas of Greenville, Spartanburg, Richla nd and Lexington (Columbia) , Charleston, Horry (Myrtle Beach), as well as Orangeburg, Florence, Marlboro, Fairfield, McCormick, Colleton, Jasper, Dillon and Lee (Figure 24).

These medications have also led to the decrease in HIV-related deaths. Large declines in HIV mortality nationally essentiall y occurred during 1996 - 1997. Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cautiously attributed the sudden drops in deaths to new anti-retrovirals, protease inhibitors, combination therapies, and increased prophylaxis for opportunistic illnesses. However, the initially reported gains were tempered by reports of demographic differentials that suggested only certain groups were benefiting from these new therapies Figure 26 shows largest declines in deaths in South Carolina were in 1997, droppi ng to 317 from 532 the previous year. In recent years, death among persons with AIDS has remained fairly stable, which may indicate diminishing efficacy of therapies am ong some patients. Reasons for this may include delay in diagnosis of HIV infection until severe symptoms arise, difficulty in adherence to prescribed medical treatments, and development of viral resistance to therapy. Although black males represent 47% of persons living with HIV/AIDS, in 2005, they accounted for the majority of persons dying from AIDS (51%). African-American females accounted for 26% of AIDS related deaths followed by white males (18%). By age group, the majority of deaths occurred among persons 25-44 years (50%).

These areas are also among those that have the highest prevalence of AIDS in the state. Question #3: Who is at risk for becoming infected with HIV? The persons most likely to become infected with HIV are those who engage in high-risk behaviors with persons in communities with a high number/rate of persons living with HIV infection, i.e. prevalence. As menti oned previously, growing numbers of people with HIV in South Carolina are living more h ealthy lives, including sexual activity. The frequency of high-risk behavi or combined with the HIV pr evalence in sexual or drug using-networks determines a person's risk for becoming infected. In order to accurately target STD/HIV prevention and treatment act ivities, it is important for community planning groups (and program providers) to have information on the number and characteristics of persons who become ne wly infected with HIV and persons whose behaviors or other exposures put them at various levels of risk for STD and HIV infection. This section summarizes HIV inf ection among population groups at high risk for HIV infection, sexually transmitted disease data, and behavioral data. Characteristics of HIV/AIDS in Persons at Highest Risk Analysis of characteristics of persons with HIV/AIDS helps identify persons at greatest risk for becoming infected. Risk for infection can be determined by assessing the frequency of high-risk behavi or (e.g., unprotected sex, need le-sharing) in combination with the estimated prevalence of HIV/AIDS and incidence of HIV/AIDS. Figure 29 shows the nu mber of persons in South Carolina living with HIV/AIDS at the end of each year by reported risk. Men who have sex men (MSM) co mprise the greatest number of living persons, followed closely by heterosexuals. Injecting drug users (IDUs) and other risks (e.g. hemophilia, blood Figure 28: Number of Persons who died of AIDS by Health Region, 2005 7 17 Region 8 100 249 TOTAL14 35 Region 76 16 Region 67 18 Region 520 49 Region 422 55 Region 316 41 Region 27 18 Region 1% No. Health Region Figure 29: Number of Persons Presumed Living with HIV/AIDS at End No Risk Re ported; MSM/IDU included in IDU categoryNumber of Persons Living with HIV/AIDS 74transfusion, perinatally acquired infection) comprise fewer numbers. While men who have sex with men comprise the greater proportion of persons living with HIV, newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS cases each year indicate that beginning in 1997, more persons report hete rosexual risk than male to male sex, except in 2004 and 2005 where the number reporting heterosexual risk and male to male sex were almost equal and in 2006, the number reporting male to male sex slightly exceed heterosexual risk. While not validated, many local experts believ e that the number of heterosexuals among African-American men may be ar tificially high due to fears of discrimination; therefore, men do not reveal male to male sex as a ri sk behavior. The number of injecting drug users reported each year has remained stab le over the past five years (Figure 30). Based on data in this profile, the following primary populations have been identified as being the highest risk of HIV/AIDS: men who have sex with men (MSM), high-risk heterosexuals, and injecting drug users (I DUs). Women will be described in the heterosexual and injecting drug user secti on, and teenagers/young adults will be described within each population cate gory. Since African-Americans are disproportionately impacted across each risk category, this impact will be described for each risk population rather than as a separate population. Infants and children and prison populations will be described separately. Men Who Have Sex With Men Estimates of Men Who Have Sex with Men Behavior in South Carolina According to the U.S. Census Bureau, th ere are approximately 1,436,281 males in South Carolina between the ages of 15-64, which is the age range when persons are most sexually active. Review of literature and other state profiles, indicates that the estimated percentage of men who have sex with me n (MSM) ranges from 2.1% to 10.1%, with the average at 2.7%. This would mean that th e number of MSM in South Carolina could be estimated to be 38,780, although the estim ated range is much broader. Characteristics Note: for purposes of this analysis, case s that are both men who have sex with men (MSM) and injecting drug users (IDU) are incl uded in the injecting drug user category. Figure 30: Number of HIV/AIDS Cases by Year of Diagnosis and Risk, 1991 -2007 0100200300400500600 1991 1993 1995 19971999 2001 2003 2005 2007 Year of DiagnosisMSM Heterosex IDU Other Excludes Persons with No Risk ReportedNumber of Cases 75 The largest proportion of persons living with HIV/AIDS in South Carolina at the end of 2007 was men who have sex with men (41% of total prevalent adult/adolescent cases with identifiable risk). MSM account for a slightly higher proportion (50%) of the more recently diagnosed adult/adolescent cases during 2006-2007. The number of MSM cases diagnosed each year increased 16% from 2003 to 2007. As Figure 31 demonstrates, the majority of MSM cases diagnosed during 2006 - 2007 were African-Americans (66%). White men accounted for 30% of the new cases and 4% were Hispanic or other races. The majority of men who have sex with men diagnosed during 2006 - 2007 were 25 - 44 years of age (52%); 25% were 20 - 24 years old and 15% were 45+ years. For men more recently diagnosed, African- Americans accounted for the highest proportion for each age group except for those 45 and older (Figure 32). Of the men who have sex with men presumed living with HIV in 2007, 69% were African-American, 28% were white and 3% were Hispanic/other men. As Figure 33 shows, for each younger age category less than 45 years, African-Americans comprise the greatest proportion of living MSM. However, among those 45 years and older, the proportion is Figure 31: Proportion of Men with HIV/AIDS Who Have Sex With Men by Race/Ethnicity, Diagnosed 2006-2007 N=536 Hisp/Other 4% Percent MSM HIV/AIDS Cases Diagnosed 2006-2007 15-19 20-24 25-44 45+ AgesWhite Black Total N includes 24 Other Men Not Included in Graph Due to Small Numbersn=42 n=134 n=279 n=80Percent of Age Group Figure 33: Percent of MSM Living with HIV/AIDS by Age 0102030405060708090100 15-19 20-24 25-44 45+ AgeWhite Black Total N includes 112 Other Men Not Included in Graph Due to Small Numbersn=22 n=216 n=2451 n=1786Percent of Age Group 76equal for white and African-American men (50%). The more urban counties of Greenville/Spartanburg, Anderson, York, Richland, Lexington, Charleston, Sumter, Horry, Florence and Orangeburg have the greatest number of men who have sex with men living with HIV/AIDS in 2007 (Figure 34). Due to small numbers for many counties, portraying the three-year annual case numbers of men who have sex with men by county is not useful. Conclusions These data indicate that prevention efforts ta rgeted to men who have sex with men need to be tailored to both African-American a nd white men. African-American men account for almost half the proportio n of both living cases (47%) and newly diagno sed HIV/AIDS cases (50%). Increased efforts in particular are needed to reach younger African- American MSM <25 years of age; for white men, targeted efforts are needed for those >25 years. Interventions also need to be pa rticularly available for persons living in the more urban areas of the state. High Risk Heterosexuals Estimates of High-Risk Heterosexual Behavior in South Carolina I t i s d i f f i c u l t t o m a k e a n a s s e s s m e n t o f the number of persons in South Carolina who engage in heterosexual contact that puts them at high risk for becoming infected with HIV. While there are some differences in th e population of persons with HIV/AIDS than for those with a sexually transmitted disease, most experts acknowledge that a diagnosis of an STD would suggest that the individual is engaging in unsafe sexual practices. During 2007, 26,117 cases of chlamydia, 9,932 cases of gonorrhea and 95 cases of infectious syphilis were reported in South Carolina. Women with an STD, in particular, indicate high-risk heterose xual activity. Among the 2007 cases of chlamydia, 20,542 were among women, and 5,453 women were reported with gonorrhea. More data on STDs, as well as other behavioral indicator s such as teenage pregnancy and condom use is described later. No. of Cases 0 to 25 26 to 50 51 to 100 101 to 1000Figure 34: SC HIV Prevalence by Exposure Category, 2007 Reported Cases, by County MSM 77In order for a case of HIV or AIDS to be co nsidered as heterosexua l transmission, it must be documented that the individual had he terosexual contact with a person who has documented HIV infection or AIDS, or had he terosexual contact with a person who is in a high risk group for HIV (MSM or injecting drug user). Characteristics of Hi gh Risk Heterosexuals Persons with documented high-risk heterose xual contact comprise 30% of the total adult/adolescent persons living with HIV/AI DS at the end of 2007 and 27% of persons more recently diagnosed during 2006-2007 (excluding persons with no risk identified for both new and prevalent cases). The number of heterosexual cases diagnosed each year decreased 34% from 2000 to 2007 (see Figure 30). Figure 35 shows that over half (58%) of recently diagnosed heterosexual HIV/AIDS cases are women. African-American women account for 50% of recent cases and white women account for 8%. Thirty-two percent (32%) are African-American men. White men account for only 4% of recent cases. Figure 36 shows the number of heterosexually acquired HIV in women and men in South Carolina from 1997 to 2007. During most of this period, the proportion of female cases outnumbered the male cases by an average of 40%. The number of women reporting heterosexual risk has gradually decreased by 26% in the past five years from 2003 to 2007. Likewise, the number of men reporting heterosexual HIV risk has gradually decreased by 27% in the same time period. The majority of high risk heterosexuals recently diagnosed were 25 - 44 years of age (52%); Figure 35: Proportion of HIV/AIDS Cases Attributed to Heterosexual Transmission, By Sex and Year of Diagnosis 050100150200250 19971998 1999 2000 2001200220032004200520062007 Year of DiagnosisWomen MenNumber Figure 37: Percent Heterosexual HIV/AIDS Group Total N includes 25 Other Race Not Included in Graph Due to Small Numbers 7835% were 45 years and older, and 13% under 25 years. With the ex ception of the 15-19 year old group, African-American women and men comprised the greatest proportion of cases in each age group (Figure 37). Am ong young women less than 45 years of age, over 8 out of every 10 of the total cases are African-American women. White women and men account for an average of 15% or less of young and older ages. Of the high risk heterosexual persons presumed living with HIV/AIDS in 2007, over half were African-American women (53%), 32% were African-American men; 8% were white women. As Figure 38 shows, over 8 of every 10 young women under age 25 living with HIV/AIDS were African-American; over one half of persons 25 - 44 are African-American women. Similarly, the proportion of persons living 45 years and older is greatest for African-American women followed closely by African-American men. As with more recently diagnosed persons, white women and men account for an average of 12% of persons living with HIV across all age groups. Estimates of prevalence of HIV among High Risk Heterosexual Women Estimates of HIV prevalence among women were obtained during 1990 - 1997 through a population-based seroprevalence survey of women who deliver live births at hospitals throughout the state. Recently estimates are obtained by the pediatric surveillance system using reports of HIV infected women delivering live births. While this prevalence is limited to child-age bearing women who have delivered a child, it provides the best overall estimate available for HIV infection among women 15 - 44 years of age. Figure 39 shows that the number of HIV infection cases among all women delivering live births has been stab le during the past seven years, averaging nearly 100 per year. The rate, tho ugh, is nearly 9 times higher among African-American women compar ed to white women. 81102111 105 10087106 100 93 98 100120107106 102 10091109 108 1996 2006*Perinatally HIV exposed/infected SCBWFigure 39 : Perinatally HIV Exposed Births by Year of Birth Compared to SC Survey of Child Bearing Women Source: provisional SC STD/HIV Surveillance Program DataFigure 38: Percent of Heterosexuals Living Group Total N includes 116 Other Race Not Included in Graph Due to Small Numbers 79 Figure 40 shows the counties with highest prevalence of pe rsons living with HIV/AIDS due to heterosexual transmission. These ar e the more urban counties of Florence, Greenville/Spartanburg, Richland, Lexi ngton, Sumter, Orangeburg, Horry and Charleston, as well as Darlington and Aiken coun ties. Figure 41 shows the case rate for 2005-2007 among women, an indicator for more recent heterosexual risk. Richland, Sumter, Orangeburg, as well as rural Ma rlboro, Marion, Bamberg, Barnwell and Allendale counties had the highest case rates in the state. Conclusions These data indicate that preven tion efforts targeted to high risk heterose xuals need to be tailored to African-Americans, particular ly young women under age 25, who account for over six of every ten persons of both living cases and more recently diagnosed cases in this age group. Efforts also need to target African-Am erican men and women 25 - 44 years, who account for over ei ght out of every ten person s living and more recently diagnosed cases (all ages). Prevention e fforts targeting African-American men and women should also be ta ilored to reach those 45 years and older. Injecting Drug Users Estimates of Injecting Drug Us e Behavior in South Carolina According to 1999-2000 estimates of heroine use provided by the SC Department of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Services (DAODAS), there are 8,000 persons in South Carolina who are injecting drug users in need of treatment services. No. of Cases 0 to 25 26 to 50 51 to 100 101 to 800Figure 40: SC HIV Prevalence by Exposure Category, 2007 Reported Cases, by County Heterosexual Contact Rate per 100,000 0 to 10.9 11 to 29.9 30 to 40Figure 41: SC HIV Incidence Rates (per 100,000 population) 2005-2007 Average of Cases Females 80Characteristics of Injecting Drug Users Note: persons who are categorized as bot h men who have sex with men and injecting drug users are included in this population description. Injecting drug users (IDUs) account for 13% of the persons presumed living with HIV/AIDS in 2007 and 12% of persons more recently diagnosed with HIV/AIDS during 2006-2007. The number of IDU cases diagnosed each year decreased 45% from 2001 to 2007 (See Figure 30). Figure 42 shows that 33% of recently diagnosed injecting drug use cases are African-American men; white men account for 32% of recent diagnoses. African-American women account for 15% of cases, and the least proportion is among white women (14%). Men are overwhelmingly impacted by HIV transmitted by injecting drug use, averaging 3 cases to every one case reported among women each year. Men show a decrease in number of diagnosed IDU cases since 1998. For most of this same period, the number of diagnosed IDU cases among women was fairly stable. The increase in 1998 cases for men is likely due to targeted screening in corrections facilities, identifying more new cases that year. (Figure 43) Figure 44 shows that 49% of recently diagnosed IDU cases are 45 years and older; 43% are 25 - 44 years of age. Only 8% of persons diagnosed during 2006-2007 were under 25 years.

(Figure 45) Figure 46 indicates the counties with the highest number of persons living with HIV with injecting drug use risk (Richland, Greenville, and Charlest on). As with other risks, the more urban counties have the greatest numbers. Conclusions Prevention efforts targeting injecting drug users need to be tailored to men, prim arily African-American men who comprise a majority of recently diagnosed cases, fo llowed by white men. Efforts should target persons older than 25 years and those who are predominately in more urban counties including Lexington, York, Florence, Spar tanburg, Horry, Orangeburg and Sumter. Other Populations Other populations at varying risk for HI V are described below and include infants and children, persons with sexually tran smitted diseases, and pregnant teen-age women. Infants and Children: (Children under 13 years of age) The majority of infants and children are infected with HIV through exposure to their mother during pregnancy. Through December 2007, there were 105 HIV infection cases No. of Cases 0 to 25 26 to 50 51 to 100101+Figure 46: HIV Prevalence by Exposure Category, 2007 Reported Cases, by County IDUFigure 45: Percent of IDU Persons Presumed Living with HIV/AIDS by Race/Sex and Group 82diagnosed among children less than 13 years of age, of which 52 had AIDS. This represents less than 1.0 percen t of the total reported AIDS and HIV infection cases. The majority of the children with HIV are black. There has been significant progress during the past five years in reducing the number of infants with perinatal acquired HIV infection. Figure 47 shows the decline in the number of infants diagnosed from 16 cases in 1997 to 5 cases in 2007. Persons with Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) STDs are primary risk factors for HIV inf ection and a marker of high risk, unprotected sexual behavior. Many STDs cause lesions or other sk in conditions that facilitate HIV infection. Trends in STD infection among di fferent populations (e .g. adolescents, women, men who have sex with men) may reflect chan ging patterns in HIV infection that have not yet become evident in the HIV/AIDS caseload of a particular area. Chlamydia In 2007, there were 26,117 cases of chlamydia diagnosed in South Caro lina. Figure 48 shows the increase of chlam ydia as a result of initiating routine screening for all young women attending family planning and STD clinics in health departments statewide. Among those cases with reported race/gender, 57% were African-American women; 18% were white women in 2007. Hispanic men and women accounted for 1% of cases in 2007.

Counties with highest chlamydia rates per 100,000 population in 2007 were Bamberg (1,460.6), (1,358.4) and Richland gonorrhea cases were diagnosed. African-American men and women account for 85% of reported cases with known race/gender in 2007. Figure 50 shows trends among race/gender by year. As with chlamydia, gonorrhea cases most affect young adults 20-29 years of age (49% of total) (Figure 51). Counties with highest rates per 100,000 of gonorrhea in 2007 were Lee (481.5); Orangeburg (405.1); and Richland Infectious Syphilis Figure 49: Proportion of 2007 Reported Chlamydia Cases by Year of Diagnosis by Age Group 20-29 52%30-39 8%40+ 2% 0-19 38% 19961997 19981999 2000 2001 20022003 20042005 20062007White Black Male Black Female YearNumber of CasesFigure 50: South Carolina Reported Gonorrhea Cases by Year of Diagnosis, 1993 - 2007 Figure 51 : Proportion of 2007 Reported Gonorrhea Cases by Year of Diagnosis by Age Group 0-19 29% 20-29 49%30-39 13%40+ 9% Excludes persons with no reported age 84In 2007, 95 cases of infectious syphilis were diagnosed. As Figure 52 shows, significant decreases have occurred during th e past ten years for all infec tious syphilis cases. As with other STDs, African-Americans are most im pacted, accounting for 75% of total cases. Unlike other STDs, syphilis most impacts older adults, 30 years and older (59% of total) (Figure 53). Counties with highest infectious syph ilis rates per 100,000 population in 2007 were Lee (9.7), Allendale (9.3), Richland (9.2), and Calhoun (6.7).

African-American girls between the ages of 10 and 14 have continued to have higher rates of live births than their white counter parts. However, their rates have decreased from 4.2 in 1988 to 1.8 per 1,000 in 2006, respectively. Teenage pregnancies among 15-17 year old South Carolinians have decreased from a rate of 43.2 per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 28.1 in 2005; a 35% decline (Figure 54). This success is also seen when viewing teen pre gnancy by racial/ethnic subgroups. The rate for White 15-17 year old teens was 29.1 in 1990 and 22.1 in 2005, representing a 24% decline. The rate for African-American 15-17 year old teens declined 44% in the same time period from 1990 to 2005. The rate for Others is the only exception to a consistent declining trend where the rate was 21.2 in 1996 and climbed to 30.4 in 1998 and down again to 17.4 in 2005, representing a 18% decrease in the rate over the 1996 to 2005 period. This fluctuation may be due to small numbers and the trend for this subgroup requires further observation. Figure 55 shows the teen pregnancy rates for 18 and 19 year olds. As with the other two age groups, African-American and other teenage girls continue to have higher live birth ra tes over the 15- year period than all races. But also as seen in the other age groups their rates have decreased from 150.6 to 103.3, 1990 and 2005, respectively. Persons Receiving HIV Counseling and Te sting At County Health Departments Data from local HIV counseling and testing sites (county health departments) generally reflect similar trends as HIV/AI DS surveillance data in terms of who is most likely to be HIV infected, risk catego ry, and county of residence.

HIV infected p ersons diagnosed through counseling and testing sites account for about one-third of the newly diagnosed persons in South Carolina annually. This data reflects numb er of individuals tested, not the number of tests. In 2007, African-Americans compri sed 64% of the total persons tested, but 77% of the total positive. Men accounted for 38% of persons tested but 70% of total positive. Persons 20-49 years of ag e had the highest positivity rate and comprised 82% of the total positive persons. Public Health regions that accounted for the great est proportion of persons tested who were positive include those with the same urban counties of highest prevalence: Region 3, (includes Richland County )- 28.1% of total positives tested; Region 2, (includes Greenville/Spartanburg Count y) - 16.2% of total positives; Region 5, (includes Orangeburg County) - 10.8% of total positives; Region 4 (includes Sumter and Florence counties) - 14.3% of total pos itives; Region 6 (includes Ho rry County) - 9.1% of total positives; Region 1 (includes Anderson Count y) - 5.1% of total positives; Region 7, (includes Charleston County)- 9.1% of total positives; and Region 8 (includes Beaufort County) - 4.2% of total positives. Other Behavioral/Risk Data Behavioral Risk Factor Su rveillance System (BRFSS) Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System is the world's largest random telephone survey of non-institutionalized population aged 18 or older that i s u s e d t o t r a c k health risks in the United States. In 1981, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in collaboration with se lected states, initia ted a telephone based behavioral risk factor surveillance system to monitor health risk behaviors. South Carolina began administering BRFSS since 1984. Several core questions address knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behavior s regarding sexually transmitted diseases, particularly AIDS. Results of the 2004 survey suggest most respondents have a fair knowledge of transmission and treatments of HIV/AIDS. Fifty-two percent of respondents said they believed treatments are available to HIV+ women to reduce the chance of transmission to the baby, and 89% believed medical treatments are available to help HIV+ persons live longer. When asked about ever being tested for HIV themselves, only 47% of respondents indicated ever being tested with 67% of those having been tested in the past 4 years. Most respondents who had been tested revealed the main reason for the test was part of a routine check-up or required (51.4%), pregnancy (13.9%), or reasons of personal interest (19.6%). When asked if in the past 12 months if a doctor, nurse, or health professional discussed condom use for preventing Figure 56: Proportion of YRBS Students Indicating Sexual Risks, 1997 - 2007 010203040506070 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007Ever had sex 4+partners Used condoms 87STDs, a majority (85.1%) said this had not occurred. Youth Risk Behavior Survey The Youth Risk Behavior Survey is administ ered to students in public high school in South Carolina. Figure 56 shows that over time there ha ve been slight decreases in the proportion of students who have been sexually active, had four or more lifetime partners, and increases in those reporting cond om use at last sexual intercourse . Substance Use A 1999-2000 household telephone su rvey of 10,324 adults > 18 yrs was conducted by the SC Department of Alcohol and Other Drug Use Services (DAODAS) to assess substance use practices. Results indicat ed that 37% of persons used alcohol during past 30 days, 3% used marijuana, and le ss than 0.5% used cocaine and hallucinogens during past month. General patterns of substance use by pe rsons in the state indi cate that more men than women use drugs/alcohol; higher us e levels are generally among younger respondents (18 - 44 years of age). Summary/Recommendations A review of this epidemiological profile indicates the following primary target populations and recommendations fo r prevention efforts: Men Who Have Sex With Men These data indicate that prevention efforts ta rgeted to men who have sex with men need to be tailored to both African-American a nd white men. African-American men account for over half of both living cases (58%) a nd newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS cases (66%) who report MSM risk. Increased efforts in particular are needed to reach younger African-American MSM <25 years of age; for white men, targeted efforts are needed for those >25 years. Interventions also need to be particularly availabl e for persons living in the more urban areas of the state. Heterosexuals These data indicate that preven tion efforts targeted to high risk heterose xuals need to be tailored to African-American women, pa rticularly young women under age 25, who account for nearly half of both living hete rosexual cases and more recently diagnosed persons in this age group. Efforts also n eed to target African-A merican men and women 25 - 44 years, who account for over three-fourth s of living and more recently diagnosed cases (all ages). Prevention efforts target ing African-American me n and women should also be tailored to reach those 45 years and older. Injecting Drug Users Prevention efforts targeting in jecting drug users need to be tailored to men, primarily African-American men who comprise just unde r half (48%) of recently diagnosed IDU cases, followed by white men. Efforts shoul d target persons older than 25 years and 88those who are predominately in more urban counties including Rich land, Greenville and Charleston as well as Lexington, York, Fl orence, Horry, Orangeburg and Sumter. Question #4: What are the pattern s of service utilization of HIV- infected persons? In 1990, Congress enacted the Ryan White CARE Act to provide funding for states, territories and Eligible Metropolitan Areas to offer medical care and support services for persons living with HIV disease who lack he alth insurance and fi nancial resources for their care. Congress reau thorized the Ryan White CARE Act in 1996 and 2000 to support Titles I through IV, Sp ecial Projects of Nationa l Significance (SPNS), the HIV/AIDS Education Training Centers and th e Dental Reimbursement Program, all of which are part of the CARE Act. The legi slation was reauthorized again in 2006 when it became the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatme nt Modernization Act. With that reauthorization Titles I-IV were changed to Parts A-D. Part B funding is used to assist States a nd Territories in develo ping and/or enhancing access to a comprehensive continuum of hi gh quality, community-based care for low- income individuals and families living with HIV. During 2007, 8,760 clients received services through the Ryan White Part B funds. Figure 57 presents the distribution of Part B client s by race/ethnicity, sex and age N=8,760, %Figure 57: Demographic Characteristics of CARE Act Part B Clients Compared with Characteristics of Persons Living with HIV/AIDS, South Carolina, 2007 89as for those persons living with HIV/AIDS in South Carolina through December 2007. Clients served through Part B are repres entative of the population affected with HIV/AIDS in all categories. HRSA has directed that States should allo cate funds for essentia l core services: 1) Primary Medical Care consistent with Public Health Service (PHS) Treatment Guidelines; 2) HIV Related Medications; 3) Mental Health Treatment; 4) Substance Abuse Treatment; 5) Oral Health; and 6) Case Management. 90 Figure 58 shows a break down of Ryan White Part B clients who received five of the core services through funding and the average number of visits per clients. Utilization of HIV related medications is described in the ADAP section. Among the 8,760 clients who received services, the majority of clients obtained medical case management services (n=6,776) followed by medical care (n=6,470), dental care (n=1035), mental health services (n=660), and substance abuse services (n=547). Of those services utilized mo re by clients (visits/clients), cas e management services were among the highest (6.5 visits pe r clients), followed by medical care (4.8 visits per client), mental health services (2.5 visits per client), dental care services ( 2.2 visits per client) and clients receiving substance abuse care averaged about 2.0 visits in 2007. Additional services obtained by clients in 2007 included treatment adherence, counseling, food bank/home delivered meals, health educati on/risk reduction, referral for health care and supportive services, psychological s upport services, housing assistance and transportation services. AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) The South Carolina AIDS Drug Assistance program (SC ADAP) was established under the Ryan White CARE Act to provide drugs to treat HIV disease and/or to prevent the serious deterioration of health arising from HIV disease in eligible individuals, including measures for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infec tions and document the progress made in making the drugs availabl e. The SC ADAP is operated through a centralized pharmacy and an insurance assist ance program located at the Department of Health and Environmental Cont rol. Currently 67 drugs ar e on the approved formulary. During calendar year 2006, ADAP served 2,887 c lients. The SC ADAP has an advisory body of infectious disease (ID ) physicians and program st aff that meets annually to review the SC ADAP formulary and make r ecommendations for program improvements. In the past, once an antiretroviral me dication received FDA approval, it was automatically added to the SC ADAP formulary. With the new development of extremely expensive therapies, such drugs are added as appropriate after consultation with the SC ADAP Medical Advisory Co mmittee. Fuzeon, pegylated interferon and ribavirin currently require prio r reauthorization for approval. No restrictions or caps on the number of other Antiretroviral me dications per client exist. 6.5 6,776 Case Management2.0 Medical per clientNo. of clients receiving serviceFigure 58: South Carolina Ryan White Part B Service Utilization by Service Type, 2007 91 Eligibility in ADAP includes verified HIV pos itive status, South Ca rolina residency, and limited income. The financial requirement is measured according to the Federal Poverty Guidelines. Eligibility remains at 300% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, and the sliding fee scale includes up to 550% of poverty level. Expenditures are carefully monitored and projections are reviewed monthly. Figure 59 lists the characteristi cs of clients enrolled in the ADAP program during 2006. Clients served through ADAP have a similar di stribution to that of persons living with HIV/AIDS in South Carolina . The majority of the clients are non-Hispanic African- Americans/Black (69%), male (71% ), and in the 25-44 age group. Question#5: What are the number a nd characteristics of persons who know they are HIV+ but who are no t receiving HIV primary medical care? To analyze the number of persons living with HIV/AIDS in South Carolina not \"in care,\" HARS (HIV/AIDS Reporting System) data was used to review all persons diagnosed through December 2007. HARS in South Carolina is a laborat ory based reporting system with all CD4 and viral load tests being reportable as of January 1, 2004. Persons who were deceased as of December 31, 2007 were ex cluded from the analysis. Only current SC residents were included. A person was repor ted as being \"in care\" if they had at least one CD4 or viral load test report fr om January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007. Persons with no CD4 or viral report in this tim e frame were defined as \"not in care\". South Carolina conducted the Interstate D uplication Evaluation Pr oject (IDEP) in 2002 assuring that HARS eliminated dup licate cases across states. Figure 59: 2006 ADAP Patient Profile Compared to Persons 12/31/07: 92 Figure 60 shows that of the 15,465 patients diagnosed through December 2007, 43% (6,656) patients did not receive a CD4 or viral load test report within the specified time period, therefore ar e reported as \"not in care\". Fifty-seven percent are defined as \"in care\". Of the 6,656 clients not in care, 58% are living with HIV-only and 41% are living with AIDS (Figure 61). Figure 62 demonstrates a comparison of persons not in care by select demographics. By gender, the percent of men not in care (71%) is more than double of the percentage of women not in care (29%). Seventy one percent of those not in care are African-Americans. In addition, a comparison by age groups shows that most persons living with HIV/AIDS and not receiving care are between Figure 60: SC HIV/AIDS Cases Estimated Not in Care vs. In Care Diagnosed through 2007 (N=15,465) Not in Care 43% In Care 57% Figure 61: SC HIV/AIDS Cases Estimated NOT In Care Diagnosed through 2007, HIV-only vs. AIDS (N=6,656) HIV-only 58% AIDS 41% Figure 62: SC HIV/AIDS Cases Diagnosed through 2007, Comparison within Select Demographics Estimated Percentage Not In Care 01020304050607080 Female71 292571 41112538 ages who are 50+ (25%) and 20-29 (11%). An analysis by mode of exposure of persons living with HIV/AIDS i ndicates most persons not in care are MSM (42%) and heterosexuals (39%) followed by IDUs (18%) (Figure 63). Figure 64 goes further to compare those in care versus those not in care within each risk category. Among all MSMs living with HIV/AIDS, more persons are in care (58%) than not in care (42%). Focusing on those persons whose mode of exposure was injecting drug use, the number of those in care (53%) is greater than the number out of care (47%). Likewise, among heterosexuals with HIV/AIDS, 63% are in care compared to 37% not in care. The location of a person's residence may have an impact of whether or not they are in care. There are more persons not in care from urban areas (71%) versus rural areas (29%). (Figures 65 and 66).

These measures are consistent with measures selected by stakeholders of all HIV programs in the state. The overarching purpose of the Qu ality Management Plan outlined in the following pages is to improve the quality of ca re for people living with HIV in the state. Through creating an effective and actionable qual ity management plan, and assuming a direct role in support of quality improvement activitie s in the state, particip ants will conceptualize and implement a quality management program , and develop a supporting infrastructure across the defined service area that is consiste nt with legislative requirements and guidance expectations for all Parts of the Ryan Wh ite HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act. Section I: Ryan White Background and History The United States Congress enacted the Ryan White Treatment Modernization Act of 2006 (Ryan White Program) in October 2006 with the goal to improve the qu ality and availability of care for individuals and families infected and affected by HIV disease by providing emergency assistance to regions most severe ly affected by HIV epidemic. Since 2000 the Ryan White legislation has in cluded specific provisions dir ecting grantees to establish, implement and sustain quality management programs, which include monitoring of access to and quality of health services to ensure that PWHIV who are eligible for treatment receive it. A major focus of the Ryan White program is not only to eliminate barriers to accessing care, but also to improve the quality of care that its clients receive. New and significant legislative requirements found in the Reauthorization of 2006 direct grantees to ensure that 1. Service providers adhere to esta blished HIV clinical practices; 2. Quality improvement strategies include support services that help people receive appropriate HIV health care (e.g., transporta tion assistance, case management); and 3. Demographic, clinical, and health care utilization information is used to monitor trends in the spectrum of HIV-related illnesses and the local epidemic. Expectations: Emphasized in the Ryan White Program exp ectations, quality management programs are pivotal in addressing the following key themes: Improve access to and retention in care fo r HIV+ individuals aware of their status Quality of services and related outcomes Linkage of social support se rvices to medical services Ability of the program to change with the epidemic Use of epidemiological and health outcome data for priority setting Accountability (resources, respon sibility, implementation, etc.) 105 Definition of Quality Quality is defined by HRSA's HIV/AIDS Bureau /Division of Service Systems as the degree to which a health or social service meets or exceeds established professional standards and user expectations. In order to continuously improve systems of care for individuals and populations, evaluation of the qua lity of care should consider: 1. The quality of inputs 2. The quality of the service delivery process 3. The quality of outcomes Section II: Quality Statement Central to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control's mission, values, and strategic plan is the goal to im prove access to high quality healthcare. The purpose of the quality management program is to set forth a coordinate d approach to quality assessment and process improvement within the SC Department of Health & Environmental Control (DHEC), STD/HIV Division, and HI V Care & Support Programs. The STD/HIV Division is dedicated to ensuring the highe st quality of HIV medical care and support services for people living with HIV/AIDS in th e state of South Carolina. The mission of the HIV Quality Management Program is to ensure that all people living with HIV/AIDS in South Carolina receive the highest quality of Ryan White funded primary medical care and support services. The key components of the Ryan White Quality Management Program are: Performance and Outcome Measurement Data Analysis and Presentation Identification of Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) strategies Implementation of CQI initiatives Monitoring adherence to the standards of care and perfor mance indicators of the services offered by the agency Coordinating data collection for the ag ency's review by outside organizations Identifying processes and procedures for improvement. 106Section III: Quality Infrastructure A. Leadership and Accountability SC Department of Health & Environmental Control: o Health Services Office of Performance Management : Health Services has designed a Performance Mana gement System that will enable the deputy area to monitor its performance in all asp ects of its operations. Categories for which performance measures have been develope d are Management, Human Resources, Public Health Capacity, Data and Information System s, Customer Focus, Financial Systems and Health Status. All of the indicators are linked to the DHEC Strategic Plan. STD/HIV Division , HIV Care & Support Services, mont hly meetings with division-wide participation including Division Director, Bureau Medical Direct or, Division Medical Director, Program Managers, Surveillance, Supp ort Staff, Nurse, DIS, Health Education, Financial, Planning and Evaluation Consultants. Division staff provides oversight and management of the RW Part B & D grants. Staffs monitor all Ryan White funds and sub-contractor s to ensure that Ryan White funds are the payer of last resort. The Divisi on leadership is dedicated to the quality improvement process and guides the quality management plan. Quality Management Steering Committee: o The Quality Management Steering Committee provides guidance, consultation and input regarding the ove rall Quality Management Program. Membership consists of ten individuals representing Ryan White Part B, C & D programs, Community H ealth Centers, local Health Department, and a Community Based AIDS Service or ganization. Members are also representative of five geographical regi ons (formerly consortia) of the state; Midlands, Catawba, Upstate (Upper Savannah, Piedmont & AID Upstate), Coastal (Low Country (ACCESS), Trident and CARETEAM), and the HopeHealth (Lower Savannah, Tri-County and Pee Dee) Membership include persons living with HIV. o Quality Management Steering Committee members: 1. Share information regarding quality management plans and processes both within organization a nd among network partners 2. Help plan regional meetings as foll ow-up to technical assistance activities to include developing common sets of quality measures among network partners 3. Help with cheerleading/buy-in fo r geographical and HIV and primary care service delivery partners and peers B. Resources SCDHEC, STD/HIV Division Direct or, Infectious Disease Medica l Consultants, HIV Care & Support Service Program Direct or, Part D Coordinator, ADAP Coordinator, Provide Software Consultant, HIV Planning Council, Part B Coordinator, Surveillance Director, HIV 107Surveillance Coordinator, and Quality Mana gement (CQI) Coordinator support the Quality Management Steering Committee. Regional CQI Committees ; o The initial development of a statewide Quality Management program included Regional CQI Committees that were initiated in the five geographical areas (formerly consor tia) of the state Midlands, Catawba, Upstate (Upper Savannah, Piedmont & AID Upstate), Coastal (Low Country (ACCESS), Trident and CARETEAM), and the Hope Health (Lower Savannah, Tri-County and Pee Dee). The Regional CQI Committees were designed to promote communication around QM issues a nd to establish common Quality Improvement goals. After a Quality Mana gement Coordinator was hired it was decided that the groups would be struct ured in a less formal way. In the absence of formal regional groups, th e QM Coordinator will serve as the conduit for regional communication and dissemination of information. Part B/D Providers (DHEC Contractors) Part B/D Providers are responsible for ensuring that quality management components of contracts are met. The FY 2008-2009 contract deliver ables include the following Quality Management language: Develop and implement a Quality Management plan (i.e., a local Quality Management plan) Participate in All Parts Quality Management meetings Provide information related to the local Quality Management program as requested by the STD/HIV Division Section IV: Quality Plan Implementation The Ryan White Quality Management C oordinator has the responsibility of management of the QM program. o The QM Coordinator is responsible for: Establishing content of and scheduling of meetings Research on best practices Quarterly reports on projects and progress Facilitating consumer involvement in quality improvement and program planning Providing instructi on on CQI principles Following up on suggestions by consum ers to improve the care they are receiving Implementation of the QM Plan include s development of a timeframe for re- measurement that will allow for the tracking of deficiencies and ensure quality care. Implementation also includes collection of da ta from all Ryan White providers in a timely and efficient way that will allow fo r data analysis and needs assessment throughout the state. 108Finally, there will be a continued focus on promoting provider adherence to highest priority PHS Guidelines for HIV care. Section V: Mechanisms to Promote Quality Care A. Performance Measurement The Quality Management Steering Committee, using priorities identified by Ryan White funded stakeholders, Health Resources and Services Administration's Office of Performance Review measures for Ryan White Part C & D Program and HIVQUAL selected 18 HIV program quality measures to align Ryan White B, C, and D Programs.

Ryan White Program Data Report (RDR) submitted to QM Coordinator. Review of data for performance me asures will occur annually. State health department staff will coordinate these activities. Data reports will be analyzed. Section VI. Annual Quality Goals A. Overall goals of the Quality Management Program include: A systematic, state-wide process for pl anning, designing, measuring, assessing and improving performance with the following components: a. Develop a planning mechanism incorporating baseline da ta from external and internal sources and input from lead ership, staff and pa tients. Clinical, operational and programmatic aspects of patient care will be reviewed. b. Emphasize design needs associated with new a nd existing services, patient care delivery, work flows and support systems which maximize results and satisfaction on the part of the patients and their families, physicians and staff. c. Evolve and refine measurement systems for identifying trends in care and sentinel events by regularly collecti ng and recording data and observations relating to the provision of patie nt care across the continuum. d. Employ assessment procedures to determine efficacy and appropriateness and to judge how well services are deli vered and whether opportunities for improvement exist. e. Focus on improving quality in all of its dimensions by implementing multidisciplinary, data driven, project teams and encouraging participatory problem solving. f. Promote communication , dialogue and informational exchange across the STD/HIV Division and throughout Regi onal Committees, with regard to findings, analyses, conclusions, reco mmendations, actions and evaluations pertaining to performance improvement. g. Strive to establish co llaborative relationships with diverse stakeholders and community agencies for collectively prom oting the general health and welfare of the community served. 110B. Multidisciplinary Team and Development of Improvement Plan Once an opportunity for improvement has been identified, a multidisciplinary team will be convened to analyze the process and develop improvement plans. These teams will include those staff members closely associated with the process under study. Every attempt will be made to include individuals from other departments who may be impacted by changes made by the team and to help promote collaboration between departments. Continuous Quality Improvement Methodology w ill be utilized and may include, but not be limited to, the following: PDSA Step 1: Plan Plan a change Step 2: Do Try it on a small scale Step 3: Study Observe the results Step 4: Act Refine the changes as necessary Flow Chart Analysis One of the most useful quality improveme nt tools as it depicts the sequence of steps performed in a specific process Cause and Effect Diagrams Diagram enables a team to focus of the content of the problem, not the history of the problem. Brainstorming Establishes a common method for a team to creatively and efficiently generate a high volume of ideas by encouraging people to open thinking. Observational Studies An investigational method involving desc ription of the associations between interventions and outcomes. Activity Logs Tracking of activities to help audit and analyze how time is spent on an activity or throughout the business day; helps eliminate time wasting or low- yield jobs. Quality Committee/Team Meeting Improve ment Plans will be developed and implemented by the teams: Improvements may include: System Redesign Education (Staff, Clients, Stakeholders and Customers) Clinical Guidelines review , revision or development Procedure and policy changes 111Form development or revision C. All improvement plans will be communicated to all appropriate staff and to clients if deemed appropriate. Evaluation The QM program will be evaluated annually to assess quality infrastructure and activities to ensure that the quality program is in line with its overall purpose. Based on those findings, the CQI Teams will refine strategies for the following year. Chart audit results, staff and patient comments, effectiveness of CQI activities, and program goals will be used to evaluate the program. Capacity Building The STD/HIV Division, HIV Care & Support Services received 12 months of technical assistance from the National Quality Center beginning in January 2007. The technical assistance developed the STD/ HIV Division, and the Ryan Wh ite Programs' capacity and quality management infrastructure. A Quality Management Coordinator was hired in March 2008 and she received training for the NQC in May 2008 and continues to develop the necessary skills to manage the QM program for the Division. Additionally, there are 9 stakeholders statewide who have participated in the NQC's Training of the Trainers. Process to Update QM Plan Plan is reviewed and updated annually by consensus by Ryan White staff in consultation with QM Steering Committee. Communication Quality Management Steering Committee meetings, and STD/HIV Division bi- annual face-to-face Statewide All Parts mee tings with stakeholders, and quarterly HIV Planning Council meetings.
