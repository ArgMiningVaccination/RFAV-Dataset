Insomnia and other sleep disorders can affect your health, and while sleep medications can bring on the zzz's, you should not be relying on medications to help you sleep in the long term. Try these techniques to help prepare your body for sleep: Mind-body Therapies - Techniques such as yoga, meditation, tai chi and deep breathing techniques can help you relax and calm your thoughts. These techniques foster a greater mind-body awareness. Natural supplements - Certain natural supplements and herbs can help reduce anxiety and help your body prepare for sleep, with less risk of developing a dependence on using them than if you were to take sleeping pills. Some popular natural sleep aids include melatonin, magnesium, chamomile tea and L-theanine. Try not to take the supplements every day, and only take them when you need extra help falling asleep. Get On A Sleep Schedule - When you stick to a sleep routine, your brain learns these patterns and can better prepare you to fall asleep (kind of like the famous Pavlov's dog experiment). Stick to the same bedtime every day (weekends included) and wake at the same time every day to set your biological clock. Also, develop a routine to help train your brain that it is time for bed: put on pajamas, drink some chamomile tea, read a book and brush your teeth. Your brain will learn these cues and prepare for sleep. \u2014 Weekly Health Tips are brought to you by UCF Health, the [College of Medicine's](http://www.med.ucf.edu) physician practice.
