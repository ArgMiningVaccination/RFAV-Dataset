Jade was thought to protect the kidneys, liver, spleen, and heart; beryl to cure eye injuries, and carnelian to purify the blood and relieve menstrual cramps. Yet the properties assigned to gems in the past tended to be general and ambiguous. No more. Today, gemstone therapy has evolved into an art and science, and a sophisticated energy medicine modality. Gemstone therapy is based on gemstones in spherical form. The primary advantage of spheres over crystals is a sphere's ability to radiate its energies in all directions. The body's energy field is able to moderate how much of this energy it wants and can direct the energy where needed. This is impossible with a crystal, which points its energies in only one direction. Furthermore, when a sphere is cut from a crystal, it captures the finest essence of that crystal, leaving the dross behind. Gemstone therapy began in 1987 when Isabelle Morton researched the missions and essential effects of gemstone spheres by intuitively communicating with the devas, or guardians, of individual healing stones. Back then, gemstone therapy was limited to wearing therapeutic-quality gemstone sphere necklaces to support physical and life issues, plus concerns that involve emotions, memory, and mind. A few techniques for placing necklaces on the body over ailing organs were also taught. Today, many new applications for therapeutic gemstone necklaces are available, including special techniques for applying them in the aura. Gemstone therapy has also expanded into two more branches: single sphere applications and gem formulas, which are homeopathic-like remedies made from the energies of gemstones. gem formulas are the next generation of gemstone elixirs. They are imprinted with the energies of therapeutic gemstones that have been arranged to produce energy fields with unique purposes. These two new branches make gemstone therapy more affordable and offer the layperson a great deal of versatility for self-therapy. This is what makes gemstone therapy stand out among other energy medicine modalities, which rely on hands-on applications. With gemstone therapy, the gems do the work. [Gemstone energies work throughout your body and aura. They are also adaptogenic in that your body's energy field can direct gemstone energies wherever they are needed, and in whatever quantities are required. Gemstone energies have a normalizing effect on the emotions, mind, and body, including all physiological systems. Because gemstones work energetically, they can be used safely along with any other natural or allopathic medicines. In addition, they are ideal self-therapy tools, which allow individuals to take an active role in self-care, and more direct responsibility for improving their health.](https://www.lillypadvillage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gemstones.jpg) Affordable self-therapy involves using single gemstone spheres. Single spheres can be used in a variety of ways, such as placement on acupoints and special energetic \"windows\" of organs and tissues. Spheres can also be arranged into patterns or small mandalas, called \"mini-gemandalas,\" which are supported by a disk of beeswax attached to a therapy rod and applied in the aura. Mini-gemandalas can address a wide variety of health concerns. Each gemstone provides its unique benefits, plus you get the added support from the numerology and geometry you use when you make the gemandala. Even with a relatively small collection of single spheres, you can make a nearly unlimited number of gemstone configurations-each tailored to your unique energetic needs at the moment the treatment is applied. Instructions for how to do self-therapy using mini-gemandalas can be viewed on the Gemstone Therapy Institute certification series DVD #1 \"Mini-Gemandalas for Self-Therapy\" available from GEMFormulas, LLC. The Gemstone Therapy Institute offers Gemstone Therapy Practitioner certification to students who complete the three-part training. A trained gemstone therapist can also use gems to diagnose the energetic picture of an illness; address the energetic patterns and accumulations that underlie disharmony; correct chakra and aura anomalies; loosen limiting patterns of emotions, habit, and belief; unwind the energies that hold life issues in a negative rut; directly address local and systemic conditions, as well as bring ease to emotional, karmic, and thought-based disharmony; and more. Gemstone therapy offers something for everyone: from the layperson who wants meaningful self-therapy to the health care practitioner looking for effective ways to add energy medicine to their practice.
