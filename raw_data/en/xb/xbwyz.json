Aluminium hydroxide is [amphoteric](/wiki/Amphoterism), i.e., it has both [basic](/wiki/Base_(chemistry)) and [acidic](/wiki/Acid_(chemistry)) properties. Closely related are and [aluminium oxide](/wiki/Aluminium_oxide) or alumina (Al2O3), the latter of which is also amphoteric. These compounds together are the major components of the aluminium [ore](/wiki/Ore) [bauxite](/wiki/Bauxite). Aluminium hydroxide also forms a gelatinous precipitate in water. Structure[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Aluminium_hydroxide&action=edit\u00a7ion=1)] Al(OH)3 is built up of double layers of hydroxyl groups with aluminium ions occupying two-thirds of the octahedral holes between the two layers. [[5]](#cite_note-5) [[6]](#cite_note-properties-6) Four [polymorphs](/wiki/Polymorphism_(materials_science)) are recognized. [[7]](#cite_note-Karamalidis-7) All feature layers of [octahedral](/wiki/Octahedron) aluminium hydroxide units, with [hydrogen bonds](/wiki/Hydrogen_bond) between the layers. The polymorphs differ in terms of the stacking of the layers. All forms of Al(OH)3 crystals are hexagonal[ to be aluminium an [aluminium phosphate](/wiki/Aluminium_phosphate). Nonetheless, both gibbsite and hydrargillite refer to the same polymorphism of aluminium hydroxide, with gibbsite used most commonly in the United States and hydrargillite used more often in Europe. Hydrargillite is named after the [Greek](/wiki/Greek_language) words for water (hydra) and clay (argylles). Properties[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Aluminium_hydroxide&action=edit\u00a7ion=2)] Aluminium hydroxide is [amphoteric](/wiki/Amphoteric). In [acid](/wiki/Acid), it acts as a [Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry base](/wiki/Br%C3%B8nsted%E2%80%93Lowry_base). It neutralizes the acid, yielding a salt: [[9]](#cite_note-:0-9) - 3 HCl + Al(OH)3 AlCl3 + 3 H2O In bases, it as [Lewis acid](/wiki/Lewis_acids_and_bases) by Production[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Aluminium_hydroxide&action=edit\u00a7ion=3)] Virtually all the aluminium hydroxide used commercially is manufactured by the [Bayer process](/wiki/Bayer_process) [[10]](#cite_note-10) which involves dissolving [bauxite](/wiki/Bauxite) in sodium hydroxide at temperatures up to 270 \u00b0C (518 \u00b0F). The waste solid, [bauxite tailings](/wiki/Bauxite_tailings), is removed and aluminium hydroxide is precipitated from the remaining solution of [sodium aluminate](/wiki/Sodium_aluminate). This aluminium hydroxide can be converted to [aluminium or alumina by [calcination](/wiki/Calcination). The residue or [bauxite tailings](/wiki/Bauxite_tailings), which is mostly iron oxide, is highly caustic due to residual sodium hydroxide. It was historically stored in lagoons; this led to the [Ajka alumina plant accident](/wiki/Ajka_alumina_plant_accident) in 2010 in Hungary, where a dam bursting led to the drowning of nine people. An additional 122 sought treatment for chemical burns. The mud contaminated 40 square kilometres (15 sq mi) of land and reached the [Danube](/wiki/Danube). While the mud was considered non-toxic due to low levels of heavy metals, the associated slurry had a pH of 13. [[11]](#cite_note-11) Uses[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Aluminium_hydroxide&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] Fire retardant filler[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Aluminium_hydroxide&action=edit\u00a7ion=5)] Aluminium hydroxide also finds use as a fire retardant filler for polymer applications. It is selected for these applications because it is colorless (like most polymers), inexpensive, and has good fire retardant properties. [[12]](#cite_note-Ullmann-12) [Magnesium hydroxide](/wiki/Magnesium_hydroxide) and mixtures at about 180 \u00b0C (356 \u00b0F), absorbing a considerable amount of heat in the process and giving off water vapour. In addition to behaving as a fire retardant, it is very effective as a smoke suppressant in a wide range of polymers, most [edit](/w/index.php?title=Aluminium_hydroxide&action=edit\u00a7ion=6)] Aluminium hydroxide is a [feedstock](/wiki/Feedstock) for aluminium hydroxide forms [gels](/wiki/Gel), which are the basis for the application of aluminium salts as [flocculants](/wiki/Flocculation) in water purification. This gel crystallizes with time. Aluminium hydroxide gels can be dehydrated (e.g. using water-miscible non-aqueous solvents like [ethanol](/wiki/Ethanol)) to form an amorphous aluminium hydroxide powder, which is readily soluble in acids. Heating converts it to activated aluminas, which are used as [desiccants](/wiki/Desiccant), [adsorbent](/wiki/Adsorbent) in gas purification, and [catalyst supports](/wiki/Catalyst_support). Under the generic name \"algeldrate\", aluminium hydroxide is used as an [antacid](/wiki/Antacid) in humans and animals (mainly cats and dogs). It is preferred over other alternatives such as [sodium bicarbonate](/wiki/Sodium_bicarbonate) because Al(OH)3, being insoluble, does not increase the pH of stomach above 7 and hence, does not trigger secretion of excess acid by the stomach. Brand names include Alu-Cap, Aludrox, Gaviscon or Pepsamar. It reacts with excess acid in the stomach, reducing the acidity of the stomach content, [[19]](#cite_note-19) [[20]](#cite_note-papich-20) which may relieve the symptoms of [ulcers](/wiki/Peptic_ulcer), [heartburn](/wiki/Heartburn) or [dyspepsia](/wiki/Dyspepsia). Such products can cause [constipation](/wiki/Constipation), because the aluminium ions inhibit the contractions of [smooth muscle](/wiki/Smooth_muscle) cells in the gastrointestinal tract, slowing [peristalsis](/wiki/Peristalsis) and lengthening the time needed for stool to pass through the [colon](/wiki/Large_intestine). [[21]](#cite_note-Washington1991-21) Some such products are formulated to minimize such effects through the inclusion of equal concentrations of [magnesium hydroxide](/wiki/Magnesium_hydroxide) or [magnesium carbonate](/wiki/Magnesium_carbonate), which have counterbalancing [laxative](/wiki/Laxative) effects. [[22]](#cite_note-22) This compound is also used to control [hyperphosphatemia](/wiki/Hyperphosphatemia) (elevated [phosphate](/wiki/Phosphate), or phosphorus, levels in the blood) in people and animals suffering from kidney failure. Normally, the kidneys filter excess phosphate out from the blood, but kidney failure can cause phosphate to accumulate. The aluminium salt, when ingested, binds to phosphate in the [intestines](/wiki/Intestine) and reduce the amount of phosphorus that can be absorbed. [[23]](#cite_note-plumb-23) [[24]](#cite_note-24) [Precipitated](/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)) aluminium hydroxide is included as an [adjuvant](/wiki/Adjuvant) some [vaccines](/wiki/Vaccine) (e.g. [anthrax vaccine](/wiki/Anthrax_vaccine)). One of the well-known brands of needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#What_information_to_include)][ [dead link](/wiki/Wikipedia:Link_rot)] Since it absorbs protein well, it also functions to stabilize vaccines by preventing the proteins in the vaccine from precipitating or sticking to the walls of the container during storage. Aluminium hydroxide is sometimes called \" [alum](/wiki/Alum)\", a term generally reserved for one of several sulfates.[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] Vaccine formulations containing aluminium hydroxide stimulate the [immune system](/wiki/Immune_system) by inducing the release of [uric acid](/wiki/Uric_acid), an immunological [danger](/wiki/Polly_Matzinger#The_danger_model) signal. This strongly attracts certain types of [monocytes](/wiki/Monocytes) which differentiate into [dendritic cells](/wiki/Dendritic_cells). The dendritic cells pick up the antigen, carry it to [lymph nodes](/wiki/Lymph_nodes), and stimulate [T cells](/wiki/T_cells) and [B cells](/wiki/B_cells). [[26]](#cite_note-26) appears to contribute to induction of a good [Th2](/wiki/T_helper_cell#Th1.2FTh2_model) response, so is useful for immunizing against pathogens that are blocked by antibodies. However, it has little capacity to stimulate cellular (Th1) immune responses, important for protection against many pathogens, [[27]](#cite_note-27) nor is it useful when the antigen is [peptide](/wiki/Peptide)-based. [[28]](#cite_note-Cranage-28) Safety[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Aluminium_hydroxide&action=edit\u00a7ion=8)] In the 1960s and 1970s it was speculated that aluminium was related to various [neurological disorders](/wiki/Neurological_disorder), including [Alzheimer's disease](/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease). [[29]](#cite_note-ALZ-29) [[30]](#cite_note-AS-30) Since then, multiple [epidemiological](/wiki/Epidemiology) studies have found no connection between exposure to environmental or swallowed aluminium and neurological disorders, though injected aluminium was not looked at in these studies. [[31]](#cite_note-31) [[32]](#cite_note-32) [[33]](#cite_note-33) Neural disorders were found in experiments on mice motivated by [Gulf War illness](/wiki/Gulf_War_illness) (GWI). Aluminium hydroxide injected in doses equivalent to those administered to the United States military, showed increased reactive astrocytes, increased [apoptosis](/wiki/Apoptosis) of motor neurons and [microglial](/wiki/Microglia) proliferation point: Gayer, K.
