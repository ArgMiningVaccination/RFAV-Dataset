{"title": "Ear Candling", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "Chinese Ear Candling is a safe, effective, and painless procedure used to remove earwax, pollen, sinus congestion, ringing of the ears, ear infection, headaches, migraines, and hearing problems. The movement of smoke through the delicate ear canal may also obtain pressure relief. What To Expect During An Ear Candling Session: Your therapist will instruct you to lie on your Side with your body using a straight alignment. They will then massage a special oil containing garlic and natural herbs into the ear. The therapist will gently insert a hollow linen candle into the ear canal, lighting the opposite end. We use only the highest quality beeswax candles, typically nine to twelve inches long. The candle creates a vacuum that draws built-up earwax and fungus into the bottom part of the candle. After extinguishing the candle, the therapist will cut open the remnant and show you the contents. Most people cannot believe the remaining contents extracted from the ear canal. If you have a hearing loss, you may feel a little heat during your session. Many people have reported an improvement in their hearing after just one session. The entire process takes 30 to 40 minutes. Ear candling can be repeated every 48 hours, and healthy ear maintenance with 3 to 4 yearly visits.", "sitename": null, "date": "2018-01-01", "cleaned_text": "Chinese Ear Candling is a safe, effective, and painless procedure used to remove earwax, pollen, sinus congestion, ringing of the ears, ear infection, headaches, migraines, and hearing problems.
