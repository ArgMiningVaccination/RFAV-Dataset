Naturopathic Medicine combines natural, non-toxic therapies with current advances in health and medicine. Naturopathic Physicians (ND's) are the only practitioners trained in both traditional healing arts and modern medical science. ND's are licensed as primary care physicians in the state of Oregon. Naturopathic Physicians are trained in a broad scope of therapies including nutrition, counseling, lifestyle coaching, herbal medicine, exercise therapeutics, vitamins and minerals, flower essences, homeopathy and prescription medications.
