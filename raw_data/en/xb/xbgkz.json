Chi may be to blame for your fatigue, brain fog, or irritability. \"Chi is the energy current that runs through our bodies, providing us with circulation, nutrients, and minerals that we need to be whole,\" says Taz Bhatia, MD, integrative health expert, founder of MD](https://centrespringmd.com/), author of [Super Woman Rx](https://www.amazon.com/Super-Woman-Rx-Secrets-Lasting/dp/1623368588). \"In [Traditional Chinese Medicine](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/chinesemed.htm), chi was thought to be the life force and ultimate measure of one's vitality.\" The ancient art\u2014which has been well-vetted and considered safe practice by the [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/chinesemed.htm)\u2014has been used by doctors of integrative medicine and acupuncturists to restore the body to its natural, healthy state, and to help people generally achieve a state of zen. Is it chi or qi? Both terms have been used to describe this undercurrent force and while they are technically interchangeable, they vary slightly based on its cultural origin. \"[It's called] qi in Chinese medicine or prana in ayurvedic, yogic tradition,\" says Annie McDonnell, LAc, York's Alchemy Acupuncture](https://www.joyalchemyhealing.com/). According to the [Acupuncture and Massage College](https://www.amcollege.edu/blog/qi-in-traditional-chinese-medicine) in Miami, Florida, it's best to use qi in the context of restoring balance since that is the \"physical or nourishing portion that makes up the air, water, and food we take in,\" whereas chi refers to the \"vital fluids and the energy itself that flows through our bodies.\" Regardless, both have to do with working towards feeling a little better day to day. So why, exactly, is qi critical to health? The answer is simple. It's what \"courses through the body along meridians, and it also controls the movement of blood,\" says Jason Wells, ND, LAc, a naturopathic physician and acupuncturist at [Reconstructed Wellness](https://www.reconstructedwellness.com/) in Portland, Oregon. \"The proper movement of both qi and blood through the body creates health and harmony in the human being,\" Wells says. \"The Chinese viewed qi as both an essential energy unit that could be obtained from food, but also a gas or pressure that promotes movement in the body.\" How do you know when your qi is out of balance? Qi\u2014or, once again, chi\u2014deficiencies can be caused by a lack of sleep, food, shelter, clean water, fresh air, and other physical elements the human body needs to properly function. An imbalance can also be caused by insufficient mental stimulation, love, and social interaction, according to Reshma Patel, PA-C, MMS, founder and CEO of [Ananda Integrative Medicine](https://anandaintegrativemedicine.com/) in Los Angeles. If your qi is out of whack, symptoms include fatigue, irritability, hormone imbalance, pain, muscle weakness, depression, cramping, and stress, according to both Taz and Wells. She says it's also possible to have excess qi as a result of environmental toxins like polluted air or waiter, or from too much physical activity, stress, negative emotion, or overeating. What's the right way to balance qi? Luckily, there are ways of getting a little more centered. Patel recommends trying mind-body techniques and practices such as tai chi, qigong, yoga, meditation, reiki, or a massage. The best thing you can do, Patel says, is to prioritize sleep to avoid getting tired. Wells also suggests taking on acupuncture, or hobbies that encourage movement, stretching, and blood flow throughout the body\u2014which can be particularly helpful for injured patients. He also recommends paying closer attention to the causes of your imbalance, not just treating the symptoms. He points out that qi deficiency often results in a lack of nutrients, and that it's essential to limit processed foods that can hinder absorption in the gut. Specifically, Wells recommends incorporating stews and broth into your diet. Ultimately, the greatest takeway is to take it easy a little more often. \"We balance qi by resting,\" Taz says, emphasizing the importance of lowering stress by adding exposure to the sun and water. \"Rest and recovery are essential to restoring the body.\" Next time someone pokes fun at you for your daily afternoon nap, simply tell them you're doing it for your qi.
