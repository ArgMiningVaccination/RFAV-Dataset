Food challenges begin when cancer, side effects, and appetite changes affect the patient's ability to eat or maintain proper nutrition. Favorite foods or go-to beverages may not be the best choices for the patient. Perceptions about what is healthy to eat and what isn't healthy to eat can also be an issue. It is important for the caregiver to be supportive (but tactful) and help the patient to make good food choices. Caregiver's Role in Nutrition. Food and food choices may be a touchy subject for your loved one. Food choices are one of the few things over which a cancer patient has control. At times, your loved one may be resistant to eating. Try to encourage your loved one to eat but don't be too forceful. Cancer treatment is an emotionally challenging time. Don't let disagreements over food turn into full-blown fights or arguments. Reach out to the healthcare team for support and resources. Many different considerations influence a cancer patient's food choices\u2014health, treatment, nutrition guidelines and social factors. For example, even though a patient may understand that healthy foods promote healing, if the patient feels nauseated after chemotherapy, they may not want to eat. A patient who cannot tolerate alcohol may feel social pressure to drink when out with friends. These are examples that show how different factors impact food choices. Food provides valuable nutrients for cancer patients. Eating well during cancer treatment helps to speed recovery, ease side effects, and keep the treatment plan running smoothly. However, your loved one may not be able to plan grocery lists, grocery shop, eat, digest foods or prepare meals as they did before the onset of their illness. This is where you, as the caregiver, can help. Depending on the health of your loved one, you may need to assist with: {Grocery shopping {Meal preparation and cooking {Encouraging the patient to make healthy food choices {Managing the patient's treatment side effects To get started, ask the appropriate member of the healthcare team about specific foods or meal recommendations and restrictions, if any. A printed meal plan or food list is often the best approach to nutrition planning. Ask for a referral to a registered dietitian for additional help.Nutrition advice is everywhere, but it's not all good information. Be cautious of nutrition advice that you find online, in magazines or advertisements and that you get from well-meaning family and friends. To get nutrition information from a reliable source, talk to a registered dietitian.TIP:WOULD YOU LIKE TO SPEAK ONE-ON-ONE WITH A REGISTERED DIETITIAN?

Your loved one can follow guidelines for proper nutrition. Nutrition Guidelines. The following list offers helpful suggestions to make good food choices. Select a variety of fruits and vegetables every day. Fruits and vegetables offer the body important nutrients. Choose a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables to get the greatest benefit. Encourage your loved one to eat a minimum of five servings of fruits and vegetables daily. Choose protein-rich foods. Protein helps the body to repair cells and tissues. It also helps the immune system to recover from illness. Include a source of lean protein at all meals and as snacks. Good sources of lean protein include: {Lean meats, such as chicken, fish, or turkey {Eggs {Low-fat dairy products, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese or dairy substitutes {Nuts and nut butters {Beans {Soy foods Add whole grains. Whole grains provide a good source of carbohydrates and fiber which help keep energy levels up. Good sources of whole grains include: {Oatmeal {Whole-wheat breads {Brown rice {Whole-grain pastas include: {Olive oil/canola oil {Avocados {Nuts {Seeds Limit sweets and added sugars. Foods high in added sugars, such as desserts and sweets, provide little nutritional benefit and often take the place of other foods that provide more nutrition for the patient. Stay hydrated. Drinking enough fluids during cancer treatment is important for preventing dehydration. A good starting goal is to drink 64 ounces of fluid daily. Your loved one's fluid goal may be different so ask for guidance from the healthcare team. Your loved one should avoid drinking large amounts of caffeinated beverages. Too much caffeine can lead to dehydration. Check with the healthcare team before the patient takes any vitamins or supplements. Some medications and cancer treatments may interact with vitamins and supplements. Choose food as the main source for nutrients. If the patient already takes supplements, give the healthcare team a list of them. Drink alcohol in moderation , if at all . Alcohol may contribute to dehydration. It can lower the abilities of the immune system, and provides no beneficial nutrients. To learn more about nutrition, visit www.LLS.org/booklets to view Nutrition Handbook: Feeding Your Family from Meal Planning to Mealtime.In this section, the food guidelines recommended for the patient also apply to people without a cancer diagnosis. Proper nutrition can provide more energy and reduce the risk for diseases, such as heart disease and cancer. Don't sacrifice your own well- being. Take care of yourself by making good food choices, too! TIP:NUTRITION l 3Malnutrition. Malnutrition is a serious concern for many cancer patients. A person who is not receiving or absorbing proper nutrition and the right amount of calories or nutrients needed for healthy bodily function, will become malnourished. Cancer patients who are malnourished are at greater risk for health complications, hospitalization, infections, loss of muscle strength and poor quality of life. To decrease the risk of malnutrition, your loved one should try to avoid losing weight during treatment unless advised to do so by the healthcare team. Strict dieting is not recommended during cancer treatment. Losing weight can lower the patient's energy level and decrease the body's ability to fight infection. As much as possible, the patient should aim to maintain a stable weight during treatment. Even with these serious risks, nutrition problems may be overlooked by the patient and the healthcare team. As a caregiver, you can help watch for the signs and/or symptoms of malnutrition. They include: {Unintentional weight loss {Loss of appetite {Changes in food intake {Side effects that make eating difficult for the patient Take this short quiz to see if your loved one may be at risk for malnutrition. Check either Yes or No for each question. NUTRITION STATUS YES NO Has the patient lost 5 to 10 lbs or more without trying in the last 3 months? Is the patient eating less due to decreased appetite? Has the patient's food intake changed? Do side effects make it difficult for the patient to eat (eg, nausea, taste changes, sore mouth, trouble swallowing, diarrhea, constipation, dental issues)? Does the patient no longer enjoy meal-times as much as they did before the onset of cancer? If you checked \"Yes\" in answer to one or more of the questions above, alert the healthcare team. Your loved one may be at risk for malnutrition. If your loved one is unable to eat enough food or drink enough fluids by mouth for proper nutrition, they may need nutrition therapy. This means that nutrition is either given via a feeding tube or intravenously (total parenteral nutrition [TPN]). If your loved one needs a feeding tube, members of the healthcare team will teach you how to care for the tube, administer nutrition, and closely monitor weight loss. Food Safety. The immune system is weakened during cancer treatment. It is important to pay special attention to food safety during cancer treatment to reduce your loved one's risk of being exposed to potentially harmful bacteria from spoiled or undercooked foods. Food Safety Guidelines. The following tips can reduce the risk of foodborne illness: Keep everything clean. {Wash your hands often and thoroughly, especially before and after handling any food. Be sure to wash your hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds. Pay special attention to fingernails and the backs of the hands. Encourage your loved one to do the same.4 l www.LLS.org/CaregiverWorkbook {Keep raw and cooked foods separate. Do not reuse any utensils, cutting boards, plates or dishes once they have been touched by raw meat or eggs. Utensils, cutting boards, plates and dishes, that have been used for preparing raw meats or eggs should be washed in hot, soapy water. It is best to keep one cutting board for meat and another for fruits/vegetables. Have additional clean cutting boards available for other food preparation as well. {Disinfect all food preparation surfaces, including sinks and countertops, both before and after cooking. {Wash all fruits and vegetables under clean, running water before eating, peeling or cooking. You may choose to use a produce brush. Cook food thoroughly. {Avoid raw foods, such as sushi, undercooked eggs, and meats that have not been cooked to a proper internal temperature. {Cook all eggs until both the white and the yolk are firm. Avoid foods that may contain raw eggs, such as raw cookie dough and homemade mayonnaise. {Use a meat thermometer to make sure that all meats are cooked to the proper internal temperature before they are eaten. Use the chart below for reference. Food Type Internal Temperature ( \u00baF) Ground meat and meat mixturesBeef, pork, veal, lamb 160\u00baF Turkey, chicken 165\u00baF Fresh beef, veal, lambSteaks, roasts, chops Rest time: 3 minutes145\u00baF PoultryAll poultry (breasts, whole bird, legs, thighs, wings, ground poultry, giblets, and stuffing)165\u00baF Pork and hamFresh pork, including fresh ham time: minutes145\u00baF Precooked ham (to reheat) Note: Reheat cooked hams packaged in United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)-inspected plants to 140\u00baF165\u00baF Eggs and egg dishesEggsCook until yolk and white are firm Egg dishes (such as frittata, quiche) 160\u00baF Leftovers and casseroles Leftovers and casseroles with fins145\u00baF or cook until flesh is opaque and separates easily with a fork Shrimp, lobster, crab, and scallopsCook until flesh is pearly or white, and opaque.

In addition to undercooked meat, these foods include: {Unpasteurized beverages, such as unpasteurized juice or raw milk {Soft mold-ripened and blue-veined cheeses, such as Brie, Camembert, Roquefort, and blue or other {Raw sprouts, such as alfalfa sprouts {Well water, unless tested, that is either filtered or has been boiled for 1 minute before drinking or has been boiled for 3 minutes before drinking in altitudes of about 2,000 meters (about 6,562 feet). {Unwashed fruits and vegetables Store food safely. {Always store food as soon as possible or within 1 hour of either purchasing or cooking it. {Label food (use a marker or pen) with a \"use by\" date if the packaging does not have an expiration date. {Put foods with the closest expiration date at the front of the fridge or shelves so that you are more likely to use them. {Discard leftovers or open packages within 1 to 4 days. If you are unsure if something is safe to eat, remember, when in doubt, throw it out. Be careful when eating at restaurants and shopping for food. {Buy only from trusted vendors with high grades in health department inspections. {Avoid buying food from street vendors. {Do not eat free food samples when shopping. {Do not choose restaurants with buffets when eating out. If you are at a party, ask if your loved one can go through the buffet line first. {At restaurants, ask for meat to be prepared well done. {If taking home leftovers, ask to bag the food yourself and make sure to refrigerate the leftovers quickly. What Should You Do if You Suspect a Foodborne Illness? You or your loved one may get a foodborne illness, so have a plan in place. Alert the healthcare team as soon as possible. Signs and/or symptoms of foodborne illness include fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and/or stomach cramps. Mark any recently eaten food or beverage as \"do not eat.\" Keep the containers in the fridge in case the healthcare team wants to test any of the potentially contaminated foods. Neutropenia and Diet. Neutropenia is a condition characterized by a lower-than-normal number of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell). If the patient has neutropenia, the doctor may recommend special food guidelines for immunosuppressed patients. The guidelines will spell out ways to protect the patient from bacteria and other harmful organisms found in some food and drinks. If the patient has had a stem cell transplantation, their diet restrictions may be stricter than those of a patient who has had chemotherapy or radiation therapy and no transplant. Members of your healthcare team may refer to these guidelines as a \"neutropenic diet\" or you may have encountered the term yourself. This diet was supposed to help individuals with neutropenia to learn how to decrease exposure to bacteria and other harmful organisms found in some foods; however, a universally accepted definition of what foods should be included or excluded was never developed. In a review of studies, the neutropenic diet was never proven to decrease exposure to bacteria in foods. This diet does not seem to benefit patients in any way. Safe preparation and handling of foods is more important than restricting 6 l www.LLS.org/CaregiverWorkbook the intake of specific food groups because a balanced diet and optimal nutrition are the most significant concern for patients who are coping with chemotherapy and other treatments. Food guidelines for immunosuppressed patients vary among cancer centers. Ask members of your loved one's healthcare team for any special instructions. Managing Side Effects with Nutrition. Cancer patients often experience side effects due to cancer and cancer treatments. Side effects can be either short term or long term. Some side effects happen during treatment. Others can occur after treatment ends. The type and severity of side effects will depend on the specific treatment plan and the patient's overall health. Many side effects of cancer treatment are nutrition-related such as nausea, diarrhea, constipation, decreased appetite and fatigue. These side effects can make eating and drinking enough difficult. There are many ways to help manage treatment side effects\u2014lifestyle changes, nutrition, exercise, and medication. As a caregiver, there are many ways in which you can help your loved one to manage side effects. Continue reading for advice on developing some general strategies and suggestions for managing a wide range of side effects. Lifestyle Changes to Manage Side Effects . Making adjustments to your loved one's daily habits can make the side effects of treatment more manageable and improve quality of life. Use the following suggestions to help manage side effects: Keep a log and track side effects so you can detect patterns that may be contributing to side effects. {By tracking your loved one's daily food intake, side effects, timing and well-being, you may be able to determine foods or behaviors that make side effects worse or you may be able to help your loved one feel better. For example, {Does a large breakfast keep your loved one energized throughout the day? {Is a certain food causing your loved one to experience gas or diarrhea? {Does skipping lunch make your loved one feel nauseated later in the day? {Once you have figured out what makes your loved one's side effects better or worse, you can adjust accordingly. {You can also share the log with the healthcare team. This way, the healthcare team can determine if your loved one needs medication or if a change in dosage will help to ameliorate the side effects. Use Worksheet 13: Food Intake and Side-Effect Log. LLS Health Manger App. With LLS Health Manger, you can now use your phone to manage your loved one's daily health by tracking side effects, medication, food and hydration, questions for the doctor, grocery lists and more. You can also set up reminders to take medications and to eat/drink throughout the day. Visit www.LLS.org/HealthManager to download. Ask the healthcare team the following questions about side effects: What side effects are common with this treatment? Can you provide a printed list? What can be done to prevent side effects? Whom should I call if the patient begins to experience a side effect? Which side effects, signs and/or symptoms require a trip to the emergency room?Questions to Ask Members of the Healthcare Team Record the answers to the last two questions in your Worksheet 1: Emergency Room (ER) Plan.NUTRITION l 7Encourage your loved one to remain active. {Exercise can help relieve many of the side effects related to cancer treatment. Exercise can help with digestive problems, pain management, maintaining muscle mass and improving sleep patterns. It may sound counterintuitive, but exercise can also increase the patient's energy levels. Exercise does not need to be strenuous. Even a walk around the block can help. {Check with the healthcare team before your loved one begins a new exercise regimen. Encourage your loved one to practice good dental and mouth care. {A sore mouth, mouth sores and dry mouth are all possible side effects of cancer treatment. Proper oral care helps to manage these symptoms and prevent secondary issues, such as tooth decay. {For a sore mouth, ask the doctor about special mouthwashes and sprays that can numb the mouth and throat if the discomfort persists. {For a dry mouth, ask the doctor about artificial saliva products, such as rinses and mints that can be purchased over the counter. {Tell the healthcare team if your loved one's gums are bleeding or if your loved one has white patches in the mouth. Both can be signs of infection. Suggest that your loved one wear loose clothing to lessen pain with digestion or nausea. {Clothing that fits tightly around the midsection may aggravate digestive issues and make nausea worse. Avoid strong smells or odors in the home. {Strong odors may trigger nausea in some patients. Avoid using air fresheners, scented candles, perfume or scented cleaning supplies in your loved one's home. To find more tips and strategies, by specific side effect, visit www.pearlpoint.org/SideEffects or www.LLS.org/booklets (filter by Side Effect Management). Food Preparation Tips to Manage Side Effects. Fatigue, sensitivity to odors, and other side effects may make food preparation difficult for your loved one. As a caregiver, assisting with changes to food choices and food preparation can be a good way to help your loved one manage side effects. Here are some tips to make food preparation easier and help your loved one to manage some of the side effects of treatment. Prepare small, frequent meals throughout the day. {Your loved one may not have much of an appetite. Eating frequent small meals will help ensure the patient's body is getting enough calories, protein and nutrients so they can tolerate treatment. {Serving small meals frequently throughout the day allows for better digestion, fewer stomach upsets, and more energy. {Use smaller plates and cups to help control portion size. {Your loved one should aim to eat five to six small meals a day or about every 3 hours throughout the day. Ask for requests. {If you (as a caregiver) are preparing a meal, check with your loved one to see what kinds of food and drink sound good.8 l www.LLS.org/CaregiverWorkbook Remember to respect your loved one's independence. If they are able to prepare food and enjoy cooking, let them do so. Offer to assist by chopping veggies or cleaning up after dinner instead.TIP: {Try asking your loved one, \"What can you eat for lunch today to build up your strength?\" instead of \"What do you want to eat?\" {Try to avoid serving the same thing every day, unless your loved one requests it. Use healthy cooking methods. {Prepare food by baking, slow-cooking, grilling, or broiling to limit fat. Fats, especially from fried and greasy foods, can make some digestive issues worse. {If your loved one needs to gain weight or stop losing weight, add healthy fats, such as olive oil, avocados and nuts, to your loved one's food to add extra calories. Eliminate problem foods. {Certain foods may make your loved one's side effects worse and these foods can differ from patient to patient. If a certain food item isn't well tolerated, remember to eliminate that food from meals in the future. {Foods your loved one may have enjoyed before treatment may cause issues now. For example, some cancer patients experience lactose intolerance as a side effect of treatment. {You can determine which foods may be \"problem foods\" for your loved one by tracking food intake and side effects daily. Check the spices to combat changes in taste. {Changes in taste and smell are common side effects of cancer treatment. {Check in with your loved one. You may need to adjust or change spices to adapt to changing tastes. {If your loved one complains of a metallic taste, switch to plastic utensils and plates. Keep aromas to a minimum. {Sensitivity to smells or odors is another side effect of cancer treatment. If odor is an issue, cook while the patient is out of the house or asleep. {Use fans to move food aromas and cooking smells out of the kitchen and house. {A small personal fan at the dinner table may help. {Prepare cold meals like sandwiches, fruit and cheese plates, crackers with peanut butter and celery, and smoothies. {Use cups with lids and straws. Plan meals in advance. {Friends and family members may want to help prepare meals. Keep a list on the refrigerator of who is bringing what and when. {Label prepared foods with an \"eat-by\" date. {You can also use online resources to help with meal planning and coordination. Use an app or an online site to coordinate delivery of meals from friends and family. {Take Them meals in advance.NUTRITION l 9Sip liquids between meals. {Staying hydrated is important, so encourage your loved one to sip liquids between meals, but to stop drinking 30 minutes before a meal or snack to build an appetite. {Drinking too much at a meal, especially low-calorie beverages, can replace vital nutrient-dense foods, such as meat, vegetables and fruits. Limit drinks with meals so that solid foods with more calories and nutrients can be consumed. Add iron-rich foods to meals if your loved one has anemia. {Anemia is caused by low numbers of red blood cells. The healthcare team will tell you if your loved one is anemic. Often a patient who has anemia has no obvious signs or symptoms, but signs and/or symptoms can include fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness and pale skin. {Iron-rich foods include: liver, beef, chicken, pork loin, salmon, clams, and oysters. Plant foods that are a good source of iron include fortified cereals, lentils, pumpkin seeds, spinach, kidney beans, tofu, and raisins. {Avoid coffee and tea at mealtimes because they can interfere with iron absorption. {Do not provide an iron supplement without checking with the healthcare team. Serve moist foods if the patient has difficulty swallowing. {Moist foods are the easiest to swallow. {Foods with moisture, such as tomatoes, applesauce, canned fruits, cooked vegetables, gelatin, soups, puddings and ice cream all provide water. So, the patient won't need a big glass of water with the meal. {Moist foods also require less cutting and chewing, which conserves energy to eat more food. Prepare smoothies, shakes, or liquid nutrition supplements to add calories and protein. {Liquids can be easier to consume than solid foods. Smoothies or shakes can serve as a small-meal replacement. {Premade liquid nutrition supplements are available at grocery and drug stores. Ask a registered dietitian which type is best for your loved one. {If your loved one is not eating well or losing weight, add ingredients that provide calories and protein, such as whole milk, powdered milk, protein powder, peanut butter, ice cream or yogurt to smoothies, shakes or liquid nutrition supplements. Choose cold foods to sooth a sore mouth or throat. {Popsicles, frozen fruit, or flavored ice can offer relief if your loved one is suffering from a sore mouth or throat. {Popsicles also help with hydration and count toward daily fluid intake. Include foods that promote healthy bowel function. {Add foods with fiber if they are well tolerated. Gradually increase fiber intake to 25 to 35 grams daily. High-fiber foods include whole grains, beans, lentils, and the skins of fruits and vegetables. {To relieve constipation, choose high-fiber foods and encourage the patient to drink plenty of water. You can also try giving the patient plum or prune juice. {Do not give the patient medication for constipation without checking with the healthcare team. Homemade Electrolyte Drink Recipe Make a homemade electrolyte replacement drink by mixing the following ingredients: \u00bc teaspoon salt, 8 teaspoons sugar, 3 tablespoons orange juice concentrate, and 4 cups water.TIP: WANT MORE INFORMATION? To schedule a personalized nutrition consultation, visit www.LLS.org/nutrition or contact an LLS Information Specialist at (800) 955-4572. 10 l www.LLS.org/CaregiverWorkbook Choose food and drinks carefully if your loved one experiences diarrhea. {Avoid high-fiber, spicy, fried, and high-fat foods. {Choose white rice, applesauce, cooked vegetables and low-fat meat and dairy instead. {To stay hydrated, your loved one should drink lots of clear liquids, such as water, ginger ale, sports drinks or electrolyte-replacement drinks. {Call the healthcare team if your loved one experiences severe diarrhea. {Do not give antidiarrheal medications without checking with the healthcare team. Use pictures of food to stimulate appetite if your loved one doesn't want to eat. {Seeing food advertisements and magazine pictures can help to stimulate the appetite or trigger memories of good meals. {Share recipes, magazines or grocery store ads with your loved one, and use them to brainstorm meal ideas. Be sociable during mealtimes. {Meals are only healthy and nutritious if the patient consumes them. Making mealtimes social times that are relaxing and fun can help improve appetite, and make unpleasant side effects more bearable. {Encourage the patient to stay sitting up after meals to reduce heartburn and reflux. {Enjoy sharing meals with your loved one and talk about something other than treatments and meal preparation. To find more tips and strategies, by specific side effect, visit www.pearlpoint.org/SideEffects or www.LLS.org/booklets (filter by Side Effect Management). Grocery Shopping. A trip to the grocery store may be a tiring event for someone with cancer. Some patients may need a little help, such as a ride to the store or help carrying heavy items. For others with limited stamina and immunity, grocery shopping may not be possible. Here is where a caregiver, friends, relatives, and neighbors can really provide help. Grocery Shopping Tips. These following grocery shopping tips will make the trip easier. Shop with a list. Make copies of a standardized grocery list, which includes perishables such as milk and bread. It can be added to each week. Add in-season fruits and veggies. Add any new items for changes in special dietary needs. Use Worksheet 11: Grocery List to begin with a fully stocked pantry. Shop early in the day. If you live in warmer climates and shop early in the day, the food will stay cold while you are driving, and it will be cooler when you are unloading the groceries at home. The grocery store may also be less crowded, as many people tend to shop after work or on weekends. Bring a cooler. If you plan to buy chilled or frozen foods, take a cooler with you to keep the food at a safe temperature until you get home. Check the dates. Cancer patients often have decreased immunity. This means that they are at a greater risk for infection and disease. Be sure to only purchase foods that have not passed the expiration date. Also, don't purchase foods with damaged packaging. Read the label. Some dietary restrictions may limit specific ingredients, such as acid, alcohol, fiber, grapefruit, iodine, lactose, or sodium. The healthcare team or a registered dietitian can provide a written list of suggested and restricted foods.NUTRITION l 11Grab cold foods last. When shopping, select fresh items and room temperature items first. Then grab cold and frozen foods right before you check out at the grocery store. This helps keep the cold and frozen foods at a safe temperature on the drive home. Learn more about organic foods. For the word \"organic\" to be on a label, the product must meet certain United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)-approved guidelines. Organic produce has been grown without the use of most synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Organic meat comes from animals that are raised in living conditions that accommodate their natural behaviors, fed organic food, and not given antibiotics or hormones. Keep in mind there is no definitive research that shows that organic foods are significantly more nutritious than conventional foods. Eating a variety of plant-based foods whether organic or conventional is what's important. Organic foods can also be more expensive. You may be able to find budget-friendly organic foods at farmers' markets. Finding a source for local produce means your produce is picked at peak freshness and only travels a short distance to market. Use coupons. Look online and in the newspaper for coupons, especially coupons for protein beverages and supplemental products recommended by the healthcare team. Some specialty products can be pricey. Check out the product websites for coupons or contact the manufacturer. Save the receipt. Saving the receipt can help you and/or your loved one to stick to a budget. Check out food delivery and pickup services. Many grocery stores now offer pickup services. Send a list to the store ahead of time. A store employee then puts together the grocery order. Once your groceries are ready, go to the store, and an employee will load them in to your car. Some online retailers and stores offer food delivery services. If a trip to the grocery store isn't feasible, think about having groceries delivered to your door. Treat your loved one. Your loved one may be on a limited budget for food. If you spot a special food, flower, or magazine that the patient might enjoy, if you can, pick it up for them. Meal and Snack Ideas. Meals and snacks do not have to be elaborate to be healthy and nutritious. Combine foods from different groups, such as proteins, fruits, vegetables or complex carbohydrates to create a complete meal. A few meal and snack suggestions that are easy-to-prepare and require minimal cooking begin on page 12. Keep in mind that these meals and snacks are only suggestions. Make changes, as necessary, to accommodate food allergies or to follow nutrition guidelines provided by the healthcare team. Always practice good food safety when preparing and storing meals and snacks to protect against illness or infection.12 l www.LLS.org/CaregiverWorkbook Scramble an egg to eat with whole-wheat toast and a glass of low-fat milk.
