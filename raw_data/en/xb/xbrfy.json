Roswell Park Ranked 14th on List of Nation's Best Hospitals for Cancer A record of outstanding clinical care and services has once again earned Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center recognition as one of the top cancer h ospitals in the country. The Buffalo -based cancer center has been named to U.S. News & World Report's annual list of the Best Hospitals in the nation, and is number 14 on its list of Best Hospitals for Cancer. U.S. News' data -driven ranking places Roswell Park among the top 1.5% of cancer hospitals, and as a high -performing center in two subspecialty areas: colon cancer surgery and lung cancer surgery. Roswell Park is the only center in Western and Upstate New York to be included in U.S. News' ranking of the top 50 cancer hospitals, and one of only two New York State centers to rank in the top 15 on this respected national list. U.S. News made a few key changes to the methodology by which this year's ratings were calculated, incorporating patient -centered m easures such as patient satisfaction and how often patients are discharged directly from the hospital to their home s, as well as risk adjustment to account for the level of complexity in treating sicker patients. Roswell Park Neurosurgeon Honored by Profe ssional Society A Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center neurosurgeon who specializes in treating disorders of the spine , Andrew J.

Roswell Park Moving Unique Immunotherapy Platform Forward With $6.42 Million DoD Grant A team from Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center is moving forward a new three -part strategy for treating advanced cancers with support from a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) grant to Pawel Kalinski, MD, PhD, Vice Chair for Translational Research and Rustum Family Professor for Molecular Therapeutics and Translational Res earch. The four -year, $6.42 million Breakthrough Award through the DoD's Breast Cancer Research Program will fund a clinical trial in patients with brain -metastatic breast cancer, to be led by Shipra Gandhi, MD, Assistant Professor of Oncology in the Depar tment of Medicine at Roswell Park. The phase II trial, slated to open in 2020, would be the first clinical study to assess the effectiveness of a three -pronged strategy combining distinct immunotherapy approaches: A new dendritic -cell treatment vaccine developed by Dr. Kalinski and colleagues in collaboration with Brian Czerniecki, MD, PhD, Chair of the Breast Oncology Department at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida Chemokine modulation using a combination proposed and validated by Dr. Kalinski as an optimized adjuvant for dendritic -cell vaccines, incorporating rintatolimod (brand name Ampligen) and interferon alfa -2b (brand name Intron A) Immune checkpoint inhibition Alone, these therapies are effective for a limited number of patients, but evidenc e suggests that together they may help break through a persistent challenge in oncology: how to turn \"cold\" tumors that don't respond to existing therapies into \"hot\" ones that the immune system can be trained to recognize and pursue.

The network improves the quality of cancer care by expanding patient access to personalized cancer care plans that are based on national cancer care guide lines, prevention programs, cancer screening, clinical trials and genomic and genetic testing. Intermediate Care Unit Unveiled The 8th floor of our main hospital underwent an exciting transformation over the past year. Construction began in early June to relocate the Intermediate Care Unit (IMCU) adjacent to the Intensive Care Unit. The relocation of the IMCU will offer us the opportunity to improve the quality of care delivered to our patients. Centralization of critical care services on the 8th floor will allow physicians, nurses and support staff to more efficiently access the resources they need. Researchers Uncover New Role for Tamoxifen in Triple -Negative Breast Cancers A Roswell Park team identifie d the first known prognostic marke r for an aggressive tumor responsible for some breast cancers. One of the mechanisms that makes so -called triple -negative breast cancer (TNBC) notoriously aggressive and hard to treat is its ability to disarm proteins that suppress tumors and mutate them i nto tumor drivers. Seeking to better understand this process, a team from Roswell Park decided to focus not on what these TNBC tumors lack \u2014 the estrogen receptor (ER -alpha), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 proteins \u2014 but something they possess: an al ternate estrogen receptor, ER - beta. What they found, in collaboration with an international team of researchers, and report ed in a new article in JNCI: Journal of the National Cancer Institute, is that a widely used breast cancer drug, tamoxifen, can turn the ER -beta protein into a double agent capable of disrupting the processes that typically make TNBC tumors so devastating. Tamoxifen , approved for treatment and prevention of ER -alpha -positive breast cancers, was previously thought not to be effective ag ainst TNBC tumors because it targets ER -alpha, one of the proteins they lack. But this new work from a team led by Gokul Das, PhD, Associate Professor of Oncology in the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics and Co -Director of the Breast Disease Site Research Group at Roswell Park, proposes a new role for this broadly studied and well -tolerated targeted agent: targeting ER -beta. Mutation of an important tumor suppressor, the TP53 protein (also known as p53), is known to be the major mechanism behind most triple -negative breast tumors. In TNBC with normal TP53, ER -beta binds to normal TP53, disabling its tumor -suppressing capabilities and resulting in aggressive tumor behavior. But Dr. Das and colleagues show here that in TNBC with mutated TP53, ER -beta functions as a tumor suppressor by binding to mutated TP53, preventing it from functioning as a tumor driver. In-Demand Dermatopathology Expert Promoted to Director of Surgical Pathology Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center has added a new leader to its Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine with the promotion of Paul Bogner, MD, to Director of Surgical Pathology. In the Surgical Pathology Division, Dr. Bogner will now oversee 14 subspecialty pathologists who handle more than 25,000 cases p er year. Armed with subspecialized training and experience, the team of pathologists is able to carefully distinguish between the many subtypes of cancers, a behind -the-scenes service that is essential to determining a treatment plan that will lead to the best possible outcome. Sought after for his expertise as a diagnostic consultant throughout Western New York, Dr. Bogner will expand outreach to community clients in various medical specialties. Dr. Bogner first joined the department in 2005 as an Assista nt Professor of Oncology and became an Associate Professor in 2013. His dedication and commitment to cancer research and mentorship led to a position as Program Director of Roswell Park's oncologic surgical pathology fellowship just two years later. Fellow s have credited him with innovations such as social media -based education and a subspecialty focus during the second half of the fellowship year. Donations to Roswell Park, 11 Day Power Play Launch New Cancer Research Studies Generous donations set in mot ion five groundbreaking new research projects at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center. The promising preliminary studies received a total of $468,848 from the Roswell Park Alliance Foundation (RPAF), the 501(c)(3) not -for-profit organization that raise s funds and manages all donations made to Roswell Park. Twice a year, the RPAF's Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) score grant applications from Roswell Park's research community , and select the projects that will receive funding based on potential to impact how we prevent, diagnose and treat cancer. This process was developed to help our researchers explore innovative ideas at the ground level and produce data that will make them eligible for national grants. Every $1 of donations supporting SAC projec ts generates an average of $13 in additional new research grant funding. Funding for this spring's review also came from contributions to the 11 Day Power Play's 2018 Community Shift, where more than 1,500 hockey players took to the ice in a 250 -hour fundraising hockey marathon. 11 Day Co -Founder, Executive Director and cancer survivor Amy Lesakowski sat in on the committee's peer review process. Patients' Own Cells Do the Work in New Roswell Park Immunotherapy Study A NYSTEM -funded clinical trial underway at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center will assess a brand -new immunotherapy approach in patients with cancer of the ovaries, fallopian tubes or peritoneum that has recurred despite earlier treatment. Enabled by a major grant from New York St em Cell Science, or NYSTEM, the clinical trial reprograms blood stem cells and T -cells as treatment of patients with ovarian cancer and takes the new approach of reprogramming a patient's own blood stem cells, or hematopoietic stem cells, to serve as a \"li ving drug\" that can generate a lasting supply of two key types of immune cells: CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Led by Kunle Odunsi, MD, PhD, FRCOG, FACOG, Deputy Director of the Buffalo -based cancer center and Executive Director of its Center for Immunotherapy, t he study is the centerpiece of an $11.9 million competitive grant awarded by NYSTEM in 2015. One patient has received treatment as part of this early - phase clinical trial, which plans to enroll 15 patients and initially be available only at Roswell Park. Tumor Expression Pattern May Predict Recurrence in Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer Roswell Park physicians Grace Dy, MD, Chief of Thoracic Oncology, and Maya Khalil, MD, Chief Hematology -Oncology Fellow , led an effort to identify whether the tumor microenviron ment can predict risk of disease recurrence in patients with non -metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Dr. Khalil present ed their findings at the 55th annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago. \"Higher immunogenicity in lung cancer has been linked to improved survival, and this also has been shown in other tumor types,\" notes Dr. Khalil, first author on the work. \"However, to our knowledge, this is the first study looking at this specific subtype of lung cancer \u2014 adenocarcinom a with the EGFR mutation \u2014 and this specific group of genes involved in the immune microenvironment in an attempt to find those linked to longer disease -free interval.\" The research team, which includes scientists from OmniSeq Inc., an advanced -molecular -diagnostics company formed to develop technologies originating from Roswell Park, sought to determine whether lung cancer patients' tumor immune microenvironment can predict their cancer's recurrence. Using a Cancer Genome Atlas database of 877 cases of lu ng adenocarcinoma, they conducted gene -expression analysis on 33 patients, finding a collection of eight genes that are prognostic for disease recurrence. OPTiM Study: T -VEC Shows Improved Survival Over Cytokine Therapy in Patients With Melanoma Igor Puza nov, MD, Director of the Early Phase Clinical Trials Program and Chief of Melanoma at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, led research on the immunotherapy T -VEC, or talimogene laherparepvec, that was presented at the annual meeting of the American S ociety of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago. Dr. Puzanov is senior author on the study, which is the first to report the ad hoc analysis of progression -free survival (PFS) for T -VEC compared to cytokine -based with granulocyte -macrophage col factor, or GM -CSF, in the pivotal OPTiM randomized phase III trial (NCT identifier no. 00769704). T-VEC (brand name Imlygic) is an injectable immunotherapy designed to kill melanoma cells in the skin and lymph nodes. An oncolytic virus, it targets cancer cells without affecting normal, nonmalignant cells. Results show that single -agent T -VEC demonstrated an improvement in progression -free survival compared to GM -CSF in the overall intent -to-treat population, in whom 12 -month progression -free survival was estimated to be 14.4% for T -VEC and 4.6% for GM -CSF. The finding was driven primarily by patients with advanced, stage 3b to stage 4M1a melanoma, in whom 12 -month progression -free survival was estimated to be 19.9% for T -VEC and only 3.2% fo r GM -CSF. Phase II Trial Shows Favorable Response for Patients Receiving Combination Therapy With SurVaxM With their phase II study in patients with aggressive brain cancer now completed, the developers of the cancer immunotherapy SurVaxM shar ed research results at the 55th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), reporting that combination therapy with the vaccine was more effective than standard therapy for nearly all patients. The meeting at McCormick Place in Chicago, Illinoi s, is the largest clinical cancer research meeting in the world. SurVaxM was developed at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center by Robert Fenstermaker, MD, Chair of Neurosurgery, and Michael Ciesielski, PhD, Assistant Professor of Neurosurgery. The vac cine is a new and unique cancer immunotherapy designed to stimulate a multifaceted immune response targeting survivin, a tumor -survival antigen not generally present in nonmalignant cells. In this five -center, single -arm phase II clinical trial (NCT identifier no. 024455557), 63 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (nGBM), median age 60, were followed for safety, six -month progression - free survival, 12 -month overall survival and immunologic response. All patients underwent standard treatment, in volving craniotomy, radiation and treatment with temozolomide both before and after surgery. Immune response was assessed by detection of a survivin -specific antibody and CD8+ T -cell levels. The team reports that, compared to a historical analysis of pati ents receiving standard therapy alone, combination therapy with SurVaxM generated encouraging efficacy and immunogenicity in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, with minimal toxicity or side effects. The vast majority of patients \u2014 96.8% \u2014 did not experience disease progression within six months of treatment, and 93.5% were alive a year after diagnosis, compared to expected 65% survival based on historical comparisons. Roswell Park Teams Bring Research on New Cancer Therapies and Prognostic Tools to ASCO 2019 Several Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center teams were invited to present their latest research or to share their expertise as discussion leaders at the 55th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), from May 31 to June 4 in Chicago, Illinois. The theme of this year's gathering , the world's largest clinical cancer research meeting , was \"Caring for Every Patient, Learning from Every Patient.\" Roswell Park's participation included presentations of new research on treatments and prognostic strategies for colorectal cancer, brain cancer, lung cancer and multiple myeloma and speaking opportunities for Roswell Park senior leaders recognized as thought leaders in their areas of specialty. Roswell Park Physician Leads D evelopment of New Multiple Myeloma Imaging Guidelines Just as newer drugs have significantly improved outcomes for patients with multiple myeloma in the past decade, newer imaging techniques are upgrading detection of the disease, leading to earlier treatm ent. But standards to help guide clinicians on the optimal use of advanced imaging have lagged behind. Until now. Jens Hillengass, MD, Chief of Myeloma at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, led an International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) effort t o compile new recommendations \u2014 the first in 10 years \u2014 for imaging techniques that offer more sensitive and accurate diagnosis and monitoring for patients with multiple myeloma and other plasma -cell disorders. Multiple myeloma \u2014 the second most common typ e of blood cancer \u2014 occurs when white blood cells known as plasma cells multiply out of control. Immunotherapy -Chemo Combo Based on Work of Roswell Park's Dr. Ben Seon Gets FDA Approval A cancer therapy based on the work of Ben Seon, PhD, at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients with an aggressive form of non -Hodgkin lymphoma. On June 10, the FDA granted accelerated approval to polatuzumab vedotin as part of a new chemotherapy /immunotherapy treatment combination for patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B -cell lymphoma. Polatuzumab vedotin incorporates a form of immunotherapy known as a monoclonal antibody \u2014 a manufactured protein that can bind to and kill tumor cells. Roswell Park has played a role in many other FDA-approved innovations in cancer treatment and diagnostics, including the work of Dr. T. Ming Chu in developing the PSA test for prostate cancer, Dr. Thomas Dougherty's work establishing photodynamic therapy (PDT) as a treatment option for some cancers and work by Dr. Ravindra Pandey and others to develop photosynthesizers used in PDT. The approval of polatuzumab vedotin marks the first time an immunotherapy from Roswell Park has been part of an FDA -appr oved treatment. Roswell Park Team Develops New Method of Tracking Cellular Changes Associated with Cancer Researchers from Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center have developed a new bioinformatics - based approach for monitoring key changes in cancer cel ls. They describe their work to develop this data -driven method and how it can be used to enhance and personalize cancer treatment in a recent article in the journal Nature Communications. Cancer cells reprogram their metabolism to redirect nutrient resou rces in ways that support their rapid proliferation and spread to other sites in the body. Cancer drugs that target these altered metabolic pathways are largely effective, but they can also be highly toxic and difficult to tolerate, and determining how an individual will respond to these drugs has proven challenging. A better understanding of how these metabolic pathways are changed in specific cancer types could help scientists design more effective and personalized therapies. A research team led by Domin ic Smiraglia, PhD, Associate Professor of Oncology in the Department of Cancer Genetics and Genomics at Roswell Park, examined the similarities and differences in cell metabolism among 10,704 tumors representing 26 major cancer types, including breast, pro state, colon, lung, liver and skin cancer. Using transcriptomic data from the Cancer Genome Atlas, a major public database of information about genes and cancer genetics, the researchers were able to distinguish cancerous tumors from healthy tissue based o n the expression patterns of genes within 114 metabolic pathways regulating various aspects of cell metabolism. Further, they identified \"master metabolic transcriptional regulators\" (MMTRs) controlling groups of genes within the affected metabolic pathway s that could explain why these metabolic differences exist and how they are similar or different among various cancer types. Roswell Park Researchers Identify Immune Biomarker of Response in Patients With Advanced Liver Cancer Roswell Park immunology researchers have uncovered a biomarker that may help explain why some patients respond better than others to a common chemotherapy treatment for liver cancer. They hope that their analysis of immune responses among patients receiving sorafenib can lead to more individualized treatment options and better overall outcomes for patients diagnosed with the disease. The four -year study, led by Department of Immunology scientist Yasmin Thanavala, PhD, was published online in JCI Insight, a peer -reviewed journal p ublished by the American Society for Clinical Investigation, and also to be highlighted in the journal's JCI This Month digest for September 2019. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which can arise from liver cirrhosis, is the most common form of liver cance r. The mainstay oral chemotherapy treatment for patients with advanced HCC is sorafenib \u2014 but side effects from this drug may cause many patients to miss doses or discontinue treatment. The researchers, who included Renuka Iyer, MD, Section Chief for Gast rointestinal Oncology at Roswell Park, collected blood samples from 30 patients both before treatment and at two timepoints during treatment with sorafenib. They observed elevated levels of a subset of CD8+ cytotoxic T -cells (CD8+ Ki67+ T cells producing I FNg) producing interferon type II, an important immune protein that destroys tumor cells and significantly reduces risk of death over time. Similarly, CD8+ cells showed an increase in granzyme B, an important enzyme that helps drive cell death. Roswell Park Secures More Than $15.4 Million in New Funding for Cancer Research Roswell Park researchers have received more than a dozen recent grant awards totaling more than $15.4 million. These competitive awards from both government agencies and private funder s will fuel research to overcome obstacles in treating diseases like prostate, breast, colon and lung cancer, as well as less -common cancers like multiple myeloma and esophageal cancer. They include the first National Institutes of Health funding to study a new electronic tobacco device, plus new state funds from Empire State Development supporting Roswell Park's role in the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Moonshot initiative. \"The announcement ...of more than $15 million in grants and awards to Roswell Pa rk, including from the National Cancer Institute and National Institutes of Health, will help the cancer center continue the effort to make critical advancements in our understanding of the disease and develop new treatments to alleviate suffering and impr ove life quality,\" says Rep. Brian Higgins. Roswell Park Team Develops New DNA -Mapping Tool A scientist at Roswell Park has developed the first dedicated tool for analyzing a DNA -mapping technology known as ATAC -seq, a technique that identifies the gene \" switches\" responsible for cancer development and progression. Developed in collaboration with the University at Buffalo, the innovative computational method, named HMMRATAC, could vastly improve current methods of cancer detection and treatment. Each cell in the human body must pack more than six feet of DNA into a microscopic space only a few microns wide. To accomplish this enormous task, DNA is precisely arranged and tightly compacted into a structure called chromatin. This dense packaging system segreg ates DNA into areas that are tucked away and inaccessible and areas that are open and accessible to the cellular machinery that reads and translates genetic information. Although only a small fraction of the genome is exposed at a given point in time, thes e biologically active regions of DNA perform the essential function of transcription, the first step in protein synthesis. Taking Baby Aspirin Improves Overall Survival for Patients With Head and Neck, Lung Cancer In companion presentations at the American Society for Therapeutic Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Annual Meeting in Chicago, doctors from Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center report new evidence that low -dose aspirin and other anti -inflammatories may impro ve survival in patients undergoing treatment for some head , neck and lung cancers. The retrospective analyses are among the first to suggest a benefit in overall survival for patients with either head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) or early -stage non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \u2014 most commonly, low -dose aspirin \u2014 alongside standard radiation therapy or chemoradiation therapy. NSAIDs, which have anti -inflammatory and anti -platelet pro perties that help decrease the risk of cardiovascular events, are often prescribed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Both research efforts were led by Anurag Singh, MD, Professor of Oncology and Director of Radiation Research in Roswell Park's Department of Radiation Medicine. Roswell Park's Dr. Alan Hutson Named Chair of International Big -Data Task Force Alan Hutson, PhD, MA, Chair and Professor of Oncology within the Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics at Roswell Park, was named to a four -year term as Chair of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Data Sharing and Big Data Task Force. The Task Force works to address hurdles related to the handling, accessibility and use of large data sets toward the goal of advancing devel opment of immune -based therapies for cancer. Dr. Hutson has served as Chair of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics at Roswell Park since 2005. He holds bachelor's and master's degrees in statistics from the University at Buffalo, and an additional master's degree and doctorate in statistics from the University of Rochester. First Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplant for Sickle Cell Patient Performed by Roswell Park Oishei Children's Joint Program Team The clinical team from the Roswell Park Oishei Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Program has successfully performed the region's first pediatric bone marr ow transplant for 19 -year -old sickle cell patient Kayla Rushing, effectively curing her of the inherited blood disease. The successful transplant, made possible through a joint program with Oishei Children's Hospital and Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, offers hope and more accessible treatment options for those suffering from the disease in Western New York and the surrounding regions. Algorithm Reduces Need for Therapy in Children With Intermediate -Risk Neuroblastoma A Children's Oncology Group (COG) study identified a treatment algorithm that can help reduce therapy for some neuroblastoma patients with intermediate -risk disease, while maintaining good clinical outcomes. The study's findings are particularly significant because they suggest that many infants and young children with this disease may be spared unpleasant or lingering side effects of prolonged therapy, says lead researcher Clare Twist, MD, of Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center. The results of the study, which follows in the f ootsteps of previous risk -based clinical trials that led to substantial improvement for children with neuroblastoma, were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Neuroblastoma is the most common extra -cranial malignant solid tumor of childhood. It primarily affects infants and children up to age 5 but can occur in older children and young adults. The disease is classified as high -risk or non -high -risk based on the patient's age at diagnosis, the extent of the disease and particular genetic features o f the tumor cells. Treatment of high -risk neuroblastoma involves very intensive therapy, but for patients with non -high -risk neuroblastoma, recent clinical trials have shown that therapy can often be reduced due to the generally excellent prognoses for the se patients. The prospective phase III study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00499616) enrolled 404 children in three groups across North America with intermediate -risk neuroblastoma. The researchers developed and then tested an algorithm based on tumor biology and anticipated response to treatment, and designed to reduce therapy for patients without compromising overall survival rates. They focused on patients whose disease was determined to have favorable clinical and biologic features. Stars of Cance r Research Align to Develop Ovarian Cancer Detection Test The vast majority of ovarian cancers, about 70%, don't become apparent until they are advanced, making the chance of successful treatment to control these tumors quite slim. Four top teams of ovarian cancer researchers are uniting efforts in an unprecedented collaboration aimed at enabling early detection and perhaps prevention of many ovarian cancers. Funded by a developmental grant from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the initiative wil l bring together researchers from both government and academic centers to apply emerging technologies to this pressing challenge to discover biomarkers for early detection of ovarian cancer. The initiative, known as the DoD and SPORE Ovarian Cancer Omics Consortium, or DSOCOC, hinges on recent discoveries about the origins of ovarian cancers and on omics, an umbrella term for new sequencing -based approaches that enable the deep characterization of various types of molecules that play important roles in hum an biology. Roswell Park Takes in New Research Funding Totaling Nearly $22 Million Roswell Park received more than $21.8 million in competitive grants and contracts to launch new investigations or continue major research efforts that have shown promise. T his includes funding from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Moonshot program as well as multimillion -dollar renewals for high -impact projects based at Roswell Park. \"Access to federal research dollars is highly competitive,\" says Rep. Brian Higgi ns. \"Continued significant investment in the work happening right here at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center speaks to the confidence placed in Roswell's incredible research team. With each research project we take steps forward in the discovery of m ethods to prevent and treat cancer, and Western New York is proud to have Roswell Park leading the way.\" Roswell Park Spinoff Company Advances Toward New Clinical Trial for Brain Cancer Immunotherapy SurVaxM The inventors of a new and unique cancer immunotherapy developed at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center have announced a major step forward with that therapy, known as SurVaxM. MimiVax LLC principals Robert Fenstermaker, MD, and Michael Ciesielski, Ph D, have announced that the company, spun off from Roswell Park in 2012, has entered into a China -exclusive licensing agreement for SurVaxM with Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co. Ltd., based in Shanghai, China. Under the terms of the agreement, Fo sun Pharma and MimiVax will work to develop and commercialize SurVaxM for patients in the U.S. and specified territories in China. A $10 million upfront payment made to MimiVax will enable and partially fund the upcoming pivotal clinical trials in both the U.S. and China. MimiVax is eligible to receive an additional $28 million in developmental milestones and $110 million in sales milestones. SurVaxM, which MimiVax is developing based on technology licensed from Roswell Park, is an immunotherapy designed t o stimulate the immune system to kill tumor cells that contain survivin, a protein that helps cancer cells to resist conventional treatments. The drug, which is manufactured in the United States, has been studied most extensively in patients with glioblast oma, an aggressive and hard - to-treat brain cancer, but the drug's target, survivin, is also present in many other types of cancer, including multiple myeloma, neuroendocrine, medulloblastoma, melanoma, kidney and breast tumors. Based upon positive results from initial phase I and phase II studies, the team expects to advance to large, multicenter randomized phase II trials in the coming year both in China and in the U.S. A single - arm phase II study in 63 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma last year demonstrated significantly longer survival time for patients treated with SurVaxM, with 93.5% alive a year after diagnosis, compared to expected 65% survival based on historical studies. Roswell Park Team Identifies New Tumor Suppressor Protein in Prostate Cancer A research team led by a scientist at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center has identified the molecule LRIG1 as an important endogenous tumor suppressor in prostate cancer. Writing in the journal Nature Communications, the team document s their findings from preclinical studies showing that overexpression of the LRIG1 protein inhibits prostate cancer development, while reducing naturally occurring LRIG1 promotes prostate tumor development. Dean Tang, PhD, Professor and Chair of Pharmacol ogy and Therapeutics at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, is the senior author of the study, whose findings, he says, have compelled researchers to look at how best to incorporate LRIG1, a protein naturally expressed in patient tumor cells, into treatment for prostate cancer patients. Patients Access to Clinical Trials May Drive Differences in Outcome Among Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma Research led by a pediatric oncologist at Roswell Park has confirmed what several earlier studies showed: that overa ll survival is significantly lower for non -white children and adolescents with Hodgkin lymphoma than for Caucasian patients with the same disease. The team set out to explain this long - known but little -understood disparity, reporting their findings in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Kara Kelly, MD, the Waldemar J. Kaminski Endowed Chair of Pediatrics at Roswell Park and Chair of the Roswell Park Oishei Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Program, was a senior advisor on the study, which updates earlie r findings reported in 2017 at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting. Roswell Park Deputy Director Elected to Lead AACR Immunology Working Group Chosen for his passion and leadership in immunotherapy research, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center Deputy Director Kunle Odunsi, MD, PhD, FRCOG, FACOG, was elected as the Cancer Immunology Working Group (CIMM) Chairperson -Elect for 2020 -2021. CIMM is a scientific working group within the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR). The CIMM works to promote the importance of immunology as it pertains to cancer research, spread information about cancer immunology to the scientific community and translate worthwhile concepts to clinic. Dr. Odunsi's goals for his tenure as Chairperson -Elect inc lude making new alliances to pursue strategic objectives in immunology and encouraging the training and mentoring of the next generation of investigators. Antioxidant Use During Chemotherapy Risky for Breast Cancer Patients Breast cancer patients who take dietary supplements known as antioxidants, as well as iron, vitamin B12 and omega -3 fatty acids, during chemotherapy may be at increased risk of disease recurrence and death, according to study results appearing in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Led by researchers at the SWOG Cancer Research Network , a cancer clinical trials network funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) through the National Institutes of Health, the study confirms previous medical guidance advising cautious use of any s upplements, other than a multivitamin, for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. A small but growing body of research in the last 20 years shows that, despite their cancer -fighting reputation, antioxidants such as vitamin E, beta -carotene and selenium can actually increase risk of some cancers, cause some cancers to return after treatment, or interfere with the effects of chemotherapy. As part of the nation's oldest and largest publicly -funded cancer research network, SWOG has conducted some of this wor k. Its landmark Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) showed that vitamin E supplementation increases the risk of prostate cancer in healthy men. What's unique about the new study, led by Christine B. Ambrosone, PhD, of Roswell Park Comp rehensive Cancer Center, is that it is the first investigation of the effects of supplement use during breast cancer treatment and only the second to investigate the effects of supplement use during any kind of cancer treatment. The first was conducted by Charles Fuchs, MD, MPH, the director of Yale Cancer Center, who found that vitamin C may be helpful for people undergoing chemotherapy treatment for colorectal cancer. Donations to Roswell Park Launch Eight New Cancer Research Studies Generous donations h ave set in motion eight groundbreaking new research projects at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center. The promising preliminary studies received a total of $772,330 from the Roswell Park Alliance Foundation, the 501(c)(3) not -for-profit organization th at raises funds and manages all donations made to Roswell Park. Twice a year, Roswell Park's Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) announces a call for grant applications from Roswell Park's research community. Researchers submit their project proposals to the committee, consisting of an internal, objective group of scientists. The committee members then score the applications and select the projects that will receive funding based on potential to impact how we prevent, diagnose and treat cancer. This proce ss was developed to help Roswell Park's researchers explore innovative ideas at the ground level and produce data that could make them eligible for national grants. On average, every $1 donated to the Roswell Park Alliance Foundation supporting research ge nerates an average of $13 in additional new research grant funding from external sources. The fall 2019 request for applications received 37 submissions. After a thorough review, these eight research studies were selected by the SAC to receive grant award s: Understanding and overcoming protein -driven (HNF1A) drug resistance in pancreatic cancer, which could improve effectiveness of treating pancreatic cancer and potentially reduce its lethality, led by Ethan Abel, PhD, Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology. Selectively targeting breast and pancreatic cancers with genetic alteration in a tumor suppressor (p53), which can lead to new combination therapies improving patient outcomes, led by Andrei Bakin, PhD, Department of Cancer Genetics and Genomics . Dissecting new IMPDH2 -dependent mechanisms that control the invasiveness of triple -negative breast cancer, which could ultimately result in the suppression of its metastatic progression, led by Anna Bianchi -Smiraglia, PhD, Department of Cell Stress Biol ogy. Targeting a metabolic enzyme in triple -negative breast cancer, which could help identify new treatment options and explain the mechanisms that promote recurrence and metastasis, led by Subhamoy Dasgupta, PhD, Department of Cell Stress Biology. Mobili zing the immune system to reduce the need for chemotherapy and improve outcomes in triple -negative breast cancer, led by Shipra Gandhi, MD, Department of Medicine. Investigating the role of breastfeeding in preventing aggressive breast cancer, led by Micha el Higgins, PhD, Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology. Investigating racial differences in the interactions between tumor cells and immune cells in breast cancer, which may lead to the design of treatment strategies specifically for African - Americ an women, led by Angela Omilian, PhD, Department of Cancer Prevention and Control. Understanding the role of protein PEPD in tumor suppressor p53's abilities and finding ways to activate the protein's capabilities, possibly leading to a novel therapeutic strategy in treating cancers, led by Yuesheng Zhang, MD, PhD, Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics. Roswell Park Team Helps Explain How Chronic Stress Weakens Immunity Against Cancer In 2013, researchers from Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center became one of the first teams to report that chronic stress can encourage the development and proliferation of tumor cells by suppressing natural immunity against cancer. In a new study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, the same la boratory revealed an important and previously unknown means through which chronic stress weakens immunity against cancer: through its effect on a specific cell type known as the myeloid -derived suppressor cell ( MDSC ). The team, led by Elizabeth Repasky, P hD, Co -Leader of the Cell Stress and Biophysical Therapies Program and the Dr. William Huebsch Professor in Immunology at Roswell Park, has identified a new immunological mechanism through which chronic stress can increase the number of MDSC s in patients' blood and tumors, which are associated with more aggressive cancer growth. Based on these findings, a team of Roswell Park researchers are working together to develop and test the impact of several stress - reducing strategies, including exercise, meditation , yoga and reiki on immune activity. Offering a variety of options is important because it helps patients find the most enjoyable and useful strategies, based on their age and physical abilities. MEAL Study: Eating More Produce Will Not Cure, Stop Prostat e Cancer National guidelines recommend that men with prostate cancer eat a vegetable -rich diet, suggesting it might decrease cancer progression and death. But in a phase III randomized clinical trial, patients with prostate cancer assigned to eat seven or more servings of vegetables and fruits daily saw no extra protection from the increased consumption of micronutrients. The data indicate s that, despite prevailing scientific and public opinion, eating more vegetables will not alter the course of prostate cancer. It will not, to the best of our knowledge, suppress or cure it . However, while eating a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables and getting more exercise may not cure cancer, it may keep the body stronger and healthier, which may help patients t olerate cancer treatments. The Men's Eating and Living (MEAL) study, published January 14, 2020, in the Journal of the American Medical Association and led by UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center and Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center investigators, en rolled 478 men between the ages of 50 to 80 at 91 sites in the United States. The patients had been diagnosed with early -stage prostate adenocarcinoma and enrolled in an active surveillance program in which patients defer immediate treatment until the di sease advances. Patients were randomized to a control group that received written information about diet and prostate cancer or to a telephone counseling behavioral intervention program that encouraged participants to eat foods high in carotenoids, such a s leafy greens, carrots and tomatoes, and cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and cabbage. Both groups were monitored for two years. Alternative Pain -Control Strategy Reduces Need for Opioids in Patients with Head and Neck Cancer In a study led by Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, , 42% of patients who received gabapentin for pain management required no narcotics . With nearly all patients who undergo treatment for cancers of the head and neck experiencing oral mucositis, or painful mouth sores, effective pain control is one of the main goals of physicians and care teams. Looking to provide more effective relief for patients while also reducing the need for opioid painkillers, a team from Roswell Park explored whether gabapentin, a drug used to r elieve nerve pain and treat seizures, could be an effective alternative to narcotics in managing treatment -related symptoms for these patients. Their results, published in the journal Cancer, show that gabapentin is an effective alternative to standard pai n-control drugs and that many patients with head and neck cancers had their pain and symptoms managed without any narcotics. Anurag K. Singh, MD, Professor of Oncology and Director of Radiation Research at Roswell Park, led the study, in which 60 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms: highdose gabapentin (2,700 mg daily), progressing successively to hydrocodone -acetaminophen and fentanyl when needed, or to a regimen of lowdose gabap entin (900 mg daily), progressing to methadone when needed. The researchers, who include first author Gregory Hermann, MD, MPH, a resident physician in radiation medicine at Roswell Park, report two key findings: that highdose prophylactic gabapentin inc reased the percentage of patients who required no opioid during treatment \u2014 from 7% among those receiving the low-dose regimen to 42% in the high -dose arm \u2014 and that methadone may improve quality of life compared to a regimen of shortacting opioids such a s hydrocodone and fentanyl, a synthetic opioid. Metabolic Pathway Can Be Effectively Targeted to Treat Prostate Cancer, Roswell Park Team Shows A Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center research team has identified a novel combination therapy that demonstrates a new approach to treating prostate cancer, reporting their findings in the journal Nature Communications. This new therapeutic strategy is the first to target metabolic processes uniquely important to prostate cancer \u2014 specifically, two enzym es in the connected polyamine catabolic pathway and the methionine salvage pathway. Dominic Smiraglia, PhD, Associate Professor of Oncology in the Department of Cancer Genetics and Genomics at Roswell Park, led the team that identified this new strategy for treating castration - recurrent prostate cancer, a highly aggressive and therapy -resistant form of the disease. The new approach is a two -part strategy involving inhibition of The research team hit upon this strategy after observing prostate cancer's high rate of flux through the polyamine biosynthetic and catabolic pathways. The new treatment takes advantag e of the prostate's innate function of generating and secreting polyamines, key components in human reproduction. Roswell Park Finds New Evidence That Inhaled Vitamin E Acetate Caused EVALI in Vapers In August 2019, the first cases of an unknown lung inju ry associated with vaping products were reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This initial cluster of cases would quickly grow to 2,807 cases across the country, leading to the deaths of 68 people, from e -cigarette, or vapi ng, product use -associated lung injury, or EVALI, by February 2020. A team of researchers from Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Environmental Health Laboratory in the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health have published new evidenc e expanding on the initial conclusions from CDC - led analyses ,that inhalation of vitamin E acetate (VEA) is strongly linked to EVALI. The team, led by Yasmin Thanavala, PhD, Professor in Roswell Park's Department of Immunology, has published these timely an d important findings as a research letter in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Roswell Park Team Discovers New Mechanism Driving Pancreatic Cancer Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center researchers conducting the first large -scale analysis of a gene regulatory mechanism that, when altered, can lead to cancerous growth have found compelling evidence of the role it plays in the development of pancreatic cancer. They share these new findings in an article in the journal Genome Research. Led by Mi chael Feigin, PhD, Assistant Professor of Oncology in the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, the team studied a largely unexplored mechanism called alternative polyadenylation that recently has been found to play a significant role in regulating the expression of genes \u2014 particularly oncogenes, or genes known to be associated with cancer \u2014 in cells. Oncogenes' impact on cells is determined by how much protein they produce. The information encoded is transcribed to form a messenger RNA molecule, or mRNA, that forms the protein when translated . Dr. Feigin, postdoctoral fellow Dr. Swati Venkat and colleagues set out to study what happens to the encoded information that doesn't get translated, a phenomenon that, Dr. Feigin says, \"remains completely un explored in the context of pancreatic cancer and can provide understanding of how we target oncogenes that drive this debilitating disease.\" The length of this sequence of information at the end of a molecule, known as a 3 ' prime untranslated region or 3' UTR, has been shown to influence the amount of protein produced: much shorter lengths cause increased protein production, leading to cancerous growth. The team mined data from tissues from hundreds of people with pancreatic cancer as well as normal pancreas samples, searching for oncogenes that showed difference in 3' UTR lengths between cancer and normal conditions. Roswell Park's Dr. Pawel Kalinski to Lead $14.5M NCI -Funded Immunotherapy Effort A team led by Pawel Kalinski, MD, PhD, of Roswell Par k Comprehensive Cancer Center , has earned a five-year, $14.54 million award from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to expand a promising immunotherapy platform.
