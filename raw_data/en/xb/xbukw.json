This Health Element is a project of the Eden Area Livability Initiative (EALI) that residents voted for during EALI phase 1. The Health Element will contain goals, policies and actions for the Ashland and Cherryland communities to ensure that they have the physical and programmatic infrastructure to reduce health inequities that currently persist. Policies will address the physical, social, and economic environment. Outreach Model The Community Health and Wellness Element planning process included a robust and multifaceted outreach program. Ashland and Cherryland, a predominantly Latino population, necessitated a multi lingual outreach approach. The following contains an overview of the project's outreach effort including community workshops, focus groups, community events, a project website, facebook page, email outreach, phon e calls, and flyers, house meetings, and oneonone meetings, among others. Meeting and event summaries and materials are available for download on the Ashland and Cherryland website: http://ashlandcherryland.org/224 2/he/materials/ Appendix B - Community Engagement Summary Page 2 The following events comprise the main outreach efforts for the CHWE planning process: Wellness Advisory Committee #1: July 10, 2013 #2: October 14, 2013 #3: February 27, 2014 Community Workshops #1: May 1, 2013 #2: August 24, 2013 Other Community Events #1: Ashland Cherryland Together (ACT) Neighborhood Str eet Party October 19, 2013 #2: EALI Phase II, Board of Supervisors Community Charrette November 16, 2013 COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT DETAIL Wellness Advisory Committee Overview As part of this process, Alameda County formed a Wellness Advisory Committee (WAC), which is comprised of community residents and technical experts to advise and provide feedback and ideas on outreach, policy strategies and community priorities. An application to participate on the WAC was circulated via email throughout Ashland and Cherryland and was provided in both English and Sp anish. The County convened a total of three WAC meetings over the course of CHWE planning process. Meetings were open to the public. Membership Dot Theodore, Castro Valley Resident, and Master's Candidate in Public Health Ruth and Mike Baratta, Cherryland Residents Shanale Allen, Ashland Resident Loretta Bautista, Tiburcio Vasquez Health Center Community Workshops Two community workshops were held during the planning process. The workshops were open to the public and workshop materials were available in both Spanish and English. The workshop format allowed for community members engage in discussions about particular topics in break out groups. Appendix B - Community Engagement Summary Page 3 Workshop #1 Overview On May 1, 2013, the kickoff community workshop was held at Eden United Church of Christ in Cherryland. The purpose of the meeting was to inform community members about the Community Health and Wellness Element planning process, begin the visioning process, brainstorm strategies to improve health outcomes and solicit volunteers for the Wellness Advisory Committee (WAC ). After a presentation about the General Plan and public health, community members broke out into groups to discuss their vision to improve community health in Ashland and Cherryland. Workshop #2 Overview On Saturday, August 24, 2013, the second community workshop was held at the REACH Ashland Youth Center. The workshop began with an open house, which featured a health and social services fair where public agencies and community organizations provided information about their programs and resources. During the open house, participants were also invite d to provide in put about Parks, Mobility and Community Safety at three activity stations. The workshop opened with a presentation about the Community Health and Wellness Element and existing conditions in Ashland and Cherryland. At the close of the presentation, community members participated in two rounds of breakout discussion groups (30 mi nutes each). The topics discussed included: A. Health and Social Services B. Public Safety and Social Environment C. Land Use and Housing D. Education and Healthy Economy E. Active and Safe Transportation F. Healthy Food Access G. Parks and Community Facilities H. Sustainability and Environmental Health Workshop Outreach Additionally, email blasts and Facebook updates were used to inform residents about the workshop. 1) On the Ground Outreach. The bilingual community engagement team conducted doortodoor outreach in both Ashland and Cherryland and passed out flyers at the Hayward farmers market, local sporting events and other local gathering spots. COR (Congre g ations Organizing for Renewal - a group of the PICO Network) spearheaded the grassroots outreach efforts. Appendix B - Community Engagement Summary Page 4 2) Press release. For the 2nd workshop, the project team worked with the Alameda County Health Department Public Information Officer to create a press release. This press release was distributed to Alameda County's media outlets. This press release was not produced in Spanish. 3) Email blasts. Email announcements were sent out to County contact lists, WAC members, CO R lists, and the EALI list. 4) Mailings. For workshop #1, postcard mailings were sent to all residents in Ashland and Cherryland. Postcard mailings were sent to all residents in Ashland and Cherryland. In addition to the mailing, the Alameda County Community Development Agency sent rounds of email blasts to community based organizations and other interested parties in Ashland and Cherryland. Workshop Logistics 1) Meeting Date and Time. The first community workshops was held on a weekday evening. The second workshop was scheduled for a Saturday morning, a time suggested by the Wellness Advisory Committee. The meeting start time was 10:00am which may have been too early since many people arrived late. 2) Facilities. The first comm unity workshop was held at the Ede n Church in Cherryland. The second workshop was held at REACH Ashland Youth Center. a. Eden Church. The large, open multi purpose room included large round tables and chairs. Very little set up was required aside from arranging tables. It should be noted there was not a projector screen in the room, however, the two PowerPoint presentations were projected on the wall and were easily visible against the white wall. The full service kitchen allowed for boiling of hot water for coffee and tea, and easy clean up. b. Ashland REAH Center. The REACH cen ter required significant set up the evening before the workshop. The large lobby (called \"The Spot\"), which served as a library and lounge area needed rearranging. The facility is well set up for its purpose as a community center, but was not an ideal location for a community workshop. Break out groups, youth programs, and childcare all took place in separate rooms and the process felt disconnected. Furthermore, the high security measures required all attendees to be buzzed in through a metal detector. Many attendees commented that it did not feel welcoming, and others commented that they did not feel safe in the neig hborhood. Workshop Event 1) MultiLingual Materials. At both workshops, all materials were available in English and Spanish. 2) Attendance. At the first workshop ## people signed in. At the second workshop, 41 attendees signed in. This included some staff tabling at the health and social services fair. This was much lower than the target attendance of 100 peo ple. Appendix B - Community Engagement Summary Page 5 3) Child Care. The first workshop did not include a childcare station. The second workshop included a dedicated room for childcare. The room was staffed by two childcare workers and there were toys on hand for the children. 4) Youth activities. The first workshop had no children's activities. For the second workshop WAC Mem bers requested activities for kids to keep them occupied. The Public Health Department arranged for a youth yoga class to be held in the side room and the project team hired SOS Juice - a local nutrition nonprofit to make smoothies with the youth. Some stakeholders mentioned that a past EALI event rented a jumpy house which was a successful addition. 5) Open House. The second workshop began with an open house to allow for a later formal start. The open house consisted of a Health and Social Services fair where local agencies and nonprofits tabled and gave informatio n to attendees. During the open house, participants could also provide input at three different interactive station boards around the room. This was a nice addition to the meeting as it encouraged local groups to showcase their offerings and participate in the planning process. 6) PowerPoint Presentations. Both workshops had PowerPoint pre sentation in both English and Spanish. At both meetings the team projected two sidebyside presentations. We have found that participants prefer this to having both languages on one slide. 7) Small Group Discussions. At both workshops we had small group discussions after the presentation. Due to limited Spanish interpretation capacity at the first workshop, we had separate English and Spanish tables. At the second workshop we ensured that all Spanish translators were available in all break out session groups. a. The integrated translation approach allowed for diverse perspectives and fruitful discussion in the breakout sessions. 8) Food. At the close of the afternoon me eting lunch was provided to meeting participants. a. Healthy food options included sandwiches, fruit, and smoothies. Lunch was served at the closing of the event after all workshop sessions were completed. Quality of Life Survey Survey Overview and Purpose A Quality of Life Survey was developed to give community members who live or work in Ashland or Cherryland an opportunity to share their thoughts on personal and community health and quality of life challenges and solutions. The survey was made available online, and was translated into Spanish. The survey is included as part of this summary. Appendix B - Community Engagement Summary Page 6 Survey Outreach M ethodology The survey instrument was distributed to community members through a variety of targeted efforts including; Door knocking Hope 4 the Heart Ashland Cherryland Together (ACT) Neighborhood Street Party (10/19/2013) Online survey Focus Groups A series of focus groups were held in the community in order to understand the needs of targeted community groups. The result of these focus groups is reported in the Survey and Focus Groups Key Findings Report . REACH Ashland Youth Center Hillside Elementary School (EnglishSpeaking Parents) Hillside Elementary School (Spanish Speaking Parents) Additional Outreach Efforts To maximize resources and efforts, the outreach team conducted two \"piggy back\" events. The two events attended were the ACT Street party and the EALI Community Charette. At both events, the CHWE outreach team hosted booths.

Data from respondents outside Ashland and Cherryland are provided in the Appendix. The \"n\" values reported refer to the number of respondents who answered each question. These vary by question due to the exclusion of missing responses and, for some questions, \"I don't know\" and \"Not applicable\" responses. The use of skip -logic in the survey, which directed respondents to subsets of questions depending upon the answers they provided, also accounts for the variance in \"n\" values. Data tables show results as percentages of either total response s to a question, within a respondent group, or, for scale questions, percentages of responses to a response option. In some cases, data are limited due to low response rates. Introduction This report has been prepared to inform the General Pl an Community Health and Wellness Element that Alameda County is developing for the Ashland and Cherryland communities . As part of the Element planning process, the County has been very interested in the input of community members to help shape its direction forward. Through the methods detailed below , survey respond ents and focus group participants were able to share their experiences living in Ashland and Cherryland and ideas for improving the quality of their communities. Methods Data were collected through a mixed method s approach that involved paper and online survey s and focus groups. Paper Survey. A paper survey was distributed in English and Spanish from September 18 through November 11 , 2013. 1Congregations Organizing for Renewal utilized convenience sampling to dist ribute the survey at schools, community centers , and throughout the Ashland and Cherryland neighborhoods. Online S urvey. An o nline survey in English and Spanish was distrib uted through SurveyMonkey from September 18 through November 4, 2013. There were a total of 72 respondents to the online survey. Seventy respondents completed the survey in English and 2 completed it in Spanish . Focus groups . Three focus groups were conducted with a total of 48 participants : 25 Spanish -speaking parents , 12 English -speaking parents, and 11 English -speaking youth . The focus groups with parents were held at a local e lementary school, and the focus group with youth was held at the REACH Ashland Youth Center. 1 Of the 729 survey respondents, 633 provided addresses that were geocoded. Of those respondents, 418 were located within the boundaries of Ashland and Cherryland and were included in analyses. Self -reported community data was referenced for the 96 respondents who did not provide addresses. There were 36 respondents who reported living in Ashland or Cherryland; these were also included in analyses. Prepared by Harder+Company for Alameda County Febru ary 2014 2 Ashland and Cherryland Community Health and Wellness Element Key Findings Key Findings The key highlights from the survey an d focus groups are presented here ; the topic areas are organized as noted below . Each topic area includes a summary of main findings, followed by a description of further evide nce in support of each finding, which incorporat e both survey data and quotations from focus groups when applicable. Organization of Key Findings Findings are organized by topic areas into the following sections: Respondent Demographics Neighborhood Characteristics Health and Wellness Transportation Community and Retail Services Community Facilities and Programs Basic Needs and Social Environment A summary of k ey findings from all topic areas is presented below and on page 3. These are the main themes that emerged across data sources and can be used t o inform the development of the General Plan Community Health and Wellness Element . Summary of Key Findings Respondent Demographics Respondents span a broad range of ages. Over half of survey respondents are Latino (67 percent), speak Spanish (57 percent) , and were born outside of the United States (57 percent). Approximately 51 percent of respondents are living in poverty , and nearly a quarter are unemployed. The majority of respondents completed high school or less. Three- quarters of respondents rent their homes, and 65 percent of respondents who are Ashland o r Cherryland residents have lived in the area for 4 years or more. Neighborhood Characteristics More than one third of survey respondents feel that their neighborhood is a healthy place to live and a safe place to raise children. A lack of affordable housi ng and safety while walking at night are key neighborhood challenges. The top reported strategy to enhance safety is more street lights. Some respondents also noted that more community policing and social services would make their communities safer. Prepared by Harder+Company for Alameda County Febru ary 2014 3 Ashland and Cherryland Community Health and Wellness Element Key Findings Summary of Ke y Findings (continued) Health and Wellness Though a segment of Ashland and Cherryland residents report being in good health, notable disparities are present. High blood pressure, asthma, and obesity are the most frequently reported diagnosed health conditions. While the majority of respondents are able to access health care services, the sites at which they receive care (e.g., health clinic or private doctor) are sharply divided by age, race, income, language, and education. Access to affordable produce could be improved for Ashland and Cherryland residents, particularly those living in poverty. Transportation While over half of respondents rely on their car to commute to work or school, nearly a quarter of respondents walk or bike. Fear of crime, distance to destinations, a nd inadequate infrastructure (e.g., lack of sidewalks and bike lanes) are the top barriers to walking or bicycling. Respondents report that i nfrastructure improvements that create safer conditions would encourage p eople to walk and bike more often. The majority of respondents seldom utilize public transportation, and indicate that improvements in safety, lighting, and cleanliness are needed at local BART stations and AC transit. Community and Retail Services Respond ents report that there are not enough child care providers, family entertainment establishments, and gyms in Ashland and Cherryland. Respondents would like more libraries, hospitals, and professional services in their communities. Many respondents indicate d that there are too many liquor stores and fast food restaurants in Ashland and Cherryland. Community Facilities and Programs While over three- quarters of respondents currently visit parks in their community, fewer report feeling safe there. Sixty -one percent of respondents report visiting the library, and many note that providing more classes and programs would encourage them to visit more often. The REACH Ashland Youth Center serves a vital role for youth, and youth report that they would benefit from additional college preparation, job training, and social services. Basic Needs and Social Environment More than one in four respondents went without at least one basic need such as food, dental care, and health care in the last year. Nearly a third of respondents experienced housing insecurity in the last twelve months. The majority of respondents do not know where to get support services.

Prepared by Harder+Company for Alameda County Febru ary 2014 7 Ashland and Cherryland Community Health and Wellness Element Key Findings Neighborhood Characteristics This section highlights survey respondents ' and focus group participants' perceptions of neighborhood safety, cleanliness, affordability, and community engagement. 1. M ore than one third of survey respondents feel that their neighborhood is a healthy place to live and a safe place to raise children. Across measures of neighborhood quality, the most frequently reported strengths are neighborhood safety during the day and familiarity with neighbors , with 57 percent of survey respondents report ing that they feel safe walking in their neighborhood during the day and 43 percent report ing that they know their neighbors (see Exhibit 7). Exhibit 7. Neighborhood Assets (n=441 -447) Percent who \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" I feel safe walking in my neighborhood during the day 57% I know most of my neighbors. 43% My neighborhood is a healthy place to live. 37% My neighborhood is a safe place to grow up or raise children. 36% Houses in my neighborhood are generally well -maintained. 35% My neighborhood has a lot of abandoned homes and/or buildings. 16% While over one third of survey respondents indicate that their neighborhood is a healthy place to live (37 percent) and a safe place to grow up or raise children (36 percent), the majority of focus group participants voiced concerns about challenges they encounter in their neighborhood related to leading safe and healthy lives. Concerns about crime and theft voiced by one participant echoed those of many: \"It's not safe to walk day or night because there are young people walking around snatching purses or scaring us.\" On the other hand , several participants noted that their neighborhood was safe in comparison to other communities. As one participant described, \"From where I came from, I think my community is pretty safe. I was raised in East Palo KEY HIGHLIGHTS 1. More than one third of survey respondents feel that their neighborhood is a healthy place to live and a safe place to raise children. 2. A lack of affordable housing and safety while walking at night are key neighbor hood challenges. 3. The top reported recommendation to enhance safety is more street lights. Some respondents also noted that more community policing and social services would make their communities safer. Prepared by Harder+Company for Alameda County Febru ary 2014 8 Ashland and Cherryland Community Health and Wellness Element Key Findings Alto, [so comparatively] where I live is a pretty good community, but I won't let my kids play late at night on the street.\" Over one third o f respondents also indicate d that houses in their neighborhood are generally well -maintained (35 percent), and few report the presence of m any abandoned homes or buildings (16 percent) . 2. A lack of affordable housing and safety while walking at night are key neighborhood challenges. Survey respondents and focus group participants overwhelmingly cited the lack of access to affordable housin g as a key issue in their neighborhood. Only 16 percent of respondents indicated that affordable housing was available in their neighborhood (see Exhibit 8 ). Fewer Latinos (12 percent), Spanish -speakers (13 percent), and people living in poverty (13 percen t) reported having affordable housing in their neighborhood, as compared to whites (24 percent), English -speakers (21 percent), and people living above the poverty line (28 percent) (data not shown). Approximately one in five respondents (22 percent) reported feeling safe walking in their neighborhood after dark, though fewer focus group participants felt similarly. As one participant explained, \"I walk in the daytime. At night, I wouldn't. I wouldn't expose me or my kids walking.\" Fewer respondents wh o primarily speak Spanish at home felt safe walking at night (16 percent) compared to those who speak English (30 percent). When asked about what makes them feel unsafe, nearly all focus group participants cited the prevalence of violence, crime, gangs, and drugs. In the words of one participant: \"More than anything, what you want in a neighborhood is no drugs and no gangs. That's what is most dangerous right now - drugs and gangs. That's what causes panic in any community.\" Exhibit 8.

Only 22 percent of respondents reported that their neighborhood is free from litter , and slightly more (26 percent) \"More than anything, what you want in a neighborhood is no drugs and no gangs. That's what is most dangerous right now - drugs and gangs. That's what causes panic in any community. \" - Focus Group Participant Prepared by Harder+Company for Alameda County Febru ary 2014 9 Ashland and Cherryland Community Health and Wellness Element Key Findings reported th at it is free from vandalism and graffiti. Roughly one quarter (26 percent ) of res pondents indicated their neighborhood is well lit after da rk, and 30 percent of respondents trust t he people in their neighborhood . 3. The top reported recommendation to enhance safety wa s more street lights. Some also noted that more community policing and social services would enhance safety , though opinions were divided. Overall, survey respondents most commonly indicated that more street lights would make them feel safer in their neighborhoods (76 percent) (see Exhibit 9 on next page ), and many focus group participants reported likewise. Several participants listed areas around their neighborhoods and schools that are dangerous because they are not well lit. As two parent participant s noted, \" There are a lot of areas that need better lig hting. The streets are too dark, \" and \" We need lights; the parking lot [at the school] is dark. T he pick -up time here is 5:45, and it's really dark. \" While c ommunity policing was the second most frequently cited recommendation to improve safety, discussions among focus group participants reveal different usages of the term \"community policing\" (see text box below ). Discussion of \" Community Policing \" Focus group participants interpreted the term \"community policing\" differently; some understood it to mean surve illance of communities by police or security personnel , and others interpreted it as the implementation of neighborhood watch programs. Those who called for increased police presence expressed a need for more police to patrol their communities , particularly at parks , and for increased responsiveness after crimes are reported. Focus group participants described numerous incidents which they reported to the police and were not responded to, or only after a lengthy delay. An exception to the delay ed response time that several focus group participants experienc ed was the police response to incidents at school: \"Anytime something happens [at the school] , the cops come right away. They don't take long to get here.\" Other focus group participants ackn owledged the need for protection from crime and violence, but expressed strong opposition to increased police surveillance due to histories of negative experiences with police, and particularly to perceptions of being racially targeted. A few youth , such a s the one quoted below, also voiced the negative impacts of racism an d discrimination on their wellbeing and behavior . \"[The police] use these stereotypes to categorize one person.... If you tell someone they're stupid from 3 years old to 10, they'll believe they're stupid because you've told them a million times they are stupid. When you instill things in people and we're young, 12 to 24... that can piss them off or [make them want to] show you different. I think... if you tell someone something [negative] they have been hearing all their lives, it is going to trigger something you don't want t o see.\" Instead of increasing police presence, these participants described a need to \"come together as a community\" and organize crime prevention programs, such as neighborhood watch groups . \"If you tell someone something [negative] they have been hearing all their lives, it is going to trigger something you don't want to see.\" - Focus Group Participant Prepared by Harder+Company for Alameda County Febru ary 2014 10 Ashland and Cherryland Community Health and Wellness Element Key Findings Overall, community policing and social services were recommended by 67 percent and 43 percent of respondents, respectively, to improve safety. However, opinions differed markedly by age, race, income, an d language, as described below. A greater percentage of youth survey respondents (88 percent of ages 15- 24 years) indicated that more street lights would enhance safety, and fewer youth survey respondents (53 percent) and focus group participants felt that community policing would make their neighborhoods safer. More people living in poverty (79 percent), Latinos (73 percent), and Spanish - speakers (75 percent) reported that more community polic ing would make them safer. However, many Spanish -speaking focus group participants expressed fear of the police, especially among undocumented immigrants. As one Spanish -speaking participant commented, \"Many Latinos don't have a license and are scared of t he cops. The cops stop you for any minor mistake and your car is taken away , and you may even be deported.\" A greater percentage of people living in poverty (55 percent) than those above poverty (35 percent) indicated that more social services would increase safety. In addition , some focus group participants attributed the prevalence of crime to poverty and described the need for education, job train ing, and employment opportunities. In the words of one youth, \"Nine times out of ten, we do [unlawful] things in our community because we don't have a job or money to do things to help our families and siblings. A job would be a definite key thing to stay positive, stay off the streets , and continue to do well.\" Other commonly noted strategies to improve neighborhood safety included traffic calming measures and community programs. A few focus group participants also called for stricter gun and drug control at the federal and state levels. Exhibit 9.

Though a segment of Ashland and Cherryland residents report being in good health, notable disparities are present. The majority of respondents rated their health status as \"g ood\" (54 percent) or excellent (16 percent ) on a four - point scale from \"p oor\" to \"e xcellent \" (Exhibit 10) . In addition , many reported exercising at least three times per week (65 percent) and eating fresh fruits and vegetables every day (77 percent) (data not shown). However, notable disparities in self -rated health exist by ra ce, income, and education: many more whites, those living above the poverty line , and those with some college or higher indicated that their health was \"good\" or \"excellent.\" Exhibit 10. Self -rated Health (n= 441) Nearly two -thirds of respondents reported that they often or sometimes exper ience stress or anxiety (23 percent and 42 percent, respectively) . Those who more commonly reported never or rarely experiencing stress were Latinos, Spanish -speakers, people living in poverty, and people with a high school education or less. This may be attributed to cultural protective factor s that serve as buffers against stressful living conditions, or differences in the definition s of stress or anxiety. Youth are among the most frequently stressed, as 37 percent indicated that they are often stressed. Exhibit 11. Frequency of Experiencing Stress or Anxiety (n=441) KEY HIGHLIGHTS 1. Though a segment of Ashland and Cherryland residents report being in good health, notable disparities are present. 2. High blood pressure, asthma, and obesity are the most frequently reported diagnosed health conditions. 3. While the majority of respondents are able to access health care services, the type of site at which they receive care (e.g., hea lth clinic or private doctor) is sharply divided by age, race, income, language, and education. 4. Access to affordable produce could be improved for Ashland and Cherryland residents, particularly those living in poverty. Prepared by Harder+Company for Alameda County Febru ary 2014 12 Ashland and Cherryland Community Health and Wellness Element Key Findings When asked about the sour ces of stress impacting their lives, focus group participants most commonly cited a lack of employment - and thus difficulty meeting basic needs - and safety. Experiences shared by two participants reflect thos e of many: \"The economy and robberies. We don't have enough money an d then they take it away ,\" and \"Going out at night is stressful because we live in danger of persecution .\" 2. H igh blood pressure , asthma, and obesity are the most frequently reported di agnosed health conditions. Despite these mostly positive reports of health described above , approximately 40 percent of respondents indicated that they had been diagnosed with one or more chronic health conditions . The most frequently reported health conditions include hi gh blood pressure (27 percent) and asthma (22 percent), followed by obesity (20 percent) and diabetes (19 percent) (see Exhibit 12 ). A third of respondents reported othe r health conditions, such as allergies, anemia, a rthritis, and high cholesterol. Exhibit 12. Diagnosed Health Conditions (n=219) Percent who have been diagnosed with this condition Other health condition 33% High blood pressure 27% Asthma 22% Obesity 20% Diabetes 19% Heart disease 7% Cancer 5% Lung disease 3% Percentages do not total 100% because respondents were instructed to select \"all that apply.\" Asthma is the most commonly diagnosed health condition among youth. Of respondents age 15- 24 with a health condition, 48 percent reported that they ha d been diagnosed with asthma. Approximately three times as many people living in poverty have diabetes. Thirty -two percent of respondents in poverty have been diagnose d with diabetes, compared to 10 percent of respondents living above the poverty line . Higher percentages of people living above the poverty line have been diagnosed with asthma and high blood pressure. Of people living above poverty, 26 percent have be en diagnosed with asthma and 40 percent with high blood pressure, compared to 13 percent and 24 percent, respectively, of people living in poverty. Th e lower rates of diagnoses among people in poverty are likely due to inadequate access to health care. Prepared by Harder+Company for Alameda County Febru ary 2014 13 Ashland and Cherryland Community Health and Wellness Element Key Findings 3. While the majority of respondents are able to access health care services, the sites at which they receive care (e.g., health clinic or private doctor) are sharply divided by age, race, income, language, and education. Overall, 47 percent of respondents access health care services at health clinics and 43 percent visit do ctors or private workers (see Exhibit 13 ). Respondents who primarily utilize health clinics were Spanish -speakers (67 percent), Latino (62 percent), living in poverty (59 percent), less educated (59 percent of respondents with a high school education or less) and 25- 34 years old (54 percent). Conversely, those who most often visit ed doctors or private workers are English -speakers (68 percent), white (67 percent) and other races (73 percent), more educated (7 1 percent of those with some college or more and 69 percent of those with Bachelor's degree or higher), living above poverty (63 percent), and seniors (53 percent of those 60 years and older). Focus group participants expressed frustration with the high costs of health care , especially dental care. They described numerous obstacles that they experienced with Medi -Cal, including the lack of dental coverage, eligibility requirements that do not reflect the costs of living , poor service, and having insurance revoked after slight salary increase s. A few participants also noted a dearth of clinics in the area, and some requested more health care facilities in Ashland and Cherryland. 4. Access to affordable produce could be improved for Ashland and Cherryland residents, particularly those living in poverty. Only 45 percent of people living in poverty and 60 percent of those above poverty reported being able to purchase affordable fresh fruits and vegetables in their neighborhood. Youth also described the la ck of access to healthy food, noting that \"Anytime you go grocery shopping you have to leave Ashland to San Leandro. . . we have liquor stores, convenience stores, and fast food.\" Focus group participants overwhelmingly sai d that th e key challenges to eating healthy were the high costs of healthy food, reductions in food stamps , and a lack of employment opportunities. Several participants also n oted th e lack of food banks in Ashland and Cherryland. In the words of one participant: \"My experience was that I used to get stamps. I'm a single mother with 3 kids. We ate healthier when we had stamps as I would buy fruits, vegetables, and cereals. The help was taken away because I went over the income limit by a couple of dollars . . . a nd no w the kids don't eat as many fruits and vegetables. [Now] I have to buy what I need on a daily basis.\" When asked wh at changes in their community would help them eat more fruits and vegetables , participan ts most commonly reported revised benefit eligibility requirements that reflect the cost of living, more food banks that are accessible to undocumented immigrants , and nutrition education workshops about h ow to eat healthy and prepare fresh produce. A few participants also suggested that community gardening would prom ote health in their neighborhood s, as one described, \"Offer gardening courses, have the community come and take a plot of land, and bring ideas and seeds. Once people start getting involved, they'll reap the benefits.\" Exhibit 13.

While over half of respondents rely on their car to commute to work or school, nearly a quarter of respondents walk or bike. Of the 60 percent of respondents who attend school or work outside of the home, over half of respondents drive alone to work or sc hool (52 percent), followed by 22 percent who walk and 12 percent who take public transportation (see Exhibit 14 ). The most popular destinations for walking and biking were grocery stores (66 percent) and parks (65 percent), followed by the homes of friends and family (42 percent). Fewer respondents reported walking or biking to a BART station (38 percent), drug store (34 percent), or library (21 percent). Latinos, people living in poverty, Spanish -speakers, and people with a high school education or less are more likely to walk and less likely to drive alone. Those who report taking public transportation more frequently identify as non -Latino and non -white races 3 (20 percent), are living in poverty (16 percent), English- speakers (17 percent), and ha ve a Bachelor's degree or higher (20 percent) . 3 This includes respondents who identify as African- American, Asian, Pacific Islander or Native Hawaiian, Alaska Native/American Indian, and mixed race.

Fear of crime, distance to destinations, a nd inadequate infrastructure (e.g., lack of sidewalks and bike lanes) are the top barriers to walking or bicycling. Respondents report that i nfrastructure improvements that create safer conditions would encourage people to walk and bike more often. 3. The majority of respondents seldom utilize public transportation, and indicate that improvements in safety, lighting, and cleanliness are needed at local BART stations and AC transit. Prepared by Harder+Company for Alameda County Febru ary 2014 15 Ashland and Cherryland Community Health and Wellness Element Key Findings 2. Fear of crime, distance to destinations, and inadequate infrastructure (e.g., lack of sidewalks and bike lanes) and are the top barriers to walking or bicycl ing. Respondents report that infrastructure improvements that create safer conditions would encourage people to walk and bi ke more often. Across survey respondents and focus group participants, t he top reported b arriers to walking or bicycl ing were fear of crime (49 percent) and distan ce of destinations (42 percent). Other commonly reported barriers relate to infrastructure and traffic issues, and include a fear of car traffic (27 percent), a lack of sidewalks (23 percent), and an insufficient number of bike lanes (18 percent) (see Exhibit 15 ). In addition to fear of crime, the presence of off- leash dogs was anothe r commonly cited safety concern that deters walking and biking. Focus group participants also described experiences of harassment and violence while walking, and many specifically highlighted challenges of car traffic and insufficient lighting near schools and parks. Exhibit 15. Top Barriers to Walking and Biking (n=401) The greatest percentage of survey respondents identified the following infrastructure improvements as important motivations for them or their family to walk or bike more often: more signs highlighting biking and walking routes (49 percent), better/more sidewalks (43 percent), more bike lanes (37 percent), and more public transit destinations (35 percent) (see Exhibit 16). Another improvement noted by fewer respondents is secure bicycle parking (30 percent). Many focus group participants also noted unsafe conditions near schools and parks , and suggested traffic calming measures such as speed bumps, stop signs , and traffic lights. Exhibit 16.

Nearly three quarters (74 percent) of respondents reported that there were not enough child care providers in Ashland and Cherryland (see Exhibit 19 ). Specifically , survey respondents and focus group participants discussed the lack of afforda ble child care and stringent requirements for government assistance, especially for single parents. A lack of family entertainment establishments and gyms or places to exercise were reported by 72 percent and 71 percent, respectively, of respondents. Furth ermore, 48 percent of respondents indicated that there were not safe places to exercise in their neighborhood. Exhibit 19.

Prepared by Harder+Company for Alameda County Febru ary 2014 19 Ashland and Cherryland Community Health and Wellness Element Key Findings Community Facilities and Programs 1. While over three-quarters of respondents currently visit parks in their community, fewer report feeling safe there. Though 77 percent of respondents indicated that they visit parks in their community, only 56 percent of respondents said they felt safe at their neighborhood parks. Survey respondents and focus group participants, such as those quoted below, provided numer ous reasons for feeling unsafe at parks located in Ashland and Cherryland. \"Fairmont, by the liquor store. . . It's right on the street, there shouldn't even be a park there [because] cars are coming off the freeway. I've never been there; I wouldn't take my kids there.\" \"We don't [visit] our local park; there are lots of youth and loose dogs. It's scary for young children.\" The top reported concerns were the presence of drugs, gangs, and violence; the parks' proximity to liquor stores and major roadways; and an overall lack of cleanliness. Some also described the dangers posed by off - leash dogs. Among survey respondents, fewer Spanish -speakers (47 percent), Latinos (51 percent), and people with a high school diploma or less reported feeling safe at their neighborhood park. However, s everal focus group participants and respondents expressed strong preference for one local park (Meekland Park), noting that \"it's really fun; it has its ow n walking thing for the parents and a play station for kids. While you walk, you can see them playing \" and \"[It's] the only park I will take my family to... the other parks are either run down or unsafe.\" However, other parents were not aware that it existed, and thus suggested that more publicity about the parks was needed. Some participants also explained that they \" have to go to nicer areas for our children's safety\" and listed the parks they drive to outside the area, for example in Castro Valley and San Ramon. When asked about the programs, facilities, or equipment that would encourage families to visit local parks more often, the vast majority of respondents re quested increased safety and cleanliness , followed by recreational activities and events such as sports and games. Other common requests include d more play structures for children, exercise equipment , and more restrooms. KEY HIGHLIGHTS 1. While over three- quarters of respondents currently visit parks in their community, fewer report feeling safe there. 2. Sixty -one percent of respondents report visiting the library, and many note that providing more classes and programs would encourage them to visit more often. 3. The REACH Ashland Youth Center serves a vital role for youth, and youth report that they would benefit from additional college preparation, job training, and social services. \"We don't [visit] our local park; there are lots of youth and loose dogs. It's scary for you ng children.\" - Focus Group Participant Prepared by Harder+Company for Alameda County Febru ary 2014 20 Ashland and Cherryland Community Health and Wellness Element Key Findings 2. Sixty -one percent of respondents report visiting the library, and many note that providing more classes and programs would encourage them to visit more often. While 61 percent of respondents visit the library, library visitation varies by age, education, race, income, and language. Most notably, only 58 percent of those with a high school degree or less visit the library, compared to 70 percent of those with a two -year degree and 81 percent of those with a Bachelor's degree or higher. F ewer youth ages 15 -24 (47 percent), Spanish -speakers (53 percent), Latinos (57 percent), and people in poverty (59 percent) frequent the library. Among focus groups participants , a key challenge to utilizing libraries was a lack of access due to a number of factors, including lack of facilities in Ashland and Cherryland, limited hours of available facilities , and the additional costs of using libraries in neighboring cities . Some families mentioned that they rent books from a mobile library van, wh ich they noted was convenient but crowded. When asked what programs or services would encourage their families to visit libraries, survey respondents most commonly described tutoring programs, programs and events for children, and English language and com puter classes. Many also mentioned the need for a library closer to where they live, and free access to other libraries in the area. Some also requested a larger selection of books, particularly in Spanish. 3. The REACH Ashland Youth Center serves a vital role for youth, and youth report that they would benefit from additional college preparation, job training, and social services. Survey respondents and focus group participants highlighted the REACH Ashland Youth C enter as an important resource for youth. As described by two participant s, it is \"the only real resource that has everything . Not just activities and game s; they [also] help you with homework , they have jobs, and arts and crafts \" and \"The response to the new facility has been tremendous and clearly demonstrates that these services are desperately needed in our community. Provide more!\" Respondents also outlined additional programs and services needed by youth; these are described in Exhibit 22 . Exhibit 22. Additional Programs and Services Needed by Youth Program and support Reflections from focus groups participants and survey respondents Sports programs and recreational activities [I'd like to see more] s ports security and programs that help youth so that they do not go and do bad things outside of the parks like smoking and drinking alcohol. Social services (e.g., support with basic needs, counseling) Think about it - I'm 15 at the house, I have no food to eat, my mom's not home. The last thing I think about is school. My mind is on nothing else but how I will get past the next day. Health and violence prevention education [I'd like] e ducation programs for parents about drug prevention, and c hats for young people about sex education. Mentorship programs Let's have more discussions on lowering the cr ime rate! Let's get some folks who turned their lives around and are doing well to speak to the youth - someone the kids can relate t o. There are very few Latino male role models for these young boys growing up - let's get more representation . Employmen t and job training [We need] career readiness programs and job placement agencies . College preparation programs (e.g., advising, workshops, college fairs, fieldtrips) I'm a senior in high school and I feel school is trying to get you ready, but now that I'm about to go to college I have unanswered questions . . . . I feel we should have college nights where people ... can come here and get college advising. Prepared by Harder+Company for Alameda County Febru ary 2014 21 Ashland and Cherryland Community Health and Wellness Element Key Findings Basic Needs and Social Environment This section presents findings related to basic needs . 1. M ore than one in four respondents went without at least one basic need such as food , dental care, and health care in the last year. Overall, 27 percent of respondents went without basic needs in the last year. Those who went without basic needs were more likely to be living in poverty (45 percent), younger and middle age (30 percent of age 15 -24, 32 percent of 25-34, and 28 percent of 35- 59, compared to 10 percent of seniors ), and Latino (29 perc ent) and other races (32 percent). In explaining the difficulty some face in meeting their basic needs, many focus group participant s described the financial challenges associated with working low- wage jobs but not meeting eligibility requirements for federal benefi ts. As stated by one participant: \"If you work and make an income, you don't qualify [for government benefits], but your income is below the living standard.\" Over half of respondents - 52 percent - who went without basic needs experienced a lac k of dental care in the last year , and 43 percent went without health care . The experiences of focus group participants echoed these findings, as two participants noted: \" Dental care is the main thing, kids get care, we don't get anything. If your teeth go, they just go\" and \"There's some access to health care, but adults don't have access to dental. I don't know what the government is thinking; when you get to a certain age you don't have access to dental.\" A similarly high percentage of respondents wen t without food or faced limited food choices (49 percent). 2. Nearly a third of respondents experienced housing insecurity in the last twelve months . When asked what basic needs they went without in the last twelve months, 32 percent of respondents indica ted that they went without rent or housing, and 31 percent went without child care in the last year . Greater percentage s of Latinos and other races went without rent and child care . While 42 percent of other races and 32 percent of Latinos went without ren t in the last twelve months, only 13 percent of whites were in similar situations. Additionally, 34 percent of Latinos and 29 percent of other races went without child care, while no whites reported lacking child care. One focus group participant provided insight into the childcare challenges that single , working parents experience: \"I'm a single mom of three, I study, work and am a mom. . . if I ask for help, I don't qualify anymore. For child care, the government offers a program through Calworks that pays a babysitter. But since I don't qualify for Medi -Cal I don't qualify for Calworks. . . They should see we're single moms and have low incomes and for a few bucks we don't qualify and that affects us a lot. \" KEY HIGHLIGHTS 1. More than one in four respondents went without at least one basic need such as food, dental care, and health care in the last year. 2. Nearly a third of respondents experienced housing insecurity in the last twelve months. 3. The majority of respondents do not know where to get support services. Prepared by Harder+Company for Alameda County Febru ary 2014 22 Ashland and Cherryland Community Health and Wellness Element Key Findings 3. The majority of respondents do not know wh ere to get support services. Only 27 percent of respondents who went without basic needs in the last 12 months reported knowing where to go to get support . Far fewer youth - 13 percent - reported knowing where to get support for their basic needs. Among Latinos and other races, awareness of available support was also lower than among whites. One - quarter of Latinos and 30 percent of other races indicated that they knew where to get support, as compared to 43 percent of whites. Additional Community Needs In addition to the needs detailed throughout this report, i nterview participants and survey respondents identified s everal other community needs, displayed in the exhibit below. Exhibit 23. Additional Programs and Services Needed by Community Members Community Need Reflections from Interviewees Programs for young children We need activities for younger kids ages 10 and under so that we can be involved with them as well. Open a program for younger kids, to have some activities like maybe dancing. Exposing kids to programs like Reach at a younger age. Some still hang out at the parking lot, so why stop now. For the younger kids, there isn't much offered. Job training and employment [We need] t rainings for people who want to work, like workshops to teach people job skills, because many people want to work but don't have those skills. Legal support Speaking from personal experience ... you go and apply [for jobs], and since you don't have a good social security number, they won't give you the job. The only thing they say is they'll call later. They don't call because there is no good social security number. This is dependent on immigration reform. At least let's get a social security number for ... people to get jobs. Family / community center It starts in the home, a family center. That teaches if a parent is humble enough to take the class, things they'd need to make their life more stable for their family. Place for everyone to spend time together and do activities together. A big community cen ter, for San Leandro and San Lorenzo too. They can have workshops and feel emotionally positive. To eat healthy, programs for how to eat and cook a different way. We have different cultures and nationalities, in Mexico we eat a lot of meat and don't see ma ny vegetables. Prepared by Harder+Company for Alameda County Febru ary 2014 23 Ashland and Cherryland Community Health and Wellness Element Key Findings Recommendations This report provides important insights into the strengths and challenges of living in Ashland and Cherryland, with a focus on how the findings can inform the development of the communities' Health and Wellness General P lan Element. Therefore, the following recommendations identify opportunities for Alameda County, community partners, and residents to create and strengthen healthy, safe, and vibrant communities while enhancing the quality of life in Ashland and Cherryland. Contribute to i mprove d public safety by making infrast ructure improvements - including more lighting and sidewalks - and implement ing pedestrian safety measures . Though s urvey respondents and focus group pa rticipants generally feel safe walking in their communities during the day, they repeatedly emphasized the ir lack of safety at night. To address this and promote active transportation (e.g., walking and biking) to parks, jobs , and services , they highligh ted the need for more street lights, sidewalk s, signage, and traffic calming measures, as well as more secure bicycle parking and stricter enforcement of leash laws. Increase public transit access, affordability, safety, lighting and cleanliness. Currently, low usage of public transit - 61 percent of respondents rarely or never take public transportation - indicates that improvements in transit are needed. Respondents most commonly report that improvements in safety, lighting, and cleanliness at AC Transit and Bay Fair and Hayward BART stations are needed. Increased affordability, parking, and bilingual information is recommended to increase BART ridership, while improved service and seating at bus stops would promote usage of AC Transit. Improve a ccess to affordable fresh produce. Respondents identified numerous challenges that they faced in accessing affordable fresh produce, and reported that revisions to government benefit eligibility requirements, more food banks, community gardens , and nutrit ion education classes would help them eat healthier . Provide clean places to exercise and i mplement health programming. In order for families to safely walk and play in their neighborhoods , respondents requested i mprovements in the safety and cleanliness of local parks . Furthermore , respondents no ted that providing family -friendly health programming and entertainment at parks would help promote physical activity and foster community cohesion. Strengthen access to dental and health care . Data indicate notable gaps in consistent dental and health care among respondents both in poverty and above the poverty line. To address this, outreach about available resources and support, more health care facilities, and improved insurance coverage, particularly for undocumented residents , are needed. Enhance services for youth, particularly higher education preparation and employment training programs . The majority of focus group participants and survey respondents reported that youth would benefit from programs to prepare them for college , train them for jobs , and connect them to needed social services. In addition, a number of respondents noted that sports and recreation activitie s, mentorship programs, and health and violence prevention education would help youth Prepared by Harder+Company for Alameda County Febru ary 2014 24 Ashland and Cherryland Community Health and Wellness Element Key Findings maintain healthy lifestyles and promote positive community involvement . Prioritize the needs of communities in poverty, low -income communities and communities of color to promote equitable health outcomes. Analyses of survey a nd focus group data demonstrate striking disparities across measures of health and quality of life among low- income communities, poor communities, and communities of color. It is therefore essential that the needs of these communities be prioritized in the development o f policy frameworks to improve the health of all Ashland and Cherryland residents . Create accessible, culturally -appropriate outreach materials to inform community members of available resources for key needs such as dental care, health care, food, housing, and child care. Lack of awareness about where to go for support services was a challenge cited by nearly three - quarters of respondents who were not able to meet one or more of their basic needs in the last year. Therefore, increased o utreach about available social services, especially to youth, Spanish -speakers, Latin os, and other people of color, would help ensure that residents' basic needs are met . Explore comprehensive crime prevention strategies. Crime and violence were the key barriers to walking, visiting local parks that respondents reported. Survey respondents and focus group participants identified several strategies to reduce crime, including increasing police patrol and responsiveness, imple menting neighborhood watch programs, and increasing access to social services. Expand the availability of affordable housing. Respondents clearly expressed a need for affordable housing, as only 16 percent of respondents indicated that affordable housin g was available in their neighborhood, and 32 percent of respondents went without rent in the last year. It is recommended that efforts to ensure that affordable housing is available and accessible to all residents incorporate an assessment of the conditio ns underlying racial disparities in perceived availability of affordable housing, such as language barriers or systemic discrimination.

The street lights between Hampton and Medford is not adequate for the length of the street. There are sections where it is extremely dark at night and you would not want to walk there. Traffic calming for 163rd Ave between 580 and E. 14th. With no continuous sidewalks and the excessive rate of speed cars drive on this street it is only a matter of time until someone is killed. Children have to walk in the street to get to school, disabled citizens also have to be in the street to traverse the neighborhood by foot.

There may be instances where a strict application of these guidelines is difficult in light of existing development patterns, environmental constraints, and/or other overriding considerations. Mission: To create, strengthen and sustain a livable community in the urban unincorporat ed areas of Alameda County. Community Principles: 1. All planning should consider the integration of communities containing housing, shops, work places, schools, parks, libraries, cultural arts ve nues, and civic facilities essential to the daily life of the residents. 2. Community design should work to ensure that housing, jobs, daily needs and other activities are within easy walking di stance of each other. 3. The location and character of the community shoul d be consistent with and facilitate a larger transit network. As many activities and servi ces as possible should be located within easy walking distance of transit. 4. A community should contain a diversity of ho using types to enable citizens from a wide range of economic levels and age gr oups to live within its boundaries. 5. Businesses within the community should provide a range of job types for the community's residents. 6. Each community should have one or more focal po ints that combine commercial, civic, cultural and recreational uses. 7. The community should contain an ample supply of specialized open space in the form of squares, greens and parks whose frequent use is encouraged through placement and design. 8. Public spaces should be designed to encourage the attention and presence of people of all ages and interests. 9. Each community or cluster of communities should have a well-defined edge, through mechanisms such as signage, public art, agricultural greenbelts, wildlife corridors, community gardens, etc. 1 Based on the Ahwahnee Principles - The Ahwahnee Principles for More Livable Communities were pr epared in 1991. They outline a more sustainable way to develop and redevelop our communities. They provide specific recommendations for communities and regions and include an implementation strategy. The principles or portions of th e principles have been adopted in the ge neral plans of over 120 local governments in California. Finalized on 01/13/05 10. Streets as well as pedestrian and bike facilitie s should contribute to a safe system of fully connected and interesting routes to all de stinations. Their design should encourage pedestrian and bicycle use by being small an d spatially defined by buildings, trees and lighting; and by discouraging high speed traffic. 11. Wherever possible, the historical character and resources, the natural terrain, drainage and vegetation of the community should be preserved. 12. The community design should help conserve reso urces, minimize waste and promote a healthy environment. 13. Communities should provide for the efficient use of water through the use of natural drainage, drought tolerant landscaping and recycling. 14. The street orientation, the placement of buildin gs and the use of shading should contribute to the energy efficiency of the community. 15. Community designs should incorporate elements that support and enhance a public safety presence through collaborative efforts that pr omote safe routes and neighborhoods, blight removal, adequate lighting, quality of life concerns and overall community well being. Regional Principles: 1. The regional land-use planning structure should be integrated within a larger transportation network built around transit rather than freeways. 2. Where practicable, regions should be bounded by and provide a continuous system of greenbelt/wildlife corridors to be determined by natural conditions. Appropriate tools (e.g., land trusts, urban growth boundaries) shall be utilized to clearly delineate areas suitable for urban development from open space/agriculture areas. 3. Regional institutions and services (government, stadiums, museums and performing arts venues, etc) should be located in the urban co re and/or near a major transit hub. 4. Materials and project designs should be consistent with local standards, exhibiting a continuity of history and culture and compatib ility with the climate to encourage the development of local character and community identity.
