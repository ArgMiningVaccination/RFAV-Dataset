[ Check out our latest analysis for Argo Group International Holdings ](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/insurance/nyse-argo/argo-group-international-holdings?l=0&t=cnfg_cresbeznapr_lnubb&s=3&id=477906&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=finance_user<=CTA_ticker&utm_campaign=CTA_ticker) Was ARGO's recent earnings decline indicative of a tough track record? ARGO's trailing twelve-month earnings (from 31 March 2018) of US$38.40m has more than halved from US$146.70m in the prior year. Furthermore, this one-year growth rate has been lower than its average earnings growth rate over the past 5 years of 18.59%, indicating the rate at which ARGO is growing has slowed down. Why could this be happening? Well, let's look at what's transpiring with margins and whether the entire industry is feeling the heat. Over the last couple of years, revenue growth has fallen behind which implies that Argo Group International Holdings's bottom line has been driven by unmaintainable cost-reductions. Scanning growth from a sector-level, the US insurance industry has been growing, albeit, at a muted single-digit rate of 3.77% over the previous twelve months, and 8.26% over the last five years. This means any recent headwind the industry is enduring, it's hitting Argo Group International Holdings harder than its peers. In terms of returns from investment, Argo Group International Holdings has not invested its equity funds well, leading to a 2.15% return on equity (ROE), below the sensible minimum of 20%. Furthermore, its return on assets (ROA) of 0.74% is below the US Insurance industry of 1.69%, indicating Argo Group International Holdings's are utilized less efficiently. And finally, its return on capital (ROC), which also accounts for Argo Group International Holdings's debt level, has declined over the past 3 years from 8.48% to 0.91%. This correlates with an increase in debt holding, with debt-to-equity ratio rising from 25.97% to 32.60% over the past 5 years. What does this mean? While past data is useful, it doesn't tell the whole story. Generally companies that endure an extended period of diminishing earnings are going through some sort of reinvestment phase Though if the entire industry is struggling to grow over time, it may be a sign of a structural shift, which makes Argo Group International Holdings and its peers a riskier investment.
