Some familypractices and hospitals provide it and many healthcare professionals incorporate it into their work.Over 20 countries have reflexology associationslinked to the International Council ofReflexologists, based in USA. 2There are several British reflexology schools: therapists are usuallymembers of the British Reflexology Association(MBRA) 3or the Association of Reflexologists (MAR), founded in 1985 and 1989 respectively.4 However, Britain does not have any specificstatutory regulations. There is little differencebetween reflexology and the less frequentlymentioned zone therapy. Origins The Chinese probably used a comparable therapy some 5,000 years ago: acupressure emerged fromthis followed by acupuncture, which then becamemainstream Chinese medicine. Ancient paintingson the foot of the Hindu god Vishnu andinscriptions on the foot of a reclining Buddhasuggest a representation of reflex points. A wallpicture and hieroglyphics on the tomb ofAnkhmahor (probably a royal physician), excavatedin Saggara in Egypt and dated c2000 BC,convincingly depict hand and foot touch therapy. 5 North American Cherokee Indians still practise aform of foot massage, thought to have originatedfrom South American Incas. 6 The Florentine sculptor Cellini (1500-1553) relieved pain using finger pressure.7DoctorsAdamus and A'tartis wrote about zone therapy in 1582. Dr Cornelius published Pressure Points and their Significance in 1902.8 American ENT surgeon William Fitzgerald (1872- 1942) applied clamps and elastic bands to fingers inorder to produce arm and jaw anaesthesia, allowinghim to perform minor operations. Dr Edwin Bowers,Fitzgerald's colleague, attracted attention with anarticle in Everybody's Magazine entitled To Stop the Toothache - Squeeze your Toe . Dr Fitzgerald devised a theory that the body was divided into ten verticalzones or slices ending in the five fingers and toes oneach side. No explanation is recorded as to how hereached this conclusion. In the 1930s, EuniceIngham (1879-1974) - an associate of Fitzgerald -produced extremely detailed maps of reflex areasrepresenting all parts of the body on the hands andfeet. She trained Doreen Bailey who introducedreflexology into Britain and founded a School ofReflexology. 9 Principles and Practice Reflexology is presented as a holistic therapy in which pressure and massage are applied to the feetor hands in order to remove and dissipate energyblocks, break down crystalline structures, encouragetoxin release, stimulate the immune system andprevent ill health. According to Pauline Wills, reflexology '...is about giving and receiving energy. That energy istransmitted to the patient through the hands of thetherapist and information is received from thepatient's feet.' 10Reflexologists do not claim to make medical diagnoses but identify body parts that are'out of balance' and require removal of energyblocks. A medical history is supplemented by 4 TRIPLE HELIX IIAUTUMN 03research ReflexologyGeorge Smith examines a popular touch therapy. KEY POINTS Reflexology is a 'touch therapy' with ancient origins based onthe idea that pressureand massage applied tothe foot can prevent andtreat organic disease.Although relatively safe,it has no rational orscientific basis andrandomised controlledtrials show no evidenceof its efficacy. Whilst asoothing foot massagemay play a part inrelieving stress, the basicphilosophy behindreflexology has roots inthe Taoist Chinese the life chakras inthe practice Christians. Sieveking/Wellcome Photo Libraryresearch information gained by foot palpation. Areas of grittiness or tenderness are presumed to identifyorgans relating to the reflex area or zone involved.Massage, pressure or techniques such as finger walking across the foot are used to unblock energychannels, stimulate vital energy and promotehealing. Individual reflexologists may combine thiswith colour therapy, yoga, aromatherapy,homeopathy or astrology. As with many alternative therapies, reflexology may be practised in NHS hospitals, AlternativeMedicine Centres in the High Street, privatepractices or at New Age Mind, Body and SpiritFestivals. Medical Checklist 1. Is there a rational, scientific basis? There does not appear to be a rational basis for Dr Fitzgerald's theory of body zones. Any significantanatomical or physiological relationships betweenthe variously shaped body organs and his geometricvertical segments or reflex areas on the foot is hardto imagine and quite incompatible with Gray's Anatomy . Different practitioners' foot maps have similar patterns but show clear variations in the positioning of certain organs. No convincing explanation for these variations has been offered.Reflexologists suggest a cause and cure relationshipbetween minor foot abnormalities (eg corns andbunions) and disease of internal organs. Diagnosis of blocked energy channels - said to be causing crystalline deposits - by foot palpation is notbacked up by scientific investigation or evidence. InNew Age settings, a query over whether this isdiagnosis or divination must be raised. Life force, vital energy, meridians and chakras all figure prominently in popular reflexology textbooks. The WHICH? Guide to Complementary Therapies stresses: 'Few scientific data have been produced to back up the experiences ofreflexology devotees or to confirm the existence ofzones, energy lines or crystalline deposits'. 11Inge Dougans - founder of the School of ReflexologyTherapy and Meridian Therapy in South Africa -states, 'There is no one correct theory on howreflexology works'. 12 2. Does it work? Reflexology is popular: its practitioners are enthusiastic and caring and many patients testify toits positive effects. A soothing foot massage in acaring environment may well diminish stress andpatients often feel better. Yet anecdotal evidenceand acknowledgement of the placebo effect cannot substitute for scientific evidence. Feeling betterdoes not automatically imply healing from disease. A survey in WHICH? failed to find any conclusive scientific evidence to support reflexology'seffectiveness. In a meticulous scientific review inProfessor Ernst's Desktop Guide to CAM , ten random controlled trials were reviewed without revealingconvincing evidence for reflexology's efficiency. 13 Further reviews of clinical trials in FACT did notreveal any satisfactory evidence of efficacy. 14 3. Is it safe? Significant harm seems unlikely from simple foot massage but foot tenderness, changes in micturitionor bowel function have been reported. 15Caution is advised in patients suffering from depression,epilepsy or vascular disorders of the legs. 16The greatest risk with potentially serious consequences iswhen reflexology is used as a substitute for propermedical diagnosis and treatment. Christian Checklist Christians need to consider both professional integrity and biblical guidelines when assessing anytreatment, orthodox or alternative. Unproveneffectiveness or mode of action cause reflexology tofall far short of the evidence-based principlessupposedly required of all modern medicaltreatments. From a Christian perspective there is much to cause concern. Reflexologists highlight the spiritualsignificance of healing through the feet. IngeDougans comments: 'Feet play a significant part inspiritual well being. The feet connect us to theground and they are therefore a connection betweenearthly and spiritual life. They are our base andfoundation and our contact with the energies thatflow through it'. 17Referring to the biblical account of Jesus washing the disciples' feet, she adds: 'TheChrist washed the disciples' feet in order to awakethe crown chakra above the head to awake spiritualenergies'. 18Similarly, many other reflexologists find an association with chakras and elements of theHindu practice of yoga. Its basic philosophy is relatedto the T aoist Chinese view of the life force ch'i (yingand yang) or its equivalent in other cultures andreligions (eg Universal Cosmic Energy). Reflexology,therefore, may provide an introduction to New Agespirituality and eastern religious philosophy. The Christian worldview is of a personal Father God upon whom we depend in all aspects of our life. 19The idea of an impersonal life force governing all living beings is contrary to this and must surely leadto the conclusion that reflexology is not a right choicefor Christians. Choose you this day whom you will serve...God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods .
