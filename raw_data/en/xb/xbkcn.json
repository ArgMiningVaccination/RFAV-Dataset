An essential oil is extracted from various parts of different plants such as the seeds, bark, stems, roots, or flowers, and then distilled. The essential oil has the characteristic aroma of its plant, and depending on the type, offers unique health benefits. How Aromatherapy is Administered There are a variety of options when it comes to how aromatherapy is administered including: - Indirect inhalation: For this method, the patient breathes in essential oils through the use of a room diffuser or placing drops of the oil nearby, on a pillow or on a cotton ball on a nightstand, for example. - Direct inhalation: During direct inhalation, a patient breathes in the essential oils using an individual inhaler, which has drops of an essential oil floating on the top of hot water. This method is often used to treat sinus headaches. - Topical application: To dilute the essential oil and make it safe for topical application, it can be mixed with a carrier oil, such as olive oil or shea butter, bath salts, or lotions, and then massaged directly into the skin.
