Dearest Guest, When my wife Jean and I first visited Miraval, we found it to be a truly trans- formative experience. The magic of the beautiful 400+ acre property and the ex- pertise of the caring staff were apparent from the moment we arrived. We were so taken by our first stay that we wanted to become a more permanent part of the Miraval family, and we decided to invest in the company. For the past seven years, we have had the pleasure of building on Miraval's tremendous legacy, with the goal of taking the life-changing Miraval experiences to more people in more places. Every day is unique for every person at Miraval. What makes it so special is the seemingly endless array of options. You can do as much or as little as you like. If this is your first visit to Miraval, the number of options may seem a little bewildering, and trying new things perhaps a little intimidating. You'll quickly discover that everybody working and staying at Miraval is part of a com- munity that encourages and supports each other. So you have nothing to fear and much to gain if you allow yourself to venture outside of your normal comfort zone. Discover what is uniquely Miraval - and uniquely you. Thanks again for visiting. I hope your experience here will be as transformative for you as mine was and that you'll be back soon! - Steve Case, Owner, Miraval Steve & Jean Case 19-24 25-28 29-39 40-41 42-43 44 Welcome Authentic Circle Making Your Time Count Our Specialists New at Miraval Daily Schedule Activities Menu Private Sessions Menu Spa Services Menu Spa Suite Menu Resort & Guest Room Info Resort Map 5000 E. Via Estancia Miraval Tucson, AZ 85739 800.232.3969 miravalresorts.com 3 The thread that is woven through the entire Miraval experience is MINDFULNESS. The umbrella under which the Miraval experience is designed is INTEGRATIVE WELLNESS. And the core philosophy governing the menu of activities and services at Miraval over the past 18 years is LIFE IN BALANCE. At Miraval, we understand that people are mind-body-spirit beings and that all these elements are intertwined. Each and every class, lecture, private session, and spa service at Miraval is designed with Mindfulness, Integrative Wellness, and Life in Bal- ance at the forefront of our minds. We Believe It is more than what you see that makes Mi- raval what it is. Our core belief of living in the moment combined with sustainability is uniquely Miraval; when people truly are con- scious of and enjoying their surroundings, they realize they want those surroundings to last. Join us in our commitment to the environment and be sure to bring your new, sustainable water bottle to your activity. Through our ef- forts we hope to continue to have a net posi- tive effect on our planet. You are the \"I\" in Miraval, where each individual is recognized as important and unique. As you move through the Miraval experience, remember that this is your time. Take each experience at your pace, reflect on how it applies to your unique life experience, and al- ways know that you are valued and recognized as an individual. Imagine a world in which medicine was oriented toward heal- ing rather than disease, where doctors believed in the natural healing capacity of human beings and emphasized prevention above treatment. In such a world, doctors and patients would be partners working toward the same ends. - Andrew Weil, M.D. Mindfulness, noun: Mindfulness is a state of active, open attention in the present moment. When you're mindful, you observe your thoughts and feelings without judgment. Mindfulness means living in the moment and awakening to experience.

SET ASIDE EXTRA TIME FOR YOURSELF Finally, remember to set aside some of your time for personal reflection - take a walk through the Labyrinth, sit by the Kiva, lie by the pool, or lounge in the Quiet Room in our Life in Balance Spa. The self-discovery process is the best part of the journey! TEENS AT MIRAVAL Miraval welcomes guests who are 14 years of age and older.

In the spa, teens must have their treatments with a same gender pro- vider, wear undergarments for their massages and facials, and wear a bathing suit for body treatments unless yoga/fitness attire is recom- mended in the service description. NOTE: Miraval expects teenage guests to conduct themselves in a respectful manner while on property so as not to disrupt the mindful atmosphere that we create for all our guests. Miraval reserves the right to allow or refuse participation in these and other experiences on a case-by-case basis. 6 Our Specialists INSPIRING DIRECTION FROM INSPIRED MINDS Our guests often tell us that it is the peo- ple at Miraval that make the difference.

The traditional South Indian 'Karma' or treatment begins when you inhale the steamy scents of lemongrass, mint, nutmeg and clove in the treatment room, engaging your senses. A curative blend of Coconut, Ginger and Rosemary oils are massaged into the skin using an authentic, \"Vashesh\" or deep tissue technique. The steaming, hand wrapped poultices warm and energize the body while the deep pressure allows muscles to become supple and release both their tension and toxins. A warm aromatic wrap follows, finishing with a cleansing hibiscus plant powder scrub, restoring the vitality of your skin as well as your spirit. Ayurveda is a science of life which provides curative and preventive principles for healthy, long life. It emphasizes preventative and healing therapies along with various methods of purification and rejuvenation. Ayurveda is more than a healing system; it is a science and art of appropriate living which helps to achieve longevity. It can also guide every individual in the prevention of disease and long term maintenance of health.
