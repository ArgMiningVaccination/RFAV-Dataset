The programme was subsequentlyexpanded to include evaluations of carcinogenic risks associated with exposures to complexmixtures, life-style factors and biological and physical agents, as well as those in specificoccupations. The objective of the programme is to elaborate and publish in the form of monographs critical reviews of data on carcinogenicity for agents to which humans are known to beexposed and on specific exposure situations; to evaluate these data in terms of human riskwith the help of international working groups of experts in chemical carcinogenesis andrelated fields; and to indicate where additional research efforts are needed.

Inclusion of an agent in the Monographs does not imply that it is a carcinogen, only that the published data have been examined. Equally, the fact that an agent has not yetbeen evaluated in a monograph does not mean that it is not carcinogenic. The evaluations of carcinogenic risk are made by international working groups of independent scientists and are qualitative in nature. No recommendation is given forregulation or legislation. Anyone who is aware of published data that may alter the evaluation of the carcino- genic risk of an agent to humans is encouraged to make this information available to theUnit of Carcinogen Identification and Evaluation, International Agency for Research onCancer, 150 cours Albert Thomas, 69372 Lyon Cedex 08, France, in order that the agentmay be considered for re-evaluation by a future Working Group. Although every effort is made to prepare the monographs as accurately as possible, mistakes may occur. Readers are requested to communicate any errors to the Unit ofCarcinogen Identification and Evaluation, so that corrections can be reported in futurevolumes. -1-NOTE TO THE READER-3-Members Ahti Anttila, Finnish Cancer Registry, Institute for Statistical and Epidemiological Cancer Research, Liisankatu 21 B, 00170 Helsinki, Finland Ramesh V .

BACKGROUND In 1969, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) initiated a pro- gramme to evaluate the carcinogenic risk of chemicals to humans and to produce mono-graphs on individual chemicals. The Monographs programme has since been expanded to include consideration of exposures to complex mixtures of chemicals (which occur,for example, in some occupations and as a result of human habits) and of exposures toother agents, such as radiation and viruses. With Supplement 6 (IARC, 1987a), the titleof the series was modified from IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of the Carcino- genic Risk of Chemicals to Humans to IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcino- genic Risks to Humans , in order to reflect the widened scope of the programme. The criteria established in 1971 to evaluate carcinogenic risk to humans were adopted by the working groups whose deliberations resulted in the first 16 volumes ofthe IARC Monographs series . Those criteria were subsequently updated by further ad- hoc working groups (IARC, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1982, 1983, 1987b, 1988, 1991a; Vainioet al. , 1992). 2. OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE The objective of the programme is to prepare, with the help of international working groups of experts, and to publish in the form of monographs, critical reviews and eva-luations of evidence on the carcinogenicity of a wide range of human exposures. TheMonographs may also indicate where additional research efforts are needed. The Monographs represent the first step in carcinogenic risk assessment, which involves examination of all relevant information in order to assess the strength of the avai-lable evidence that certain exposures could alter the incidence of cancer in humans. Thesecond step is quantitative risk estimation. Detailed, quantitative evaluations of epidemio-logical data may be made in the Monographs , but without extrapolation beyond the range of the data available. Quantitative extrapolation from experimental data to the humansituation is not undertaken. The term 'carcinogen' is used in these monographs to denote an exposure that is capable of increasing the incidence of malignant neoplasms; the induction of benign neo-IARC MONOGRAPHS PROGRAMME ON THE EV ALUATION OF CARCINOGENIC RISKS TO HUMANS PREAMBLEIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 10 plasms may in some circumstances (see p. 19) contribute to the judgement that the expo- sure is carcinogenic. The terms 'neoplasm' and 'tumour' are used interchangeably. Some epidemiological and experimental studies indicate that different agents may act at different stages in the carcinogenic process, and several mechanisms may be involved.The aim of the Monographs has been, from their inception, to evaluate evidence of carci- nogenicity at any stage in the carcinogenesis process, independently of the underlyingmechanisms. Information on mechanisms may, however, be used in making the overallevaluation (IARC, 1991a; Vainio 25-27). The Monographs may assist national and international authorities in making risk assessments and in formulating decisions concerning any necessary preventive measures.The evaluations of IARC working groups are scientific, qualitative judgements about theevidence for or against carcinogenicity provided by the available data. These evaluationsrepresent only one part of the body of information on which regulatory measures may bebased. Other components of regulatory decisions vary from one situation to another andfrom country to country, responding to different socioeconomic and national priorities.Therefore, no recommendation is given with regard to regulation or legislation,which are the responsibility of individual governments and/or other internationalorganizations. The IARC Monographs are recognized as an authoritative source of information on the carcinogenicity of a wide range of human exposures. A survey of users in 1988 indi-cated that the Monographs are consulted by various agencies in 57 countries. About 2500 copies of each volume are printed, for distribution to governments, regulatory bodies andinterested scientists. The Monographs are also available from IARC Press in Lyon and via the Marketing and Dissemination (MDI) of the World Health Organization in Geneva. 3. SELECTION OF TOPICS FOR MONOGRAPHS Topics are selected on the basis of two main criteria: (a) there is evidence of human exposure, and (b) there is some evidence or suspicion of carcinogenicity. The term'agent' is used to include individual chemical compounds, groups of related chemicalcompounds, physical agents (such as radiation) and biological factors (such as viruses).Exposures to mixtures of agents may occur in occupational exposures and as a result ofpersonal and cultural habits (like smoking and dietary practices). Chemical analoguesand compounds with biological or physical characteristics similar to those of suspectedcarcinogens may also be considered, even in the absence of data on a possible carcino-genic effect in humans or experimental animals. The scientific literature is surveyed for published data relevant to an assessment of carcinogenicity. The IARC information bulletins on agents being tested for carcino-genicity (IARC, 1973-1996) and directories of on-going research in cancer epide-miology (IARC, 1976-1996) often indicate exposures that may be scheduled for futuremeetings. Ad-hoc working groups convened by IARC in 1984, 1989, 1991, 1993 andPREAMBLE 11 1998 gave recommendations as to which agents should be evaluated in the IARC Mono- graphs series (IARC, 1984, 1989, 1991b, 1993, 1998a,b). As significant new data on subjects on which monographs have already been prepared become available, re-evaluations are made at subsequent meetings, and revised mono-graphs are published. 4. DATA FOR MONOGRAPHS The Monographs do not necessarily cite all the literature concerning the subject of an evaluation. Only those data considered by the Working Group to be relevant to makingthe evaluation are included. With regard to biological and epidemiological data, only reports that have been published or accepted for publication in the openly available scientific literature arereviewed by the working groups. In certain instances, government agency reports thathave undergone peer review and are widely available are considered. Exceptions maybe made on an ad-hoc basis to include unpublished reports that are in their final formand publicly available, if their inclusion is considered pertinent to making a finalevaluation (see pp. 25-27). In the sections on chemical and physical properties, onanalysis, on production and use and on occurrence, unpublished sources of informationmay be used. 5. THE WORKING GROUP Reviews and evaluations are formulated by a working group of experts. The tasks of the group are: (i) to ascertain that all appropriate data have been collected; (ii) to selectthe data relevant for the evaluation on the basis of scientific merit; (iii) to prepareaccurate summaries of the data to enable the reader to follow the reasoning of theWorking Group; (iv) to evaluate the results of epidemiological and experimental studieson cancer; (v) to evaluate data relevant to the understanding of mechanism of action; and(vi) to make an overall evaluation of the carcinogenicity of the exposure to humans. Working Group participants who contributed to the considerations and evaluations within a particular volume are listed, with their addresses, at the beginning of each publi-cation. Each participant who is a member of a working group serves as an individualscientist and not as a representative of any organization, government or industry. Inaddition, nominees of national and international agencies and industrial associations maybe invited as observers. 6. WORKING PROCEDURES Approximately one year in advance of a meeting of a working group, the topics of the monographs are announced and participants are selected by IARC staff in consul-tation with other experts. Subsequently, relevant biological and epidemiological data areIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 12 collected by the Carcinogen Identification and Evaluation Unit of IARC from recognized sources of information on carcinogenesis, including data storage and retrieval systemssuch as MEDLINE and TOXLINE. For chemicals and some complex mixtures, the major collection of data and the pre- paration of first drafts of the sections on chemical and physical properties, on analysis,on production and use and on occurrence are carried out under a separate contract fundedby the United States National Cancer Institute. Representatives from industrial asso-ciations may assist in the preparation of sections on production and use. Information onproduction and trade is obtained from governmental and trade publications and, in somecases, by direct contact with industries. Separate production data on some agents may notbe available because their publication could disclose confidential information. Infor-mation on uses may be obtained from published sources but is often complemented bydirect contact with manufacturers. Efforts are made to supplement this information withdata from other national and international sources. Six months before the meeting, the material obtained is sent to meeting participants, or is used by IARC staff, to prepare sections for the first drafts of monographs. The firstdrafts are compiled by IARC staff and sent before the meeting to all participants of theWorking Group for review. The Working Group meets in Lyon for seven to eight days to discuss and finalize the texts of the monographs and to formulate the evaluations. After the meeting, the mastercopy of each monograph is verified by consulting the original literature, edited and pre-pared for publication. The aim is to publish monographs within six months of theWorking Group meeting. The available studies are summarized by the Working Group, with particular regard to the qualitative aspects discussed below. In general, numerical findings are indicated asthey appear in the original report; units are converted when necessary for easier compa-rison. The Working Group may conduct additional analyses of the published data and usethem in their assessment of the evidence; the results of such supplementary analyses aregiven in square brackets. When an important aspect of a study, directly impinging on itsinterpretation, should be brought to the attention of the reader, a comment is given insquare brackets. 7. EXPOSURE DATA Sections that indicate the extent of past and present human exposure, the sources of exposure, the people most likely to be exposed and the factors that contribute to theexposure are included at the beginning of each monograph. Most monographs on individual chemicals, groups of chemicals or complex mixtures include sections on chemical and physical data, on analysis, on production and use andon occurrence. In monographs on, for example, physical agents, occupational exposuresand cultural habits, other sections may be included, such as: historical perspectives, des-cription of an industry or habit, chemistry of the complex mixture or taxonomy. Mono-PREAMBLE 13 graphs on biological agents have sections on structure and biology, methods of detection, epidemiology of infection and clinical disease other than cancer. For chemical exposures, the Chemical Abstracts Services Registry Number, the latest Chemical Abstracts primary name and the IUPAC systematic name are recorded; othersynonyms are given, but the list is not necessarily comprehensive. For biological agents,taxonomy and structure are described, and the degree of variability is given, whenapplicable. Information on chemical and physical properties and, in particular, data relevant to identification, occurrence and biological activity are included. For biological agents,mode of replication, life cycle, target cells, persistence and latency and host response aregiven. A description of technical products of chemicals includes trade names, relevantspecifications and available information on composition and impurities. Some of thetrade names given may be those of mixtures in which the agent being evaluated is onlyone of the ingredients. The purpose of the section on analysis or detection is to give the reader an overview of current methods, with emphasis on those widely used for regulatory purposes.Methods for monitoring human exposure are also given, when available. No critical eva-luation or recommendation of any of the methods is meant or implied. The IARCpublished a series of volumes, Environmental Carcinogens: Methods of Analysis and Exposure Measurement (IARC, 1978-93), that describe validated methods for analysing a wide variety of chemicals and mixtures. For biological agents, methods of detectionand exposure assessment are described, including their sensitivity, specificity andreproducibility. The dates of first synthesis and of first commercial production of a chemical or mixture are provided; for agents which do not occur naturally, this information mayallow a reasonable estimate to be made of the date before which no human exposure tothe agent could have occurred. The dates of first reported occurrence of an exposure arealso provided. In addition, methods of synthesis used in past and present commercialproduction and different methods of production which may give rise to different impu-rities are described. Data on production, international trade and uses are obtained for representative regions, which usually include Europe, Japan and the United States of America. It shouldnot, however, be inferred that those areas or nations are necessarily the sole or majorsources or users of the agent. Some identified uses may not be current or major appli-cations, and the coverage is not necessarily comprehensive. In the case of drugs, mentionof their therapeutic uses does not necessarily represent current practice, nor does it implyjudgement as to their therapeutic efficacy. Information on the occurrence of an agent or mixture in the environment is obtained from data derived from the monitoring and surveillance of levels in occupational envi-ronments, air, water, soil, foods and animal and human tissues. When available, data onthe generation, persistence and bioaccumulation of the agent are also included. In thecase of mixtures, industries, occupations or processes, information is given about allagents present. For processes, industries and occupations, a historical description is also given, noting variations in chemical composition, physical properties and levels of occu-pational exposure with time and place. For biological agents, the epidemiology ofinfection is described. Statements concerning regulations and guidelines (e.g., pesticide registrations, maximal levels permitted in foods, occupational exposure limits) are included for somecountries as indications of potential exposures, but they may not reflect the most recentsituation, since such limits are continuously reviewed and modified. The absence ofinformation on regulatory status for a country should not be taken to imply that thatcountry does not have regulations with regard to the exposure. For biological agents,legislation and control, including vaccines and therapy, are described. 8. STUDIES OF CANCER IN HUMANS (a)Types of studies considered Three types of epidemiological studies of cancer contribute to the assessment of carcinogenicity in humans \u2014 cohort studies, case-control studies and correlation (orecological) studies. Rarely, results from randomized trials may be available. Case seriesand case reports of cancer in humans may also be reviewed. Cohort and case-control studies relate the exposures under study to the occurrence of cancer in individuals and provide an estimate of relative risk (ratio of incidence ormortality in those exposed to incidence or mortality in those not exposed) as the mainmeasure of association. In correlation studies, the units of investigation are usually whole populations (e.g. in particular geographical areas or at particular times), and cancer frequency is related toa summary measure of the exposure of the population to the agent, mixture or exposurecircumstance under study. Because individual exposure is not documented, however, acausal relationship is less easy to infer from correlation studies than from cohort andcase-control studies. Case reports generally arise from a suspicion, based on clinicalexperience, that the concurrence of two events \u2014 that is, a particular exposure andoccurrence of a cancer \u2014 has happened rather more frequently than would be expectedby chance. Case reports usually lack complete ascertainment of cases in any population,definition or enumeration of the population at risk and estimation of the expected numberof cases in the absence of exposure. The uncertainties surrounding interpretation of casereports and correlation studies make them inadequate, except in rare instances, to formthe sole basis for inferring a causal relationship. When taken together with case-controland cohort studies, however, relevant case reports or correlation studies may addmaterially to the judgement that a causal relationship is present. Epidemiological studies of benign neoplasms, presumed preneoplastic lesions and other end-points thought to be relevant to cancer are also reviewed by working groups.They may, in some instances, strengthen inferences drawn from studies of cancer itself.IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 14PREAMBLE 15 (b)Quality of studies considered The Monographs are not intended to summarize all published studies. Those that are judged to be inadequate or irrelevant to the evaluation are generally omitted. They maybe mentioned briefly, particularly when the information is considered to be a usefulsupplement to that in other reports or when they provide the only data available. Theirinclusion does not imply acceptance of the adequacy of the study design or of theanalysis and interpretation of the results, and limitations are clearly outlined in squarebrackets at the end of the study description. It is necessary to take into account the possible roles of bias, confounding and chance in the interpretation of epidemiological studies. By 'bias' is meant the operation offactors in study design or execution that lead erroneously to a stronger or weaker asso-ciation than in fact exists between disease and an agent, mixture or exposure circum-stance. By 'confounding' is meant a situation in which the relationship with disease ismade to appear stronger or weaker than it truly is as a result of an association betweenthe apparent causal factor and another factor that is associated with either an increase ordecrease in the incidence of the disease. In evaluating the extent to which these factorshave been minimized in an individual study, working groups consider a number ofaspects of design and analysis as described in the report of the study. Most of these consi-derations apply equally to case-control, cohort and correlation studies. Lack of clarity ofany of these aspects in the reporting of a study can decrease its credibility and the weightgiven to it in the final evaluation of the exposure. Firstly, the study population, disease (or diseases) and exposure should have been well defined by the authors. Cases of disease in the study population should have beenidentified in a way that was independent of the exposure of interest, and exposure shouldhave been assessed in a way that was not related to disease status. Secondly, the authors should have taken account in the study design and analysis of other variables that can influence the risk of disease and may have been related to theexposure of interest. Potential confounding by such variables should have been dealt witheither in the design of the study, such as by matching, or in the analysis, by statisticaladjustment. In cohort studies, comparisons with local rates of disease may be moreappropriate than those with national rates. Internal comparisons of disease frequencyamong individuals at different levels of exposure should also have been made in thestudy. Thirdly, the authors should have reported the basic data on which the conclusions are founded, even if sophisticated statistical analyses were employed. At the very least, theyshould have given the numbers of exposed and unexposed cases and controls in acase-control study and the numbers of cases observed and expected in a cohort study.Further tabulations by time since exposure began and other temporal factors are alsoimportant. In a cohort study, data on all cancer sites and all causes of death should havebeen given, to reveal the possibility of reporting bias. In a case-control study, the effectsof investigated factors other than the exposure of interest should have been reported.IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 16 Finally, the statistical methods used to obtain estimates of relative risk, absolute rates of cancer, confidence intervals and significance tests, and to adjust for confoundingshould have been clearly stated by the authors. The methods used should preferably havebeen the generally accepted techniques that have been refined since the mid-1970s.These methods have been reviewed for case-control studies (Breslow & Day, 1980) andfor cohort studies (Breslow & Day, 1987). (c) Inferences about mechanism of action Detailed analyses of both relative and absolute risks in relation to temporal variables, such as age at first exposure, time since first exposure, duration of exposure, cumulativeexposure and time since exposure ceased, are reviewed and summarized when available.The analysis of temporal relationships can be useful in formulating models of carcino-genesis. In particular, such analyses may suggest whether a carcinogen acts early or latein the process of carcinogenesis, although at best they allow only indirect inferencesabout the mechanism of action. Special attention is given to measurements of biologicalmarkers of carcinogen exposure or action, such as DNA or protein adducts, as well asmarkers of early steps in the carcinogenic process, such as proto-oncogene mutation,when these are incorporated into epidemiological studies focused on cancer incidence ormortality. Such measurements may allow inferences to be made about putative mecha-nisms of action (IARC, 1991a; Vainio et al. , 1992). (d)Criteria for causality After the individual epidemiological studies of cancer have been summarized and the quality assessed, a judgement is made concerning the strength of evidence that the agent,mixture or exposure circumstance in question is carcinogenic for humans. In making itsjudgement, the Working Group considers several criteria for causality. A strong asso-ciation (a large relative risk) is more likely to indicate causality than a weak association,although it is recognized that relative risks of small magnitude do not imply lack ofcausality and may be important if the disease is common. Associations that are replicatedin several studies of the same design or using different epidemiological approaches orunder different circumstances of exposure are more likely to represent a causal relation-ship than isolated observations from single studies. If there are inconsistent resultsamong investigations, possible reasons are sought (such as differences in amount ofexposure), and results of studies judged to be of high quality are given more weight thanthose of studies judged to be methodologically less sound. When suspicion of carcino-genicity arises largely from a single study, these data are not combined with those fromlater studies in any subsequent reassessment of the strength of the evidence. If the risk of the disease in question increases with the amount of exposure, this is considered to be a strong indication of causality, although absence of a graded responseis not necessarily evidence against a causal relationship. Demonstration of a decline inPREAMBLE 17 risk after cessation of or reduction in exposure in individuals or in whole populations also supports a causal interpretation of the findings. Although a carcinogen may act upon more than one target, the specificity of an asso- ciation (an increased occurrence of cancer at one anatomical site or of one morphologicaltype) adds plausibility to a causal relationship, particularly when excess cancer occur-rence is limited to one morphological type within the same organ. Although rarely available, results from randomized trials showing different rates among exposed and unexposed individuals provide particularly strong evidence forcausality. When several epidemiological studies show little or no indication of an association between an exposure and cancer, the judgement may be made that, in the aggregate, theyshow evidence of lack of carcinogenicity. Such a judgement requires first of all that thestudies giving rise to it meet, to a sufficient degree, the standards of design and analysisdescribed above. Specifically, the possibility that bias, confounding or misclassificationof exposure or outcome could explain the observed results should be considered andexcluded with reasonable certainty. In addition, all studies that are judged to be methodo-logically sound should be consistent with a relative risk of unity for any observed levelof exposure and, when considered together, should provide a pooled estimate of relativerisk which is at or near unity and has a narrow confidence interval, due to sufficient popu-lation size. Moreover, no individual study nor the pooled results of all the studies shouldshow any consistent tendency for the relative risk of cancer to increase with increasinglevel of exposure. It is important to note that evidence of lack of carcinogenicity obtainedin this way from several epidemiological studies can apply only to the type(s) of cancerstudied and to dose levels and intervals between first exposure and observation of diseasethat are the same as or less than those observed in all the studies. Experience with humancancer indicates that, in some cases, the period from first exposure to the development ofclinical cancer is seldom less than 20 years; studies with latent periods substantiallyshorter than 30 years cannot provide evidence for lack of carcinogenicity. 9. STUDIES OF CANCER IN EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS All known human carcinogens that have been studied adequately in experimental animals have produced positive results in one or more animal species (Wilbourn et al. , 1986; Tomatis et in experimental animals was established orhighly suspected before epidemiological studies confirmed their carcinogenicity inhumans (Vainio et al. , 1995). Although this association cannot establish that all agentsand mixtures that cause cancer in experimental animals also cause cancer in humans, nevertheless, in the absence of adequate data on humans, it is biologically plausible and prudent to regard agents and mixtures for which there is sufficient evidence (see p. 24) of carcinogenicity in experimental animals as if they presented a carcinogenicrisk to humans . The possibility that a given agent may cause cancer through a species- specific mechanism which does not operate in humans (see p. 27) should also be takeninto consideration. The nature and extent of impurities or contaminants present in the chemical or mixture being evaluated are given when available. Animal strain, sex, numbers pergroup, age at start of treatment and survival are reported. Other types of studies summarized include: experiments in which the agent or mixture was administered in conjunction with known carcinogens or factors that modifycarcinogenic effects; studies in which the end-point was not cancer but a definedprecancerous lesion; and experiments on the carcinogenicity of known metabolites andderivatives. For experimental studies of mixtures, consideration is given to the possibility of changes in the physicochemical properties of the test substance during collection,storage, extraction, concentration and delivery. Chemical and toxicological interactionsof the components of mixtures may result in nonlinear dose-response relationships. An assessment is made as to the relevance to human exposure of samples tested in experimental animals, which may involve consideration of: (i) physical and chemicalcharacteristics, (ii) constituent substances that indicate the presence of a class ofsubstances, (iii) the results of tests for genetic and related effects, including studies onDNA adduct formation, proto-oncogene mutation and expression and suppressor geneinactivation. The relevance of results obtained, for example, with animal virusesanalogous to the virus being evaluated in the monograph must also be considered. Theymay provide biological and mechanistic information relevant to the understanding of theprocess of carcinogenesis in humans and may strengthen the plausibility of a conclusionthat the biological agent under evaluation is carcinogenic in humans. (a)Qualitative aspects An assessment of carcinogenicity involves several considerations of qualitative importance, including (i) the experimental conditions under which the test was per-formed, including route and schedule of exposure, species, strain, sex, age, duration offollow-up; (ii) the consistency of the results, for example, across species and targetorgan(s); (iii) the spectrum of neoplastic response, from preneoplastic lesions and benigntumours to malignant neoplasms; and (iv) the possible role of modifying factors. As mentioned earlier (p. 11), the Monographs are not intended to summarize all published studies. Those studies in experimental animals that are inadequate (e.g., tooshort a duration, too few animals, poor survival; see below) or are judged irrelevant toIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 18PREAMBLE 19 the evaluation are generally omitted. Guidelines for conducting adequate long-term carcinogenicity experiments have been outlined (e.g. Montesano et al. , 1986). Considerations of importance to the Working Group in the interpretation and eva- luation of a particular study include: (i) how clearly the agent was defined and, in thecase of mixtures, how adequately the sample characterization was reported; (ii)whether the dose was adequately monitored, particularly in inhalation experiments;(iii) whether the doses and duration of treatment were appropriate and whether thesurvival of treated animals was similar to that of controls; (iv) whether there wereadequate numbers of animals per group; (v) whether animals of each sex were used;(vi) whether animals were allocated randomly to groups; (vii) whether the duration ofobservation was adequate; and (viii) whether the data were adequately reported. Ifavailable, recent data on the incidence of specific tumours in historical controls, aswell as in concurrent controls, should be taken into account in the evaluation of tumourresponse. When benign tumours occur together with and originate from the same cell type in an organ or tissue as malignant tumours in a particular study and appear to represent astage in the progression to malignancy, it may be valid to combine them in assessingtumour incidence (Huff et al. , 1989). The occurrence of lesions presumed to be pre- neoplastic may in certain instances aid in assessing the biological plausibility of any neo-plastic response observed. If an agent or mixture induces only benign neoplasms thatappear to be end-points that do not readily progress to malignancy, it should neverthelessbe suspected of being a carcinogen and requires further investigation. (b)Quantitative aspects The probability that tumours will occur may depend on the species, sex, strain and age of the animal, the dose of the carcinogen and the route and length of exposure.Evidence of an increased incidence of neoplasms with increased level of exposurestrengthens the inference of a causal association between the exposure and the develop-ment of neoplasms. The form of the dose-response relationship can vary widely, depending on the particular agent under study and the target organ. Both DNA damage and increased celldivision are important aspects of carcinogenesis, and cell proliferation is a strong deter-minant of dose-response relationships for some carcinogens (Cohen & Ellwein, 1990).Since many chemicals require metabolic activation before being converted into theirreactive intermediates, both metabolic and pharmacokinetic aspects are important indetermining the dose-response pattern. Saturation of steps such as absorption, activation,inactivation and elimination may produce nonlinearity in the dose-response relationship,as could saturation of processes such as DNA repair (Hoel et al. , 1983; Gart et al. , 1986). (c) Statistical analysis of long-term experiments in animals Factors considered by the Working Group include the adequacy of the information given for each treatment group: (i) the number of animals studied and the numberexamined histologically, (ii) the number of animals with a given tumour type and(iii) length of survival. The statistical methods used should be clearly stated and shouldbe the generally accepted techniques refined for this purpose (Peto et al. , 1980; Gart et al. , 1986). When there is no difference in survival between control and treatment groups, the Working Group usually compares the proportions of animals developing eachtumour type in each of the groups. Otherwise, consideration is given as to whether or notappropriate adjustments have been made for differences in survival. These adjustmentscan include: comparisons of the proportions of tumour-bearing animals among theeffective number of animals (alive at the time the first tumour is discovered), in the casewhere most differences in survival occur before tumours appear; life-table methods,when tumours are visible or when be considered 'fatal' because mortalityrapidly follows tumour development; and the Mantel-Haenszel test logistic regression,when occult tumours do not affect the animals' risk of dying but are 'incidental' findingsat autopsy. In practice, classifying tumours as fatal or incidental may be difficult. Several survival-adjusted methods have been developed that do not require this distinction (Gartet al. , 1986), although they have not been fully evaluated. 10. OTHER DATA RELEV ANT TO AN EV ALUATION OF CARCINOGENICITY AND ITS MECHANISMS In coming to an overall evaluation of carcinogenicity in humans (see pp. 25-27), the Working Group also considers related data. The nature of the information selected for thesummary depends on the agent being considered. For chemicals and complex mixtures of chemicals such as those in some occupa- tional situations or involving cultural habits (e.g. tobacco smoking), the other data consi-dered to be relevant are divided into those on absorption, distribution, metabolism andexcretion; toxic effects; reproductive and developmental effects; and genetic and relatedeffects. Concise information is given on absorption, distribution (including placental transfer) and excretion in both humans and experimental animals. Kinetic factors thatmay affect the dose-response relationship, such as saturation of uptake, protein binding,metabolic activation, detoxification and DNA repair processes, are mentioned. Studiesthat indicate the metabolic fate of the agent in humans and in experimental animals aresummarized briefly, and comparisons of data on humans and on animals are made whenpossible. Comparative information on the relationship between exposure and the dosethat reaches the target site may be of particular importance for extrapolation betweenspecies. Data are given on acute and chronic toxic effects (other than cancer), such asIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 20PREAMBLE 21 organ toxicity, increased cell proliferation, immunotoxicity and endocrine effects. The presence and toxicological significance of cellular receptors is described. Effects onreproduction, teratogenicity, fetotoxicity and embryotoxicity are also summarizedbriefly. Tests of genetic and related effects are described in view of the relevance of gene mutation and chromosomal damage to carcinogenesis (Vainio et al. , 1992; McGregor et al. , 1999). The adequacy of the reporting of sample characterization is considered and, where necessary, commented upon; with regard to complex mixtures, such comments aresimilar to those described for animal carcinogenicity tests on p. 18. The available dataare interpreted critically by phylogenetic group according to the end-points detected,which may include DNA damage, gene mutation, sister chromatid exchange, micro-nucleus formation, chromosomal aberrations, aneuploidy and cell transformation. Theconcentrations employed are given, and mention is made of whether use of an exogenousmetabolic system in vitro affected the test result. These data are given as listings of test systems, data and references. The data on genetic and related effects presented in theMonographs are also available in the form of genetic activity profiles (GAP) prepared in collaboration with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (see alsoWaters et al. , 1987) using software for personal computers that are Microsoft Windows \u00ae compatible. The EPA/IARC GAP software and database may be downloaded free of charge from www.epa.gov/gapdb . Positive results in tests using prokaryotes, lower eukaryotes, plants, insects and cultured mammalian cells suggest that genetic and related effects could occur inmammals. Results from such tests may also give information about the types of geneticeffect produced and about the involvement of metabolic activation. Some end-pointsdescribed are clearly genetic in nature (e.g., gene mutations and chromosomal aberra-tions), while others are to a greater or lesser degree associated with genetic effects (e.g.unscheduled DNA synthesis). In-vitro tests for tumour-promoting activity and for celltransformation may be sensitive to changes that are not necessarily the result of geneticalterations but that may have specific relevance to the process of carcinogenesis. Acritical appraisal of these tests has been published (Montesano et al. , 1986). Genetic or other activity detected in experimental mammals and humans is regarded as being of greater relevance than that in other organisms. The demonstration that anagent or mixture can induce gene and chromosomal mutations in whole mammals indi-cates that it may have carcinogenic activity, although this activity may not be detectablyexpressed in any or all species. Relative potency in tests for mutagenicity and relatedeffects is not a reliable indicator of carcinogenic potency. Negative results in tests formutagenicity in selected tissues from animals treated in vivo provide less weight, partly because they do not exclude the possibility of an effect in tissues other than thoseexamined. Moreover, negative results in short-term tests with genetic end-points cannotbe considered to provide evidence to rule out carcinogenicity of agents or mixtures thatact through other mechanisms (e.g. receptor-mediated effects, cellular toxicity withregenerative proliferation, peroxisome proliferation) (Vainio et al. , 1992). Factors thatmay lead to misleading results in short-term tests have been discussed in detail elsewhere (Montesano et al. , 1986). When available, data relevant to mechanisms of carcinogenesis that do not involve structural changes at the level of the gene are also described. The adequacy of epidemiological studies of reproductive outcome and genetic and related effects in humans is evaluated by the same criteria as are applied to epidemio-logical studies of cancer. Structure-activity relationships that may be relevant to an evaluation of the carcino- genicity of an agent are also described. For biological agents \u2014 viruses, bacteria and parasites \u2014 other data relevant to carcinogenicity include descriptions of the pathology of infection, molecular biology(integration and expression of viruses, and any genetic alterations seen in humantumours) and other observations, which might include cellular and tissue responses toinfection, immune response and the presence of tumour markers. 11. SUMMARY OF DATA REPORTED In this section, the relevant epidemiological and experimental data are summarized. Only reports, other than in abstract form, that meet the criteria outlined on p. 11 areconsidered for evaluating carcinogenicity. Inadequate studies are generally not summarized:such studies are usually identified by a square-bracketed comment in the preceding text. (a)Exposure Human exposure to chemicals and complex mixtures is summarized on the basis of elements such as production, use, occurrence in the environment and determinations inhuman tissues and body fluids. Quantitative data are given when available. Exposure tobiological agents is described in terms of transmission and prevalence of infection. (b)Carcinogenicity in humans Results of epidemiological studies that are considered to be pertinent to an assessment of human carcinogenicity are summarized. When relevant, case reports andcorrelation studies are also summarized. (c) Carcinogenicity in experimental animals Data relevant to an evaluation of carcinogenicity in animals are summarized. For each animal species and route of administration, it is stated whether an increasedincidence of neoplasms or preneoplastic lesions was observed, and the tumour sites areindicated. If the agent or mixture produced tumours after prenatal exposure or in single-dose experiments, this is also indicated. Negative findings are also summarized. Dose-response and other quantitative data may be given when available. IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 22PREAMBLE 23 (d)Other data relevant to an evaluation of carcinogenicity and its mechanisms Data on biological effects in humans that are of particular relevance are summarized. These may include toxicological, kinetic and metabolic considerations and evidence ofDNA binding, persistence of DNA lesions or genetic damage in exposed humans. Toxi-cological information, such as that on cytotoxicity and regeneration, receptor bindingand hormonal and immunological effects, and data on kinetics and metabolism inexperimental animals are given when considered relevant to the possible mechanism ofthe carcinogenic action of the agent. The results of tests for genetic and related effectsare summarized for whole mammals, cultured mammalian cells and nonmammaliansystems. When available, comparisons of such data for humans and for animals, and parti- cularly animals that have developed cancer, are described. Structure-activity relationships are mentioned when relevant.For the agent, mixture or exposure circumstance being evaluated, the available data on end-points or other phenomena relevant to mechanisms of carcinogenesis from studies inhumans, experimental animals and tissue and cell test systems are summarized within oneor more of the following descriptive dimensions: (i) Evidence of genotoxicity (structural changes at the level of the gene): for example, structure-activity considerations, adduct formation, mutagenicity (effect onspecific genes), chromosomal mutation/aneuploidy (ii) Evidence of effects on the expression of relevant genes (functional changes at the intracellular level): for example, alterations to the structure or quantity of the productof a proto-oncogene or tumour-suppressor gene, alterations to metabolic activation/inac-tivation/DNA repair (iii) Evidence of relevant effects on cell behaviour (morphological or behavioural changes at the cellular or tissue level): for example, induction of mitogenesis, compen-satory cell proliferation, mali-gnant cells (immortalization, immunosuppression), effects on metastatic potential (iv) Evidence from dose and time relationships of carcinogenic effects and inter- actions between agents: for example, early/late stage, as inferred from epidemiologicalstudies; initiation/promotion/progression/malignant conversion, as defined in animalcarcinogenicity experiments; toxicokinetics These dimensions are not mutually exclusive, and an agent may fall within more than one of them. Thus, for example, the action of an agent on the expression of relevant genescould be summarized under both the first and second dimensions, even if it were knownwith reasonable certainty that those effects resulted from genotoxicity. 12. EV ALUATION Evaluations of the strength of the evidence for carcinogenicity arising from human and experimental animal data are made, using standard terms.It is recognized that the criteria for these evaluations, described below, cannot encompass all of the factors that may be relevant to an evaluation of carcinogenicity. Inconsidering all of the relevant scientific data, the Working Group may assign the agent,mixture or exposure circumstance to a higher or lower category than a strict inter-pretation of these criteria would indicate. (a)Degrees of evidence for carcinogenicity in humans and in experimental animals and supporting evidence These categories refer only to the strength of the evidence that an exposure is carcino- genic and not to the extent of its carcinogenic activity (potency) nor to the mechanismsinvolved. A classification may change as new information becomes available. An evaluation of degree of evidence, whether for a single agent or a mixture, is limited to the materials tested, as defined physically, chemically or biologically. When the agentsevaluated are considered by the Working Group to be sufficiently closely related, theymay be grouped together for the purpose of a single evaluation of degree of evidence. (i) Carcinogenicity in humans The applicability of an evaluation of the carcinogenicity of a mixture, process, occu- pation or industry on the basis of evidence from epidemiological studies depends on thevariability over time and place of the mixtures, processes, occupations and industries.The Working Group seeks to identify the specific exposure, process or activity which isconsidered most likely to be responsible for any excess risk. The evaluation is focused asnarrowly as the available data on exposure and other aspects permit. The evidence relevant to carcinogenicity from studies in humans is classified into one of the following categories: Sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity : The Working Group considers that a causal relationship has been established between exposure to the agent, mixture or exposurecircumstance and human cancer. That is, a positive relationship has been observedbetween the exposure and cancer in studies in which chance, bias and confounding couldbe ruled out with reasonable confidence. Limited evidence of carcinogenicity : A positive association has been observed between exposure to the agent, mixture or exposure circumstance and cancer for whicha causal interpretation is considered by the Working Group to be credible, but chance,bias or confounding could not be ruled out with reasonable confidence. Inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity : The available studies are of insufficient quality, consistency or statistical power to permit a conclusion regarding the presence orabsence of a causal association between exposure and cancer, or no data on cancer inhumans are available. Evidence suggesting lack of carcinogenicity : There are several adequate studies covering the full range of levels of exposure that human beings are known to encounter,which are mutually consistent in not showing a positive association between exposure toIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 24PREAMBLE 25 the agent, mixture or exposure circumstance and any studied cancer at any observed level of exposure. A conclusion of 'evidence suggesting lack of carcinogenicity' is inevitablylimited to the cancer sites, conditions and levels of exposure and length of observationcovered by the available studies. In addition, the possibility of a very small risk at thelevels of exposure studied can never be excluded. In some instances, the above categories may be used to classify the degree of evi- dence related to carcinogenicity in specific organs or tissues. (ii) Carcinogenicity in experimental animals The evidence relevant to carcinogenicity in experimental animals is classified into one of the following categories: Sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity : The Working Group considers that a causal relationship has been established between the agent or mixture and an increased inci-dence of malignant neoplasms or of an appropriate combination of benign and malignantneoplasms in (a) two or more species of animals or (b) in two or more independentstudies in one species carried out at different times or in different laboratories or underdifferent protocols. Exceptionally, a single study in one species might be considered to provide sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity when malignant neoplasms occur to an unusual degree withregard to incidence, site, type of tumour or age at onset. Limited evidence of carcinogenicity : The data suggest a carcinogenic effect but are limited for making a definitive evaluation because, e.g. (a) the evidence of carcino-genicity is restricted to a single experiment; or (b) there are unresolved questionsregarding the adequacy of the design, conduct or interpretation of the study; or (c) theagent or mixture increases the incidence only of benign neoplasms or lesions of uncertainneoplastic potential, or of certain neoplasms which may occur spontaneously in highincidences in certain strains. Inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity : The studies cannot be interpreted as showing either the presence or absence of a carcinogenic effect because of major qualitative orquantitative limitations, or no data on cancer in experimental animals are available. Evidence suggesting lack of carcinogenicity : Adequate studies involving at least two species are available which show that, within the limits of the tests used, the agent ormixture is not carcinogenic. A conclusion of evidence suggesting lack of carcinogenicityis inevitably limited to the species, tumour sites and levels of exposure studied. (b)Other data relevant to the evaluation of carcinogenicity and its mechanisms Other evidence judged to be relevant to an evaluation of carcinogenicity and of sufficient importance to affect the overall evaluation is then described. This may includedata on preneoplastic lesions, tumour pathology, genetic and related effects, structure-activity relationships, metabolism and pharmacokinetics, physicochemical parametersand analogous biological agents.IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 26 Data relevant to mechanisms of the carcinogenic action are also evaluated. The strength of the evidence that any carcinogenic effect observed is due to a particularmechanism is assessed, using terms such as weak, moderate or strong. Then, the WorkingGroup assesses if that particular mechanism is likely to be operative in humans. Thestrongest indications that a particular mechanism operates in humans come from data onhumans or biological specimens obtained from exposed humans. The data may be consi-dered to be especially relevant if they show that the agent in question has caused changesin exposed humans that are on the causal pathway to carcinogenesis. Such data may,however, never become available, because it is at least conceivable that certain com-pounds may be kept from human use solely on the basis of evidence of their toxicityand/or carcinogenicity in experimental systems. For complex exposures, including occupational and industrial exposures, the chemical composition and the potential contribution of carcinogens known to be presentare considered by the Working Group in its overall evaluation of human carcinogenicity.The Working Group also determines the extent to which the materials tested in experi-mental systems are related to those to which humans are exposed. (c) Overall evaluation Finally, the body of evidence is considered as a whole, in order to reach an overall evaluation of the carcinogenicity to humans of an agent, mixture or circumstance ofexposure. An evaluation may be made for a group of chemical compounds that have been eva- luated by the Working Group. In addition, when supporting data indicate that other,related compounds for which there is no direct evidence of capacity to induce cancer inhumans or in animals may also be carcinogenic, a statement describing the rationale forthis conclusion is added to the evaluation narrative; an additional evaluation may bemade for this broader group of compounds if the strength of the evidence warrants it. The agent, mixture or exposure circumstance is described according to the wording of one of the following categories, and the designated group is given. The categorizationof an agent, mixture or exposure circumstance is a matter of scientific judgement, reflec-ting the strength of the evidence derived from studies in humans and in experimentalanimals and from other relevant data. Group 1 \u2014 The agent (mixture) is carcinogenic to humans.The exposure circumstance entails exposures that are carcinogenic to humans. This category is used when there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans. Exceptionally, an agent (mixture) may be placed in this category when evidence of carci-nogenicity in humans is less than sufficient but there is sufficient evidence of carcino- genicity in experimental animals and strong evidence in exposed humans that the agent(mixture) acts through a relevant mechanism of carcinogenicity.Group 2 This category includes agents, mixtures and exposure circumstances for which, at one extreme, the degree of evidence of carcinogenicity in humans is almost sufficient, aswell as those for which, at the other extreme, there are no human data but for which thereis evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. Agents, mixtures and exposurecircumstances are assigned to either group 2A (probably carcinogenic to humans) orgroup 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans) on the basis of epidemiological and experi-mental evidence of carcinogenicity and other relevant data. Group 2A \u2014 The agent (mixture) is probably carcinogenic to humans.The exposure circumstance entails exposures that are probably carcinogenic tohumans. This category is used when there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. In some cases, an agent (mixture) may be classified in this category when there is inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity in humans, sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals and strong evidence that the carcinogenesis is mediated by a mechanism thatalso operates in humans. Exceptionally, an agent, mixture or exposure circumstance maybe classified in this category solely on the basis of limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans. Group 2B \u2014 The agent (mixture) is possibly carcinogenic to humans.The exposure circumstance entails exposures that are possibly carcinogenic tohumans. This category is used for agents, mixtures and exposure circumstances for which there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and less than sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. It may also be used when there is inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity in humans but there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. In some instances, an agent, mixture or exposure circumstancefor which there is inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity in humans but limited evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals together with supporting evidence from otherrelevant data may be placed in this group. Group 3 \u2014 The agent (mixture or exposure circumstance) is not classifiable as to itscarcinogenicity to humans. This category is used most commonly for agents, mixtures and exposure circums- tances for which the evidence of carcinogenicity is inadequate in humans and inadequate or limited in experimental animals. Exceptionally, agents (mixtures) for which the evidence of carcinogenicity is inade- quate in humans but sufficient in experimental animals may be placed in this categoryPREAMBLE 27when there is strong evidence that the mechanism of carcinogenicity in experimental animals does not operate in humans. Agents, mixtures and exposure circumstances that do not fall into any other group are also placed in this category. Group 4 \u2014 The agent (mixture) is probably not carcinogenic to humans. This category is used for agents or mixtures for which there is evidence suggesting lack of carcinogenicity in humans and in experimental animals. In some instances, agents or mixtures for which there is inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity in humans but evidence suggesting lack of carcinogenicity in experimental animals, consistently and strongly supported by a broad range of other relevant data, may be classified in this group. 13.

Of these, the Monographs have previously evaluated several of the pyrrolizidine alkaloids that occur in certain species of Senecio , and other plant genera, mycotoxins, (IARC, 1993b); and styrene (IARC, 1994). These previous evaluations are summarized in Table 1. -33-Table 1.

The existing Group 1 evaluation of naturally occurring aflatoxins was reaffirmed. Traditional herbal medicines Traditional herbal medicines encompass an extremely diverse group of preparations, and originate from many different cultures. Many herbal medicines have emerged fromhealing traditions around the world. Digitalis (from the dried leaf of Digitalis pur- purea L.) and quinine (from the cinchona tree, Cinchona pubescens Vahl) are well-known examples of valuable therapeutic products of botanical origin. Some herbalproducts in current use in many parts of the world, such as ginseng (e.g., from Panax ginseng C.A. Mey) and valerian (e.g., from Valeriana officinalis L.), have long standing for their modest efficacy and few side-effects. Some, however, such as ephedra (e.g.,from Ephedra sinica Stapf) have been imported from traditional healing systems and then used for indications (weight loss, athletic performance enhancement) never contem-plated in the traditions from which they emerged. Rather few data on possible carcinogenic hazards of any of these substances have been collected until recently. Previous IARC Monographs have reviewed a small number of food plants (cycad nuts, bracken fern) and some natural products that occur in theseand other plants for which there were published data on carcinogenicity in experimentalanimals (Table 2). The only substance listed in Table 2 that has been used for medicinalpurposes is dantron (1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone), which was once widely used as astimulant laxative. The naturally occurring glycoside derivatives of 1,8-dihydroxyanthra-quinone are the pharmacologically active constituents of a herbal purgative (laxative)preparation, senna, which is obtained from the dried leaflets or seed pods of the sub-tropical shrubs, Cassia (Senna) acutifolia and The cathartic properties of senna have been known for centuries, and were alreadydescribed in Arabic writings in the ninth century. No data were available to previousworking groups on cancer risk in humans exposed to any of the substances in Table 2,except bracken fern. Several of these compounds, however, including dantron, are potentcarcinogens in experimental animals. It is clear from these examples that some natural products derived from plants are carcinogenic, including certain compounds that are present in, and may be the activeingredients of, some traditional herbal medicines. It is a reasonable inference that othersmay be also. Data relating to three categories of natural products used in herbal medi-cines are reviewed in separate sections of this volume. The first section considers the Aristolochia species and some of their chemical constituents. Roots of plants of the genus Aristolochia have recently been imported from China and sold in Europe in powdered form, to be taken by mouth in capsules as an aidto body weight reduction. Nephrotoxicity and urothelial carcinomas have occurred inindividuals who consumed these products. Carcinogenic risks associated with theseIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 34preparations are evaluated for the first time. The carcinogenicity of aristolochic acids (nitrophenanthrene compounds that are natural products of this genus of plants) is alsoevaluated for the first time in this volume. The second section deals with some anthraquinone derivatives that are structurally related to the previously evaluated 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone. These compoundsoccur naturally in certain herbaceous plants that have been used in some traditionalOriental medicinal preparations. The final section of the herbal medicines monograph concerns toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids including riddelliine that occur in widely distributed genera of wildplants including Senecio , Crotalaria and some others. In western North America these plants co-exist with edible forage plants and may be ingested by livestock. The alkaloidsmay contaminate foods derived from these animals, including meat and milk, and maybe found in honey (National Toxicology Program, 2001). Riddelliine occurs in the plantSenecio longilobus , which has been used as a herbal tea called 'gordolobo yerba' by members of the Mexican-American community in the south-western region of the USA,and has been linked with acute hepatic veno-occlusive disease al., 1977; Segall Monographs programme (IARC, 1976). Experimental carcinogenicity data on riddelliine available at that time were considered insufficient to evaluate the carcino-genicity of this compound, and there were no data on cancer risks in humans who mighthave been exposed to it either in food or as a traditional herbal medicine. Riddelliine wasGENERAL REMARKS ON THE SUBSTANCES CONSIDERED 35 Table 2.

A recent bioassay of riddelliine for carcinogenicity conductedby the US National Toxicology Program provides important new data on this compound(National Toxicology Program, 2001) and is the basis for its re-evaluation in this volume. Mycotoxins Aflatoxins comprise four secondary metabolites of toxins produced by a number of species of Aspergillus of which A. flavus and A. parasiticus are the most common. These fungi and their toxins contaminate maize and peanuts (groundnuts) along with othercommodities in the field and when improperly stored. Naturally occurring aflatoxins andaflatoxin B 1were previously reviewed and evaluated in V olume 56 (IARC, 1993a). Naturally occurring aflatoxins (as a group) were evaluated as carcino- genic to humans (Group 1). Aflatoxin M1, the metabolite of aflatoxin B1found in the milk of lactating mammals, was classified in Group 2B as possibly carcinogenic to humans (IARC, 1993a) (Table 1). An update of the scientific literature on these substances is provided in this volume. The existing Group 1 evaluation of naturallyoccurring aflatoxins was reaffirmed; an update was undertaken because of the concurrentre-evaluation of another mycotoxin, fumonisin B 1. Mention is also made in this monograph of carcinogenicity studies of materials containing aflatoxins that have been treated with ammonia by a number of methods toreduce aflatoxin content. These processes result in a number of known and unknownreaction products which are not evaluated as such in this monograph; the elimination ofthe carcinogenicity of aflatoxin B 1in ammoniated feed as well as the reduction of the mutagenicity and carcinogenicity due to aflatoxin M1in milk from dairy cows fed ammoniated feed was noted. This monograph also contains an annex on the causes andoccurrence of aflatoxin contamination and on the management of this problem. The fungi Fusarium verticillioides (Sacc.) Nirenburg (formerly known as proliferatum are maize endophytes. Fumonisins are toxins produced by these fungi. Under environmental conditions that result in stress of the plant,the maize disease 'Fusarium kernel rot' occurs and the crop may become contaminatedwith fumonisins. Experimental carcinogenicity data on these toxins in theprevious IARC Monographs review (IARC, 1993b) were from studies in which crude mixtures, rather than purified individual compounds, were fed to experimental animals,and the resulting evaluation was for 'toxins derived from Fusarium moniliforme ' (Table 1) (IARC, 1993b). New bioassays to assess the carcinogenicity of purified fumo-nisin B 1in experimental animals have been published since the previous IARC Mono- graphs evaluation. These bioassays, as well as numerous studies on the toxicity and mechanisms of action of fumonisin B1are reviewed and evaluated in the present volume.IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 36Naphthalene and styrene Naphthalene was originally planned for inclusion in IARC Monographs V olume 77, Some Industrial Chemicals (2000), but was withdrawn from consideration at that time because the Monographs programme became aware of new carcinogenicity studies of this compound that were nearing completion. These studies have now been published,and their results are included in the present evaluation. In addition, there are extensivenew data that contribute to understanding the mechanisms of carcinogenicity of thiscompound. Styrene is an important industrial chemical and a major intermediate in the manufacture of both synthetic rubber and certain plastics. It was previously evaluated bythe IARC Monographs programme in 1994 (IARC, 1994) (see Table 1). At that time it was classified in Group 2B as possibly carcinogenic to humans, on the basis of limited evidence for carcinogenicity in experimental animals that was supported by an extensive set of other relevant data, including biomarkers of exposure and of effect. Recently, newresults have been published on carcinogenicity of styrene in experimental animals byinhalation and on mechanistic aspects, which are included in the present re-evaluation.

History of Use of Traditional Herbal Medicines By definition, 'traditional' use of herbal medicines implies substantial historical use, and this is certainly true for many products that are available as 'traditional herbal medi-cines'. In many developing countries, a large proportion of the population relies on tradi-tional practitioners and their armamentarium of medicinal plants in order to meet healthcare needs. Although modern medicine may exist side-by-side with such traditionalpractice, herbal medicines have often maintained their popularity for historical andcultural reasons. Such products have become more widely available commercially, espe-cially in developed countries. In this modern setting, ingredients are sometimes marketedfor uses that were never contemplated in the traditional healing systems from which theyemerged. An example is the use of ephedra (= Ma huang) for weight loss or athleticperformance enhancement (Shaw, 1998). While in some countries, herbal medicines aresubject to rigorous manufacturing standards, this is not so everywhere. In Germany, forexample, where herbal products are sold as 'phytomedicines', they are subject to thesame criteria for efficacy, safety and quality as are other drug products. In the USA, bycontrast, most herbal products in the marketplace are marketed and regulated as dietarysupplements, a product category that does not require pre-approval of products on thebasis of any of these criteria. These matters are covered extensively in Section 3 below. 1.1 The role of herbal medicines in traditional healing The pharmacological treatment of disease began long ago with the use of herbs (Schulz et al., 2001). Methods of folk healing throughout the world commonly used herbs as part of their tradition. Some of these traditions are briefly described below,providing some examples of the array of important healing practices around the worldthat used herbs for this purpose. 1.1.1 Traditional Chinese medicine Traditional Chinese medicine has been used by Chinese people from ancient times. Although animal and mineral materials have been used, the primary source of remediesis botanical. Of the more than 12 000 items used by traditional healers, about 500 are incommon use (Li, 2000). Botanical products are used only after some kind of processing, -43-which may include, for example, stir-frying or soaking in vinegar or wine. In clinical practice, traditional diagnosis may be followed by the prescription of a complex andoften individualized remedy. Traditional Chinese medicine is still in common use in China. More than half the population regularly uses traditional remedies, with the highest prevalence of use in ruralareas. About 5000 traditional remedies are available in China; they account for approxi-mately one fifth of the entire Chinese pharmaceutical market (Li, 2000). 1.1.2 Japanese traditional medicine Many herbal remedies found their way from China into the Japanese systems of traditional healing. Herbs native to Japan were classified in the first pharmacopoeia ofJapanese traditional medicine in the ninth century (Saito, 2000). 1.1.3 Indian traditional medicine Ayurveda is a medical system primarily practised in India that has been known for nearly 5000 years. It includes diet and herbal remedies, while emphasizing the body,mind and spirit in disease prevention and treatment (Morgan, 2002). 1.2 Introduction of traditional herbal medicines into Europe, the USA and other developed countries The desire to capture the wisdom of traditional healing systems has led to a resur- gence of interest in herbal medicines (Tyler, 2000), particularly in Europe and NorthAmerica, where herbal products have been incorporated into so-called 'alternative','complementary', 'holistic' or 'integrative' medical systems. During the latter part of the twentieth century, increasing interest in self-care resulted in an enormous growth in popularity of traditional healing modalities, including the useof herbal remedies; this has been particularly true in the USA. Consumers have reportedpositive attitudes towards these products, in large part because they believe them to be of'natural' rather than 'synthetic' origin, they believe that such products are more likely tobe safe than are drugs, they are considered part of a healthy lifestyle, and they can helpto avoid unnecessary contact with conventional 'western' medicine. While centuries of use in traditional settings can be used as testimony that a parti- cular herbal ingredient is effective or safe, several problems must be addressed as theseingredients are incorporated into modern practice. One problem is that ingredients once used for symptomatic management in tradi- tional healing are now used in developed countries as part of health promotion or diseaseprevention strategies; thus, acute treatment has been replaced by chronic exposure (e.g.,herbal products used for weight loss, Allison et al. , 2001). This means that a statement about 'thousands of years of evidence that a product is safe' may not be valid for the wayIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 44the product is now being used. This does not expressly mean that an ingredient is unsafe; it does mean that safety in the modern context cannot be assumed. A second problem is that efficacy and effectiveness have rarely been demonstrated using modern scientific investigations. An evidence-based approach to this issue hasonly recently been implemented, and the results reveal that for most herbal products,considerable gaps in knowledge need to be remedied before one can be convinced abouttheir efficacy. One of the most difficult issues to contend with in translating traditional herbal practices into conventional 'western' medicine is the individualization of prescriptionscontaining multiple herbal and other ingredients. There is little incentive for standar-dization of products for a mass market, when the intention has been to provide an indivi-dual prescription. To the small grower or the traditionally trained herbalist, standar-dization means understanding the growth conditions, the time of harvesting, the mannerof extraction or other preparation of material so that a reliable (albeit small amount of)active ingredient can be offered to people. To the manufacturer or distributor of largequantities that will be sold in a supermarket or a health food store, standardization refersto industrial production under defined conditions, using so-called Good ManufacturingPractices (GMP) (Food & Drug Administration, 2002) akin to those used for drugproduction. In the USA, there is both small-scale and large-scale production of herbal products and there can be wide variation in their content and quality in the marketplace. Regu-lations in the USA do not yet require that dietary supplement manufacturers adhere tostandard manufacturing practices, and so quality is not guaranteed (see Section 3). Thepublic becomes discouraged by reports that products taken from store shelves do notconsistently contain the ingredients \u2014 or in the amounts \u2014 that are claimed on the label. For herbal products in common use, evidence of efficacy may be based upon tradi- tional use, testimonials, clinical studies, both controlled and uncontrolled, and rando-mized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. For the most part, however, there is a lackof systematic clinical studies to support claims. Safety of some herbal ingredients has been recently called into question, in part because of the identification of adverse events associated with their use and, increasingly,because of the demonstration of clinically relevant interactions between herbs and pres-cription drugs. Adverse events (stroke, heart attacks, heart-rate irregularities, liver toxicity, seizures, psychoses and death) associated with use of ephedra for weight loss, body-buildingeffects and increased energy or kava-kava (also known as kawa), widely used in Europeand increasingly in Canada to treat anxiety, nervousness, insomnia, pain and muscletension, for example, have caused some countries to issue regulations restricting orbanning these products (e.g. Health Canada Online, 2002a,b). Only a few herbs incommon use have been suspected of causing cancer. These discussed in detail below. SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 452. Use of Traditional Herbal Medicines in Developed Countries 2.1 Origin, type and botanical data Plants and their secondary metabolite constituents have a long history of use in modern 'western' medicine and in certain systems of traditional medicine, and are thesources of important drugs such as atropine, codeine, digoxin, morphine, quinine andvincristine. Use of herbal medicines in developed countries has expanded sharply in the latter half of the twentieth century. Monographs on selected herbs are available from a numberof sources, including the European Scientific Cooperative on Phytotherapy (ESCOP,1999), German Commission E (Blumenthal et al. , 1998) and the World Health Organi- zation (WHO, 1999). The WHO monographs, for example, describe the herb itself by anumber of criteria (including synonyms and vernacular names) and the herb partcommonly used, its geographical distribution, tests used to identify and characterize theherb (including macroscopic and microscopic examination and purity testing), the activeprinciples (when known), dosage forms and dosing, medicinal uses, pharmacology,contra-indications and adverse reactions. Other resources that provide detailed infor-mation about herbal products in current use include the Natural Medicines Compre-hensive Database (Jellin, 2002) and NAPRALERT (NAtural PRoducts ALERT) (2001).Information about other available databases has been published by Bhat (1995). 2.2 Medicinal applications, beneficial effects and active components In some cases, the active principles of plant-derived products have been isolated and characterized, and their mechanisms of action are understood (e.g., ephedrine alkaloidsin some species of Ephedra ). For many, however, including virtually all of the most common products in the marketplace, such information is incomplete or unavailable.This is in large part due to the complexity of herbal and botanical preparations; they arenot pure compounds. It is also a function of the traditionally-held belief that the syner-gistic combination of several active principles in some herbal preparations is responsiblefor their beneficial effects. 2.3 Trends in use Data on the global nutrition products industry, in which herbal and botanical products are often included, are given in Table 1.

This pattern of growth has been replicated elsewhere in the world (Table 2),although more recently, sales of herbal products have apparently experienced a decline. In the European Union (EU), in general, herbal products for which therapeutic claims are made must be marketed and regulated as drugs, while those that do not make suchclaims may be found in the food or cosmetic categories. Attempts are at present beingmade to harmonize the scientific and regulatory criteria that govern the marketing ofherbal products (AESGP, 1998). In 1994, when the Dietary Supplements Health and Education Act (DSHEA) was passed in the USA, approximately 50% of the adult population of the country wasreported to use dietary supplements and sales of all products combined were approxi-mately $4 billion. This category of products includes vitamins, minerals and a variety ofother ingredients; herbal products accounted for about one quarter of those sales. In2000, the last year for which comparable data are available, again 50% of the adultpopulation reported use of dietary supplements, and sales were close to $15 billion;herbals accounted for nearly one third of those sales. Table 3 identifies some trends inherbal supplement use in the USA from 1997 to 2000. In the 1990s, the USA saw the growth of government organizations concerned with dietary supplements, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Center forComplementary and Alternative Medicine and Office of Dietary Supplements, and theNational Cancer Institute (NCI) Chemoprevention Program of the Division of CancerPrevention and Control.

In Canada, herbal use has also increased. Berger (2001) noted, in summarizing the results of a 2001 survey of 2500 persons, 15 years of age and older, that herbal remedieswere used by 38% of respondents, up from 28% in 1999. A survey in 1998 of the mostpopular remedies reported in Canada is given in Table 4. In 1994, the European herbal medicine market was worth over \u00a31.8 billion [US$ 2.8 billion] at retail selling prices. Although the UK market was smaller than thatof Germany (in 1994 it was \u00a388 million, compared with \u00a31400 million), it had one of thehighest forecast growth rates in Europe (Shaw, 1998).SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 49 Table 3.

Awareness, Control, Regulation and Legislation on Use 3.1 WHO guidelines for herbal medicines In 1992, the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific invited a group of experts to develop criteria and general principles to guide research work on evaluating herbalmedicines (WHO, 1993). This group recognized the importance of herbal medicines tothe health of many people throughout the world, stating: 'A few herbal medicines havewithstood scientific testing, but others are used simply for traditional reasons to protect,restore, or improve health. Most herbal medicines still need to be studied scientifically,although the experience obtained from their traditional use over the years should not beignored. As there is not enough evidence produced by common scientific approaches toanswer questions of safety and efficacy about most of the herbal medicines now in use,the rational use and further development of herbal medicines will be supported by furtherappropriate scientific studies of these products, and thus the development of criteria forsuch studies'.

(2001) a From a survey of 6849 adults in April 1998 b See Table 3. c Reported previously as Matricaria chamomilla (WHO, 1999)The document covered such topics as developing protocols for clinical trials using herbal medicines, evaluating herbal medicine research, guidelines for quality specifi-cations of plant materials and preparations, and guidelines for pharmacodynamic andgeneral pharmacological studies of herbal medicines and for toxicity investigations ofherbal medicines. WHO has also issued Guidelines for the Assessment of Herbal Medicines (WHO, 1996). These guidelines defined the basic criteria for the evaluation of quality, safety andefficacy of herbal medicines with the goal of assisting national regulatory authorities,scientific organizations and manufacturers in assessing documentation, submissions anddossiers in respect of such products. It was recommended that such assessments take intoaccount long-term use in the country (over at least several decades), any description inthe medical and pharmaceutical literature or similar sources or documentation ofknowledge on the application of a herbal medicine, and marketing authorizations forsimilar products. Although prolonged and apparently uneventful use of a substanceusually offers testimony of its safety, investigation of the potential toxicity of naturallyoccurring substances may reveal previously unsuspected problems. It was also recom-mended that regulatory authorities have the authority to respond promptly to new infor-mation on toxicity by withdrawing or limiting the licences of registered products contai-ning suspect substances, or by reclassifying the substances to limit their use to medicalprescription. The guidelines stressed the need for assessment of efficacy including thedetermination of pharmacological and clinical effects of the active ingredients, andlabelling which includes a quantitative list of active ingredient(s), dosage, and contra-indications. 3.2 The European Union The Association Europ\u00e9enne des Sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9s Pharmaceutiques Grand Public (Asso- ciation of the Self-Medication Industry; AESGP) has carried out a study forthe European Commission on herbal medicinal products in the European Union (EU).The following summary is taken from this report (AESGP, 1998). The importance of herbal medicinal products varies from one country to another. These products are not a homogeneous group. In general, they are either fully licensedmedicinal products with efficacy proven by clinical studies or by references to publishedscientific literature (in accordance with Article 4.8 a (ii) of Council Directive65/65/EEC) (European Commission, 1965) or are available as products with a more orless simplified proof of efficacy according to their national use. Many Member Stateshave these two categories, but there are major discrepancies between the Member Statesin the classification of individual herbal drug preparations and products into one of thesecategories as well as in the requirements for obtaining a marketing authorization.SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 513.2.1 Definition of herbal medicinal products According to Council Directive 65/65/EEC (European Commission, 1965), which has been implemented in national law in all Member States, medicinal products requireprior marketing approval before gaining access to the market. In almost all MemberStates, herbal medicinal products are considered as medicinal products, and are, inprinciple, subject to the general regulations for medicines as laid down in the variousnational medicine laws. In many cases, a specific definition of herbal medicinal productsis available, which is in line with the EU Guideline 'Quality of Herbal MedicinalProducts'. This includes plants, parts of plants and their preparations, mostly presentedwith therapeutic or prophylactic claims. Different categories of medicinal productscontaining plant preparations exist or are in the process of being created. For instance,draft legislation in Spain includes the definitions 'herbal medicinal products' and'phytotraditional products'. The latter are not considered as 'pharmaceutical specialties'and are therefore not classified as herbal medicinal products. 3.2.2 Classification of herbal products Generally, herbal products are classified as medicinal products if they claim thera- peutic or prophylactic indication, and are not considered as medicinal products whenthey do not make these claims. Products not classified as medicinal in most cases belongto the food or cosmetic areas, although they sometimes contain plants which havepharmacological properties. For example, senna pods (from Cassia plants, used as laxatives) (see General Remarks and monograph on Rubia tinctorum , Morinda officinalis and anthraquinones in this volume) can be marketed as food in Belgium. Specific cate-gories of non-medicinal products exist in some Member States, such as the so-called'therapeutic supplement products' in Austria. In Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom,there exist preparations defined as medicinal products, which are under specific condi-tions exempt from licensing requirements. 3.2.3 Combination products Herbal ingredients used in combination are widely used in Europe, and their assessment is often performed according to specific guidelines. Combinations of herbaland homeopathic ingredients exist in a few countries. Their assessment follows ratherstrict criteria, usually those of a 'full' application procedure. Combinations of herbalingredients and vitamins are available in many countries. 3.2.4 Documentation of quality, safety and efficacy A marketing authorization for a herbal medicinal product is, in principle, granted based on an extensive dossier in terms of proof of quality, safety and efficacy in allMember States, with the exception of Denmark and Finland, where it is possible to useIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 52only references to published data for herbal medicinal products. Luxembourg, in practice, only grants marketing authorization based on the assessment of other countries.In principle, according to Article 4.8 (a) (ii) of Council Directive 65/65/EEC (EuropeanCommission, 1965), the option of using reviews on published data is available in allMember States. However, this 'bibliographical' option is sometimes only availablethrough assessment on a case-by-case basis or not used in practice. Austria permits thistype of application for safety documentation only. 3.2.5 ESCOP and WHO monographs European Scientific Cooperative on Phytotherapy (ESCOP) (see Awang, 1997) or WHO monographs may be used in many Member States as a summary of published data.Many regulatory authorities regard them as helpful documentation for clarifying efficacyand safety. The European Commission (EC), the EMEA (European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products) Executive Director and the EMEA Management Board esta-blished the EMEA Ad Hoc Group in 1997. This Working Group is made up of represen-tatives from the Member States (primarily health authorities) and representatives fromthe European Parliament, the EC and the European Pharmacopoeia. The Working Grouphas reviewed the criteria for the demonstration of quality, pre-clinical safety and clinicalefficacy in marketing authorization applications for herbal medicinal products as set outin the Council Directives. The Working Group has proposed requirements for non-clinical testing of herbal drug preparations based on a draft EC Guideline for oldsubstances with long market histories (EMEA, 2000). The Group has also discussed theappropriate role of scientific monographs prepared by the WHO and ESCOP. 3.2.6 Simplified proof of efficacy Various traditional herbal medicinal products exist in many Member States in addi- tion to fully licensed herbal medicinal products. For these products, national authoritiesusually verify the safety and ensure a sufficient level of quality. For proof of efficacy, thelevel of requirements is sometimes adjusted to take into account the long-term expe-rience and is therefore simplified. For example, a specific simplified procedure exists inAustria, Belgium, France and Germany. Most other countries in the EU do not use thisstrategy. 3.2.7 Further developed products For herbal medicinal products that have been proposed for non-traditional indi- cations or are modified from their traditional form (e.g., highly processed or specialextracts), a full licence is required in most cases, and efficacy has to be proven by clinicalstudies. In several countries, such products are not used.SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 533.2.8 Individual supply Herbal medicinal products (like other medicinal products) are made up and/or supplied to individual patients following a one-to-one consultation between patient andpractitioner. Some herbal medicinal products are made according to accepted formulaeand are prepared by pharmacists. According to Article 2.4 of Council Directive65/65/EEC (European Commission, 1965), a marketing authorization is not needed. Aspecific situation exists in the United Kingdom, where a practitioner, according toSection 12 of the Medicines Act 1968 (Griffin, 1998), may supply products to a customerwithout a licence. 3.2.9 Products from foreign countries The quality of imported medicinal plants and their preparations is assessed diffe- rently in different Member States. In some cases, no specific regulations exist concerningthe control of raw materials or crude drugs, particularly for products that enter the marketas foodstuffs or other products that are not controlled in the same way as medicinalproducts. Finished products are often treated as new chemical entities with full proof ofquality, safety and efficacy being required. 3.2.10 Good manufacturing practices and quality control All Member States apply the manufacturing requirements of Council Directive 75/319/EEC (European Commission, 1975) to herbal medicinal products. Startingmaterials for herbal medicinal products are in principle controlled in accordance with theEuropean Pharmacopoeia in all Member States. Good manufacturing practice inspectionsare carried out in nearly all Member States. The European Pharmacopoeia was created in 1964; its efforts have resulted in the creation of 83 monographs on herbal drugs which are used either in their natural stateafter desiccation or concentration or for the isolation of natural active ingredients(Council of Europe, 1996). 3.2.11 Post-marketing surveillance The adverse reaction reporting systems of the Member States also monitor herbal medicinal products if they are authorized medicinal products. This system has demons-trated its effectiveness in the case of several withdrawals of marketing authorizations forherbal medicinal products due to safety concern in connection with certain plants.Consumer reports could provide a picture of the spectrum of adverse reactions to herbalmedicinal products and alert authorities to potential problems; the degree of acceptanceof such reports varies between Member States. IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 543.2.12 Advertising, distribution and retail sale All Member States have implemented Council Directive 92/28/EEC (European Commission, 1992a) on advertising in national law. This directive covers herbal productsif they are authorized as medicinal products. Wholesale marketing of all medicinal products as well as authorized herbal medi- cinal products is covered by Council Directive 92/25/EEC (European Commission,1992b). The retail sale of herbal medicinal products is restricted to pharmacies inBelgium, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain. It is permittedin other outlets in the case of certain herbal medicinal products in Austria, Denmark,Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Distance sellingand teleshopping are not permitted for herbal medicinal products in most countries. 3.2.13 Differences between Member States Herbal medicinal products are regarded as medicinal products in most of the Member States and have, in theory, the option of obtaining marketing authorization inthe same way as all other medicinal products. However, the legal systems of the MemberStates differ in the classification of herbal products, in the availability of an applicationprocess for a marketing authorization based on a full application, bibliographicalapplication or simplified proof of efficacy, and in the permitted outlets for retaildistribution. Member States have different traditions regarding the therapeutic use ofmedicinal plant preparations, which may make it more difficult for manufacturers ofherbal medicinal products to apply for marketing authorization using the decentralizedprocedure. 3.3 Individual countries (Calixto, 2000) 3.3.1 France The French Medicines Agency (Agence du M\u00e9dicament) grants marketing autho- rizations based on abridged dossiers by making reference to traditional use. Theshortened procedure requires limited or no pharmacological, toxicological and clinicaltests and is detailed in the Agency Instructions No. 3. The list of drugs with acceptedtraditional uses was first published in 1985 by the Ministry of Health and has sub-sequently been revised several times (Table 5). Traditional use of approximately 200herbal drugs or preparations derived from these drugs has been recognized for minorindications. Agency Instructions No. 3 includes rules for labelling and packaging ofherbal medicinal products. If the drug is not specifically included in the list, there is nooption to use an abridged procedure (AESGP, 1998). As of 1997, local medicinal plantswere on the A list of the French Pharmacopoeia (Castot et al. , 1997) which groups the 454 herbs which benefit/risk ratio is considered as positive when traditionally used.SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 55IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 56 Table 5.

(1997) have reviewed the surveillance or pharmacovigilance of herbal medicines in France. Between 1 and 15 October 1996, the authors observed 15 publi-cations or publicities in 23 magazines widely available in France; these publications/publicities offered for sale by mail a number of medicinal plants found or not found onthe list of 34 'approved' plants. (These plants were listed in 1979 by the government inreason of lack of reported toxicity in traditional use or following complete bibliographicinvestigation.) Between 1985 and 1995, the French national surveillance system registered 341 cases of undesirable effects possibly linked to herbal medicines; this figure representsonly 0.35% of the total adverse effects from all drugs reported during the same period.The number of adverse effects from herbal medicines is almost certainly under-reported.The population concerned was largely female (73%) with a mean age of 50 years;reasons for taking herbal medicines were constipation, obesity and anxiety. Undesirableeffects reported were quite diverse, including allergic and cutaneous responses, eczema,liver damage tonic, diuretic)), digestive problems (linked to laxative plants), neurological effects such as vertigo (linked to plantsclassified as sedatives) and blood pressure fall and hypokalaemia (linked to plant laxa-tives containing anthraquinones (see monograph in this volume)). Outcome of thesecases was generally favourable (Castot et al., 1997).SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 57 Table 5 (contd) Medicinal plantInformation for the medical profession Information for the public Plantago major L.Traditionally used topically as a soothing and antipruriginous application for dermatological ailments and as a protective treatment forcracks, grazes, chapped skin and insect bites.Traditionally used topically as a soothing application and to calm the itching of skin ailments and in cases of cracks, grazes,chapped skin and insect bites (Precaution: do not use before exposure to the sun).

From AESGP (1998) a See General Remarks3.3.2 Germany (see Kraft, 1999; Calixto, 2000) Keller (1991) summarized the legal requirements for the use of phytopharmaceutical drugs in the Federal Republic of Germany. The legal status for herbal remedies wasdefined by the Medicines Act of 24 August 1976. For finished drugs a marketingauthorization is obligatory. Herbal finished drugs have to comply with the same criteriafor quality, safety and efficacy as all other finished drugs. Finished herbal drugs may beauthorized for marketing in one of three ways: (i) Evaluation and validation of old medicines . Finished drugs registered in 1978 possessed a provisional marketing authorization and could remain on themarket until the end of April 1990. The medical evaluation of these drugs wasmainly based on published data and was carried out by a special expertcommittee, the Commission E (Expert Commission for Herbal Remedies). Thepreparation of new monographs by Commission E ended in 1993 (Sandberg &Corrigan, 2001). (ii) Standardized marketing authorization . Medicines that do not represent a direct or indirect risk for health can be exempted from the need for an individualmarketing authorization by reference to a previously existing monograph. (iii) Individual application for marketing authorization . In this procedure, complete documentation including the results of analytical tests, results ofpharmacological and toxicological tests and results of clinical or other medicaltests are required. In addition, drugs sold outside pharmacies and only for traditional uses without clinical evidence for efficacy have to be labelled as 'traditionally used' (Table 6). 3.3.3 United Kingdom A number of papers have discussed the situation regarding herbal medicines in the United Kingdom. De Smet (1995) recommended that herbal products be licensed asspecial products 'medicines'; he estimated that unlicensed preparations accounted forover 80% of herbal sales. Many medicine-like products on the British herbal marketremain unregistered for two reasons: acceptable data on efficacy, safety and quality maynot be available, and the licensing fee is high. Traditional experience with herbs can bea useful tool in detecting acute toxicity, but is less useful in detecting rare adversereactions or those that develop after long-term exposure or after a latent period.Therefore, traditional experience needs to be supplemented with orthodox data fromresearch and post-marketing surveillance. Such post-marketing surveillance is onlypartly helpful, as herbal suppliers and traditional practitioners are not obliged to reportsuspected adverse reactions and herbal products are of variable quality.IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 58Shaw (1998) has discussed the safety aspects of herbal remedies in the United Kingdom. The legal status of herbal remedies/medicines in the United Kingdom can bebroadly divided into three categories: (i) Most herbal products are unlicensed and therefore no medicinal claims can be made. These are regarded as food supplements and come under foodlegislation (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF), 1998). (ii) Licensed medicinal products require evidence of quality, safety and efficacy and are regulated by the Medicines Control Agency. (iii) Herbal medicines supplied by a herbalist are exempt from licensing under the 1968 Medicines Act. Since 1996, the Medicines Control Agency has included adverse reaction reports on unlicensed herbal remedies within its remit and now monitors all three categories(Griffin, 1998). The House of Lords Science and Technology Committee in early 1999 reviewed a large amount of oral and written evidence from a wide variety of sources in order to scru-tinize complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) including herbal medicines(Mills, 2001). The report noted that public satisfaction with CAM was high and that useof CAM was increasing. Evidence was required that CAM has an effect above andSOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 59 Table 6.

The current lack of regulation of CAM did not protect the public interest adequately. Acupunctureand herbal medicine should be subject to statutory regulation under the Health Act 1999,as should possibly non-medical homeopathy. The regulatory status of herbal medicineswas viewed as particularly unsatisfactory. The report recommended that training forCAM professionals should be standardized and independently accredited and, for many,should include basic biomedical science. Conventional health professionals shouldbecome more familiar with CAM and those working in the best-regulated CAM pro-fessions should work towards integration with conventional medicine. 3.3.4 United States In the USA, the Food Drug and Cosmetics Act characterizes a product primarily on the basis of its intended use. For a botanical product, this intended use may be as afood (including a dietary supplement), a drug (including a biological drug), a medicaldevice (e.g., gutta-percha) or a cosmetic as shown by, among other things, the products'accompanying labelling claims, advertising materials, and oral or written statements(21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 201.128) (Food and Drug Administration (FDA),2000). For products classified as drugs, the FDA regulates them under the authority of the Food Drug and Cosmetics Act and its amendments. Under current regulations, if there isno marketing history in the USA for a botanical drug product, if available evidence ofsafety and effectiveness does not warrant inclusion of the product in an existing,approved category of OTC (over-the-counter) drugs, or if the proposed indication wouldnot be appropriate for non-prescription use, the manufacturer must submit a new drugapplication to obtain FDA approval to market the product for the proposed use. Ifexisting information on the safety and efficacy of a botanical drug product is insufficientto support a new drug application, new clinical studies will be needed to demonstratesafety and effectiveness. Most botanical products in the USA are marketed as dietary supplements. Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), an orally ingestedproduct that meets the definition of a 'dietary supplement' under section 201(ff) of theFood Drug and Cosmetics Act may be lawfully marketed using a statement that(1) claims a benefit related to a classical nutrient deficiency disease (and discloses theprevalence of the disease in the USA); (2) describes how the product is intended to affectthe structure or function of the human body; (3) characterizes the documented mecha-nism by which the product acts to maintain such structure or function; or (4) describesgeneral well-being derived from consumption of the product (section 403 r (6)(A) of theFood Drug and Cosmetics Act, 21 U.S.C. 343 r(6)(A)). The term 'dietary supplement' isdefined in section 201 (ff) of the Act and means a product (other than tobacco) intendedto supplement the diet that contains one or more of certain dietary ingredients, such as avitamin, a mineral, a herb or another botanical substance, an amino acid, a dietaryIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 60substance for use by people to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of the preceding ingre-dients (Chang, 1999). A dietary supplement is a product that is intended for ingestion ina form described in section 411C(1)(B)(i) of the Act (i.e., tablet, capsule powder, softgel,gelcap and liquid), which is not represented as conventional food, or as the sole item ofa meal or of the diet, and which is labelled as a dietary supplement. It is the responsibilityof the manufacturer to ensure that a dietary ingredient used in a dietary supplement issafe for its intended use. The FDA has issued regulations defining the types of statement that can be made concerning the effect of a dietary supplement on the structure and function of the body.The regulations distinguish these statements from the types of statement that requireprior approval as drug claims or prior authorization as health claims. Safety monitoring of dietary supplements focuses on the post-marketing period. The FDA receives spontaneous reports of suspected adverse events through a variety ofmeans, including through a programme called MEDWATCH, the FDA Medical ProductsReporting Program (Goldman & Kennedy, 1998). The post-marketing surveillancesystem for foods and dietary supplements, called the Adverse Event Reporting Systems,is a passive system that relies on voluntary reporting by concerned parties, primarilyhealth professionals and consumers (AESGP, 1998). The DSHEA extended the definition of dietary supplements beyond vitamins and minerals and established a formal definition of a dietary supplement using new criteria.The Congressionally mandated Commission on Dietary Supplement Labels (CDSL)suggested that some botanicals may qualify as OTC products under existing statutes;these state that a product may avoid 'new drug' premarket approval requirements andmay be eligible for marketing under an OTC drug monograph if the product is generallyrecognized as safe (GRAS) and effective under the conditions for use for which it islabelled and if the product has been used 'to a material extent and for a material time'under those conditions. The FDA's response to the Commission stated that it does notregard marketing experience outside the USA to meet conditions of historical use. Angell and Kassirer (1998) stated that the primary factor that sets alternative medicine, including its most common form, herbal medicine, apart from conventionalmedicine is 'that it has not been scientifically tested and its advocates largely deny theneed for such testing'. Angell and Kassirer defined 'testing' as the gathering of evidenceof safety and efficacy, as required by the FDA. 'There cannot be two kinds of medicine\u2014 conventional and alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately testedand medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work.Once a treatment has been tested rigorously, it no longer matters whether it was consi-dered alternative at the outset. If it is found to be reasonably safe and effective, it will beaccepted. Alternative treatments should be subjected to scientific testing no less rigorousthan that required for conventional treatments'.SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 613.3.5 Canada The Canadian Food and Drug Act and findings of an Expert Advisory Committee on Herbs and Botanical Preparations were consulted by Kozyrskyj (1997) to provide anoverview of the issues regarding regulation of herbal products in Canada. Case reports ofherbal toxicity were identified to illustrate some of the hazards of herbal products, andreferences were provided to guide health professionals in searching the literature forclinical trials that have evaluated the efficacy of these drugs. Herbal products not registered as drugs in Canada are sold as foods and are thus exempt from the drug review process that evaluates product efficacy and safety. AnExpert Advisory Committee on Herbs and Botanical Preparations was formed in 1984 toadvise the Health Protection Branch (HPB). HPB published lists of hazardous herbalproducts in 1987, 1989, 1992 and 1993. The last publication elicited a large responsefrom consumers and the herbal industry. As of 1995, the list was still under review(Kozyrskyj, 1997). The recently formed Office of Natural Health Products (currently the Natural Health Products Directorate) (Sibbald, 1999) is responsible for all regulatory functions inclu-ding, but not limited to pre-market assessment for product labelling, licensing of manu-facturers, post-approval monitoring and compliance and implementation of the recom-mendations of the standing House Health Committee. In December 2000, the provincial government of British Columbia approved regu- lations that established traditional Chinese medicine as an alternative form of primaryhealth care. The cost is not covered under Canadian medicare and practitioners faceseveral practice restrictions. For example, 'no acupuncturist or herbalist may treat anactive serious medical condition unless the client has consulted with a medical practi-tioner, naturopath or dentist or doctor of traditional Chinese medicine, as appropriate'(Johnson, 2001). 3.3.6 Chile In 1992 the Unidad de Medicina Tradicional was established with the aims of incor- porating traditional medicine with proven efficacy into health programmes and of contri-buting to the establishment of their practice. Herbal medicines are legally differentiatedinto: (a) drugs intended to cure, alleviate or prevent diseases; (b) food products for medi-cinal use and with therapeutic properties; and (c) food products for nutritional purposes(Calixto, 2000). Herbal products with therapeutic indications and/or dosage recommendations are considered to be drugs. Distribution of these products is restricted to pharmacies. A regis-tration for marketing authorization is needed for herbal products, homeopathic products,and other natural products. An application for such registration consists of the completeformula, the labelling, samples of the product, and a monograph which permits iden-tification of the formula and characteristics of the product (Zhang, 1998).IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 623.3.7 Japan (Zhang, 1998; Eguchi et al. , 2000; Saito, 2000) Japanese traditional medicine, as used in Japanese society for more than a thousand years, may be divided into folk medicine and Chinese medicine (or Kampo medicine).Kampo medicine is so popular that the per capita consumption of herbal medicine inJapan seems to be the highest in the world. One hundred and forty-six Kampo drugs areregistered as drugs by the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW) and are included incoverage under the National Health Insurance. Acceptance of Kampo drugs took placewithout clinical validation studies. In 1989, about 80% of physicians reported pres-cribing Chinese medicine. Physicians generally recognize Chinese medicine as a com-plement to modern medicine; traditional drugs are viewed in Japanese society as safe. Raw herbs which have long been used as folk medicine and which have also been used for a considerable period as components of an industrial product are each describedin a corresponding monograph. These products are freely usable for the purposes indi-cated in the monograph. Local traditional usage is not sufficient for approval as a drug;the claims and rules of combinations of herbal ingredients are determined on the basis ofthe pharmacological actions of the ingredients. If a monograph is not available, theclaims reported in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia are used as a guide. In the evaluation of a Chinese medicine, importance is given to 'empirical facts or experience', such as reference data, clinical test reports, etc., rather than the pharmaco-logical action of each ingredient. Safety and efficacy have been estimated based ongeneral methods employed by modern medical science. In 1972 the MHW designated210 formulae as OTC drugs; this selection was based primarily on the experience ofdoctors actually practising traditional Chinese medicine. In 1976, the MHW specified146 formulations as 'National Health Insurance (NHI) applicable prescription drugs'. Inthe case of an application for approval of a prescription drug other than those previouslylisted, specified data on safety, stability, comparison with other drugs, clinical testresults, etc. must be submitted. New Kampo drugs are regulated in essentially the same way as 'western' drugs in Japan. The same data required for new 'western' drugs are required for new Kampodrugs, including data from three-phase clinical trials. Since 1971, the MHW has been running a programme for re-evaluation of all drugs marketed before 1967; a new system to re-evaluate the efficacy and safety for all drugsevery five years was launched in 1988. An Advisory Committee for Kampo drugs was established in 1982 in close asso- ciation with the MHW in order to improve quality control of Kampo drugs. Since the1986 Good Manufacturing Practice Law, the standard applied to all pharmaceuticaldrugs has also applied to Kampo drugs. In addition, in 1985, guidelines for ethicalextract products in oriental medicine formulations were developed. The MHW has three major systems for collection of adverse reaction data. The first is a voluntary system involving 2915 monitoring hospitals. The second system \u2014 thePharmacy Monitoring System \u2014 which includes 2733 pharmacies, collects data on casesSOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 63of adverse reactions to OTC drugs. The third system is Adverse Reaction Reporting from Manufacturers. These cases are reported to the MHW by the responsible company, withinformation arising from medical conferences and from journals. 3.3.8 Korea (Republic of) The Pharmaceutical Act of 1993 explicitly allowed pharmacists to prescribe and dispense herbal drugs (Cho, 2000). 3.3.9 China Many herbal medicines have been used for hundreds of years and it is assumed in many cases that they must work. For example, about 7000 species of plants are used inChina as herbal medicines, but only 230 of the most commonly used ones have beensubject to in-depth pharmacological, analytical and clinical studies. The 2000 edition of the Chinese pharmacopoeia included 784 items on traditional Chinese medicines and 509 on Chinese patent medicines. Herbal medicines in China arenormally considered as medicinal products with special requirements for marketing.New drugs have to be investigated and approved according to the Drug AdministrationLaw. New traditional Chinese medicines are classified under five categories based on theAmendment and Supplement Regulation of Approval of new traditional medicines: Class 1 (1) Artificial alternatives of Chinese crude drugs.(2) Newly discovered Chinese crude drugs and their preparations.(3) Active constituents extracted from Chinese crude drugs and their preparations.(4) Active constituents extracted from a composite formulation of traditional Chinese medicines. Class 2 (1) Injection of traditional Chinese medicines(2) Use of new medicinal parts of Chinese crude drugs and their preparations.(3) Effective fractions extracted from Chinese crude drugs or natural drugs and their preparations. (4) Chinese crude drugs artificially developed in an animal body and their preparations. (5) Effective fractions extracted from a composite formulation. Class 3 (1) New composite formulations of traditional Chinese medicines.(2) Composite preparations of traditional Chinese medicines and chemical drugs with the main efficacy due to the traditional Chinese medicine. (3) Domestically cultivated or bred crude drugs originally imported and commonly used in China, and their preparations.IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 64Class 4 (1) Preparation with a change of dosage form or route of administration. (2) Botanical crude drugs acclimatized from their origin, or crude drugs from a domesticated wild animal in China. Class 5 Marketing drugs with new indications or syndromes. In Hong Kong in 1989, the Government appointed a Working Party to review and make recommendations for the use and practice of traditional Chinese medicines. In1995 the preparatory Committee on Chinese medicines was formed to manage the imple-mentation of these recommendations: as a result 31 potent Chinese medicines that maypotentially cause adverse effects have been identified. Proprietary preparations con-taining a combination of herbal ingredients and conventional drugs are regulated in thesame manner as other conventional drugs. The majority of suppliers are state-owned or state-connected. The extensive pharma- copoeia relating to traditional Chinese medicine allows the parallel manufacturing andsale of both pharmaceutical drugs and traditional herbal blends (Chan, 1997; Zhang,1998). 3.3.10 Saudi Arabia Registration of medicinal products by the Ministry of Health is obligatory, as is that of products, in addition to drugs, with medicinal claims or containing active ingredientshaving medicinal effects such as herbal preparations, health and supplementary food,medicated cosmetics, antiseptics or medical devices (Zhang, 1998). 3.3.11 South Africa (Zhang, 1998) The trade in crude indigenous herbal products is completely unregulated. A large number of South Africans consult traditional healers, generally in addition to medicalpractitioners. There are about 200 000 traditional healers in the country. Once a health-related claim is made for a finished herbal product, that product must go through a full drug evaluation in the Medicines Control Council (MCC) beforemarketing. Specific regulations for registration and control of new 'traditional' herbal medicines do not exist. Old medicines, including such well known herbal medicines as senna oraloe, are already registered by the MCC, according to internationally accepted standardsof efficacy and safety. Pharmaceutical standards need to be consistent with those of theUnited States Pharmacopeia or the British Pharmacopoeia.SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 653.3.12 Australia and New Zealand (Moulds & McNeil, 1988; Zhang, 1998) The Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 sets out the legal requirements for the import, export, manufacture and supply of medicines in Australia. It details the requirements forlisting or registering all therapeutic goods in the Australian Register of TherapeuticGoods (ARTG), as well as many other aspects of the law including advertising, labellingand product appearance. Australian manufacturers of therapeutic goods must be licensedand their manufacturing processes must comply with the principles of Good Manufac-turing Practice (GMP). All medicines manufactured for supply in Australia must be listedor registered in the ARTG, unless they are specifically exempt or excluded. Listed medi-cines are considered to be of lower risk than registered medicines. Most complementarymedicines (e.g., herbal, vitamin and mineral products) are examples of listed products.Medicines assessed as having a higher level of risk must be registered (not listed).Registered medicines include non-prescription (low-risk, OTC) medicines and prescrip-tion (high-risk) medicines. Complementary medicines (also known as 'traditional' or'alternative' medicines) include vitamin, mineral, herbal, aromatherapy and homeopathicproducts. Complementary medicines may be either listed or registered, depending ontheir ingredients and the claims made. Most complementary medicines are listed in theARTG and some are registered (Therapeutics Good Administration, 1999). In New Zealand, supplements in the market place are largely manufactured in the USA. Regulations are not restrictive; there are no limits on ingredients or potencies and'structure/function' claims are allowed. 4.

Exposure Data 1.1 Origin, type and botanical data Aristolochia species refers to several members of the genus (family Aristolochiaceae ) (WHO, 1997) that are often found in traditional Chinese medicines, e.g., Aristolochia debilis , A. contorta , A. manshuriensis and A. fangchi , whose medicinal parts have distinct Chinese names. Details on these traditional drugs can be found in the Pharmacopoeia of the People' s Republic of China (Commission of the Ministry of Public Health, 2000), except where noted. This Pharmacopoeia includes the following Aristolochia species: In traditional Chinese medicine, Aristolochia species are also considered to be inter- changeable with other commonly used herbal ingredients and substitution of one plantspecies for another is established practice. Herbal ingredients are traded using theircommon Chinese Pin Yin name and this can lead to confusion. For example, the name'Fang Ji' can be used to describe the roots , Stephania tetrandra or Cocculus species used Pin Yin Name Aristolochia fangchi Root Guang Fang Ji Aristolochia contorta Mu Xiang Plant species supplied as 'Fang Ji' Pin Yin name Botanical name Part used Guang Fang Ji Aristolochia fangchi Root Han Fang orbiculatus manshuriensis , and certain Clematis or Akebia species. There are some reports in Chinese literature where substitution can occur with 'Ma Dou Ling' (EMEA, 2000). The Pin Yin name 'Mu Xiang' is applied to a number of species; there is no evidence of substitution between the species but the common names have potential for confusionin both Chinese and Japanese (see Figure 1) is a perennial climbing herb. The stem is convo- luted, smoothish, more than 2 metres long. Leaves are alternated, petioled, entire, trian-gular cordate-shaped, 3-13 cm long and 3-10 cm (effeminate) stem(petiole), 1-7 cm long. Axillary racemes have 3-10 flowers clustered with a dark purpleperianth which is 2-3 cm long and zygomorphic. Peduncles are 2 cm long, with a smallovate bract, 1.5 cm long and 1 cm wide, near the base. Flowers have an obliquely trum-pet-shaped upper part with acuminate apex and a tubular middle part. The lower part isenclosing the style and globular, six stamens and six stigmas. Capsules, broadly obovate-shaped, burst into six valves when ripe. The plant grows in valleys along streams and inthickets (see WHO, 1997, 1998).IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 70 Plant species supplied as 'Mu Tong' Pin Yin name Botanical name Part used Guan Mu Tong Aristolochia manshuriensis Stem Chuan Mu Tong Clematis armandii Stem Chuan Mu Tong Clematis montana Stem Bai Mu Tong Akebia quinata Stem Bai Mu Tong Akebia trifoliata Stem Plant species supplied as 'Mu Xiang' Pin Yin name Botanical name Japanese name Qing Mu Xiang Aristolochia debilis Sei-Mokkou Mu Xiang Aucklandii lappa debilis (see Figure 2) differs from A. contorta chiefly in the following: Leaves are 3-8 cm long and 2-4 cm wide, cordate at the base, with round auricles onboth sides and a petiole 12 cm long. Capsules are subglobose or oblong. The dried fruits of both A. debilis and A. contorta (Ma Dou Ling), also known as Fructus Aristolochiae in Latin and Dutchman's pipe fruit in English, are ovoid and 3-7 cm long and 2-4 cm in diameter. The outer surface is yellowish green, greyish greenor brown, with 12 longitudinal ribs, from which extend numerous horizontal parallelveinlets. The apex is flattened and obtuse and the base has a slender fruit stalk. The peri-carp, which is light and fragile, is easily divided into six valves; the fruit stalk is alsodivided into six splittings. The inner surface of the pericarp is smooth and lustrous, withdense transverse veins. The fruit is six-locular, with each locule containing many seeds,which are overlapped and arranged regularly. The seeds are flat and thin, obtuse trian-gular or fan-shaped, 6-10 mm long, 8-12 mm wide and winged all around, and palebrown. The fruit has a characteristic odour and a slightly bitter taste.

The texture is fragile; thestems are easily broken and when fractured exhibit several vascular bundles of variablesize. The leaves are mostly crumpled and broken, but, when whole, are deltoid narrowovate or deltoid broad ovate and cordate at the base, dark green or pale yellowish brownand basal leaves are clearly veined and slenderly petioled. It has a delicately aromaticodour and is weak to the taste. Qing Mu Xiang ( Radix Aristolochiae in Latin and slender Dutchman's pipe root in English) is the root of A. debilis and is cylindrical or compressed cylindrical, slightly tortuous, 3-15 cm long and 0.5-1.5 cm in diameter. It is yellowish brown or greyishbrown in colour, rough and uneven, and exhibits longitudinal wrinkles and rootlet scars.The texture is fragile; the root is easily broken and when fractured shows an uneven, paleIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 72 Figure 2.

Peduncles are droo-ping, with an ovate cordate, bract, 1 cm long. Sixstamens adhibit to the outside of the stigma in pairs; they are inferior to the ovary,cylindrical, angular, whitish villi and 1-2 cm long. Capsules are cylindrical, dark brown,9-10 cm long and 3-4 cm in diameter and burst into six valves when ripe. Seeds arenumerous in each cell and cordate to triangular-shaped, with no winged margin. The dried stem is long, cylindrical, slightly twisted, 1-2 m long and 1-6 cm in dia- meter. Externally, it is greyish yellow or brownish yellow, with shallow longitudinalgrooves and has adhering remains of brown patches of coarse bark. Nodes are slightlyswollen, with a branch scar. The stem is light and hard, not easily broken, but when frac-tured shows a narrow yellow or pale yellow bark, and broad wood having vessels arrangedin many rings, with radial rays and indistinct pith. It has a slight odour and a bitter tasteand gives off a smell like camphor when the remains of the coarse bark are rubbed. 1.1.3 Aristolochia fangchi The dried root of A. fangchi (see Figure 4) is named Guang Fang Ji (Radix Aristolo- chiae fangchi in Latin and commonly southern fangchi root). A. fangchi is a perennial climbing vine with crassitudinous roots. The stem is slender, greyish brown, with brownish villi and is 3-4 m long. The leaves are either petioled,entire, oblong or ovate-shaped, with grey whitish villi when young, and are 3-11 cm longand 2-6 cm wide. The petiole perianth is canister-shaped, spots and 2-3 cm long. Six stamens adhibit to the outside of the trilobedstigma. The capsules have numerous seeds. The plant grows in valleys along streams andin thickets and blooms from May to June. The dried root is cylindrical or semi-cylindrical, slightly curved, 6-18 cm long and 1.5-4.5 cm in diameter. Externally it is greyish brown, rough and longitudinallywrinkled; the peeled stems are yellowish. The root is heavy and compact and is brokenwith difficulty; when fractured, the inside is starchy, exhibiting alternately greyish brownand whitish radial lines. It is odourless with a bitter taste. 1.1.4 Aristolochia clematitis The medicinal parts of birthwort ( A. clematitis ) are the aerial portion (when in blossom) and the root. The plant has dirty yellow flowers, usually in axillary groups ofseven. The perigone forms a straight tube, which is bulbous beneath and has a lingui-form, oblong-ovate, obtuse border. There are six stamens, the style is upward-growing ,and the stigma is six-lobed. The flower briefly traps insects that pollinate it. The fruit isa globose, pear-shaped capsule. The plant grows to a height of 30-100 cm. The stem iserect, simple, grooved and glabrous. The leaves are alternate, long-petioled, cordate-reni-form, yellow-green, with prominent ribs. The plant has a fruit-like fragrance and is poiso-IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 74nous. The plant is indigenous to Mediterranean regions, Asia Minor and the Caucasus, but is found in numerous other regions (Medical Economics Co., 2000). 1.1.5 Aristolochia indica Aristolochia indica (Indian birthwort) is a perennial climber with greenish white woody stems found throughout India in the plains and low hills. The leaves are glabrousand very variable, usually obovate-oblong to sub-pandurate, entire with somewhatundulate margins, somewhat cordate, acuminate. Flowers are few, in axillary racemeswith a perianth up to 4 cm long having a glabrous pale-green inflated and lobed basenarrowed into a cylindrical tube terminating in a horizontal funnel-shaped purple mouthand a lip clothed with purple-tinged hair. Capsules are oblong or globose-oblong, 3-5 cmlong and the seeds are flat, ovate and winged (Anonymous, 1985).SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 75 Figure 4. Aristolochia fangchi From Qian (1996) 1, twig leaf; 2, of A. debilis and A. contorta have been used for various therapeutic purposes in Chinese traditional medicine. The dried ripe fruits of both plants are used asa remedy for haemorrhoids, coughs and asthma. The dried stems or leaves are used fortreatment of epigastric pain, arthralgia and oedema. The dried roots from A. debilis are used for treatment of dizziness, headache, abdominal pain, carbuncles, boils and snakeand insect bites. 1.2.2 Aristolochia manshuriensis There are no clinical reports concerning the use of dried stems of A. manshuriensis alone. It is usually used in complex prescriptions as an anti-inflammatory and diuretic foracute infections of the urinary system, emmenagogue and galactagogue for ame-norrhoea lactation in traditional Chinese medicine. 1.2.3 Aristolochia fangchi There are no clinical reports concerning the use of the stems of A. fangchi alone. It is usually used in complex prescriptions as a diuretic for oedema and for antipyretic andanalgesic ( A. clematitis ) has been used to stimulate the immune system and in the treatment of allergically caused gastrointestinal and gall-bladder colic. The plant is usedin a wide variety of ways in the folk medicine of nearly all European countries. Inhomeopathy, the drug is used for gynaecological disorders and climacteric symptoms, inaddition to the treatment of wounds and ulcers. It is also used as a treatment after majorsurgery and in ear-nose-throat treatments (Medical Economics Co., 1998, 2000). 1.2.5 Aristolochia indica The roots of Indian birthwort ( Aristolochia indica L.) have been used in Indian folk medicine as an emmenagogue and an abortifacient (Che et al. , 1984). 1.3 Chemical constituents [As most of the literature is in Chinese, the Working Group had difficulty in identi- fying some of the acids1I, II, IIIa and IVa, debilic acid, 7- hydroxyaristolochic acid I and 7-methoxyaristolochic acid I.

Aristolochic acids are extractedfrom the sample matrix with aqueous methanol/formic acid. The concentration of aristo-lochic acids in the extract is determined by gradient high-performance liquid chromato-graphy (HPLC) with UV absorption detection at 390 nm and their identity is confirmedby liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry using either an ion-trap mass spectrometeror a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The quantitation limit is equivalent to 1.7 g/g in solid samples and 0.14 g/mL in liquid samples (Flurer et al., 2000). Lee et al. (2001) developed an HPLC procedure with a silica gel RP-18 reversed- phase column to determine aristolochic acids I and II in medicinal plants and slimmingproducts. The recovery of these two compounds in medicinal plants and slimmingproducts by extracting with methanol and purifying through a PHP-LH-20 (piperidino-hydroxypropyl Sephadex LH-20) column 90%. spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis, using a quadrupole ion-trap mass spectrometer, permitted the detection of aristolochicacids I and II in crude 70% methanol extracts of multi-component herbal remedieswithout any clean-up or concentration stages. The best ionization characteristics wereobtained using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) and by includingammonium ions in the mobile phase. Limits of detection for aristolochic acids wereinfluenced by the level of interference due to other components in the sample matrix.They were determined to be between 250 pg and 2.5 ng on-column within a matrix con-taining compounds extracted from 2 mg of herbal remedy (Kite et al., 2002). Ong and Woo (2001) developed a method for the analysis of aristolochic acids in medicinal plants or Chinese prepared medicines using capillary zone electrophoresis(CZE). The limits of detection for aristolochic acids I and II were 30 and 22.5 mg/kg,respectively. The proposed method using pressurized liquid extraction with CZE wasused to determine the amount of aristolochic acids in medicinal plants or samples ofChinese prepared medicines with complex matrix and the results were compared withthose from HPLC. Results obtained for aristolochic acids I and II in medicinal plants byCZE and HPLC are presented in Table 1. Ong et al. (2000) compared extraction and analysis of aristolochic acids I and II in medicinal plants ( Radix aristolochiae ) using a pressurized liquid extraction method in a dynamic mode with ultrasonic and Soxhlet extraction. The effects of temperature,volume of solvent required and particle size were investigated. The pressurized liquidextraction method showed some advantages over ultrasonic and Soxhlet extractionmethods. Singh et al. (2001a,b) developed a reversed-phase HPLC method with photodiode array detection for quantitative detection of aristolochic acids in Aristolochia plant samples. The procedure involves extraction of aristolochic acids with methanol andSOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 81chromatographic separation with a mobile phase of acetonitrile-water-trifluoroacetic acid-tetrahydrofuran (50:50:1:1). The average recovery of aristolochic acids was 97.8%;the minimum quantity detectable was 0.10 g per injection with a 5 L injection volume. 1.6.5 Production Aristolochic acids are produced commercially only as a reference standard and as research chemicals (Sigma-Aldrich, 2002). 1.6.6 Use The aristolochic acid occurring in Aristolochia species used in traditional herbal medicines has been reported to function as a phospholipase A2inhibitor and as an Aristolochic acids are alkaloid components of a wide range of species of the family Aristolochiaceae (e.g., Aristolochia , Asarum ). They are also found (e.g., Atrophaneura , Battus, Pachliopta , Troides al. , al., 1983, 1987;IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 82 Table 1. Comparison of results obtained for aristolochic acids I and II in medicinal plants by capillary aristolochiae (qing mu xiang)190.0 208.4 a From Ong & Woo (2001) b Analysis of a different batch of Radix aristolochiae fangchiNishida & et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2000). Aristolochic acids I and II have been determined in several samples of medicinal plants and slimming products using HPLC. The major component was aristolochic acid Iin Aristolochia fangchi and the level ranged from 437 to 668 ppm (mg/kg). Aristolochic acid II was the major component in Aristolochia contorta , at levels ranging from less than 1 to 115 ppm (mg/kg). Twelve out of 16 samples of slimming pills and powders con-tained aristolochic acids I and/or II. The major component in most slimming productswas aristolochic acid II and the level ranged from less than 1 to 148 ppm (Lee et al., 2001). The amounts of aristolochic acids I and II in four groups of medicinal plants from the family Aristolochiaceae and some related plants were determined by HPLC.Aristolochic acids I and II were detected in all the plants from the genus Aristolochia (Aristolochiaceae) and at trace levels in some from the genus Asarum (Aristolochiaceae) (Hashimoto et al., 1999). The levels of these compounds in several medicinal plants are presented in Table 2. 1.6.8 Regulations The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) (2001a) of Australia has issued a Fact Sheet stating that all species of Aristolochia are prohibited for supply, sale or use in thera- peutic goods in Australia. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (2001b) also issued aPractitioner Alert to communicate its concern about traditional Chinese medicine herbalproducts that are known to contain, or suspected to contain, Aristolochia species, whichSOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 83 Table 2. Aristolochic acid content in individual samples of medi cinal plants of the 1430 60 40 a From et al. (1999) AA-I, aristolochic acid I AA-II, aristolochic acid IImay contain aristolochic acids. The TGA has published three lists of botanicals or products at risk of containing aristolochic acids: botanicals known or suspected to contain aristolo-chic acid (Group A); botanicals which may be adulterated with aristolochic acid (Group B);and products which have Mu Tong and Fang Ji as declared ingredients (Group C). The use of Aristolochia in unlicensed medicines was prohibited by the Medicines Control Agency (2001) in the UK in July 1999, and a further temporary prohibitioncovering certain herbal ingredients at risk of confusion with Aristolochia came into force in June 2000. The UK Committee on Safety of Medicines (2001) made these prohibitionspermanent by issuing a Statutory Instrument to prohibit the sale, supply and importationof any medicinal product consisting of or containing certain plants belonging to a speciesof the genus Aristolochia or consisting of or containing Guan Mu Tong; or belonging to any of eight specifically listed or consisting of or containing an extract from such a plant. In addition, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products issued a position paper in October 2000 (EMEA, 2000), warning European Union Member Statesto 'take steps to ensure that the public is protected from exposure to aristolochic acidsarising from the deliberate use of Aristolochia species or as a result of confusion with other botanical ingredients'. The European Commission (EC) (2000) has prohibited 'aristolochic acid and its salts, as well as Aristolochia species', and their preparations in cosmetic products. In 1999, Health Canada issued a warning not to use products containing Aristolochia due to potential risk of cancer, cell changes and kidney failure. Health Canada issued fouradditional warnings and advisories in 2001 advising not to use products labelled tocontain Aristolochia (Health Canada, 1999, 2001a,b,c,d). The Food and Drug Administration (2001a) of the USA has issued a Consumer Advi- sory to communicate its concern about the use and marketing of dietary supplements orother botanical-containing products that may contain aristolochic acids. It has also posteda listing of botanical ingredients of concern, including: botanicals known or suspected tocontain are ingredients; and botanicalproducts determined by FDA to contain aristolochic acids (Food and Drug Adminis-tration, 2001b). 2. Studies of Cancer in Humans Aristolochia spp. The possibility of adulteration of herbal products with Aristolochia species exists as a result of similarities in their common names, e.g. substitution of Stephania tetrandra (Han Fang Ji) with Aristolochia species (e.g. Guang Fang Ji).IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 84In 1992, a cluster of patients with interstitial renal fibrosis rapidly progressing to end-stage renal disease after having followed a slimming regimen containing powderedextracts of Chinese herbs was recorded in Brussels, Belgium (Vanherweghem et al. , 1993; 1994; Vanherweghem, 1998), followed by some reports from several other countries (see Section 4.2.1 for details). The herbalproduct was labelled as including Stephania tetrandra , but was later found to contain Aristolochia fangchi , which had been erroneously substituted for Stephania tetrandra. Subsequent reports have shown the etiology of this disease to be related to exposure to aristolochic acids which are components of Aristolochia species (see Section 1.4.1( c)) (Vanhaelen Muniz Martinez et al. , 2002). The renal disease associated with prolonged intake of some Chinese medicinal herbs is called by various names. The term 'Chinese herb nephropathy' has been widely usedin scientific nephrology publications. However, this could be considered misleading inrelation to the hundreds of Chinese medicinal herbs that are safely used throughout theworld, including for renal diseases. Thus alternatives such as 'aristolochic acid-asso-ciated nephropathy' and 'Aristolochia nephropathy' are monograph, the term 'Chinese herb nephropathy' is consistently used to referspecifically to the Aristolochia-associated disease. 2.1 Case reports Mild-to-moderate atypia and atypical hyperplasia of the urothelium were detected in three women in Brussels, Belgium, who had undergone nephroureterectomies as part ofa transplantation programme (Cosyns et al. , 1994a). All three cases of end-stage renal disease were attributed to the use of Chinese herbs containing aristolochic acids(Schmeiser et al. , 1996). One of these three women developed, 12 months after trans- plantation, at the age of 25 years, two papillary tumours of the posterior in the two ureters (right and remnant distal part of left ureter) and in the rightpelvis (Cosyns et al. , 1994b). A second report from Belgium described a 42-year-old woman presenting with end- stage renal disease and haematuria. Apart from the Chinese herbal product labelled asStephania tetrandra , she had regularly taken paracetamol (1.2-2.4 g per day) for 27 years. In medical surveillance, no side-effects on renal function were recordedprevious to the consumption of the herbal product. The haematuria was secondary to atransitional-cell carcinoma with moderate atypia of the right renal pelvis(Vanherweghem et al., 1995). In a report from Taiwan, China, of 12 cases with rapidly progressive interstitial fibrosis associated with Chinese herbal drugs, one case of a bladder carcinoma wasobserved (Yang et al., 2000).SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 85A bilateral multifocal transitional-cell urothelial carcinoma occurring six years after the onset of end-stage renal disease was described (Lord et al. , 1999, 2001) in one of two cases of Chinese herbal nephropathy in the United Kingdom related to aristolochic acidfrom Aristolochia manshuriensis contained in Mu Tong. 2.2 Prevalence of urothelial cancers among patients with Chinese herb nephropathy Following the previously described case reports of rare urothelial tumours among some patients who had suffered end-stage renal disease after consumption of Chineseherbs, other patients were offered a bilateral removal of their native kidneys and ureters.High prevalence of urothelial cancers was documented in two series. In the first series (Cosyns et al. , 1999), nephroureterectomies were performed in 10 renal-grafted Chinese herb nephropathy patients. The patients were all women and had amean age of 40 years (range 27-59 years). In the pelviureteric urothelium, moderateatypia was observed in all samples. Multifocal high-grade carcinoma in situ was observed in four patients, in the renal pelvis (three patients), upper ureter (four patients),mid ureter (one patient) and lower ureter (three patients). In the second series of 39 Chinese herb nephropathy patients with end-stage renal disease in Brussels (31 transplanted patients and eight dialysis patients), bilateral nephro-ureterectomy of the native kidneys and ureters was performed. Except for a 60-year-oldman, all the patients were women (aged 54 \u00b17 years). Aristolochic acid-specific DNA adducts were detected in tissue samples from kidneys. Among the 39 patients, 18 casesof urothelial carcinomas were found (prevalence, 46%; 95% confidence interval [CI],29-62%). Except for one case of bladder cancer, all the carcinomas were located in theupper urinary tract and were almost equally distributed between the pelvis and the ureter.Mild to moderate dysplasia of the urothelium was found in 19 of the 21 patients withouturothelial carcinoma. Cumulative doses of herbs labelled as Stephania tetrandra (which on analysis proved to contain various levels of Aristolochia fangchi ) taken by the patients were significantly higher in the group of 18 Chinese herb nephropathy patients withurothelial cancer than in the group of 21 Chinese herb nephropathy patients withoutcancer (226 \u00b123 g versus 167 \u00b117 g; p= 0.035). Among the 24 patients with a cumu- lative dose of 200 g or less, eight cases of urothelial cancer were recorded and among the15 patients who had ingested more than 200 g, 10 cases of urothelial cancer wereobserved ( p= 0.05) (Nortier et al., 2000).IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 863. Studies of Cancer in Experimental Animals Aristolochic acids 3.1 Oral administration Mouse : A group of 39 female NMRI mice [age not specified] was given daily doses of 5.0 mg/kg aristolochic acids (77.2% aristolochic acid I and 21.2% aristolochicacid II) by gavage for three weeks. A group of 11 vehicle controls was given solvent[unspecified]. The mice were kept for up to 56 weeks with interim sacrifice at 3, 9, 18,26, 37 and 48 weeks. The remaining eight animals were killed at 56 weeks. At 18 and 26weeks stages, low- to middle-grade papillomatosis was observed in the forestomach of allmice. Of the mice sacrificed at 37 and 48 weeks, 1/5 mice at each time point hadsquamous-cell carcinoma. Forestomach carcinoma was diagnosed in all of the eight micekilled at 56 weeks. Adenocarcinoma of the glandular stomach was observed in one mouseat 37 weeks. In addition, cystic haemangiomasin the uterus (3/8 mice) were found at 56 weeks. No tumours were detected in 11 controlanimals at 56 weeks (Mengs, 1988). Rat: Groups of 30 male and 30 female Wistar rats, 10 weeks of age, were given aris- tolochic acids (77.2% aristolochic acid I and 21.2% aristolochic acid II) as their sodiumsalts in distilled water at 10.0 or 1.0 mg/kg bw for three months and held for up to anadditional six months or at 0.1 or 0 mg/kg bw for 3, 6 or 12 months and held for up toan additional four months. Forestomach carcinomas were observed in 13/18 males and8/13 females given 10 mg/kg bw for three months and killed at six months. addition,renal pelvis carcinomas (8/18) and urinary 10 bw. Forestomach carcinomas were observed in 4/4 female ratstreated with 10 mg/kg bw for three months and killed at nine months. In the groups dosedwith 1.0 mg/kg bw for three months, forestomach carcinomas were observed in 3/11males and 0/10 females after six months and 6/9 males and 2/11 females after ninemonths. In rats treated with 0.1 mg/kg bw for three months and killed at 12 months, 2/7males and 0/6 females had forestomach carcinomas. In rats treated with 0.1 mg/kg bwfor 12 months and killed at 16 months, 4/4 males and 1/5 females had forestomachtumours. Only one tumour (a spontaneous endometrial polyp) was observed in thecontrols (0/30 in males and 1/31 in females) (Mengs et al. , 1982). Two groups of male Wistar rats, eight weeks old, were examined for the histogenesis of forestomach carcinoma caused by aristolochic acids [77.2% aristolochic acid I and21.2% aristolochic acid II]. A group of 108 rats was given aristolochic acids daily bygavage at a dose of 10 mg/kg in distilled water for up to 90 days. A group of 37 controlsSOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 87received distilled water. The animals were sacrificed sequentially. Administration of the aristolochic acids caused extensive necrosis of the squamous epithelium in the fore-stomach, followed by regeneration formation and ultimatelyinvasive squamous-cell carcinoma. No pathological changes were seen in the controls(Mengs, 1983). Three groups of 20 male BD-6 rats weighing 140 g received twice-weekly doses of 10 mg/kg bw aristolochic acid [components not otherwise specified] by gavage for 12weeks. One of these groups also bw diallyl sulfide by gavage 4 and another group received diallyl sulfide 24 h and 4 hbefore the treatment. A fourth group received diallyl sulfide only, four times per week,for 12 weeks. Treatment with diallyl sulfide 4 h before aristolochic acid treatmentdecreased the development of forestomach tumours that appeared within 6-9 monthsafter the start of experiment. The incidence of aristolochic acid-induced forestomachtumours (60%; 12/20 rats) was reduced by the prior 4 h-treatment withdiallyl sulfide.

All 11 survivingrabbits developed fibrotic changes in the kidneys resembling Chinese herb nephropathyand two developed kidney tumours (renal-cell carcinoma or tubulopapillary adenoma).One rabbit had a transitional-cell carcinoma of the ureter as well as a peritonealmesothelioma. Mild to moderate atypia of the epithelium of the collecting ducts and ofthe pelvis was present in 5/11 and 11/11 rabbits, respectively. These changes were notdetected in 10 female control rabbits (Cosyns et al. , 2001). 3.3 Subcutaneous administration Rat: In a study to model the renal fibrosis seen in Chinese herb nephropathy, 66 male Wistar rats, four weeks of age, were given a single intraperitoneal injection of furosemideand fed a low-salt normal-protein diet. This group was divided into three groups whichreceived daily subcutaneous injections of either 1 or vehicle (control group; n= 18) for 35 days. On days 10 and 35, six rats from each group were sacrificed for assessment of kidney function. Urothelialdysplasia was detected in two rats on day 10, one rat on day 35 and three of the remainingIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 8811 rats on day 105 in the high-dose group. Urothelial dysplasia was also seen in a few rats of the low-dose group on day 10 or 105. Three of the high-dose group developedpapillary urothelial carcinomas by day 105. Malignant fibrohistiocytic sarcomas werefound on day 105 around the sites of subcutaneous injection in two of the six rats of thelow-dose group and in seven of the 11 of the high-dose group. Marked interstitial fibrosisof the kidney was noted in the high-dose group on day 35. None was seen in the low-dose or controls groups (Debelle et al. , 2002). 4. Other Data Relevant to an Evaluation of Carcinogenicity and its Mechanisms 4.1 Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion 4.1.1 Humans As part of a clinical study designed to investigate the effects of aristolochic acids on the phagocytic activity of granulocytes, six healthy volunteers were given a daily dose[presumably oral but not explicitly stated] of 0.9 mg of a mixture of aristolochic acids Iand II [ratio not specified] for several days, and 24-h urine samples from day 3 of thistrial were analysed for metabolites. The only metabolites detected were I(metabolite aristolochic I) and aristolactam II (metabolite of aristolochic acid II)(Figure 5). The percentage conversions to these two metabolites were not reported(Krumbiegel et al. , 1987). This contradicts an earlier report of oral absorption of aristo- lochic acid in humans resulting in the compound(s) being excreted unchanged in urine,bile, breast milk and cerebrospinal fluid (Schulz et al. , 1971). 4.1.2 Experimental systems In an extensive study following oral administration of aristolochic acids I and II to male Wistar rats (pure compounds given; 3 mg), the following metabolites were detectedin urine and faeces: from aristolochic acid I \u2014 aristolactam I, aristolactam Ia, aristo-lochic acid Ia, aristolic acid I and 3,4-methylenedioxy-8-hydroxy-1-phenanthrenecarbo-xylic acid; from aristolochic acid II \u2014 aristolactam II, aristolactam Ia and 3,4-methy-lenedioxy-1-phenanthrenecarboxylic acid (Krumbiegel et al. , 1987). The structures of these compounds (Figure 5) were determined by spectroscopic methods including low-resolution Roth, metabolite of aristolochic acid II witha lactam moiety was not fully characterized. The principal metabolite of aristolochicacid I in rats was aristolactam Ia (46% of the dose converted to this was found in theurine and 37% in the faeces). In the urine, most of the aristolactam Ia was present as aconjugated form, which required alkaline treatment (3 M NaOH) for hydrolysis. TheSOME TRADITIONAL II I Aristolactam Aristolactam II Species: mouse, guinea-pig, dog, humanSpecies: Rat, 5. Proposed metabolic transformations of aristolochic acids I and II in various species From Krumbiegel et al. (1987) The metabolites were detected in the urine of the species indicated.metabolites determined for aristolochic acid II in rats were all minor compounds, with the largest proportion accounted for by aristolactam II (4.6% in the urine and 8.9% in thefaeces) (Krumbiegel et al. , 1987). This study also examined the metabolism of aristolochic acids I and II by other labo- ratory animals. The amounts of aristolochic acids I and II administered were similar inproportion to the weight of each test animal. The mouse (NMRI, female) was the onlyspecies to exhibit the same metabolic profiles for these compounds as the rat. In general,dogs (beagle, male), rabbits (White Vienna, male) and guinea-pigs (Pirbright White,male) showed smaller numbers of metabolites than mice and rats (summarized inFigure 5) (Krumbiegel et al. , 1987). 4.2 Toxic effects 4.2.1 Humans Aristolochic acid I [purity not specified] was given by infusion to 20 patients having various malignant tumours, at different dose schedules ranging from 0.1 mg/kg bw perday for five days to a single dose of 2 mg/kg bw. The compound was too toxic to thekidneys for further trial (Jackson et al., 1964). The so-called Stephania tetrandra powder, first introduced in a slimming regimen in a Belgian clinic in early 1990, was withdrawn from the Belgian market at the end of1992. Altogether, 1500-2000 persons are thought to have followed the same regimenduring the period 1990-92. Among them, about 100 patients with renal disease (70% ofthem being in end-stage renal disease that had to be treated by dialysis or kidney trans-plantation) had been recorded by 1998, or about 5% of the exposed population(Vanherweghem, 1998). The pathology of the renal disease was characterized by extensive interstitial fibrosis with atrophy and loss of the tubules, while the glomeruli were relatively untouched(Vanherweghem et al., 1993; Cosyns et al., 1994a; Depierreux et al., 1994). The typical slimming treatment followed by the patients included intradermal injection of artichokeextract (Chophytol S) and euphyllin as well as oral intake of a mixture of was suspected because Stephania tetrandra (Han Fang Ji) belongs to the same family and the Chinese characters are identical to those forAristolochia fangchi (Guang Fang Ji) (Vanherweghem et al., 1993). The inadvertent substitution of Stephania by Aristolochia was confirmed by phyto- chemical analysis of 12 different batches of herb powders delivered in Belgium underthe name of Stephania tetrandra : only one batch contained tetrandrine and not aristo- lochic acids I and II, one contained both tetrandrine and aristolochic acids and 10contained aristolochic acids only. The amount of aristolochic acids in the 12 batchesSOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 91varied from undetectable (< 0.66 \u00b10.56 mg/g) (Vanhaelen et al., 1994). Further evidence supports the involvement of aristolochic acids I and II in the kidney disease: 7-(deoxyadenosin- N6-yl)aristolactam I-DNA adduct (dA-AAI) was detected in renal tissue obtained from five patients with Chinese herb nephropathy, while none wasfound in renal tissue from six patients with other renal diseases (Schmeiser et al., 1996; see Section 4.4.1). A larger series of kidney samples from 38 patients with Chinese herbnephropathy confirmed the presence of DNA adducts formed by aristolochic acid sixyears after their exposure Aristo- lochia fangchi ). Such adducts were absent in kidney tissues obtained from eight patients with renal disease of other origin (Nortier et al., 2000; see Section 4.4.1). After the description of the initial cases (Vanherweghem et al., 1993), similar cases of Chinese herb nephropathy were reported in many other countries: four cases in Francesecondary to the intake of slimming pills containing Stephania tetrandra which was, in fact, Aristolochia fangchi (Pourrat et al., 1994; Stengel & Jones, 1998); one case in Spain after chronic intake of a tea made with a mixture of herbs containing Aristolochia pistolochia , a herb that was grown in the Catalonia region (Pe\u00f1a et al., 1996); two cases in the United Kingdom after treatment of eczema with Mu Tong containing aristolochicacid (Lord et al., 1999); 12 cases in Taiwan related to the use of various unidentified herbal medications for different purposes (Yang et al., 2000); one case in the USA after intake of herbal medicine containing aristolochic acid for low back pain (Meyer et al. , 2000); and 12 cases in Japan, in five of which the presence of aristolochic acid wasdemonstrated in the herbal medicine; in the other suspected (Tanaka et al., 2001). In Japan, the cases of Chinese herb nephro- pathy often presented with adult-onset Fanconi syndrome (Tanaka et al., 2000a,b). A similar case was reported in Germany after intake of a purported Akebia preparation containing aristolochic acid (Krumme et al., 2001). 4.2.2 Experimental systems In a study of acute effects of a mixture of aristolochic acids I (77.2%) and II (21.2%), intragastric or intravenous administration at high doses to male and female mice (NMRI)and rats (Wistar) resulted in death from acute renal failure within 15 days. The oral LD 50 ranged from 56 to 203 mg/kg bw and the intravenous LD50from 38 to 83 mg/kg bw, depending on the species and sex. The predominant histological features were severenecrosis of the renal tubules, atrophy of the spleen and thymus, superficial ulceration ofthe forestomach by both of thesquamous epithelium (Mengs, 1987). In study, a no-effect level of 0.2 mg/kg bw \u2014 given daily by gavage for four weeks \u2014 was observed for aristolochic acids in male Wistar rats. Mild changes onlyIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 92were observed at 1.0 mg/kg bw, with clear toxic effects first seen at 5.0 mg/kg bw given daily for four weeks. Degenerative lesions in the kidneys, forestomach, urinary bladderand testes were observed at a dose of 25 mg/kg bw. Two of the rats in the 25-mg/kg bwgroup died due to tubular necrosis following renal failure. Renal lesions were also foundwithin three days in female Wistar rats given single doses of 10, 50 or 100 mg/kg bwintragastrically (Mengs & Stotzem, 1992). There was a dose-dependent decrease in bodyweight, which was significant at doses above 10 mg/kg bw. At necropsy, a grey-browndiscoloration of the kidneys was seen in the 100-mg/kg bw group and the relative kidneyweights of this group were significantly greater than those of the controls. There wasevidence of dose-dependent tubular epithelial necrosis of the renal tubules, with (in the100-mg/kg bw group) degenerative changes predominantly localized in the pars recta of the proximal tubules and widespread necrosis affecting all of the nephrons. In the50 mg/kg bw group, single cell necrosis no necrotic lesions wereobserved in the 10-mg/kg bw group. There were groups. In these same two groups, urinary electrolytedeterminations showed decreases in calcium and magnesium concentrations, althoughthe levels of sodium, potassium and chloride remained unaffected. Urine testing showedsignificantly increased protein concentrations and some increases in haemoglobin in the50- and 100-mg/kg bw groups, with glucose concentrations elevated significantly in allthree dose groups. Urinary volume, specific gravity and pH were unaffected in all dosedanimals (Mengs & Stotzem, 1993). In a recent study on the effects of chronic administration of a commercially available mixture (97% purity) of aristolochic acids I (44%) and II (56%), female New Zealandwhite rabbits were given intraperitoneal injections of either the test mixture (0.1 mg/kgbw) or saline (control) for five days per week for 17-21 months. All dosed animals deve-loped urothelial atypia, whereas no significantpathological changes were seen in the control animals. Three animals developed tumoursof the urinary tract. The treated group also showed impaired growth, increased serumcreatinine, glucosuria, tubular proteinuria and anaemia (Cosyns et al. , 2001). Groups of 5-6 male Fischer 344 rats, weighing 140-150 g, were given a single intra- peritoneal injection of 10 mg/kg bw aristolochic acids (a commercially available mixtureof aristolochic acids I and II) 18 h after a two-thirds partial hepatectomy. After a one-week recovery period, one group was kept on the basal diet while the second group wasgiven a diet with 1% orotic acid to stimulate cell proliferation. In the second group, thepercentage of rats with nodules and the number of nodules per rat were increasedcompared with the group given aristolochic acids alone, suggesting that aristolochicacids act as initiating agents (Rossiello et al. , 1993). The aristolochic acids have a phagocytosis- and metabolism-activating effect. They are also thought to enhance the production of lymphokines. Activation of phagocytes hasbeen demonstrated in tests in rabbits and guinea-pigs. In addition, in animal tests, aristo-SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 93lochic acids enhanced immune resistance to herpes simplex viruses in the eye (Medical Economics Co., 2000). 4.3 Reproductive and developmental effects 4.3.1 Humans The roots of Aristolochia indica L. are reputedly used in Indian folk medicine as an abortifacient (references cited in Che et al., 1984). However, no data concerning repro- ductive effects in humans were available to the Working Group. 4.3.2 Experimental systems With a view to developing fertility-regulating agents from plants, various extracts of A. indica have been investigated for effects during pregnancy in mice, rats, hamsters and rabbits. An ethanolic extract of A. indica roots decreased the number of pregnancies in both rats and hamsters when administered daily by gavage on days 1-10 and 1-6 post-coitum,respectively. The extract was fractionated and the various materials were tested. Aristo-lochic acid I was lethal to rats at a daily dose of 40 mg/kg bw and to hamsters at a dailydose of 25 mg/kg bw. A dose of 10 mg/kg bw per day was not lethal to rats and had noeffect on the number of pregnancies, while a daily dose of 12.5 mg/kg bw caused somelethality in hamsters (4/10 died), and tended to decrease the number of pregnancies insurvivors. However, this may have been a result of non-specific toxic effects of the testsubstance (Che et al., 1984). Aristolochic acid I from A. mollisima H. given orally to mice on gestation days 1-6 or 7-10 caused a marked decrease in the number of pregnancies at a daily dose of3.7 mg/kg bw. In similarly dosed rats, no effect was found. Single injections given intra-amniotically to rats on one of gestation days 14-16 and to dogs on one of gestationdays 30-45 led to fetal death and termination of pregnancy at doses per fetus of 50 or100 g (for rats) and 1-18 mg (dogs) (Wang & Zheng, 1984). In female Swiss albino mice given a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg bw of a crude extract of A. indica on day 6 or 7 of gestation, the number of pregnancies was markedly reduced. Dosing with 50 mg/kg bw of various purified fractions also led to a markedeffect. No toxic effects were reported at the doses used; however, no other data weregiven on, for example, body weight of the animals (Pakrashi et al., 1976). Aristolochic acid I metabolites A number of studies have investigated aristolic acid , a metabolite of aristolochic acid I detected in rats, mice, guinea-pigs and rabbits, but not in humans (see Figure 5). Oral administration of 90 mg/kg bw aristolic acid to Swiss albino mice on gestation day 6 resulted in termination of pregnancy and in-utero death (Pal et al., 1982). IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 94A single oral dose of 120 or 90 mg/kg bw aristolic acid given by gavage to Swiss albino mice on gestation day 1 or 6 caused marked reduction in uterine weight andincreased concentrations of acid phosphatase and a decrease in alkaline phosphatase inthe uterus. A subcutaneous dose of progesterone (1 mg per mouse) on gestation days 5-8with aristolic acid on gestation day 6 did not prevent the effects. The authors concludedthat aristolic acid did not appear to block hormone synthesis in the ovary (Pakrashi &Ganguly, 1982). Aristolic acid disrupted nidation in Swiss albino mice when given at a dose of 150 mg/kg bw on gestation day 1. The treatment did not affect tubal transport of eggs,but affected implantation. In addition, it inhibited the increase in specific uterine alkalinephosphatase activity of the uterus, which in control mice was about three-fold throughgestation days 4-6. Based on these results, it was inferred that aristolic acid interfereswith estrogenic conditioning of the uterus (Ganguly et al., 1986). Studies of endocrine properties of aristolic acid revealed anti-estrogenic effects, as the compound inhibited estrogen-induced weight increase and epithelial growth of theuterus in immature female Swiss albino mice. Aristolic acid given on gestation day 1caused total inhibition of implantation at 60 mg/kg bw and decreased implantation atdose levels down (43% Chakrabarty, aristolic acid caused a 100% abortifacient effect when a single oral dose of 60 mg/kg bw was administered to Swiss albino mice on gestation day 6 or7. At a dose of 30 mg/kg bw, the effect was 40%. The 60-mg/kg bw dose caused 25%and 20% reduction of fertility when given on gestation day 10 or 12, respectively. Notoxic effects were reported in the dams and no malformations were found in the offspring(Pakrashi & Shaha, 1978). Aristolic acid administered orally to rabbits on gestation day 9 caused 65% fetal loss at a dose of 60 mg/kg bw and 80% fetal loss at 90 mg/kg bw (Pakrashi & Chakrabarty,1978b). In male mice, oral feeding of the water-soluble part of the chloroform extract of A. indica at a dose of 75 mg/kg bw caused a marked decrease in the weight of the testes (55%) and accessory genital organs. There were varying degrees of arrest of spermato-genesis and nuclear degeneration in various germinal cell types. The treatment alsocaused a decrease of approximately 30% in body weight. The effects on the male sexorgans may have been a result of non-specific toxicity (Pakrashi & Pakrasi, 1977).SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 954.4 Genetic and related effects 4.4.1 Humans (a)DNA-adduct formation in patients with Chinese herb nephropathy (see Table 3 for details of studies and references) Aristolochic acid-specific DNA adducts have been detected by the 32P-postlabelling method in the kidneys and ureters of patients with Chinese herb nephropathy (a total of47 women and one man). The major DNA adduct, which co-chromatographed with7-(deoxyadenosin- N 6-yl)aristolactam I (dA-AAI), was detected in all urothelial tissues analysed, whereas the two minor ones, chromatographically I (dG-AAI) and 7-(deoxyadenosin- N6-yl)aristo- lactam II (dA-AAII), were found in most cases (see Figure 6). Total aristolochic acid-specific adduct levels in DNA obtained from whole organs or biopsies from Chinese herbnephropathy patients were in the range of 1.7-530 adducts per 10 9normal nucleotides. All studies presented evidence that these patients had taken herbal preparations con-taining a natural mixture of aristolochic acids. (b)p53 overexpression in patients with Chinese herb nephropathy Overexpression of the p53 protein, a common finding in human tumours, was observed in carcinoma in situ , papillary transitional-cell carcinoma and urothelial atypia found in 10 Belgian patients with Chinese herb nephropathy (Cosyns et al., 1999). 4.4.2 Experimental systems (a)DNA adduct formation by aristolochic acids in rats in vivo (see Table 4 for details of studies and references) Aristolochic acid-DNA adducts were formed in vivo in many organs of male rats given oral doses of aristolochic acid (natural mixture) or the pure major componentsaristolochic acid I or aristolochic acid II. Aristolochic acid-DNA adducts were alsoformed in vivo in the kidney (the only organ examined) of male and female rats given multiple oral doses of a slimming regimen of plant material that contained aristolochicacids. The results confirm that the three major DNA adducts formed in vivo co-chromato- Oral administration of a single dose of aristolochic acid I to rats led to formation of the dA-AAI adduct that persisted in DNA of several organs, consistent with the results obtainedfrom studies in patients with Chinese herb nephropathy.IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 96SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 97Table 3.

Among these patients were 18 cases of urothelial carcinoma. Data were related to cumulative doses of compounds in the weight-reducing pills on the basi s of all prescriptions made during the period of exposure (1990-92). The cumulative dose of aristolochia was a significant risk factor for developing urothelial carcinoma. The kidneys and ureters from the CHN patients had the same pattern of adducts consisting of dA-AAI, dG-AAI and dA-AAII. The major adduct dA-AAI was detectable up to 89 months after discontinuation of use of the weight-reducing pills.

(c)In-vitro studies (see Tables 6-8 for details of studies and references) After metabolic activation, aristolochic acid I and aristolochic acid II form adducts in vitro with activating aristolochicacids I and II to reactive species that may form adducts are pH 5.8 and microsomal prepa-rations from various species other than the rat. Aristolochic acid-specific adducts wereformed in calf thymus DNA after activation of aristolochic acids I and II with hepaticmicrosomes from humans, mini-pigs and rats, as well as with microsomes containingrecombinant human CYP1A1 and CYP1A2. From studies with specific inducers andselective inhibitors, it can be concluded that most of the microsomal activation of aristo-lochic acids is due to CYP1A1 and CYP1A2. Activated aristolochic acids I and II react with DNA to form three and two major adducts, respectively. These major adducts that acid reacts preferentiallywith the exocyclic amino group of purine bases. On the basis of the adduct structures, itcan be concluded that reduction of the nitro group is the main metabolic pathway for theactivation of aristolochic acid. The major metabolites, the aristolactams, form DNA adducts in vitro after activation hepatic or horseradish Adducts with calf thymus DNA arealso formed by aristolochic acids I and II in vitro in the presence of rat faecal bacteria. In explants of rat stomach tissue, both acids formed adducts in the DNA of the epitheliallayer. DNA adducts have been detected in MCF-7 cells after exposure to aristolochicacid I and in opossum kidney cells after exposure to an aristolochic acid mixture. After reaction of aristolochic acids with DNA, DNA synthesis by T7 DNA poly- merase and human DNA polymerase is mainly blocked at the nucleotide 3 to the aristolochic acid-induced DNA adducts. This property has allowed the use of polymerasearrest assays that revealed binding of aristolochic acids I and II in vitro to the c-Ha- ras gene and the TP53 gene. Aristolochic acids I and II and the aristolochic acid mixture induced SOS repair and mutations in bacteria.

Both aristolactams were mutagenic in S. typhimurium only with S9 mix. Aristolochic acids I and II did not induce DNA strand breaks in hepatocytes. In cultured human lymphocytes, the It also induced micronuclei in human hepatoma cells in vitro and in mouse bone-marrow cells after administration in vivo , but it did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat stomach after in-vivo treatment. The aristolochic acid mixture as well as aristolochicacids I and II induced mutations at the hprt locus in Salmonella typhimurium , in the granuloma pouch and in Chinese hamster cells. 4.5 Mechanistic considerations Aristolochic acid must be activated in order to form DNA adducts in vitro and in vivo . From the structures of the major aristolochic acid-DNA adducts identified in various in-vitro systems and in animals and humans in vivo , it can be concluded that the major pathway of activation of aristolochic acid is nitroreduction (Figure 6): a cyclicN-acylnitrenium ion with a delocalized positive charge is the ultimate DNA-reactive species that binds preferentially to the exocyclic amino groups of purine nucleotides inDNA or is hydrolysed to the corresponding 7-hydroxyaristolactam. Therefore, the acti-vation of aristolochic acid is a unique example of an intra-molecular acylation whichleads to the DNA-reactive species. This view is supported by the results of the Salmo- nella mutagenicity assays showing that only the nitro group is important for the muta- genic activity of aristolochic acid and by the demonstration that the enzymatic activationof both aristolochic acids by xanthine oxidase, a mammalian nitroreductase, produced anadduct pattern identical to that seen after metabolism mediated by rat liver S9 mix(Schmeiser et al., 1988). It was also demonstrated that both aristolochic acids could be activated by rat liver microsomes through simple nitroreduction (Schmeiser et al., 1997). In a single study, this anaerobic hepatic microsomal activation of aristolochic acid couldbe attributed to CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 and \u2014 to a lesser extent \u2014 to NADPH:CYPreductase (CYPOR) using specific CYP/CYPOR inhibitors (Stiborov\u00e1 et al., 2001a). The adduct patterns in DNA from forestomach and kidney \u2014 target tissues of aristo- lochic acid-mediated carcinogenesis \u2014 and from non-target tissues, such as glandularstomach, liver and lung, were similar. This indicates that adduct formation is notsufficient to result in neoplasia. In rodents, many chemical carcinogens activate the ras proto-oncogene by inducing a single point mutation, resulting in alteration of amino acid residue 12, 13 or 61.Similarly, aristolochic acid-initiated carcinogenesis in rodents is associated with adistinct molecular characteristic, the activation of ras by a specific AT TA transversion mutation in codon 61 (CAA). This mutation occurs exclusively at the first adenine ofcodon 61 of Ha- ras(CAA CTA) in all forestomach and ear-duct tumours of rats treated with aristolochic acid I (Schmeiser et al., 1990) and was also found in tumoursSOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 115of the forestomach and lung of mice treated with a plant extract containing both aristo- lochic acids I and II (Schmeiser et al., 1991). The selectivity of aristolochic acid I for mutations at adenine residues is consistent with the extensive formation of dA-AAIadducts in the target organ (Pfau et al., 1990a; Stiborov\u00e1 et al., 1994). Moreover, an apparently lifelong persistence of the dA-AAI adduct in rat forestomach DNA wasobserved, whereas the less abundant dG-AAI adduct was removed continuously from thesame DNA over a 36-week period after treatment with a single dose of aristolochic acid I(Fernando et al., 1993). Therefore, both the higher initial levels and the longer persis- tence of the dA-AAI adduct in urothelial tissue of patients with Chinese herb nephro-pathy probably contribute to the relative abundance of this adduct. Investigations on the conversion of individual aristolochic acid-DNA adducts into mutations have shown that during in-vitro DNA synthesis, dAMP and dTMP wereincorporated opposite adenine adducts of aristolochic acid indicates a mutagenicpotential resulting from dAMP incorporation by DNA polymerase, consistent with anATTA transversion as the mutagenic consequence. Therefore, the adenine adducts have a higher mutagenic potential than the guanine adducts, which may explain the appa-rent selectivity for mutations found at adenine residues in the rasgenes in aristolochic rodent tumours et al., polymerase arrest assay with a plasmid containing exon 2 of the mouse c-H- rasgene demonstrated that both adenines in codon 61 of this gene are aristo- lochic acid-DNA binding sites (Arlt et al., 2000). Since rasgenes are activated with high frequency by an AT TA transversion mutation in codon 61 of rasDNA from aristo- lochic acid-induced tumours in (Schmeiser et al., 1990), suggests an impor- tant role of the dA-AAI adduct in Chinese herb nephropathy-related urothelial cancer inhumans. Polymerase arrest spectra showed a preference for reaction with purine bases inhuman TP53 for both aristolochic acids. The aristolochic acid-DNA binding spectrum in the TP53 gene did not suggest the existence of any mutational hotspot in urothelial tumours of the current TP53 mutation database. Thus, aristolochic acid is not a likely cause of urothelial tumours not associated with Chinese herb nephropathy (Arlt et al. , 2001b). 5. Summary of Data Reported and Evaluation 5.1 Exposure data Several Aristolochia species (notably A. contorta , A. debilis , A. fangchi and A. manshuriensis ) have been used in traditional Chinese medicine as anti-rheumatics, as diuretics and in the treatment of oedema. Aristolochic acids are nitrophenanthrenecarboxylic acid derivatives that are constituents of these plant species.IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 1165.2 Human carcinogenicity data An outbreak of rapidly progressive renal fibrosis in Belgium involved at least 100 patients, mostly middle-aged women undergoing a weight-loss regimen that included useof a mixture of Chinese herbs containing Aristolochia species incorrectly labelled as Stephania tetrandra . Additional cases of rapidly progressive renal disease involving Chinese herbs have been reported from at least five other countries in Europe and Asia.This syndrome has been called 'Chinese herb nephropathy'. Because of a few early cases of urothelial cancer among Belgian patients suffering from Chinese herb nephropathy, individuals with end-stage renal disease were offeredprophylactic nephroureterectomy. This surgical procedure led to the identification of ahigh prevalence of pre-invasive and invasive neoplastic lesions of the renal pelvis, theureter and the urinary bladder in patients with Chinese herb nephropathy. The number ofmalignancies detected (18 cancers in 39 women undergoing prophylactic nephroureter-ectomy) greatly exceeded the expected number of these uncommon tumours. There wasa positive dose-response relationship between the consumption of the herbal mixtureand the prevalence of the tumours. Some cases of clinically invasive disease have beendescribed in the follow-up of end-stage Chinese herb nephropathy patients not under-going prophylactic nephroureterectomy. Subsequent phytochemical investigation led to the identification of aristolochic acids in the herbal mixture consumed by these patients. While there was batch-to-batchvariation in the chemical composition of such mixtures employed in the weight-lossclinics in Belgium, specific aristolochic acid-DNA adducts were found in urothelialtissue specimens from all the urothelial cancer patients, providing conclusive evidenceof exposure to plants of the genus Aristolochia . One additional case of urothelial cancer following treatment for eczema with another herbal mixture that contained aristolochic acid has been reported. 5.3 Animal carcinogenicity data Aristolochic acids, when tested for carcinogenicity by oral administration in mice and rats and by intraperitoneal injection in rabbits, induced forestomach carcinomas inmice and rats, and fibrotic changes in the kidney together with a low incidence of kidneytumours in rabbits. Subcutaneous injection of aristolochic acids into rats induced a low incidence of uro- thelial carcinomas in the kidney and malignant fibrohistiocytic sarcomas at the injectionsite. 5.4 Other relevant data Several structurally defined metabolites (mainly nitroreduction products) have been reported following oral administration of aristolochic acid I (five metabolites) and aristo-SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 117lochic acid II (three metabolites) to rats and mice. Fewer metabolites were observed in beagle dogs, rabbits, guinea-pigs and humans than in rats and mice. The toxic effects of aristolochic acids I and II have been inferred from effects seen in patients suffering from kidney nephropathy as a result of consuming herbal mixturescontaining Aristolochia species, which leads to rapidly progressive fibrosing interstitial nephritis. In experimental animals, high doses of aristolochic acids administered eitherorally or intravenously caused severe necrosis of the renal tubules, atrophy of the spleenand thymus, and ulceration of by hyperplasia hyper-keratosis of the squamous epithelium. Various constituents of Aristolochia indica including aristolochic acids and aristolic acid (a metabolite) caused termination of pregnancy in female mice, hamsters andrabbits, but not rats. The dose levels used, however, may also lead to general toxicity. Aristolochic acids, when metabolically activated by nitroreduction, are consistently active in genotoxicity tests in vivo and in vitro . They form DNA adducts in rodent tissues and activate rasoncogenes through a specific mutation in codon 61. Aristo- lochic acid-specific DNA adducts were identified in urothelial tissues of all patients withChinese herb nephropathy. 5.5 Evaluation There is sufficient evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of herbal remedies containing plant species of the genus Aristolochia . There are no data in experimental animals on the carcinogenicity of herbal remedies containing plant species of the genus Aristolochia . There is limited evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of naturally occurring mixtures of aristolochic acids. There is sufficient evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of aristo- lochic acids. Overall evaluation Herbal remedies containing plant species of the genus Aristolochia are carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) . Naturally occurring mixtures of aristolochic acids are probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A) . 6. References Abel, G. & Schimmer, O.

ANTHRAQUINONES 1. and botanical data 1.1.1 Rubia tinctorum L.(Rubiaceae ) The medicinal part of is the dried root (Blumenthal (common names: madder, dyer's madder (Felter & Lloyd, 2002)). The small yellowish-green flowers are in loose, leafy, long-peduncled terminal or axillary cymes. The marginof the calyx is indistinct, 4- to 5-sectioned and has a tip that is curved inward. There arefive stamens and an inferior ovary. The fruit is a black, pea-sized glabrous, smooth drupecontaining two seeds. The perennial plant grows to a height of 60 to 100 cm. The pencil-thick rhizome creeps widely underground. The stem is quadrangular with backward-turning prickles at the edges. The stems are at times so thin that they are more descendentthan erect. The leaves are in whorls, in fours below, in sixes above. They are oblong tolanceolate with one rib and protrudingly reticulate beneath. The plant is indigenous tosouthern Europe, western Asia and North Africa, and is cultivated elsewhere (MedicalEconomics Co., 2000). 1.1.2 Morinda officinalis How (Rubiaceae ) of M. officinalis is cylinder-shaped (with oblate circumference of the section) and slightly curved. The diameter of the root is usually 0.5-2 cm. Thesurface, with vertical wrinkles and transverse crackles, is yellowish-gray or dark gray. Insome roots, the bark is thicker, violet or light violet in colour, and easy to separate fromthe xylem. The xylem, with a diameter of 1-5 mm and with slightly dentate margin, ishard and whitish-yellow in colour. Morinda root is odourless, sweetand slightly sour in taste. The fleshy root is used for medicinal purposes. -129-1.2 Use The roots of R. tinctorum contain a red colouring matter which is used for dyeing. Additionally, extracts from R. tinctorum are used for the treatment of kidney and bladder stones (Westendorf et al., 1990; Bl\u00f6meke et al., 1992). Plants containing 1-hydroxy- anthraquinone have been widely used for pharmaceutical purposes such as treatment ofkidney and bladder stones, as a laxative mixture, and as a mild sedative (Brown &Brown, 1976; Mori et al., 1990; Wang et al., 1992). Madder root has reportedly also been used medicinally for menstrual and urinary disorders (Medical Economics Co., 1998,2000). The roots of M. officinalis have been used as a Chinese natural medicine for tonic and analgesic purposes. Anthraquinone glycosides are the active principles of plant-derived laxatives such as senna, cascara, frangula, rhubarb and aloe. These five plant-derived laxative substancesare not included in the present review, because there are no published reports on theirIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 130 Figure 1. Morinda officinalis How From Qian (1996) 1. flower twig; 2, flower; 3, stamen in tive ingredient of senna, was formerly marketed as a laxative under the trade nameDantron \u00ae, but human drug products containing Dantron\u00ae(see IARC, 1990) were with- drawn from commerce in the United States in 1987 after it was shown to cause intestinaltumours in experimental animals. 1.3 Chemical constituents Anthracene derivatives are widely distributed in the plant kingdom. Especially in the dicotyledons, many families, such the monocotyledons, only the family Liliaceae ( Aloe) contains this class of chemicals. About 90% of these compounds occur as derivatives of 9,10-anthracenedione (anthraquinones) with several hydroxy and otherfunctional groups, such as methyl, hydroxymethyl and carboxy groups. Hydroxyanthra-quinones are the active principles of many phytotherapeutic drugs. 1.3.1 al., 1998; Backheet, 1998; Marczylo et al., 2000). A number of compounds have been characterized from the roots of R. tinctorum (the source of commercial madder colour) by various analytical methods. Among these these compounds (Kawasaki et al ., 1992; Westendorf et al ., 1998; Medical Economics Co., 2000). The majority of the anthraquinones present in the plant itself or in plant extracts are glycosides (Bl\u00f6mekeet al., 1992; Westendorf et al., 1998).SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 1311.3.2 Morinda officinalis A number of compounds have been isolated from M. officinalis . Anthraquinones found (officinalisin) and several amino acids have also been found (Li et al. , 1991; Yang et al., 1992; Yoshikawa et al., 1995; Zheng & Dong, 1997; Yao et al., 1998). 1.4 Sales and consumption No data were available to the Working Group. 1.5 Component(s) with potential cancer hazard (1-hydroxyanthraquinone; 1,3-dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethylanthraquinone (lucidin)) Synonyms VOLUME 82 1321.5.2 Structural and molecular formulae and mass 1-Hydroxyanthraquinone 270.24 1.5.3 physical properties of the pure substance 1-Hydroxyanthraquinone (a)Description : Fine yellow crystals (Buckingham, 2001) (b)Melting-point : 195-196 \u00b0C (Buckingham, 2001) Lucidin (a)Description : Yellow crystals (Buckingham, 2001) (b)Melting-point : 330 \u00b0C (Buckingham, 2001) (c)Dissociation constant : pKa, 8.11 (20 \u00b0C, water) (Buckingham, 2001) Analysis A method using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has been described that allows the separation of 13 naturally occurring naphthoquinonesand anthraquinones, including 1-hydroxyanthraquinone. The separation was achievedunder isocratic and gradient conditions (Steinert et al., 1996). The following method has been used to determine hydroxyanthraquinones in experi- mental laboratory animal diet containing madder. Hydroxyanthraquinones were isolatedSOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 133 OH O O OH O OCH2OH OHby Soxhlet extraction with ethyl acetate, evaporation of the solvent, and dissolution in methanol. Separation of the hydroxyanthraquinones was accomplished by HPLC withspectrometric detection at 410 nm (Westendorf et al., 1998). Lucidin content in R. tinctorum crude drug powder has been determined using reversed-phase HPLC with methanol/acetic acid as the mobile phase and detection at225 nm (Wang et al., 1997). An HPLC method with isocratic elution has been developed for the separation of anthraquinones with particular attention to the detection of lucidin in commerciallyavailable sources of R. tinctorum aglycones (Bos\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al., 2000). A reversed-phase HPLC method has been developed for the simultaneous character- ization of anthraquinone glycosides and aglycones in extracts of R. tinctorum . The anthraquinones, including lucidin, are separated on a reversed-phase column with awater-acetonitrile gradient as eluent and measured with ultraviolet detection at 250 nm(Krizsan et al., 1996; Derksen et al., 1998). 1.5.5 Production 1-Hydroxyanthraquinone has been synthesized by diazotization of 1-aminoanthra- quinone and heating the diazonium salt with concentrated sulfuric acid. After dilutionwith water, the precipitated crude product was diluted with acetone and purified by pre-parative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) in toluene:ethyl formate:formic acid (75:24:1)(Bl\u00f6meke et al., 1992). A general method for synthesis of anthraquinones, including 1-hydroxy-anthraqui- none, has been developed. The anthraquinones were obtained under mild conditions fromortho -dicarboxylic acid chlorides and suitable aromatic substrates via a Friedel-Crafts process (Sartori et al., 1990). 1-Hydroxyanthraquinone has also been prepared in 96.4% yield by reacting 1-nitro- anthraquinone with sodium formate in dimethylformamide at 130 \u00b0C for 17 hours(Michalowicz, 1981). Lucidin has been synthesized from nordamnacanthal (Prista et al. , 1965). Available information indicates that 1-hydroxyanthraquinone is manufactured by one company each in China and Japan (Chemical Information Services, 2001). 1.5.6 Use Anthraquinones are the largest group of naturally occurring quinones. Both natural and synthetic anthraquinones have been widely used as colourants in food, drugs,cosmetics, hair dyes and textiles (Brown & Brown, 1976; Mori et al., 1990). 1-Hydroxy- anthraquinone can be used as an intermediate in the production of dyes and drugs (Imaki& Fukumoto, 1988). The Working Group was not aware of any commercial use ofpurified lucidin.IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 1341.5.7 Occurrence 1-Hydroxyanthraquinone has the herb Cassia occidentalis (Brown & Brown, 1976; Mori et al., 1990; Wang et al. , 1992; Yang et al. , 1992; Steinert et al., 1996; Buckingham, 2001). 1-Hydroxy- anthraquinone has also been identified to rats (Bl\u00f6meke et al., 1992). Lucidin has been identified in plants from Rubia (R. tinctorum, R. iberica 1981; Zhural'ov et al., 1987; Buckingham, 2001). 1.5.8 Human exposure Thousands of patients in European countries have been treated chronically in the past, against kidney stones, with madder root preparations ( R. tinctorum ) at high doses. The daily amount of lucidin ingested by these patients was calculated to be 3-10 mg.Under certain circumstances, the daily lucidin intake may even reach several hundredmilligrams (Westendorf et al., 1998). 2. Studies of Cancer in Humans Laxatives based on naturally occurring anthraquinone derivatives Herbs containing anthraquinone derivatives (rhubarb, senna, frangula, cascara, aloe) are used as laxatives. A meta-analysis of 11 studies dealing with colorectal cancers andlaxative use showed that use of laxatives carried an increased risk (odds ratio, 1.5;95% CI, 1.3-1.6) for colorectal cancer (Sonnenberg & M\u00fcller, 1993). A more recent andvery large study among nurses in the USA found no association between colorectalcancer and laxative use (Dukas et al. , 2000). The relevance of this evidence to the carci- nogenicity of anthraquinone-containing herbs used as laxatives is unknown because it isuncertain whether the use of laxatives in general is an adequate proxy measure for theuse of anthraquinones. The following studies mentioned anthraquinones specifically in evaluating laxative use as a risk factor for cancer. Also reported below are studies that used melanosis colias a marker of exposure, because this in turn may reflect consumption of anthraquinones(see Section 4.2).SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 1352.1 Case-control studies 2.1.1 Gastrointestinal cancer Boyd and Doll (1954) analysed data collected in a previous inquiry, which detailed histories of purgative use for 2249 patients. People whose history of taking purgativesextended over a continuous period of at least five years were considered as 'purgativeusers'. After excluding patients suffering from gastrointestinal diseases other than cancer,there remained 614 patients with gastrointestinal cancers (387 cancers of the large boweland 227 cancers of the stomach) and 1313 control patients (647 cancers of the lung and666 patients with non-cancer non-gastrointestinal diseases). A history of regular (at leastonce per week) use of purgatives was reported for 222/614 [36.2%] of the patients withgastrointestinal cancer and 343/1313 [26.1%] of the control patients. Use of cascara wasreported by [6%] of cases and [5.4%] of controls. Use of senna was reported by [6.2%]of cases and [2.6%] of controls and when exposure was restricted to chronic users (regu-larly, at least once per week), the percentages were [5.2%] of cases and [1.7%] of con-trols ( p= 0.04). The difference between cases and controls was similar for separate consi- deration of cancer of the large bowel. Siegers et al. (1993) studied retrospectively 3049 patients and prospectively 1095 patients who underwent endoscopic examinations in L\u00fcbeck, Germany. In the retros-pective study, melanosis coli was found in 3.1% of patients without other abnormalities,in [2.8%] of patients with colitis or diverticulosis, in 8.6% of patients with adenomas andin 3.9% of patients with carcinomas. In the prospective study, melanosis coli was foundin 6.9% in patients without other abnormalities, in [4.5%] in patients with colitis or diver-ticulosis, in 9.8% of patients with adenomas and in 18.6% of patients with carcinomas.The relative risk for colorectal cancer among subjects with melanosis coli was 3.0(95% CI, 1.2-4.9). Among 33 of the patients who had both melanosis coli and adenomaor carcinoma, all but two acknowledged abuse of anthranoid laxatives for 10-30 years.[The Working Group noted that detection of melanosis coli requires colonoscopy and thatindication of colonoscopy may result in selection bias of the controls.] Kune (1993) analysed laxative use in 685 colorectal cancer patients in Australia, diagnosed over a 12-month period (1980-81), compared with 723 age- and sex-matchedcommunity-based controls. Use of laxatives containing anthraquinones was reported by[13.9%] of the cases of colorectal cancers and [14.1%] of controls. Comparing cases andcontrols using laxatives containing anthraquinones with patients and controls using nolaxatives, the relative risk for colorectal cancer related to the use of laxatives containinganthraquinones was 1.01 [confidence intervals were not reported]. In a retrospective analysis of 2229 consecutive patients having undergone a colonos- copy in Erlangen, Germany, between 1985 and 1992, the presence of colorectal cancerwas not associated with melanosis coli or laxative use: colorectal cancer was present in2.7% ( n= 60) of all patients, 2.9 % ( n= 3) of the 102 patients with melanosis coli n= 9) of the 286 patients with anthranoid laxative use (relative risk, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.48-2.3) al., 1997). [The WorkingIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 136Group noted some discrepancies with data from the same study reported by Nusko et al. (1993).] Nusko et al. (2000) performed a prospective case-control study in Erlangen of the association between anthranoid laxative use and risk for development of colorectal ade-nomas or carcinomas. The study included a total of 202 patients with newly diagnosedcolorectal carcinomas, 114 patients with adenomatous polyps and 238 patients (controls)with no colorectal neoplasms who had been referred for total colonoscopy between 1993and 1996. For each subject, the use of anthranoid preparations was assessed by standar-dized non-blind interview after colonoscopy, and melanosis coli was studied by histo-pathological examination. Use of anthranoid laxatives was reported by 33/238 controls,16/114 adenoma patients and 29/202 carcinoma patients. Anthranoid use did not conferany significantly elevated risk for development of colorectal adenomas (unadjusted oddsratio, 1.0; radio, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.6-1.8).After adjustment for the risk factors age, sex and blood in the stools by logisticregression analysis, the odds ratio for adenomas was 0.84 (95% 0.4-1.7) and 0.5-1.7). Duration of anthranoid laxative use, whenincluded in the logistic regression as a continuous variable, was not significantly asso-ciated with colorectal carcinoma ( p= 0.41). Macroscopic and high-grade microscopic melanosis coli were not significantly associated with the development of adenomas orcarcinomas. 2.1.2 Urothelial cancer Bronder et al. (1999) reported on 766 cases of urothelial cancers (98% confirmed by histology) in Berlin, Germany, between 1990 and 1994. A control group (1:1) wasobtained by sampling, from the West Berlin Population Registry, persons of Germannationality who had lived in Germany for at least 20 years and matched with the patientsfor sex and age. Through a standardized questionnaire completed by 648 patients and647 controls, social class was recorded as well as consumption of analgesics, laxativesand tobacco. After adjustment for tobacco use and social class, the risk of urothelialcarcinoma was increased in laxative users. Use of contact laxatives was reported by 63urothelial cancer patients versus 29 controls (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5-4.2) and 13renal pelvis and ureter versus two controls (odds ratio, 9.3; 95% CI,1.1-83.3). For different laxatives, the corresponding figures (urothelial cancer patientsversus controls) were: chemical and anthranoid laxatives, five versus two (odds ratio,2.7; 95% CI, 0.47-16); anthranoid laxatives alone, 37 versus 20 (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% CI,1.1-3.7); aloe, 16 versus 11 (odds ratio, senna, 1.1-5.0); eight versus four (odds ratio, 2.6;95% CI, 0.68-9.6). [The Working Group noted that no results for laxatives adjusted foruse of analgesics were presented.]SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 1373. Studies of Cancer in Experimental Animals 3.1 1-Hydroxyanthraquinone 3.1.1 Oral administration Rat: A group of 30 male ACI/N rats, 1.5 months of age, was fed 1% 1-hydroxyanthra- quinone in CE-2 diet throughout the experimental period of 480 days. Thirty control ratswere fed basal diet. Rats that survived more than 280 days developed various tumours ofthe intestine (25/29). nodules (5/29) wereobserved. No such tumours were observed in control animals (Mori et al., 1990). A group of 27 male ACI/N rats, six weeks of age, was fed 1.5% 1-hydroxyanthra- quinone in the diet for 48 weeks. A second group (14 rats) was also given 16 mg/L indo-methacin in the drinking-water for the experimental period. Fifteen control rats were fedbasal diet. Rats fed with 1-hydroxyanthraquinone had incidences indomethacin, these inci-dences were 0/14 and 2/14, respectively. Untreated animals and rats given indomethacinalone had no neoplasms in the large intestine and forestomach (Tanaka et al., 1991). 3.1.2 Administration with known carcinogens Rat: Two groups of male and female ACI/N rats, six weeks of age, were given weekly intraperitoneal injections of 25 mg/kg bw methylazoxymethanol acetate for two weeks.One group (21 males and 20 females) was subsequently fed 1% 1-hydroxyanthraquinoneuntil the end of the experiment (44 weeks). The second group treated with methylazoxy-methanol acetate (19 males and 19 females) was fed basal diet. A third group (17 malesand 20 females) received 1-hydroxyanthraquinone alone and a control group (16 malesand 22 females) was fed basal diet only. The incidences of caecal tumours and and 1-hydroxyanthraquinone were significantlyhigher ( p< 0.05) than those of the groups treated with methylazoxymethanol acetate alone (caecal tumours: males, incidence and multiplicity of caecumand colon tumours in the first group were significantly greater than the combined resultsIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 138for those of second and third groups, suggesting that 1-hydroxyanthraquinone acted synergistically with methylazoxymethanol acetate (Mori et al. , 1991). 3.2 1,3-Dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethylanthraquinone (lucidin) No data on the carcinogenicity of lucidin in rodents were available to the Working Group, but this compound is an active principle of Rubia tinctorum used as a herbal medicine. Rat: Groups of 15-20 male and female ACI rats, weighing 150-200 g, were fed a standard diet containing 0, 1 or 10% madder root ( but also large amounts of alizarin (0.67%; 1,2-dihydroxy-anthraquinone) and the primeverosides of both compounds. All surviving animals werekilled and necropsied at 780 days. In the groups receiving 10% madder root diet, 2/16males and 3/17 females developed hepatocellular wereobserved in the controls or the 1% madder root group of either sex. In addition, renaltubule-cell adenomas were observed in 1/16 males and 2/16 females in the 10% madderroot group and a renal tubule-cell carcinoma in in the 1% madder root group.No renal tumours were seen in the control groups (Westendorf et al. , 1998). [The Working Group noted the small number of animals used in this study and that the madderroot contained large amounts of other compounds such as alizarin.] 4. Other Data Relevant to an Evaluation of Carcinogenicity and its Mechanisms 4.1 Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion 1-Hydroxyanthraquinone (a)Humans No data were available to the Working Group. (b)Experimental systems In an early study, 1-hydroxyanthraquinone was found to be absorbed when conti- nuously administered to rats [strain not specified] by stomach tube (50 mg suspended inaqueous gum arabic), and its metabolites were identified by paper chromatography.Urine and faeces were collected during 48 h after treatment and extracted with diethylether. Of the 1-hydroxyanthraquinone originally present, 2.49% and 0.74% were into alizarin in after sulfation and glucuronidation (Fujita et , 1961). SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 1391,3-Dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethylanthraquinone (lucidin) (a)Humans No data were available to the Working Group. (b)Experimental systems No direct information was found on the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of ludicin in experimental animal systems. However, a report has appeared onthe oral administration of lucidin 3- O-primeveroside to rats, which resulted in the excretion in the urine of lucidin and (to a lesser extent) rubiadin (1,3-dihydroxy-2-methylanthraquinone) (Bl\u00f6meke et al. , 1992). 4.2 Toxic effects Chronic ingestion of laxatives of the anthracene group such as cascara, senna, fran- gula, aloe or rhubarb is considered to be an etiological factor in melanosis coli, a condi-tion in which colonic macrophages accumulate a dark pigment with the staining charac-teristics of lipofuscin. In 14 patients submitted to 11 4-14 months and elimi-nated it nine times by withdrawing the laxative for 5-11 months. Steer and Colin-Jones(1975) studied histological patterns of rectal biopsies from seven patients with melanosiscoli three months after they ceased to take anthraquinone-containing purgatives. Adecrease was observed in the number of macrophages infiltrating the mucosa, as well asa reduction in the intensity of the acid phosphatase reaction. The effect of anthraquinone glycosides on cell proliferation in the sigmoid colon of patients in vivo has been studied. Twenty-four hours before colonoscopy with a sigmoid biopsy, nine patients were given an oral dose of 1 mL/kg of a syrup containing2.0 mg/mL of the anthraquinone glycosides sennosides A and B. Proliferative activity ofepithelial cells was determined by incubating the biopsy specimens with the thymidineanalogue 5-bromo-2 -deoxyuridine (BrdU) and then visualizing BrdU-labelled cells immunochemically. activity was expressed as the labelling index, i.e. thenumber of labelled nuclei divided by the total number of nuclei multiplied by 100 (%).Data from these nine subjects were compared with those of 10 subjects who had a normalcolonoscopy and 14 patients with sporadic colonic neoplasms who had not receivedanthraquinone laxatives before the colonoscopy. The labelling index (% \u00b1SD) was significantly higher in the group given the sennosides (26.4 \u00b16.1) than in normal patients (5.7\u00b11.8) or with a colonic neoplasm (8.7 \u00b12.6; p< 0.005). Furthermore, the reduction of the number of cells per crypt, observed as a reduced crypt height in thetreated group, suggests that compensatory cell proliferation may occur as well(Kleibeuker et al., 1995).IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 1401-Hydroxyanthraquinone (a)Humans No data were available to the Working Group. (b)Experimental systems Little information is available on the toxic effects of 1-hydroxyanthraquinone in experimental animals, and no acute toxicity studies have been reported. A group ofACI/N rats fed 1.5% 1-hydroxyanthraquinone in the diet for 48 weeks showed inflam-matory changes of various degrees (colitis, ulcerative colitis or melanosis coli) in thelarge bowel, but no clinical sign of toxicity (Tanaka et al. , 1995). 1-Hydroxyanthraquinone was fed in the diet (0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%) to male Fischer 344 rats for seven days. Induction of cell proliferation in the intestines was ana-lysed by BrdU labelling. At the high dose, 1-hydroxyanthraquinone induced cell proli-feration in the caecum and the proximal colorectum, but there was little evidence ofintestinal cytotoxicity (Toyoda et al., 1994). 1-Hydroxyanthraquinone is a constituent of the heartwood of Tabebuia avellanedae (Burnett & Thompson, 1967; Steinert et al. the roots of Morinda officinalis and Damnacanthus indicus (Yang et al. , 1992). No reports documenting toxicity of any of these three plants appear to have been published. 1,3-Dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethylanthraquinone (lucidin) (a)Humans No data were available to the Working Group. (b)Experimental systems No information was available on general toxic effects of lucidin. However, this com- pound is a known constituent of the roots of Rubia tinctorum (madder) (Burnett & Thomson, 1968a), and one study has been published on the acute and subacute toxicityof madder root. A 14-day toxicity test was conducted on an aqueous extract of madderroot administered by gavage to (C57BL/6 \u00d7C3H)F 1mice. The maximum tolerated dose was between 3500 and 5000 mg/kg bw. A subacute toxicity test was then performed on62 mice of each sex with madder root extract incorporated into their diet at 0, 0.3, 0.6,1.25, 2.5 or 5% for 90 days. All mice tolerated these doses well, and none showedclinical signs of toxicity or adverse effects on body weight gain. Histopathological exa-mination showed retention cysts of the kidneys and epidermal vaginal cysts in a few ofthe treated and control mice. It was concluded that dietary exposure to madder root at thedoses tested had no significant acute or subacute toxic effects on mice (Ino et al. , 1995). [The Working Group noted that this study is more germane to the toxicity of anyglycoside forms of lucidin present than to that of the aglycone itself.]SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 1414.3 Reproductive and developmental effects 1-Hydroxyanthraquinone and 1,3-dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethylanthraquinone (lucidin) (a)Humans No data were available to the Working Group. (b)Experimental systems No data were available to the Working Group . 4.4 Genetic and related effects (a)Humans No data were available to the Working Group. (b)Experimental systems (for references see Table 1) 1-Hydroxyanthraquinone 1-Hydroxyanthraquinone induced frameshift mutations in Salmonella typhimurium TA1537 in the absence of metabolic activation; addition of liver homogenate led to areduction of the mutagenic activity. In strains TA98 and TA100, no mutagenic effectswere seen. The induction of unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes in vitro was studied independently by two groups and a positive response was found in both studies. A few studies were available on genotoxic effects of alizarin, a metabolite of 1- hydroxyanthraquinone. Alizarin was weakly mutagenic in S. typhimurium TA1537 in presence of S9 and in rat hepatocyte DNA-repair assays, but it was consistently inactivein transformation experiments with C3H/M2 mouse fibroblasts and in Hprt mutation assays with Chinese hamster V79 cells (Westendorf et al., 1990). 1,3-Dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethylanthraquinone (lucidin) A positive response was obtained with lucidin in Salmonella /microsome reverse mutation frameshift strain TA1537 and in the base substitutionstrain TA100. The compound was mutagenic in these assays in the absence of metabolicactivation and addition of liver homogenate had no major effect on the mutagenicpotency. Lucidin also gave positive results in unscheduled DNA synthesis experimentswith rat liver cells, it caused gene mutations in Chinese hamster V79 cells (without acti-vation) and it transformed mouse fibroblasts. With polynucleotides in vitro the compound binds to DNA bases. The only data from an in-vivo study indicated that DNAadducts were present in various organs of mice fed lucidin (2 mg per day per animal forIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 142SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 143Table 1.

In hepatic tissue, 1.16 \u00b10.2 adducts per 108nucleotides were detected; slightly higher adduct levels were found in kidneys and duodenum, namely 2.19 \u00b11.2 and 1.91 \u00b10.6, respectively (Poginsky et ., 1991). The only genotoxicity assay in which lucidin gave a negative response was the Drosophila wing-spot test. 4.5 Mechanistic considerations 1-Hydroxyanthraquinone There is some evidence that 1-hydroxyanthraquinone is genotoxic. In rats, induction of cell proliferation in vivo was seen in the caecum which was paralleled by enhanced ornithine decarboxylase activity (Mori et al., 1992). In a combination experiment with methylazoxymethanol acetate (given by single intraperitoneal injection) and 1-hydroxy-anthraquinone (1% in diet; 40 weeks), the level of tumour necrosis factor was increased when rats were exposed to the combination compared with the groups thatreceived either compound alone. It was postulated that this might account for the syner-gistic carcinogenic effect of these compounds (see Section 3.2.2) (Yoshimi et al. , 1994). In studies of mutations in cancer-related genes from tumours of rats exposed to methyl-azoxymethanol acetate and 1-hydroxyanthraquinone, specific mutations were found inthe gene encoding -catenin but not in other genes such as apc(Suzui et al., 1999). 1,3-Dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethylanthraquinone (lucidin) Lucidin is genotoxic in vitro and in vivo (Westendorf et al. , 1988). Data on carcino- genic activity of this compound were not available, but it has been shown that madderroot ( Rubia tinctorum ) \u2014 which contains lucidin \u2014 causes tumours in liver and kidneys of rats. The DNA-adduct pattern from colon, liver and kidneys of rats showed one adductthat was also found when deoxyguanosine-3 -monophosphate was incubated with luci- din in vitro . This supports the assumption that lucidin is involved in the carcinogenic effects of Rubia tinctorum (Westendorf et al. , 1998). It has been hypothesized that luci- din is activated by phase II enzymes through substitution of the hydroxymethyl group,followed by hydrolytic cleavage, leading to the formation of DNA-reactive methylenemetabolite or carbenium ion (Poginsky et al., 1991).SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 1455. Summary of Data Reported and Evaluation 5.1 Exposure data Hydroxyanthraquinones are constituents of a number of plant species including Rubia tinctorum (madder root) and Morinda officinalis that are used traditional herbal medicines. 1,3-Dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethylanthraquinone (lucidin) occurs in R. tincto- rum in the form of glycoside conjugates, and 1-hydroxyanthraquinone similarly occurs in M. officinalis . 5.2 Human carcinogenicity data Herbs containing anthraquinone derivatives Herbs containing anthraquinone derivatives are used as laxatives and several studies have reported data relating indices of use of such laxatives to cancer outcomes. In anearly British study, patients with gastrointestinal cancer reported higher past chronic useof senna than did patients with other diseases. Three German case-control studies oncolorectal cancer using melanosis coli as an exposure indicator gave conflicting results.An Australian case-control study on colorectal cancer which assessed self-reported useof anthraquinone laxatives as an index of exposure found no excess risk. A study of uro-thelial cancer in Germany found elevated relative risks in relation to several types oflaxative, including those containing anthraquinones. For all of these case-control studies,it is difficult to exclude bias and confounding from dietary habits, constipation or use ofanalgesics. Except for two studies (the Australian colorectal cancer and the German uro-thelial cancer studies), selection of controls is also a major concern. 5.3 Animal carcinogenicity data 1-Hydroxyanthraquinone was tested for carcinogenicity by oral administration in three studies in rats and induced adenocarcinomas of the large intestine in two studies. No carcinogenicity tests have been carried out with 1,3-dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl- anthraquinone (lucidin) per se ( Rubia tinctorum ) (which contains this compound among others) was tested by oral administration in rats. Madderroot caused an increase in hepatocellular adenomas and adenomas and carcinomas of therenal cortex in males and females in a single experiment.IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 1465.4 Other relevant data 1-Hydroxyanthraquinone is metabolized by rats and excreted as alizarin (1,2-di- hydroxyanthraquinone). When given orally to rats, it induced inflammatory changes inthe colon. It is mutagenic in bacteria and causes unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat livercells in vitro . Lucidin in bacteria, mutagenic and genotoxic in cultured mammalian cellsand forms DNA adducts in mice. 5.5 Evaluation There is inadequate evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of laxatives contai- ning anthraquinone derivatives. There is sufficient evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of 1-hydroxyanthraquinone. There is limited evidence in experimental animals the carcinogenicity of madder root ( Rubia tinctorum ). to humans (Group 3) . 6. References Bauch, H.J. & Leistner, E.

Exposure Data 1.1 Origin, type and botanical data (Molyneux et al. , with pinnatifid and relatively hairless leaves, revealing its bright green leafcolour. It has bright yellow flowers on the stems at about the same height above theground. This gives the plant a flat-topped appearance when in bloom. It produces flowersin late summer to early autumn and dies back to ground level after the first frost. It growsin dry, sandy soils and its roots are long and about as thick as a lead pencil. Senecio longilobus (also known as woolly groundsel and thread-leaf groundsel) is a shrubby, erect, branched, leafy plant, 30-60 cm tall. It has narrowly linear leaves whichare thick, white, and occasionally pinnately lobed, up to 10 cm long. The compositeyellow flower heads contain numerous clusters. In North America, this is a commonplant with a range extending from Colorado to Utah, south to Texas and Mexico(Kingsbury, 1964). 1.2 Use The 'bush tea' used in Jamaica to treat children for a cold an a herbal tea that is popular in the south-west USA, gordolobo yerba, may contain riddelliine (Stillman et al. , 1977a; Huxtable, 1980; National Toxicology Program, 2002). 1.3 Chemical constituents The plants (ragworts) from which riddelliine and other pyrrolizidine alkaloids are isolated are found in the rangelands of the western USA. Cattle, horses and, lesscommonly, sheep that ingest these plants can succumb to their toxic effects (called pyrro-lizidine alkaloidosis). Riddelliine residues have been found in meat, milk and honey. Theplants may contaminate human food sources as intact plants, and their seeds may conta-minate commercial grains such as wheat (Fu et al., 2001; National Toxicology Program, 2002). The main chemical constituents of importance in S. riddellii are pyrrolizidine alkaloids. -153-Four pyrrolizidine alkaloids have riddelliine, retrorsine, senecionine and seneciphylline (Segall & Molyneux, 1978). 1.4 Sales and consumption No information was available to the Working Group. 1.5 Component with potential cancer hazard (riddelliine) Riddelliine was evaluated previously (IARC, 1976). 1.5.1 Nomenclature Serv.

Pyrrolic metabolites from pyrrolizidine alkaloids were detected in liver and dried blood samples from pigs fed varying amounts of riddelline using gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (Schoch et al., 2000). 1.5.5 Production Riddelliine is produced commercially only as a reference standard and as a research chemical (National Toxicology Program, 2002). 1.5.6 Use Riddelliine has no known commercial use. 1.5.7 Occurrence Riddelliine is found in S. 2001; R\u00f6der, 2002). Structurally, riddelliine belongs to a class of toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids that are esters of unsaturated basic alcohols (necines) and of a necic acid produced by plantsgrowing in climates ranging from temperate to tropical. The pyrrolizidine alkaloid-producing plants are unrelated taxonomically. The alkaloids occur in different parts ofthe plants, with the highest content in the seeds and flowering tops. The quantity of thealkaloids varies, depending on the season, climate and soil constitution (Fu et al., 2001; National Toxicology Program, 2002). 2. Studies of Cancer in Humans Riddelliine No report of cancer related to the intake of riddelliine or of Senecio spp. in humans was available to the Working Group.SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 1553. Studies of Cancer in Experimental Animals Riddelliine Oral administration Mouse : Groups of 50 male B6C3F1mice, 5-6 weeks of age, were administered 0, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 or 3 mg/kg bw riddelliine by gavage in sodium phosphate buffer on five daysper week for 105 weeks. Groups of 50 female B6C3F 1mice, 5-6 weeks of age, were administered 0 or 3 mg/kg riddelliine by gavage in sodium phosphate buffer on five daysper week for 105 weeks. Mean survival (days) among these groups was 696 (0.0 mg/kg),705 (0.1 mg/kg), 716 (0.3 mg/kg), 701 (1 mg/kg) and 667 (3 mg/kg) for males and 670(0.0 mg) and 678 (3 mg/kg) for females. The incidence of hepatic haemangiosarcomas inmales that received 3 mg/kg was significantly greater the controls (2/50,1/50, 0/50, 2/50, 31/50 ( p< 0.001) at doses of 0, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 3 mg/kg, respectively). The incidence of hepatocellular tumours was negatively correlated with dose in malemice and was significantly decreased in females given the 3 mg/kg dose. The incidencesof bronchiolo-alveolar adenoma (1/50 andcarcinoma combined (2/50 control versus 13/50 treated) were significantly increased inthe highest-dose females compared with control females. The incidence of bronchiolo-alveolar tumours in this group exceeded the historical control range for this neoplasm(National Toxicology Program, 2002). Rat: Groups of 50 female Fischer 344 rats, 5-6 weeks of age, were administered riddelliine in sodium phosphate buffer by gavage at doses of 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 and1 mg/kg bw on five days per week for 105 weeks. Groups of 50 males were administeredriddelliine similarly at doses of 0 or 1 mg/kg bw for only 72 weeks, due to mortality inhigh-dose males. All high-dose (1 mg/kg bw) females died before week 97. Survival offemales in the other groups was not affected. In females, there was increased incidenceof haemangiosarcoma at the and 38/50(p< 0.001) at doses of 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg, respectively). Hepatocellular adenoma/carcinoma combined and 8/50(p< 0.001) at doses of 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg, respectively). Mononuclear- cell leukaemia and 14/50 at doses of 0,0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg, respectively (trend test positive, p= 0.009). In treated males, mononuclear-cell leukaemia (National Toxicology Program, 2002). Groups of 20 male and 20 female Fischer 344 rats, 6-8 weeks old, were given 0, 0.1, 0.33, 1.0, 3.3 or 10 mg/kg bw riddelliine by gavage in phosphate buffer five times perweek. Ten rats per sex per dose were sacrificed after 13 weeks of treatment. Five rats perIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 156sex were killed after a seven-week recovery period and the remaining five rats per sex were killed after 14 weeks' recovery. No liver lesions were observed in control animals.Two of 10 female rats in the 10-mg/kg group examined at 13 weeks had hepatocellularadenomas. Three other females in this group had hepatocellular foci or focal nodularhyperplasia. One female in this group that died during the 14-week recovery period hadmultiple adenomas and multi-focal nodular hyperplasia and cholangiocellular hyper-plasia (Chan et al., 1994). 4. Other Data Relevant to an Evaluation of Carcinogenicity and its Mechanisms 4.1 Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion 4.1.1 Humans No data were available to the Working Group. 4.1.2 Experimental systems Several feeding experiments have indicated that riddelliine and its N-oxide are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract of domestic farm animals. Calves treated for 20days with either riddelliine N-oxide (40.5 mg/kg/day) or a and riddelliine (4.5 mg/kg/day) showed implyingabsorption in each case (Molyneux et al. , 1991). Tissue samples from pigs fed various amounts (3, 10 or 15 mg/kg bw in gelatin capsules) of riddelliine for 40 days also showedabsorption, as determined by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometric(LC/MS) analysis of pyrrolic metabolites in blood and liver samples collected one dayafter the end of treatment (Schoch et al. , 2000). Pyrrolizidine alkaloids exist in plants in two forms, the free-base alkaloids and their N-oxides, neither of which is toxic per se . In numerous experimental studies, especially in rats, free riddelliine base has been found to be absorbed and transported to the liver,where it is converted to hepatotoxic pyrroles by microsomal enzymes &White, 1971; Molyneux et 1991). In liver microsomes of Fischer 344 rats pretreated with phenobarbital, the major metabolites of riddelliine obtained after aerobic incubationfor 30 min were riddelliine N-oxide and dehydroretronecine, as determined by HPLC and LC/MS (Figure 1). The latter metabolite interacts with DNA to form various adducts(Yang et al. , 2001a).SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 157Figure 1. Metabolism of riddelliine by rat liver microsomes From Yang et al. (2001a) 4.2 Toxic effects 4.2.1 Humans No data were available to the Working Group on the toxicity of riddelliine itself to humans. Riddelliine is one constituent of the plant Senecio longilobus , which has been used as a folk remedy called gordolobo yerba by Mexican-Americans in the south-westernUSA (Segall & The consumption of gordolobo yerba has been linkedwith the incidence of acute hepatic veno-occlusive disease (Stillman et al. , 1977a,b). Two infants were diagnosed as exhibiting hepatic veno-occlusive disease due to pyrrolizidinealkaloid intoxication, as a result of ingesting S. longilobus as a herbal tea used as a cough medicine. One of these infants subsequently died (Stillman et al. , 1977a). IARC MONOGRAPHS of pyrrolizidine alkaloids in Senecio , Crotalaria and other plant species in large animals, small herbivores and other laboratory animals. Cattle and horses are highly susceptible to pyrrolizidine poisoning, whereassheep, goats, rabbits and guinea-pigs are much more resistant. A few studies have beenpublished specifically on the toxic signs and symptoms of riddelliine. Thus, prefloweringSenecio riddellii whole plants (Riddell's groundsel), a species that contains mainly (> 90%) riddelliine and its N-oxide as alkaloidal constituents, caused seneciosis when given to calves for 20 days either by gavage or in gelatin capsules at an equivalent doseof 15-20 mg/kg bw pyrrolizidine alkaloid per day. The main clinical signs were malaise,depression, erratic or unpredictable behaviour, aimless walking and ataxia. Diarrhoeawith tecnesmus and rectal prolapse, and mesentery between loops of the ansaspiralis. Hepatobiliary lesions were present in all cattle necropsied. Portal hyper-plasia, formation of new bile ductules fibrosis also seen. In moresevere cases, vacuolated and enlarged hepatocytes were seen throughout the liver lobule.Central nervous system lesions were present in all cattle with seneciosis, such as spongydegeneration along the axonal tracts of the white matter. Other microscopic lesionsincluded mucosal haemorrhage, et al. , 1985). In a follow-up study, under the experimental conditions described by Johnson et al. (1985), a group of calves fed 4.5 mg/kg bw riddelliine free base per day showed no signof toxicosis or serum enzyme changes. However, two further groups fed pure riddelliineN-oxide (40.5 mg/kg/day) and a mixture of pure riddelliine (4.5 mg/kg/day) and pure riddelliine N-oxide (40.5 mg/kg/day) showed 100% morbidity, with the latter group showing fewer liver lesions. It was established from this study that the N-oxide of riddelliine alone is capable of inducing seneciosis in cattle (Molyneux et al. , 1991). The toxicity of riddelliine was studied in male and female Fischer rats and in B6C3F 1 mice. The compound was given by gavage in 0.1 M phosphate buffer five times per weekat daily doses of 0, 0.1, 0.33, 1, 3.3 and 10 mg/kg bw (rats) and of 0, 0.33, 1, 3.3, 10 and25 mg/kg bw (mice). The animals were necropsied after 13 weeks of treatment or afteran additional 7 or 14 weeks of recovery. Body weight gain was inversely related to dosein both rats and mice. The initial group sacrificed after 13 weeks showed dose-relatedhepatopathy and intravascular macrophage accumulation in rats (at doses 0.33 mg/kg bw) and hepatocytomegaly in mice (only at 25 mg/kg bw). Some of these lesionspersisted throughout the 14-week recovery period, with hepatic foci and cellular alte-rations observed in male rats, and increasingly severe bile duct proliferation in femalerats and in male and female mice (Chan et al. , 1994).SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 1594.3 Reproductive and developmental effects 4.3.1 Humans No data were available to the Working Group. 4.3.2 Experimental systems The developmental toxicity of pyrrolizidine alkaloids has been evaluated alkaloids, pyrrolizidine alkaloid derivativesand compounds have been shown to produce teratogenic and fetotoxic effects inexperimental animals (WHO, 1988). However, none of the studies reviewed was onriddelliine. According to Chan et al. (1994), pyrrolizidine alkaloids have been detected in milk of lactating rats and cows. In 13-week gavage studies combined with mating trials, groups of male and female Fischer 344 rats and B6C3F 1mice were administered riddelliine at doses of up to 10 and 25 mg/kg bw, respectively. Body weight gain was inversely related to dose in both ratsand mice. In rats, decreased epididymal and testis weights were observed in males given1.0 mg/kg bw, but spermatozoal measurements were not affected. At 10 mg/kg bw (adose lethal to the males), riddelliine caused persistent estrus in females. In mating trialswith 1.0 mg/kg bw as the highest dose, no effect was seen on fertility, weight gain ofdams during gestation, litter size or percentage of live pups. At 14 and 21 days of age,female pups had lower body weight than control pups. In mice, females in the 25-mg/kgbw group showed marked prolongation of length of the estrus cycle. Despite this, doseddams were able to conceive and continue with pregnancy. There was no effect onmaternal body weight gain during pregnancy at the 25-mg/kg bw dose, but live litter sizewas reduced and pups of treated dams had lower body weight at birth and during thelactation period than control pups. There was no effect on litter size or pup body weightat 3.3 mg/kg bw (National Toxicology Program, 1993; Chan et al., 1994). 4.4 Genetic and related effects 4.4.1 Humans No data were available to the Working Group. 4.4.2 Experimental systems (see Table 1 for references) Riddelliine was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 in the presence of a metabolic activation system, but not in strains TA1535, TA97 and TA98. It causedDNA-protein cross-links in bovine kidney CCL 22 cells in vitro . Sister chromatid exchange and chromosomal aberrations were induced in Chinese hamster ovary cellsin vitro.

Riddelliine did form DNAadducts in rat liver following oral exposure. A major metabolite of riddelliine, dehydroretronecine, was mutagenic in S. typhimu- rium TA92 and induced sister chromatid exchange in human lymphocytes in the absence of exogenous activation. DNA-DNA M13 viral DNA and DNA-protein cross-linksin bovine kidney CCL 22 cells in vitro . Exposure of calf thymus DNA or deoxyguanosine to dehydroretronecine in vitro caused DNA-adduct formation and alkylation of the exo- cyclic amino group, respectively. Eight different dehydroretronecine-derived DNA adducts were detected in all liver samples from female Fischer 344 rats fed riddelliine at five different doses (0.01, 0.033,0.1, 0.33, 1.0 mg/kg bw per day). Two of these were characterized as dehydroretro-necine-3 N-deoxyguanosin- N 2-yl epimers (Figure 2) by a 32P-postlabelling/HPLC tech- nique, supported by spectroscopic and synthetic procedures (Yang et al. , 2001b). The other six adducts detected were not identified (Yang et al. , 2001a). 4.5 Mechanistic considerations Orally administered riddelliine forms dehydroretronecine-DNA adducts and induces unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat liver, indicating that liver is a target for its genotoxicactivity. Dehydroretronecine forms DNA adducts and cross-links in vitro without further metabolic activation. This metabolite is also mutagenic to S. typhimurium . This activity, as well as the hepatotoxicity with consequent hyperplasia, could be significant events inriddelliine-induced hepatocarcinogenicity. It is not known, however, whether the basicmetabolic step occurs in humans. 5. Summary of Data Reported and Evaluation 5.1 Exposure data Riddelliine is a pyrrolizidine alkaloid that is found in Senecio riddellii and other Senecio species, including S. longilobus , which is used as a herbal remedy in the south- western USA. 5.2 Human carcinogenicity data No data on the carcinogenicity of riddelliine to humans were available to the Working Group.SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 163IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 164 CH2OH CO HH2C to dehydroretro- necine DNA adducts in female Fischer 344 rats fed riddelliine From Yang et al. (2001a)5.3 Animal carcinogenicity data In mice, oral administration of riddelliine induced hepatic haemangiosarcomas in males and bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas and carcinomas in females. In rats, oral admi-nistration riddelliine increased the incidence of and both males andfemales. In a short-term study, a few rats developed hepatocellular adenomas after 13weeks of oral administration. 5.4 Other relevant data Riddelliine and its N-oxide are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Riddelliine is metabolized to riddelliine N-oxide and dehydroretronecine in rat liver microsomes. A herbal preparation made from Senecia longilobus , riddelliine is a consti- tuent, hepatic veno-occlusive disease in humans. Intoxication of calves witheither S. riddellii or one of its two main pyrrolizidine alkaloid constituents, riddelliine N- oxide, led to the typical signs and symptoms of seneciosis. A similar toxicity profile wasinduced by riddelliine in rodents. Riddelliine disturbs the estrus cycle in rodents. It causes developmental toxicity in the absence of marked toxicity in rodents. DNA adducts of dehydroretronecine are found in rat liver following oral adminis- tration of riddelliine. Dehydroretronecine is chromatid exchange in human lymphocytes, DNA-protein cross-linksin bovine kidney epithelial cells in vitro and gene mutations in bacteria. 5.5 Evaluation There are no data on the carcinogenicity of riddelliine to humans. There is sufficient evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of riddelliine. Overall evaluation Riddelliine is possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) . 6.

The methods have greatly improved in recent yearswith the commercial availability of multifunctional columns and immunoaffinityAFLATOXINS 173columns, which are simple and rapid to use, and with reduction in the use of toxic solvents for extraction and clean-up. Quality assurance for the analysis of aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, G2 and M1 in foods is available for laboratories through the American Association of Cereal Chemists' CheckSample Program and the Analytical Proficiency Testing Programme administered in theUSA and the United Kingdom, respectively. As contamination may not occur in a homogeneous way throughout a sample of maize or peanuts 1, good sampling and sample preparation procedures must be used to obtain accurate quantitative results. Summaries of the procedures, variability and appli-cation of sampling plans for mycotoxins are included in Section 1.5 and in the EuropeanCommission directive 98/53/CE (European Commission, 1998a). A number of approaches have been used to analyse aflatoxins and their metabolites in human tissues and body fluids. These include immunoaffinity purification, immuno-assay (Wild et al. , 1987), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) Molecular biomarkers, such as urinary markers, metabolites in milkand parent compounds in blood, are used for determining exposure to aflatoxins(Groopman, 1993).IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 174 Table 1.

These are well defined species: A. flavus produces only B aflatoxins and sometimes the mycotoxin cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), while A. parasi- ticus produces both B and G aflatoxins, but never CPA (Schroeder & Boller, 1973; Dorner et al. , 1984; Klich & Pitt, 1988; Pitt, 1993) (see Annex). This simple situation, of just two aflatoxigenic species, has been complicated by more recent taxonomic findings. Kurtzman et al. (1987) described A. nomius , a species closely related to A. flavus but which produces small bullet-shaped sclerotia, as distinct from the large spherical sclerotia produced by many A. flavus isolates. This species is also distinguished from A. flavus by the production of both B and G aflatoxins (Saito et al. , 1989; Pitt, 1993). A second new species, closely related to A. nomius , was described by Peterson et al. (2001) and named A. bombycis . These two species were distinguished from each other by differences in DNA, and also by differences in growthrates at 37 \u00b0C. Like A. nomius , A. bombycis produces both B and G aflatoxins. The species A. ochraceoroseus described by Bartoli and Maggi (1978) was recently shown to be another aflatoxin producer. It also produces sterigmatocystin (Frisvad, 1997;Klich et al. , 2000). flavus var. parvisclerotigenus , spherical sclerotia, but one isolate (NRRL 3251) (AgriculturalResearch Service Culture Collection) reported to be representative of the new varietywas considered by both Christensen (1981) and Pitt (1993) to be a typical A. flavus . This same isolate was reported by Stubblefield et al. (1970) to produce B but not G aflatoxins, in line with those assessments. Moreover, Geiser et al. (2000) showed that the production of small versus large sclerotia does not have taxonomic significance within A. flavus . Two aflatoxin-producing isolates from Japan, originally classified as aberrant A. ta- marii (Goto et al. , 1996), were recently described as A. pseudotamarii . Like A. flavus , this species produces B aflatoxins and CPA, but differs from A. flavus by the production of orange-brown conidia (Ito et al. , 2001). In studying population genetics of A. flavus , Geiser et al. (1998) showed that A. flavus from an Australian peanut field comprised two distinct subgroups, which they termed Group I and Group II, and suggested that Group II differed from Group I(A. flavus sensu stricto ) sufficiently to be raised to species level. Further studies by Geiser et al. (2000) and independent observations have confirmed that A. flavus Group II comprises a distinct species, which will be described as ' Aspergillus australis '. Unlike any other known species, A. australis produces both B and G aflatoxins and also CPA. It appears to occur almost exclusively in the southern hemisphere, where it has beenfound in Argentina, Australia, Indonesia and South Africa. The current status of taxonomic information and mycotoxin production by species that produce aflatoxins is summarized in Table 3. This information, complex though it is,should not be allowed to obscure the importance of the older species. The evidenceAFLATOXINS 177indicates that A. flavus and A. parasiticus are responsible for the overwhelming pro- portion of aflatoxins found in foodstuffs throughout the world. Of the other species, onlyA. australis , which appears to be widespread in the southern hemisphere and is common in Australian peanut soils, may also be an important source of aflatoxins in a fewcountries. 1.2.2 Production and reduction Apart from natural formation, aflatoxins are produced only in small quantities for research purposes, by A. flavus or A. parasiticus fermentations on solid substrates or media in the laboratory. Aflatoxins are extracted by solvents and purified by chromato-graphy. Total annual production is less than 100 g (IARC, 1993). Aflatoxins occurring naturally in foods and feeds may be reduced by a variety of pro- cedures. Improved farm management practices, more rapid drying and controlled storageare now defined within GAP (Good Agricultural Practice) or HACCP (Hazard Analysis:Critical Control Point) (FAO, 1995). By segregation of contaminated lots after aflatoxinanalyses and by sorting out contaminated nuts or grains by electronic sorters, conta-minated lots of peanuts or maize can be cleaned up to produce food-grade products.Decontamination by ammoniation or other chemical procedures can be used forrendering highly contaminated commodities suitable as animal feeds. More detailedinformation on these topics is given in the Annex to this Monograph. 1.2.3 Uses Aflatoxins are not used commercially, only for research.IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 178 Table 3.

A. flavus is especially abundant in the tropics. Levels of A. flavus in warm temperate climates such as in the USA and Australia are generally much lower, while the occurrence of A. flavus is uncommon in cool temperate climates except in foods and feeds imported from tropicalcountries (see Section 1.3.3). The major hosts of A. flavus among food and feed commodities are peanuts, maize and cottonseed. In addition, various spices sometimes contain aflatoxins, while tree nutsare contaminated less frequently. Low levels may be found in a wide range of other foods(Pitt et al. , 1993, 1994; Pitt & Hocking, 1997) It seems probable that although A. parasiticus has the same geographical range as A. flavus , it is less widely distributed. In particular, it has been found only rarely in south- east Asia. The food-related hosts of A. parasiticus are similar to those of A. flavus , except that A. parasiticus is very uncommon in maize (Pitt et al., 1993, 1994). 1.3.2 Factors affecting formation of aflatoxins in foods A fundamental distinction must be made between aflatoxin formation in crops before (or immediately after) harvest, and that occurring in stored commodities or foods.Peanuts, maize and cottonseed are associated with A. flavus , and in the case of peanuts, also with A. parasiticus , so that invasion of plants and developing seed or nut may occur before harvest. This close association results in the potential for high levels of aflatoxinsin these commodities and is the reason for the continuing difficulty in eliminating afla-toxins from these products. In contrast, A. flavus lacks this affinity for other crops, so it is not normally present at harvest. Prevention of the formation of aflatoxins therefore relies mainly on avoidanceof contamination after harvest, using rapid drying and good storage practice (see Annex). 1.3.3 Occurrence Aflatoxins have been found in a variety of agricultural commodities, but the most pronounced contamination has been encountered in maize, peanuts, cottonseed and treenuts. Aflatoxins were first identified in 1961 in animal feed responsible for the deaths of100 000 turkeys in the United Kingdom (Sargeant et al., 1961). An extensive review of the levels of aflatoxins encountered in commodities in North America, South America,Europe, Asia and Africa was included in the previous IARC monograph (IARC, 1993). A summary of data published since the previous monograph on the worldwide occurrence of aflatoxins is given in Table 4.

Aflatoxins are a far greater problem in the tropics than in temperate zones of the world.However, because of the movement of agricultural commodities around the globe, noregion of the world is free of aflatoxins. With regard to aflatoxin contamination in foods imported into Japan, relatively low incidences and low levels of aflatoxins have been found in various commodities.Aflatoxin inspection of imported peanuts (1999-2000) indicated that 355 (6.9%) of 5108samples were contaminated with aflatoxin B 1at levels ranging from 0.2 to 760 g/kg, and 145 samples (2.8%) contained over 10 g/kg, the maximum permitted level in Japan (Okano et al. , 2002). In commercial nuts and nut products in markets, aflatoxin B1was found in 23 (3.4%) of 673 samples at levels of 0.3-128 g/kg. Imported spices (white and red pepper, paprika and nutmeg) contained aflatoxin B1in 106 (19.4%) of 546 samples at levels of 0.2-27.7 g/kg (Tabata et al. , 1998). Information on the occurrence of aflatoxins in imported spices in the European Union (EU) is given in Table 5. Among the total of 3098 spice samples including nutmeg,pepper, chilli and paprika, 183 samples (5.9%) contained more than 10 g/kg aflatoxins (European Commission, 1997). In the United Kingdom, seven of 139 maize samples (5.0%) imported in 1998-99 contained total aflatoxins in the range of 4.9-29.1 g/kg (3.7-16.4 g/kg aflatoxin B 1) (MAFF, 1999). The French Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Concurrence, de la Consommation et de la R\u00e9- pression des Fraudes (DGCCRF) surveyed 635 imported foods between 1992 and 1996,of which 227 (35.7%) had aflatoxin B 1levels above 0.05 g/kg. The highest levels were found in spices (up to 75 g/kg) and dried fruits (up to 77 g/kg) (Castegnaro & Pfohl- Leszkowicz, 1999).IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 182 Table 5. Aflatoxin B 1 in spices imported into the European Union Aflatoxin B 1 (g/kg) Product Detected/ total samples > 2 g/kg > 10 g/kg From European Commission (1997)Dietary intake of aflatoxin B1was monitored for one week in a number of house- holds in a Chinese village. Aflatoxin B1was detected in 76.7% (23/30) of ground maize samples (range, 0.4-128.1 g/kg), 66.7% (20/30) of cooking peanut oil samples (range, and 23.3% (7/30) of rice samples (range, , 2001). Co-occurrence of aflatoxin B1and fumonisin B1in maize and sorghum from Latin America and Asia is shown in Table 6. Maize harvested in the tropical and subtropicalareas of the world with hot and humid climates is the major commodity contaminatedwith the two mycotoxins. Two studies were carried out on cross-contamination with aflatoxins and fumonisins in staple maize samples from two high-risk areas for human hepatocellular carcinoma inChina; Haimen, Jiangsu Province, Shandong (Ueno et al. , 1997) and Chongzuo County, Guangxi in 1998 (Li et al. , 2001). Three-year (1993-95) surveys demonstrated that maize harvested in Haimen was highly contaminated with aflatoxins and fumonisins andthat the levels of fumonisins were 10-50-fold higher than in a low-risk area (Ueno et al. , 1997). Staple maize samples from Guangxi were co-contaminated (14/20) with highlevels of aflatoxin B 1(11-2496 g/kg) and fumonision B1(74-780 g/kg), and the probable daily intake was estimated to be 3.68 g/kg bw of aflatoxin B1 and 3.02 g/kg bw fumonisin B1(Li et al. , 2001). In India, rain-affected maize samples from rural households and retail shops had higher levels of contamination with fumonisins (250-6470 g/kg) than normal samples (50-240 g/kg) as well as with aflatoxin B1(250-25 600 versus 5-87 g/kg), which co- occurred with fumonisins. The level of fumonisin B1was also higher in sorghum affected by rain (140-7800 g/kg versus 70-360 g/kg). No correlation was observed between levels of the two toxins in individual samples, indicating that the toxins are formed inde-pendently (Vasanthi & Bhat, 1998). (b)Occurrence of aflatoxin M1 Aflatoxin M1is a metabolite of aflatoxin B1that can occur in milk and milk products from animals consuming feed contaminated with B aflatoxins (Applebaum et al. , 1982). Data on occurrence of aflatoxin M1in milk were summarized earlier (IARC, 1993) and data reported subsequently are included in Table 7. Galvano et al. (1996) reviewed the worldwide occurrence of aflatoxin M1in milk and milk products. 1.3.4 Human biological fluids Covalent binding of aflatoxin to albumin in peripheral blood has been measured in a number of studies (Montesano et al. , 1997). The levels of these adducts are assumed to reflect exposure to aflatoxin over the previous 2-3 months, based on the half-life ofAFLATOXINS 183IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 184 Table 6.

Experimental data have also shown that this biomarker reflects the formation of the reactive metabolite of aflatoxin B1and the level of DNA damage occurring in the livers of rats treated with aflatoxin B1. Figure 2 shows data from a number of popu- lations, with adduct levels expressed as aflatoxin B1-lysine equivalents per milligram of serum albumin. Other measurements of aflatoxin-DNA and aflatoxin-protein adducts in humans are discussed in Sections 4.4 and 4.5. Maxwell (1998) has discussed the presence of aflatoxins in human body fluids and tissues in relation to child health in the tropics. In Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and SierraAFLATOXINS 185 Table 7.

(2000); 25% of cord blood samples contained aflatoxins, primarily M1and M2, as well as others in variable amounts (range: 1 ng aflatoxin M1/L to 64 973 ng aflatoxin B1/L). Of 35 cord serum samples from Thailand, 48% contained aflatoxins at concentrations of 0.064-13.6 nmol/mL (mean, 3.1 nmol/mL). By comparison, only two of 35 maternalsera obtained immediately after birth contained aflatoxin (mean, 0.62 nmol/mL). Theseresults show that transplacental transfer and concentration of aflatoxin by the feto-placental unit occur (Denning et al., 1990). Analyses of breast milk in Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Sudan showed primarily aflatoxin M 1, aflatoxin M2and aflatoxicol. Aflatoxin exposure pre- or post-natally at levels 100 ng/L was very often associated with illness in the child (Maxwell, 1998). Exposure of infants to aflatoxin M1from mothers' breast milk in the United Arab Emirates has been measured by Saad et al. (1995). Among 445 donors of breast milk, 99.5% of samples contained aflatoxin M1at concentrations ranging from 2-3 g/L. The mothers were of a wide range of nationalities, ages and health status; no correlation wasobserved between these factors and aflatoxin M 1content of the milk. El-Nazami et al. (1995) measured levels of aflatoxin M1in breast milk in 73 women from Victoria, Australia and 11 women from Thailand. Aflatoxin M1was detected in 11 samples from Victoria (median concentration, 0.071 g/L) and five samples fromIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 186 Figure 2.

(1997) Data are expressed as pg aflatoxin B1-lysine equivalents/mg serum albumin and represent the mean levels in samples with levels above the detection limit of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay used (5 pg/mg).Shandong (China), Europe (France and Poland) and Egypt are represented at the detection limit, but nosamples were above this level of adduct (0% prevalence). The number of sera analysed varies per country.Original data are from Wild et al. (1993a) and Yu (1995).Thailand (median concentration, 0.664 g/L). Levels were significantly higher in the Thai samples. 1.3.5 Occupational exposure to aflatoxins Kussak et al. (1995) demonstrated the presence of aflatoxins in airborne dust from feed factories. During unloading of ships, aflatoxin B1has been found in bilge at levels as high as 300 ng/m3(Lafontaine et al. , 1994). Autrup et al. (1993) assessed the exposure to aflatoxin B1of workers in animal feed processing plants in Denmark. The workers served as their own controls; blood sampleswere taken after their return from vacation and after four weeks of work. Binding ofaflatoxin B 1to serum albumin was measured. Seven of 45 samples were positive for aflatoxin B1with an average daily intake of 64 ng/kg bw aflatoxin B1. The exposed workers had been unloading cargoes contaminated with aflatoxin B1or working at places where the dust contained detectable amounts of aflatoxin B1. This level of exposure could partly explain the increased risk for liver cancer in workers in the animal feed pro-cessing industry. Ghosh et al. (1997) assayed airborne aflatoxin in rice- and maize-processing plants in India using an indirect, competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Levels ofairborne aflatoxin were always higher in the respirable dust samples (< 7 m) than in total dust samples. Concentrations of total airborne aflatoxin in the respirable dusts in therice mill were 26 pg/m 3and 19 pg/m3in the workplace and the storage area, respectively. Airborne aflatoxin was not detected in control sites of either of the grain-processingplants or in total dust samples obtained from the maize plant. At three sites in the maize-processing plant \u2014 the elevator (18 pg/m 3), the loading/unloading area (800 pg/m3) and the oil mill (816 pg/m3) \u2014 airborne aflatoxin was present only in the respirable dust samples. In a study of factories in Thailand (Nuntharatanapong et al., 2001), samples of air- borne dust generated during handling of animal feed were analysed in order to assessworker exposure to aflatoxins. The average aflatoxin level in the control air samples was0.99 ng/m 3. Higher levels of aflatoxins were found in the air samples taken by samplers carried by five workers adding hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate to animal feed(1.55 ng/m 3) and five workers adding glucomannan, a viscous polysaccharide, to animal feed (6.25 ng/m3). The exposed workers had altered lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme activity and tumour necrosis factor levels in plasma. These changes may be associatedwith inhalation of mycotoxins and other contaminants in foodstuffs.AFLATOXINS 1871.4 International exposure estimates 1.4.1 JECF A (1998) In 1997, the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO) Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) performed an exposure esti-mate for aflatoxins (JECFA, 1998). This report summarized the results of monitoring andavailable national estimates of intake of aflatoxins in order to provide a framework forestimating increments in intake of aflatoxins. Estimates were based on the results ofavailable monitoring data. Total intake of aflatoxins based on the GEMS (Global Envi-ronment Monitoring System)/Food Regional Diets (WHO, 1998) was used to evaluatethe impact of four different scenarios: no regulatory limit and limits set at 20, 15 and10g/kg aflatoxins. The evaluation was carried out for total aflatoxins and aflatoxin B 1 in maize and peanuts. The data submitted were not considered to be representative because sampling largely focused on those lots that were most likely to contain thehighest levels of aflatoxin. However, JECFA considered the analysis to provide usefulqualitative comparisons between regulatory options. JECFA received data for this analysis from at least one country on every continent. The submitters generally considered the data to be biased towards the upper end ofintake. In some cases, JECFA required individual data points in order to generate distri-butions and to evaluate the impact of imposing upper limits on aflatoxin in foodstuffs.Hence, data reported by the USA, China and Europe were used because the raw datawere available. The reader is referred to the original report for a more complete dis-cussion of the data. JECFA used three pieces of information to estimate the potential intakes due to afla- toxin in imported crops: ( a) levels of aflatoxin in imported crops; ( b) the amounts of each imported crop consumed; and ( c) the effect of any subsequent processing on aflatoxin levels. It then applied methods for combining these three factors to estimate intake. (a)Aflatoxin levels in foods: general The 1995 compendium, Worldwide Regulations for Mycotoxins (FAO, 1997) sum- marized reports from 90 countries. The data submitted by 33 countries for aflatoxin B1 and 48 countries for total aflatoxins (B1, B2, G1and G2) were used to estimate median levels of 4 and 8 g/kg, respectively, in foodstuffs. The range of levels reported for afla- toxin B1was from 0 to 30 g/kg and for total aflatoxins from 0 to 50 g/kg. Seventeen countries provided information on aflatoxin M1in milk, with a median of 0.05 g/kg and a range of 0-1 g/kg. Participants in the European Union Scientific Cooperation (EU SCOOP) assessment of aflatoxin (SCOOP, 1996) reviewed data submitted by member countries and byNorway. JECFA concluded that the results were unlikely to be representative and shouldnot be used to estimate total aflatoxin intake for individual countries or for Europe.However, some insights were gained. SCOOP concluded that aflatoxins were found in aIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 188broader range of foods than had been previously assumed, but that most samples did not contain any detectable aflatoxin. Sampling methods were very important in estimatingaflatoxin levels accurately. In addition, different methods of collecting food consumptiondata may have made a difference in estimating aflatoxin intakes. (b)National estimates of aflatoxin intake (from JECF A, 1998) (i) Australia From Australian market basket surveys, intake was estimated for average and extreme consumers. The average diet was estimated to give an intake of 0.15 ng aflatoxinper kg body weight per day and the upper 95th percentile diet approximately twice thatlevel. Children's diets were estimated to give an intake up to approximately 0.45 ng/kgbw per day for the 95th percentile two-year-old (National Food Authority, 1992, reportedby JECFA, 1998). (ii) China A series of intake and market basket studies have been conducted in China since 1980 to estimate the aflatoxin B1 intakes, which were reported to range from 0 to 91g/kg bw per day (Chen, 1997). (iii) European Union Nine countries provided estimates of aflatoxin intake to the EU SCOOP project. None of these estimates was considered to be representative and all were viewed only asindicators of intake of aflatoxin. These estimates ranged from 2 to 77 ng per person perday for aflatoxin B 1and from 0.4 to 6 ng per person per day for aflatoxin M1. JECFA noted that these levels should not be used as estimates of intake either for a particularcountry or for Europe (JECFA, 1998). (iv) USA The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) estimated intakes using data from the National Compliance Program for maize, peanut and milk products using Monte Carlosimulation procedures and data from the 1980s. Results differed only slightly from thoseof a repeat analysis in 1992 (Henry et al. , 1997). The lifetime intake of total aflatoxin was 18 ng per person per day for consumers only; intake for the 90th percentile indivi-duals was 40 ng per person per day. For aflatoxin M 1, mean intake was 44 ng per person per day and for the 90th percentile individual 87 ng per person per day. Many assump-tions were made in these estimates which would tend to bias the results upward. (v) Zimbabwe The theoretical maximum intake of aflatoxin M1for a child's diet containing 150 g maize with 5 g/kg aflatoxin B1and 30 g peanuts with 10 g/kg aflatoxin B1was esti- mated to be 1.05 g per day (JECFA, 1998). AFLATOXINS 189(c)Impact of establishing maximum limits on estimate of intake Data from the EU, China and the USA were used to assess the potential impact of successfully eliminating aflatoxin levels above 20 g/kg versus 15 g/kg versus 10g/kg versus no limit for maize and peanuts (JECFA, 1998). The reader is referred to the full report for the tables, which more fully describe these four scenarios. JECFAemphasized that the aflatoxin levels presented in this report were not considered to berepresentative of the food supply in any country or of the commodities moving in inter-national trade. The lack of representative data severely limited the ability to make quanti-tative estimates of aflatoxin intake; in general, the results were considered to be biasedupwards. The data did provide, as JECFA stated, sufficient information to evaluate thelikely impact of limiting aflatoxin levels in foodstuffs. Of the scenarios considered, thegreatest relative impact on estimated average aflatoxin levels was achieved by limitingaflatoxin contamination to less than 20 g/kg, i.e., eliminating all samples above 20g/kg from the food supply. Only small incremental reductions could be achieved by limiting aflatoxin levels to no more than 15 or 10 g/kg. 1.4.2 JECF A 2001 In February 2001, at the request of the Codex Committee on Food Additives and Contaminants (Codex Alimentarius, 2000), JECFA (2001) evaluated the human healthrisks associated with consumption of milk contaminated with aflatoxin M 1at two maxi- mum regulatory levels of 0.05 g/kg and 0.5 g/kg. This project involved estimating exposure to aflatoxin M1in consumers from countries all over the world consuming milk and milk products. Data on aflatoxin M1contamination of milk and/or milk products were submitted from Argentina, Canada, the Dubai Municipality of the United Arab Emirates, the EU,Indonesia, Korea (Republic of), Norway, the Philippines, Thailand and the USA. Themajority of samples were submitted from the USA and the European Commission; veryfew were from south-east Asia and none from Africa. Of 6181 samples submitted fromthe USA and collected in south-western and southern states between 1998 and 2000,1392 had aflatoxin M 1levels between 0.05 and 0.5 g/kg, and 113 had levels > 0.5 g/kg. However, no samples were available from the north-eastern USA, where aflatoxin rarely occurs; most samples came from south-eastern parts where aflatoxincontamination often occurs in maize and peanuts consumed by dairy cows. The data submitted by the European Commission represented 7573 samples from Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Swedenand the United Kingdom collected in 1999; 96% of the samples had aflatoxin M 1levels below the limit of detection (which varied between countries: 0.001-0.03 g/kg). The concentration in samples where aflatoxin M1was were 0.05 g/kg (JECFA, 2001).IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 190(a)Estimates of aflatoxin M1intake GEMS (Global Environment Monitoring System)/Food Regional Diets The GEMS/Food Regional Diets (WHO, 1998) are tables of dietary intakes of food commodities for five geographical areas. The major food class responsible for aflatoxinM 1intake was identified as milk. The term 'milk' was assumed to include the mammalian milks (buffalo, camel, cattle, goat and sheep) listed in the GEMS/Food Regional Diets,but not to include cheese, butter or other dairy products derived from milk. In Table 8,exposure to aflatoxin M 1from milk was calculated using three concentrations for the five geographical areas. [The use of dietary data to estimate mycotoxin intake can be mis-leading. Local climatic and other factors can greatly influence levels of mycotoxins infoods.] The first concentration was 0.05 g/kg (the proposed maximum limit), the second was 0.5 g/kg (the current maximum limit) and the third was the weighted mean of values for the geographical area. The use of 0.5 g/kg as the level of aflatoxin M 1in milk pro- bably encompasses most of the milk samples and overestimates exposure. JECFA (2001)AFLATOXINS 191 Table 8.

Because there were many non-detectable levels of aflatoxin M1in milk from the various studies and reports, the use of weighted means of all values could underestimate exposure for thoseindividuals who are routinely exposed to higher levels of aflatoxin M 1from milk. (b)Limitations of exposure estimates (i) The data submitted to FAO/WHO may not have been representative of countries or geographical areas, and not all member countries submitted data. (ii) There were difficulties in attempting to compare and aggregate data on afla- toxin M1levels from different laboratories because the laboratories used diffe- rent analytical methods. Also the data were presented in different ways (distri-butions, means of positive values, values less than a maximum limit). (iii) The use of different analytical methods (thin-layer chromatography (TLC), HPLC) probably affected reported concentrations of aflatoxin M 1in milk and therefore may affect intake estimates. Some methods, such as TLC, are moresensitive than others. (iv) It was not possible to ascertain the effects of processing, season, climate or other environmental variables on the aflatoxin M 1content of milk. These effects were often not addressed by the various studies and reports, and diffe-rent descriptors were used for milk and other dairy products (e.g., 'raw' versus'pasteurized') (JECFA, 2001). 1.4.3 Exposure to aflatoxin M1in the French population Verger et al. (1999) have estimated exposures to aflatoxin M1in the French popu- lation (Table 9).IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 192 Table 9.

The rationale forthe establishment of specific regulations varies widely; however, most regulations arebased on some form of risk analysis including the availability of toxicological data,information on susceptible commodities, sampling and analytical capabilities, and theeffect on the availability of an adequate food supply (Stoloff et al. , 1991). In 1995, among countries with more than five million inhabitants, 77 had known regulations formycotoxins (all of which included aflatoxins) and 13 reported the absence of regulations.Data were not available for 40 countries (FAO, 1997). The regulation ranges for afla-toxin B 1 and total aflatoxins (B1, B2, G1, G2) were 'none detectable' to 30 or 50 g/kg, respectively. Seventeen countries had regulations for aflatoxin M1in milk. The regu- latory range for aflatoxin M1in milk was 'none detectable' to 1.0 g/kg. New minimum EU regulations to which all EU countries must adhere were provided in 1998 (EuropeanCommission, 1998b). These regulations apply to all aflatoxins (B 1, B2, G1, G2) in raw commodities and processed foods and to aflatoxin M1in milk. Regulations for other commodities include infant foods (European Commission, 2001) and selected spices(European Commission, 2002). The Codex Alimentarius Commission (1999) is considering a recommendation to establish a limit for aflatoxins in foods of 15 g/kg of total aflatoxins for all foods worldwide. 2. Studies of Cancer in Humans Beginning in the 1960s and throughout the 1980s, a large number of ecological correlation studies were carried out to look for a possible correlation between dietaryintake of aflatoxins and risk of primary liver cancer (IARC, 1993). Most of these studieswere carried out in developing countries of sub-Saharan Africa or Asia, where livercancer is common. With some notable exceptions, and despite the methodological limi-tations of these studies, they tended to show that areas with the highest presumed afla-toxin intake also had the highest liver cancer rates. However, the limitations of thesestudies, including questionable diagnosis and registration of liver cancer in the areasstudied, questionable assessment of aflatoxin intake at the individual level, non-existentor questionable control for the effect of hepatitis virus and the usual problem of makinginferences for individuals from observations on units at the ecological level, led toincreasing recognition of the need for studies based on individuals as units ofobservation. In the 1980s, some case-control studies were carried out in high-risk areas, generally based on reasonably reliable diagnostic criteria for liver cancer (IARC, 1993). Thecomparability of cases and controls was limited in some of these studies. Exposure toAFLATOXINS 193aflatoxins was sometimes assessed via dietary questionnaires and sometimes via bio- marker measurements. As both of these were collected after disease onset, their relevanceto past lifetime intake of aflatoxins was uncertain. Beginning in the mid 1980s, someprospective cohort studies were undertaken which avoided many of the methodologicallimitations of earlier studies. Among the major advantages of this new generation ofstudies were the following: new improved biomarkers of aflatoxin exposure, improvedability to measure hepatitis infection, better comparability of cases and controls within awell defined cohort, and control of the temporal sequence by measuring exposure beforedisease onset. In 1992, an IARC Working Group described all relevant human studies that had been reported and concluded that there was sufficient evidence in humans for carcinogenicity of aflatoxin B 1and of naturally-occurring mixtures of aflatoxins. The present monograph represents an update of evidence published since that evaluation was made, withoutdescribing the studies covered in the previous monograph, although brief summaries ofthe main studies are given in tabular format (Tables 10-12). These tables also providesummaries of the relevant studies that have been published since 1993 and which aredescribed in the following sections. The outcome investigated in most studies was livercancer. Different studies used different sources (e.g., death certificates, hospitalregistries, medical examinations) and different criteria (clinical, cytological) for defi-nition of liver cancer. Different terms, such as liver cancer, primary liver cancer orhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were used. In the following descriptions, we have usedthe terminology used by the authors. 2.1 Descriptive studies (see Table 10) Hatch et al. (1993) conducted a hybrid ecological cross-sectional study in eight areas of Taiwan (China), with a wide range of rates of mortality from primary hepatocellularcarcinoma (HCC). In order to derive estimates of aflatoxin levels in the eight areas, theyselected a representative sample of 250 adult residents in total (unequal numbers perarea). Participants were interviewed and were asked to provide both morning urine andblood specimens. Serum was used for detecting hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).Urine was used for detecting aflatoxins B 1and G1and metabolites, including aflatoxins M1and P1; the highest sensitivity was for aflatoxin B1. Measured values ranged from 0.7 to 511.7 pg equivalents of aflatoxin B1/mL of urine, with a mean of 41.3 pg/mL. Mean levels were similar in men and women, and in hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers and HBVnon-carriers. The primary analyses were carried out with individuals as the unit ofanalysis. In these analyses, the individual's measurements of aflatoxin B 1equivalents and of HBsAg were used in conjunction with the HCC rate (sex-specific, age-adjusted) of theentire area in which the individual resided. There were 246 data points for these analyses(four individuals had missing blood specimens). Some bivariate correlation coefficientsand some regression analyses in which aflatoxin levels were regressed on area HCCmortality, HBsAg, age and sex were calculated. In addition, in some analyses the dataIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 194AFLATOXINS 195Table 10.

Type of storage assessedFragmentary data indicate that risk of liver cancer is higher inone area than the other.- Aflatoxin consumption levels were higher in the presumed high-risk areathan in the presumed low- risk area.Only two areas compared. Unreliable measures of liver cancer incidence AFB 1, aflatoxin B 1; anti-HBc, antibody to hepatitis B core antigen; HBsAg, PLC, primary liver cancerwere collapsed into a conventional ecological study with eight units of observation and the mean levels of aflatoxin and HBsAg correlated with HCC rates. The univariate corre-lations between at the ecological level ( p= 0.01) in men and 0.49 ( p= 0.22) in women. The correlations were much lower, albeit statistically significant, when analysed at the individual level: 0.29 ( p= 0.002) in and 0.17 in women. In the multivariate regression analysis, HCC was significantly associated with aflatoxin levels, after adjusting for age, sex and HBsAg. Adjustments forsmoking and alcohol, in a subset of 190 subjects with available interview data, and theinclusion of interaction terms did not materially affect the findings. Thus, the very diffe-rent types of analysis all pointed to an association between urinary aflatoxins and HCC.[The Working Group noted that the calculation of the pvalue did not take into account the clustered sampling design.] Omer et al. (1998) carried out a comparison of aflatoxin contamination of peanut products in two areas of Sudan. On the basis of 'clinical experience and Khartoumhospital records', the authors suspected that incidence of HCC was substantially higherin western Sudan than in central Sudan. The study was carried out in 1995 and involvedselection of peanut butter samples from local markets using a staged sampling approachto identify markets in the two study areas. Samples were characterized as to how theyhad been stored and were analysed for aflatoxin B 1by HPLC. Mean aflatoxin B1levels were much higher in 'high-risk' western Sudan (87.4 \u00b1197.3 g/kg) than in central Sudan (8.5 \u00b16.8 g/kg). Also, dietary questionnaires among subjects recruited for a small case-control study indicated that residents in western Sudan consumed morepeanut butter than residents in central Sudan. [The Working Group noted that only twoareas were compared, and that there was no documented evidence of differences in theincidence rates of HCC between the two areas. A small case-control study was carriedout as well, but the Working Group noted that this was probably a small feasibility studythat was superseded by Omer et al. (2001).] 2.2 Cohort studies (see Table 11) Qian et al. (1994) updated a cohort study previously described by Ross et al. (1992) of 18 244 male residents of Shanghai, China, 96% of whom were aged 45-64 years onentry to the study. The men were recruited by invitation from four geographically definedareas and responded to questionnaires administered by nurses, usually in their homes, onlifestyle (including smoking and alcohol consumption) and on food frequency. Blood andurine specimens were collected. The men were followed up by identification of deathrecords in district vital statistics units and through linkage with the Shanghai CancerRegistry (estimated to be 85% complete). An attempt was also made to contact eachcohort member annually. The cohort was established between January 1986 andSeptember 1989 and was followed to 1 February 1992 for the current analysis, resultingin 69 393 person-years of follow-up. Of 364 cancer cases identified, 55 were diagnosedas primary liver cancers, nine of which were confirmed by biopsy. The reported dietIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 198AFLATOXINS 199Table 11.

To assess the risks in relation to biomarkers of aflatoxin exposure, a nested case- control study was conducted using 50 of the cases (Qian et al. , 1994). Controls were selected from among subjects who had no history of liver cancer on the date of cancerdiagnosis of the index cases and were matched to cases in ratios ranging from 10:1 to 3:1,yielding a total of 267 controls. For each case and control, urine samples were analysedfor aflatoxins B 1, P1and M1and for aflatoxin B1-N7-guanine adducts, and among a sub- group of 28 cases and their matched controls for aflatoxins G1and Q1. HBsAg was measured by radioimmunoassay. Thirty-two out of 50 cases and 31 out of 267 controlswere HBsAg-positive. Each of the six biomarkers of aflatoxin exposure was morefrequently present among cases than controls. For 36 of the 50 liver cancer cases and 109of 267 controls, results were positive in at least one of the four assays analysed for thefull set of cases and controls (adjusted relative risk, 5.0; 95% CI, 2.1-12). The highestrisks were found among subjects with aflatoxin B 1-N7-guanine adducts. Compared with subjects who had no aflatoxin biomarkers and were HBsAg-negative, the interaction ofthe two factors was supra-multiplicative, with relative risks as follows: aflatoxinbiomarker only, 3.4 (95% 17-212). [The Working Group noted inconsistencies between analysesbased on dietary questionnaires and biomarkers.] The Penghu Islets reportedly have the highest rates of HCC in Taiwan, China. Chen et al. (1996) enrolled 4691 men and 1796 women, aged 30-65 years, in a prospective cohort study. The subjects were selected from a housing register maintained by the localadministration. Participants were interviewed on a variety of sociodemographic, dietaryand medical history topics. Blood samples were collected and stored frozen. A two-stagescreening process for HCC was undertaken which included serological markers andclinical assessments with ultrasonography. Subjects were further followed up withannual examinations. A total of 33 cases of HCC were diagnosed by December 1993, ofwhom two were negative for HBsAg. A total of 123 controls were selected from withinthe cohort among unaffected subjects, and matched with cases for age, sex, village anddate of blood collection. Blood samples from cases and controls were analysed forHBsAg, for anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies and aflatoxin B 1-albumin adducts, although samples for adduct analysis were usable for only 20 cases and 86 controls.Using logistic regression, with age and sex adjustment, and a detection limit for albuminadducts of 0.01 fmol/ g as the cut-off value, the OR for an association between presence of aflatoxin B 1-albumin adducts and HCC was 3.2 (13 cases; 95% CI, 1.1-8.9). When the statistical model also included several other covariates (HBsAg, anti-HCV , familyhistory of liver cancer and odds ratio for aflatoxin B 1-albumin adductsIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 202rose to 5.5 (95% CI, 1.2-25). There was also an extremely high risk associated with posi- tive HBsAg status (OR = 129; 95% CI, 25-659). The authors surmised that peanut conta-mination was a major source of aflatoxin in this population. Wang et al. (1996a) carried out a cohort study in seven townships of Taiwan, China, including three on the Penghu Islets and four on Taiwan Island. Of the total populationof 89 342 eligible subjects selected from local housing offices and mailed an invitationin a cancer screening project, 25 618 (29%) volunteered to participate. Among parti-cipants, 47% were men and enrolment occurred from July 1990 to June 1992. Parti-cipants were interviewed to elicit information on sociodemographic characteristics,alcohol and smoking habits, and medical history. Fasting blood and spot urine specimenswere collected and stored frozen. Serum samples were assayed for HBsAg and -feto- protein, anti-HCV and various markers of liver function. Abdominal ultrasonographywas carried out among a subgroup of high-risk persons from two Penghu Islets. All parti-cipants were recontacted by invitation to local research centres or by telephone inter-views between 1992-94. Periodic searches for death certificates from local housingoffices and in June 1995 through linkage with the national death and cancer registrieswere carried out. The overall follow-up rate was > 98%. Between February 1991 andJune 1995, 56 HCC cases were identified in the cohort, of which 22 were histologi-cally/cytologically confirmed. For each case, four controls were selected among cohortmembers who were free of liver cancer or cirrhosis at the time of case identification, andwho were matched for age, sex, township and recruitment date. Altogether there were 56HCC cases and 220 controls. Serum and urine specimens were available for analysis onsubsets: serum for 52 cases and 168 controls, and urine for 38 cases and 137 controls.Urinary aflatoxin metabolites were determined using a monoclonal antibody with highaffinity to aflatoxin B 1and significant aflatoxins B2, M1, G1and P1. Serum aflatoxin-albumin adducts were measured. Using conditional logistic regression,the OR for liver cancer corresponding to detectable levels of aflatoxin-albumin adductswas 4.6 (95% CI, 2.0-10) before 1.6 (95% CI, 0.4-5.5) afteradjustment. [The Working Group inconsistencies in numbers of available controlsfor serum aflatoxin-albumin adducts.] For high levels of urinary aflatoxin metabolites,the OR was 3.3 (95% CI, 1.4-7.7) before adjustment for HBsAg and 3.8(95% CI, 1.1-13) after adjustment. While there was little or no effect of aflatoxin bio-markers on HCC among HBsAg-negative subjects, there were quite strong effectsamong HBsAg-positive subjects, especially in the analysis using aflatoxin metabolites asthe exposure. [It seems that the present cohort and the cases identified in it include thecases studied by Chen et al. (1996) in the Penghu Islets. The low participation rate would not have affected the validity of the results unless individuals with preclinical livercancer symptoms and high aflatoxin exposure were more likely to volunteer for parti-cipation in the study than others in the same population.] Sun et al. (2001) reported the results from a nested case-control study of an extended follow-up of the cohort described by Wang et al. (1996a). Seventy-nine HBsAg-positive cases of HCC were identified between 1991 and 1997, and matched for age, gender,AFLATOXINS 203residence and date of recruitment to one or two randomly selected HBsAg-positive controls (total, 149). Blood samples were collected and analysed for HBV and M1 and T1 geno- types. In a conditional logistic regression analysis, a significant relationship wasobserved between HCC risk and aflatoxin B 1-albumin adducts GSTT1 -null genotypes were associated with a decreased risk for HCC (OR = 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.7 and A statistically signi-ficant ( p= 0.03) found between aflatoxin B 1-albumin adducts and GSTT1 genotype, indicating a more pronounced risk among those who were GSTT1 -null genotype (OR = 3.7; 95% CI, 1.5-9.3), and no risk among those who had the non-nullgenotype (OR = 0.9; 95% CI, 0.3-2.4). Yu et al. (1997a) carried out a cohort study in Taiwan, China, to study the role of afla- toxin in the etiology of HCC. Between 1988 and 1992, a cohort of 4841 male asympto-matic HBsAg carriers and 2501 male non-carriers, aged 30-65 years, was recruited fromthe Government Employee Central Clinics and the Liver Unit of a hospital in Taipei. Atentry into the study, each participant was interviewed to obtain information on demo-graphic characteristics, habits of cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking, diet (includingthe frequency of consuming peanuts and fermented bean products, which are thought tobe the major aflatoxin-contaminated foodstuffs in Taiwan), as well as personal andfamily history of major chronic diseases. Urine and blood samples from study subjectswere stored frozen. All HBsAg carriers in this study had both ultrasonography and - fetoprotein measurement every 6-12 months. Follow-up of HBsAg non-carriers wascarried out by annual examination including a serum -fetoprotein test. The response rate to the periodic follow-up examinations was approximately 72% for HBsAg carriers and80% for HBsAg non-carriers. Information on HCC occurrence and vital status of studysubjects who did not participate in the follow-up examinations was obtained from bothcomputerized data files of the national death certification and the cancer registry. By31 December 1994, 34 579 person-years of follow-up had been accumulated, an averageof 4.7 years per person. Fifty HCC cases were identified during the follow-up period. AllHCC cases were diagnosed on the basis of either pathological and cytological exami-nations or an elevated -fetoprotein level combined with at least one positive image. To investigate the role of aflatoxin, a nested case-control comparison was carried out, inwhich two separate matched controls per case were selected, one who was HBsAg-positive and one who was HBsAg-negative. Levels of aflatoxin metabolites in urine wereanalysed by reverse-phase HPLC allowing measurement of aflatoxins M 1, P1, B1and G1 and aflatoxin B1-N7-guanine. Most subjects were also tested for anti-HCV . After exclu- sion of subjects with missing specimens, analyses were available on 43 matched case-control sets. Among all HCC cases, only one occurred in the HBsAg-negative subcohort,and that one was positive for anti-HCV . All study subjects were positive for aflatoxin M 1, 81% for aflatoxin P1, 43% for aflatoxin B1-N7-guanine adducts, 28% for aflatoxin B1 and 12% for aflatoxin G1. There was a significant correlation ( r= 0.35) between reported dietary intake of various foods thought to contain aflatoxins and levels of urinaryIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 204aflatoxin M1. No significant correlations with other aflatoxin metabolites were observed. The main analyses, using conditional logistic regression, were carried out among casesand controls who were HBsAg carriers. Four of the five aflatoxin markers, but not afla-toxin G 1, were associated with an elevated risk for HCC among subjects in the highest tertile of exposure, although only for aflatoxin M1was this significant. The OR in the highest tertile of aflatoxin M1 exposure, after adjustment for education, ethnicity, alcohol and smoking, was 6.0 (23 cases; 95% CI, 1.2-29). When pairs of these aflatoxin bio-markers were examined, certain combinations were found to be associated with parti-cularly high risk: thus, subjects with detectable aflatoxin B 1- N7-guanine and high levels of aflatoxin M1had an OR of 12 (16 cases; 95% CI, 1.2-117). To investigate the role of HBV and aflatoxin in the etiology of liver cancer, Lu et al. (1998) carried out a nested case-control analysis within a cohort of 737 male HBsAgcarriers and 699 HBsAg non-carriers in Qidong, China (follow-up was from 1987-97).Among the HBsAg carriers, 30 cases of liver cancer were matched for age and place ofresidence with 150 non-cases from the cohort. Levels of aflatoxin B 1-albumin adducts were significantly higher among cases than among controls, both in proportion and inconcentration. The crude OR was 3.5 [95% CI, 1.3-10]. Sun et al. (1999) reported on the experience of a cohort of 145 men with chronic hepatitis B. These HBV-positive men had been detected in a prevalence survey carriedout in 1981-82 in two townships in Qidong, China. They were recruited for the presentfollow-up study during 1987-98. At recruitment, they were interviewed and examined;eight urine samples were obtained at monthly intervals and blood was drawn periodicallythroughout the follow-up period. The urine samples for each individual were pooled andaflatoxin M 1was measured in the pooled sample. No patients were lost to follow-up. The mean age of the cohort was 39 years in 1998. Over the period of follow-up, 22 of the 145subjects were diagnosed with liver cancer, of whom 10 had pathological confirmation.Anti-HCV-positive subjects had an increased risk for HCC compared with subjects whowere anti-HCV-negative and subjects with a family history of HCC had an increased riskcompared with subjects who did not have a family history of HCC. The median concen-tration of aflatoxin M 1in urine was 9.6 ng/L and the highest concentration was 243 ng/L. Using 3.6 ng/L as the cut-point in a Cox proportional hazard model, the relative risk forHCC among subjects with high aflatoxin M 1compared with those having low aflatoxin M1was 3.3 (95% CI, 1.2-8.9). When anti-HCV status and family history of HCC were also included in the model, the relative risk for HCC associated with afla-toxin M 1was 4.5 (95% CI, 1.6-13). 2.3 Case-control studies (see Table 12) Olubuyide et al. (1993a,b) carried out a small case-control study in Nigeria to assess the role of HBV and aflatoxins in primary hepatocellular carcinoma.

Blood samples were collected after subjects were on hospital diet for one week and were analysed for HBsAg and a numberof aflatoxins (B 1, B2, M1, M2, G1, G2) and aflatoxicol. HBsAg was detected in 16 cases and 8 controls. Elevated levels of aflatoxins were detected in five (23%) cases and one(5%) control, the difference being significant ( p< 0.05). [The Working Group questioned the comparability of cases and controls.] Mandishona et al . (1998) carried out a small case-control study in South Africa aiming primarily to determine the role of dietary iron overload in the etiology of HCC.They also collected information on exposure to aflatoxin B 1and reported risks in relation to this. Cases were 24 consecutive patients with HCC in two hospitals of one province ofSouth Africa. Two control series were assembled. A matched (sex, age, race) series of 48(two controls per case) was selected from patients hospitalized mainly with trauma orinfection. In addition, 75 relatives and family members of the cases constituted a secondcontrol series. Interviews were conducted and blood samples taken. Laboratory analysesyielded measures of serum aflatoxin B 1-albumin adducts, iron overload, HBsAg, anti- HCV and other The median level of aflatoxin B1-albumin adducts (pg/mg) was lower among cases (7.3; range 2.4-91.2) among hospitalcontrols (21.7; range otherparameters (HBsAg, serum ferritin) were higher among cases than controls. [TheWorking Group noted that the comparability of cases and controls was questionable forthe purpose of investigating carcinogenicity of aflatoxin. The measure used to compareaflatoxin levels between groups \u2014 the median \u2014 may fail to reflect the numbers withhigh values in the different groups.] Omer et al. (2001) conducted a case-control study in Sudan to assess the association between peanut butter intake as a source of aflatoxins and the GSTM1 genotype in the etiology of HCC. Cases were 150 patients with HCC who were diagnosed in five out ofsix hospitals of Khartoum and whose place of residence was in either western Sudan,about 650 km from Khartoum or central Sudan, about 500 km from Khartoum. Controlswere 205 residents of the two study areas, and selected by a two-stage process, thesecond stage of which involved random selection from local village 'sugar shops'. Theselists are thought to be comprehensive. Data collection involved a questionnaire whichincluded a particularly detailed history of peanut butter consumption and information onpotential confounders. The peanut butter history was transformed into a quantitativecumulative index. Usable blood samples were analysed for HBsAg and anti-HCV (115cases and 199 controls) and genotyped for GSTM1 (110 cases and 189 controls). Cases consumed more peanut butter than controls. There was a clear dose-response relation-ship between average peanut butter consumption and risk for HCC. In the highestquartile of consumption, the OR ranged from 3.0 to 4.0 depending on the covariatesincluded in the model, and all were statistically significant. The pattern of risk differedby region. Peanut butter consumption conferred no increased risk in central Sudan, but avery high risk in western Sudan (OR in the highest quartile, 8.7). Aflatoxin contami-nation of peanut butter was found to be a much greater problem in western Sudan thanIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 208in central Sudan (Omer et al., 1998). The authors also noted, however, that residents of the two regions are ethnically different, so effect modification by unmeasured genetic orenvironmental factors cannot be excluded. While GSTM1 genotype was not a risk factor for HCC, it was a strong effect modifier. The excess risk due to peanut butter consump-tion was restricted to subjects with GSTM1 -null genotype; the OR in the highest quartile of peanut butter exposure among GSTM1 -null subjects was 17 (95% CI, 2.7-105). 2.4 Limitations of recent studies While recent studies have incorporated many methodological improvements over studies described in the previous monograph on aflatoxins (IARC, 1993), therenevertheless remain certain problems that limit our ability to fully understand the role ofaflatoxins in liver carcinogenesis. Many recent studies have used HBsAg as the marker of exposure to HBV . However, among liver cancer cases that are negative for HBsAg, HBV DNA can be detected in33% (serum) and 47% (liver) of the cases, notably those from areas of high viralprevalence. Similarly, HCV RNA can be found in 7% (serum) and 26% (liver) of anti-HCV-negative liver cancer cases (Br\u00e9chot et al. , 1998). Thus studies relying on HBsAg or anti-HCV measurements may underestimate viral exposure and this may affect anevaluation of interaction between hepatitis viruses and aflatoxin (Paterlini et al. , 1994; Kew et al. , 1997; Kazemi-Shirazi et al. , 2000). Biomarkers of exposure to aflatoxin have been increasingly used to assess aflatoxin exposure. However, measurable urinary metabolites of aflatoxin or aflatoxin-albuminadducts in serum reflect only exposures in a recent period (days or weeks), and these maynot be related to exposures during the etiologically relevant period (years earlier).Moreover, it is unclear whether the presence of liver disease before cancer modifies thelevels of the markers found in serum or urine. In the presence of liver disease, compa-risons of levels of the marker between liver cancer cases and controls may be biased.Follow-up studies of either general populations in areas of different aflatoxin exposureor of HBsAg carriers investigated with repeated measurements of aflatoxin biomarkershave not yet accumulated follow-up periods that are long enough to minimize thepossibility that pre-existing liver disease led to bias in measurements of biomarkerlevels. Dietary questionnaires and food measurement surveys at the population level, often used to estimate aflatoxin exposure, provide crude measurements and may fail to accountfor secular trends in exposure or individual variations in exposure. Similarly, mortalityrates used in ecological studies to characterize regions at variable risk of liver cancermay suffer from misclassification of the diagnosis and reporting systems in somecountries.AFLATOXINS 2093. Studies of Cancer in Experimental Animals Studies on the carcinogenicity of aflatoxins in experimental animals completed and reported up to 1993 have been previously evaluated (IARC, 1993). Oral administrationof aflatoxin mixtures and aflatoxin B 1in several strains of rats, hamsters, salmon, trout, ducks, tree shrews and monkeys induced benign and malignant hepatocellular and/orcholangiocellular tumours. Orally administered aflatoxin B 1did not induce liver tumours in mice. Renal cell tumours were also found in rats following oral administration, whileintraperitoneal administration to adult mice increased the incidence of lung adenomas.Intraperitoneal administration of aflatoxin B 1to pregnant and lactating rats induced benign and malignant liver tumours in mothers and their progeny. Oral administration ofaflatoxin B 2to rats induced liver adenomas, while intraperitoneal administration induced a low incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. Oral administration of aflatoxin G1induced hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas and renal cell tumours in rats and liver-celltumours in trout; however, the responses were less than with aflatoxin B 1at the same dose level. A similar pattern was reported for aflatoxin M1and its metabolite aflatoxicol, while aflatoxin Q1induced a higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in trout than aflatoxin B1. Aflatoxin M1induced fewer hepatocellular carcinomas following oral admi- nistration to rats and trout than aflatoxin B1given at an equivalent dose by the same route. Aflatoxicol induced hepatocellular carcinomas in both species; the tumour inci-dences were lower than that in animals treated with aflatoxin B 1at the same dose level. The previous evaluations of aflatoxins (IARC, 1993) were that evidence for carcino- genicity in experimental animals was sufficient for aflatoxins B1, G1and M1, limited for aflatoxin B2and inadequate for aflatoxin G2. This monograph considers only relevant carcinogenicity studies published since 1993. 3.1 Intraperitoneal administration 3.1.1 Transgenic mouse Groups of 11 wild-type F1\u00d7F1(C57BL/6 \u00d7CBA) and 12 transgenic mice over- expressing porcine transforming growth factor 1(TGF- 1) [sex unspecified], seven days of age, received aflatoxin B1as a single intraperitoneal dose of 6 g/kg bw. No sponta- neous tumours were detected after 12 months in either nine control wild-type or 19control transgenic mice. after 12 months in theliver of the aflatoxin-treated transgenic and wild-type mice, respectively (Schnur et al., 1999). [The Working Group noted the limited reporting of this study.]IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 2103.2 Oral administration of ammoniated forms 3.2.1 Rat In a study to investigate the effect of ammoniation on the carcinogenicity of aflatoxin B1-contaminated cakes, male and female Wistar WAG and Fischer 344 rats, 4-5 weeks of age, were fed: diet containing 30% peanut oil cake contaminated with 1000 ppb[g/kg] aflatoxin B 1and 170 ppb aflatoxin G1; contaminated diet treated with pressurised ammonia gas (2 bar; 200 kPa) for 15 min at 95 \u00b0C (140 ppb aflatoxin B1and 20 ppb aflatoxin G1); or contaminated diet treated with ammonia at a pressure of 3 bar (300 kPa) for 15 min at 95 \u00b0C (60 ppb aflatoxin B1and 10 ppb aflatoxin G1). A control group received a diet containing 30% of uncontaminated peanut oil cakes (later deter-mined to contain 50 ppb aflatoxin B 1); this was reduced to 25% of diet after one month due to greater consumption than the other diets. Deaths occurred among rats receivingthe contaminated, untreated diet (10% male Fischer 344, 25% female Fischer 344, of hepatic tumours at the 12-monthtermination are given in Table 13. Treatment with ammonia at 2 bar (200 kPa) greatlyreduced the carcinogenic potential of the contaminated diet. Treatment with ammonia at3 bar (300 kPa) eliminated induction of tumours occurring at 12 months (Frayssinet &Lafarge-Frayssinet, 1990). 3.2.2 Trout The effect of ammoniation on the hepatocarcinogenic potential of aflatoxin B1was investigated in Mount Shasta strain rainbow trout. Duplicate groups of 80 trout (averageweight 63 g) were randomly distributed into ~380-L tanks and fed uncontaminated cornor corn contaminated with 180 g/kg aflatoxins g/kg; B2, 10 g/kg; G1, 9g/kg; G2, trace) treated by ammoniation or untreated, following diets for untreated corn; uncontaminated treated corn; contaminateduntreated corn; and contaminated treated corn.

Ten fish were removed from each tank for histopathological evaluation at four and eight months and the remainingfish were held for 12 months. Liver nodules of doubtful classification and five randomlysampled livers at each sampling date were examined histopathologically. At eightmonths, fish fed contaminated untreated corn had a high incidence (19/20) of hepatoma(Brekke et al. , 1977). Ammoniation significantly reduced the carcinogenic potential at 12 months of aflatoxin B 1-contaminated corn (Table 14). In a more recent experiment, trout were given non-fat dried milk power prepared from the milk of cows that had received aflatoxin-contaminated diets. Thirty lactatingcows (Holstein-Friesian) were fed 1, 5200 g/kg) for seven days followed by an untreated aflatoxin-containing seed for seven days. The final aflatoxin B1concentration in the cow ration was 780 g/kg. In a second experiment, three lactating cows were fed for 10 days a ration containingammonia-treated (high pressure at high temperature; HP/HT) aflatoxin-contaminatedcottonseed (aflatoxin B 1, 1200 g/kg), incorporated at 25% (w/w) of the total dry weight of the ration. Then, they were fed for 10 days a ration containing untreated aflatoxin-contaminated cottonseed (aflatoxin B 1, 1200 g/kg), incorporated at 25% (aflatoxin B1, 300 g/kg, in final ration). Milk was collected daily from days 3 to 7 (for each period) when cows were fed the AP/AT material and from days 3 to 10 (for each period) whenthey were fed the HP/HT material. The milk was processed to prepare non-fat dried milkpowder, which was fed as 25% of the diet to rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) for 12 months. The aflatoxin M 1levels in the milk powders from cows given untreated and treated seed were: AP/AT, 85 and < 0.05 g/kg; and HP/HT, 32 and < 0.05 g/kg, respec- tively. AP/AT treatment reduced the liver tumour incidence to 2.5% compared with 42%in the trout fed the milk from the cows that received the untreated cottonseed. In positivecontrols, feeding aflatoxin B 1(4 g/kg) continuously for 12 months resulted in a 34% tumour incidence, while feeding for two weeks a diet containing 20 g/kg aflatoxin B1 resulted in an incidence of 37% of liver tumours, and feeding of 80 g/kg or 800 g/kgIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 212 Table 14. Incidence of hepatoma in trout fed various diets for 12 months Diet Incidence of hepatoma Basal Uncontaminated et al. (1977)aflatoxin M1 resulted in tumour incidences of 5.7 and 50%, respectively, after nine months. In the separate HP/HT experiment, no tumours were observed in the livers ofthe trout fed diets containing milk from either the ammonia-treated or untreated sourceor the control diet containing 8 g/kg aflatoxin M 1. In positive controls fed 64 g/kg aflatoxin B1for two weeks, tumour incidence was 29% after 12 months. It was concluded that neither aflatoxin M1at 8 g/kg nor any HP/HT-derived aflatoxin deri- vatives carried over into milk represented a detectable carcinogenic hazard to trout(Bailey et al., 1994a). 3.3 Carcinogenicity of metabolites Trout : Fry ( O. mykiss , Shasta strain) were fed Oregon Test Diet (OTD) containing 0, 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64 ng aflatoxin B1or aflatoxicol per g dry weight of diet for two weeks. Each dietary group consisted of 400 treated fish or 200 control fish. The experiment wasterminated after nine months. The incidence of hepatic tumours in the groups given the4, 8, 16, 32 64 ng/g seen in the controls. In the second protocol, quadruplicate groups of 120 eggs(21-day-old embryos) were exposed to various concentrations (0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1,0.25, 0.5 g/mL) of aflatoxin B 1or aflatoxicol for 1 h. At swimup (after hatching and yolk sac absorption), 360 healthy fry per treatment group (320 and 240 fish from the0.5 ppm aflatoxin B 1- and aflatoxicol-treated embryos, respectively) were fed the OTD diet for 13 months. There was a induced a slightly higher hepatic tumour response in fry and fish embryosthan did aflatoxin B 1(Bailey et al. , 1994b). Groups of 120 rainbow trout fry, weighing 1.2 g, were treated with concentrations of aflatoxin B1and aflatoxicol ranging from 4 to 64 ng/g of diet and of aflatoxin M1and aflatoxicol M1ranging from 80 to 1280 ng/g of diet for two weeks. All the fry were then maintained on the control diet until termination at one year. The tumour responsesrelative to aflatoxin B 1were: aflatoxin B1, aflatoxin M1, 0.086; and aflatoxicol M1, 0.041. The authors also monitored DNA-adduct formation and concluded that the differences in tumour response were largely accounted for by diffe-rences in uptake and metabolism leading to DNA adduct formation, rather than diffe-rences in tumour-initiating potency per DNA adduct (Bailey et al., 1998).AFLATOXINS 2133.4 Administration with known carcinogens and other modifying factors 3.4.1 Viruses Transgenic mouse : Hepatitis B virus-positive (HBV+) C57BL/6 mice were bred TP53-/-) to produce TP53+/-, HBV+ litter mates ( TP53+/+, HBV+ and TP53+/-, HBV-) were randomly divided into groups of 16-24 animals. Approximately half of the animals in each group were females. The experi-mental group received a single intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/kg bw aflatoxin B 1in tricaprylin, while the controls received tricaprylin alone at the age of one week.Surviving animals were sacrificed at 13 months and assessed for HBV positivity byHBsAg expression. The incidence of hepatocellular 2 or higher [adenomas and 100% in males that were heterozygousfor the TP53 allele and that carried HBV and received aflatoxin B 1and was 62.5% in males that were homozygous for the wild-type TP53 allele and had both risk factors (HBV and aflatoxin B1). The presence of HBV without aflatoxin in heterozygous animals was more potent (25%) than the presence of aflatoxin without HBV (14.2%). The wild-type TP53 was capable of suppressing tumours when animals were exposed to either risk factor alone (0%). In a companion set of experiments reported later, the relative effect ofa mutant allele for TP53 at serine 246 (the mouse homologue to the human TP53 249 ser mutation) on the risk factors described above was examined. The 246sermutation, when present in heterozygous TP53 male animals, led to the development of tumours in 25% of the animals even without virus or aflatoxin. In animals heterozygous for TP53 with the 246sermutation, 71% of the animals receiving aflatoxin B1and not carrying HBV had tumours, whereas in the the heterozygous wild-type allele was associatedwith 14.2% tumours. Female mice in both studies had fewer tumours but exhibitedsimilar patterns of response. The presence of the TP53 246 sermutant not only enhanced the synergistic effect of HBsAg and aflatoxin B1but also increased tumorigenesis in afla- toxin B1-treated mice weighing 100-160 g [age unspecified], were divided into four groups. Normal and HBV (human)-infected animals were fed aflatoxin B 1at 150 g/kg bw per day in milk on six days per week for 105 weeks. Animals were held until 160 weeks. Hepatocellular carcinomasdeveloped in 67% (14/21) of both male (5/10) and female (9/11) combined HBV-infected/aflatoxin B 1-treated animals and in 30% (3/10) animals treated with aflatoxin B1 alone (male, 1/6; female, 2/4). The average time for development of hepatocellular carci-noma for males and females combined was significantly reduced ( p< 0.01) with combined HBV-infection and aflatoxin B 1treatment (120.3 \u00b116.6 weeks) compared with aflatoxin B1treatment alone (153 weeks) (Li et al., 1999). Woodchuck ( Marmota monax ): Woodchucks were infected with the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV; closely related to HBV) at 2-7 days of age. From the age of 12months, groups of six male and six female WHV-positive and six male and six femaleWHV-negative animals were fed 50 g/kg bw aflatoxin B 1(< 99% pure) in bananas, fiveIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 214days per week for four months followed by treatment with 20 g/kg bw aflatoxin B1, five days per week for life. Two untreated groups (WHV-positive and -negative) served as thecontrols. Woodchucks infected with WHV with or without aflatoxin B 1treatment developed preneoplastic foci, hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas between 6 and 26months after commencing the treatment. Liver tumours were observed by ultrasound at25 months in 5/9 animals infected with WHV and at 11 months in 1/11, at 19 months in4/10 and at 25 months in 2/5 animals that received the combined WHV/aflatoxintreatment. No liver tumours were diagnosed in aflatoxin B 1-treated or untreated control animals. The combined treatment resulted in earlier tumour appearance than with WHValone (Bannasch et al., 1995). 4. Other Data Relevant to an Evaluation of Carcinogenicity and its Mechanisms 4.1 Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion 4.1.1 Humans Rigorous quantitative comparisons of dietary intakes and aflatoxin metabolites in body fluids following absorption and distribution are lacking. As noted in the previousmonograph (IARC, 1993), aflatoxin M 1concentrations in urine and human milk have been correlated with dietary aflatoxin intake. However, studies of human exposure haveyielded quantitatively very different correlations between aflatoxin concentrations infoods and either aflatoxin-protein or aflatoxin-DNA adducts in urine and sera (Hall &Wild, 1994). Hudson et al. (1992) very carefully measured aflatoxin intake based on plate foods in a village in The Gambia. They found intakes less than those estimatedfrom aflatoxin-serum and urinary adduct levels in the same individuals. In humans, aswith other species, the DNA binding and carcinogenicity of aflatoxin B 1result from its conversion to the 8,9-epoxide by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (Essigman et al. , 1982). There is individual variability in the rate of activation of aflatoxin, includingbetween children and adults, which may be material to the pharmacokinetics (Ramsdell& Eaton, 1990; Wild et al. , 1990). The pharmacokinetics of aflatoxins in humans are still not clearly known. Factors that explain variation in response to aflatoxin between individual humans, animal species and strains include the proportion of aflatoxin metabolized to the 8,9-epoxide (mainly by CYP enzymes) relative to the other much less toxic metabolites andthe prevalence of pathways forming non-toxic conjugates with reduced mutagenicity andcytotoxicity. Several excellent reviews have been published on the metabolism ofaflatoxins since the last IARC monograph on this topic (Eaton & Gallagher 1994;McLean 1995; Guengerich B1is short-lived but highly reactive and is the main mediator of cellular injury (McLean & Dutton, 1995). Formation of DNA adducts ofaflatoxin B 1-epoxide is well characterized. The primary site of adduct formation is the N7 position of the guanine base (Guengerich et al. , 1998). The metabolism of aflatoxins in humans has been extensively studied and the major CYP enzymes involved have been identified as CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 (Gallagher et al., 1996; Ueng et al ., 1998). mediates formation of exo-epoxide and aflatoxin Q1while CYP1A2 can generate some exo-epoxide but also a high proportion of endo -epoxide and aflatoxin M1. In-vitro evidence that both CYP3A4 and 1A2 are responsible for aflatoxin metabolism in humans has been substantiated by biomarkerstudies. Aflatoxins M 1and Q1, produced by CYP1A2 and 3A4, respectively, are present in the urine of individuals exposed to aflatoxin (Ross et al., 1992; Qian et al.,1994). The N7-guanine adducts of aflatoxin are generated primarily by the exo-8,9-epoxide, from which yields of adduct are > 98% (Guengerich et al. , 1998). The overall contribution of the above enzymes to aflatoxin B1metabolism in vivo will depend not only on their affinity but also on their expression in human liver, where CYP3A4 is predominant.CYP3A5, in contrast to CYP3A4, metabolizes aflatoxin B 1mainly to the exo-8,9 epoxide but is about 100-fold less efficient in catalysing 3-hydroxylation of aflatoxin B1to yield the aflatoxin Q1metabolite (Wang et al ., 1998). Hepatic CYP3A5 expression differs markedly between individuals, with a proportion of the population, dependent on ethnicgroup, showing no expression; in particular, 40% of African Americans do not expressthis enzyme. Therefore, differences in expression of CYP3A5 could influence suscepti-bility to aflatoxins. Recently, polymorphisms have been identified in the promoter regionof CYP3A5 leading to alternative splicing and truncated protein (Hustert et al., 2001; Kuehl et al., 2001). The role of these polymorphisms in susceptibility to aflatoxins is currently unknown. CYP3A7 (also called P450 HFLa) is a major form of cytochrome P450 in human fetal liver, which has the capacity to activate aflatoxin B 1to the 8,9-epoxide (Kitada et al., 1989, 1990). This is consistent with the detection of aflatoxin-albumin adducts in the cord blood of newborns whose mothers were exposed to dietary aflatoxin in TheGambia (Wild et al., 1991). Recombinant CYP3A7 conferred sensitivity to aflatoxin B 1 in transfected Chinese hamster lung cells (Kamataki et al., 1995). In humans, the reactive exo- and endo -epoxides of aflatoxin B1can be -epoxides can also hydrolyse rapidly by a non-enzymatic process to an 8,9-dihydrodiol that in turn undergoes slow,base-catalysed ring opening to a dialdehyde phenolate ion (Johnson et al., 1996; Johnson & The dialdehydes from aflatoxins B 1and G1form Schiff bases with primary amine groups such as those in lysine, to yield protein adducts, for example withalbumin (Sabbioni et al., 1987; Sabbioni & Wild 1991). A further metabolic step involves B 1aldehyde reductase (AFB1-AR) which dialdehydic phenolate ion to a dialcohol; this enzyme has been characterized in both rats and humans (Hayes et al., 1993; Ireland et al., 1998; Knight et al., 1999). The role of epoxide hydrolase in hydrolysis of aflatoxin B18,9-epoxide has been investigated et al. , 1996; Johnson et al ., 1997a,b) with respect to the observed association between epoxide hydrolase genotype and risk for hepatocellularcarcinoma in aflatoxin-exposed populations (McGlynn et al., 1995; Tiemersma et al., 2001). If the enzyme is involved, its contribution may be limited, given the rapid non-enzymatic hydrolysis mentioned above (Guengerich et al., 1998). Oltipraz, an antischistosomal drug, acts as a potent inhibitor of aflatoxin-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in animal models. A total of 234 healthy adults from Qidong(China) were assigned to receive 125 mg oltipraz daily, 500 mg oltipraz weekly or aplacebo. Urinary aflatoxin metabolites were quantified by sequential immunoaffinitychromatography and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry or fluo-rescence detection. One month of weekly administration of 500 mg oltipraz led to a 51%decrease in the amount of aflatoxin M 1excreted in urine compared with administration of a placebo ( p= 0.030), but it had no effect on concentrations of aflatoxin-mercapturic acid ( p= 0.871). Daily intervention with 125 mg oltipraz led to a 2.6-fold increase in median aflatoxin-mercapturic acid excretion ( p= had excreted aflatoxin M1levels ( p = 0.682). It was concluded that the higher dose of oltipraz inhibited aflatoxin activation, whereas the lower dose increased GSH conjugation ofaflatoxin 8,9-epoxide (Wang et al ., 1999a). Among other things, this clinical trial demonstrates that the results of studies conducted in vitro on the major pathways of afla- toxin processing (discussed below) are consistent with human data. Kirby et al .(1993) examined liver tissues from 20 liver cancer patients from Thailand, an area where exposure to aflatoxin occurs. The activity of hepatic CYP iso-enzymes and GST was examined and compared with the in-vitro metabolism of afla- toxin B1. There was considerable inter-individual variation in activity of CYP enzymes, tumours, metabolism of aflatoxin B 1to the 8,9-epoxide and aflatoxin Q1(the major metabolites) was related to the concentration of CYP3A3/4 and CYP2B6. There was significantly reduced activity of major CYP proteins in micro-some preparations from liver tumours compared with those from adjacent non-tumourareas in the liver. The major classes of cytosolic GSTs (, and )were also analysed in normal and tumorous liver tissue. The activity of and class proteins was decreased and increased in the majority of tumour cytosols compared with normal liver. Cyto- solic GST activity was significantly lower in liver tumours than in normal liver. Therewas no detectable conjugation of aflatoxin B 18,9-epoxide to GSH by microsomal preparations from either normal liver or liver tumour tissue. Heinonen et al. (1996) studied aflatoxin B1metabolism in human liver slices from three donors by incubating the tissue with 0.5 M [3H]aflatoxin B1for 2 h. The rates of oxidative metabolism aflatoxins Q1, P1and M1were similar to thoseAFLATOXINS 217observed slices, albeit with significant interindividual variation. GSH- conjugate formation was not detected in the human liver samples. It is probable that the apparent discrepancies between studies showing the elimi- nation of mercapturic acids in the urine of aflatoxin-exposed individuals (Wang et al., 1999a) and the apparent lack of formation of glutathione conjugates in cytosolicincubations with aflatoxin B 18,9-epoxide (Heinonen et al. , 1996) are due to differences in sensitivity of the analytical methods employed. Rodent studies (see below) have demonstrated that viral damage to the liver affects the metabolism of aflatoxin. Kirby et al . (1996a) examined the expression of CYP enzymes in sections of normal human liver and in livers with hepatitis and cirrhosis. Byuse of immunohistochemical techniques, it was shown that in sections infected withhepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), the concentration of CYP2A6 wasincreased in hepatocytes immediately adjacent to areas of fibrosis and inflammation. Inthe same tissues, CYP3A4 and CYP2B1 were somewhat increased and CYP1A2 was un-affected compared with normal liver. In HCV-infected liver, CYP2A6, CYP3A4 andCYP2B1 were increased in hepatocytes that had accumulated haemosiderin pigment. 4.1.2 Experimental systems (a)Human tissues Data published before 1993 were reviewed in IARC Monographs V olume 56 (IARC, 1993). The metabolism and major metabolites of aflatoxin B1are shown in Figures 3 and 4. Gallagher et al. (1996) studied the kinetics of aflatoxin oxidation in human liver microsomes and in microsomes expressing human CYP3A4 andCYP1A2 K mwas 41 M for CYP1A2 and 140-180 M (average affinity for two binding sites) for CYP3A4. In the case of CYP3A4, the rate of product formationdropped as the substrate concentration was reduced. In contrast, CYP1A2 has a higheraffinity for aflatoxin. In humans, at plausible serum aflatoxin concentrations, the rate offormation of aflatoxin 8,9-epoxide will be determined by both the lower K mof CYP1A2 and the greater abundance of CYP3A4 in human liver. The ability of the human lung to metabolize aflatoxin has been studied in the context of the risk of pulmonary carcinogenesis from handling crops contaminated by aflatoxins.Bioactivation of tritiated aflatoxin B 1was demonstrated in fresh lung preparations from patients undergoing lobectomy for lung cancer. Lipoxygenase and prostaglandin Hsynthase activity was shown to be primarily responsible for aflatoxin activation, ratherthan the CYP enzymes, which display a low level of activity in this tissue (Donnellyet al., 1996). Neal et al. (1998) compared the metabolism of aflatoxins B 1and M1in vitro using human liver microsomes. Indirect evidence was obtained for metabolism of aflatoxin M1 to the 8,9-epoxide by trapping the reactive metabolite with Tris and GSH in the presenceof mouse cytosolic fraction. Human liver cytosol did not appear to mediate GSHIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 218AFLATOXINS 219 Figure 3. Metabolic activation of aflatoxin B1to the 8,9-epoxide, leading to binding to glutathione, DNA and serum albumin From Essigman et al. (1982)conjugation of either microsomally activated aflatoxin B1or aflatoxin M1. An interesting observation was the cytotoxicity of low doses of aflatoxin M1(0.5 g/mL) to lympho- blastoid cells in the absence of metabolic activation, which was not observed withaflatoxin B 1. A non-tumorigenic SV40-immortalized human liver epithelial cell line expressing human CYP1A2 cDNA mediated the formation of both aflatoxin B1- and aflatoxin M1- DNA adducts, suggesting that aflatoxin B1hydroxylation to aflatoxin M1can subse- quently lead to DNA damage (Mac\u00e9 et al., 1997). As mentioned above, human cytosolic fractions or liver slices in vitro show little detectable conjugation of aflatoxin B18,9-epoxide. Purified recombinant human -classIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 220 Figure 4. Major metabolites of aflatoxin B1 From Essigman et al. (1982)GSTs, namely hGSTA1-1 and hGSTA2-2, also lack significant activity (Raney et al., 1992; Buetler et al ., 1996; Johnson et al ., conjugating expressed by human -class GSTs M1a-1a and M2-2, although mostly towards the epoxide (Raney et al., 1992). Langou\u00ebt et al.(1995) investigated metabolism of aflatoxin B1in primary human hepatocytes from eight human liver donors with or without pretreatment by oltipraz.Parenchymal cells obtained from the three GSTM1-positive livers metabolized aflatoxinB 1to aflatoxin M1and to aflatoxin B1-glutathione conjugates, but no such conjugates were formed in the cells lacking GSTM1. Although oltipraz treatment of the cellsinduced GSTs A2, A1 and M1, it resulted in decreased formation of aflatoxin M 1and aflatoxin B1oxides due to inhibition of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. (b)Experiments on animals and animal tissues Kirby et al. (1996b) demonstrated that viral infections causing liver injury alter the activity of aflatoxin-metabolizing enzymes in human liver. This has also been shown intransgenic mice that overproduce the HBV large envelope protein, which results inprogressive liver cell injury, inflammation and regenerative hyperplasia. The activity ofCYP2A5 and CYP3A and a GST isoenzyme was examined in these mice. Increased activity and altered distribution of CYP2A5 were shown to be associated with the deve-lopment of liver injury. The amount of CYP3A was also increased, while GST enzyme concentrations were the same in transgenic mice and in otherwise isogenic, non-trans-genic mice (Kirby et al., 1994a). Fetal rat liver contains a GST that forms a conjugate with aflatoxin B 18,9-epoxide, identified as a GST . By means of immunoblotting and enzyme assays it was shown that liver from adult female rats contains concentrations of one of the enzyme subunits (Yc2) about 10-fold higher than those in liver from adult male rats. This may contribute to therelative insensitivity of female rats to aflatoxin B 1(Hayes et al., 1994). In addition to CYP-mediated activation, aflatoxin B18,9-epoxide can also be formed through metabolism by lipoxygenase and prostaglandin H synthase isolated from guinea-pig tissues and ram seminal vesicles, respectively (Battista & Marnett, 1985; Liu &Massey, 1992). In some organs, for example guinea-pig kidney, the contributions of CYPand prostaglandin H synthase to formation of the epoxide are similar (Liu et al., 1990). There are marked species differences in sensitivity to aflatoxin carcinogenesis (Gorelick, 1990; Eaton & Gallagher, 1994; Eaton & Groopman, 1994). For example, theadult mouse is almost completely refractory to tumour formation except under condi-tions of partial hepatectomy or liver injury through expression of HBV antigens. Incontrast, the rat is extremely sensitive (see Section 3). A considerable part of this inter-species variation is now understood in terms of differences in activity of aflatoxin-meta-bolizing enzymes in the pathways described above. Microsomal preparations from miceactually exhibit higher specific activity for aflatoxin B 18,9-epoxide production than the rat (Ramsdell & Eaton, 1990). However, in the mouse, the resistance to aflatoxin carci-nogenesis is largely if not exclusively explained by the constitutive hepatic expression ofAFLATOXINS 221an -class GST, mGSTA3-3, which affinity for aflatoxin B18,9-epoxide (Buetler & Eaton, 1992; Hayes et al., 1992). In contrast, rats do not constitutively express a GST isoform with high epoxide-conjugating activity but do express an inducible - class GST (rGSTA5-5) with high activity. The induction of this enzyme plays a majorrole in the resistance of rats to aflatoxin B 1-induced hepatocarcinogenicity following treatment hydroxy-anisole (Kensler et 1986, 1987; Hayes et al., 1991, 1994). A cross-species study of rats (Fischer 344, Sprague-Dawley and Wistar), mice (C57BL), hamsters (Syrian golden) and guinea-pigs (Hartley) was conducted using dosesof aflatoxin B 1between 1 and 80 g/kg bw per day for up to 14 days by gavage (Wild et al., 1996). Aflatoxin-albumin adducts were measured at 1, 3, 7 and 14 days and hepatic aflatoxin B1-DNA adducts were measured at the final time point. Both albumin and DNA adducts were formed in the order rat > guinea-pig > hamster > mouse, withsimilar ratios between the two biomarkers across species, suggesting that the albuminadducts reflected hepatic DNA damage. Calculations from human environmental expo-sure data and albumin adducts suggested that humans and rats \u2014 a sensitive species \u2014 have similar formation of albumin adducts for a given exposure to aflatoxin. In rats, the -class enzymes rGSTM2-2 and rGSTM2-3 can conjugate both the exo- and endo -epoxide of aflatoxin but the latter is the preferred substrate (Raney et al., 1992; Johnson et al., 1997a). Wang et al. (2000) showed that the GST-conjugating ability of the non-human primate, Macaca fascicularis (mf), towards the 8,9-epoxide was partially due to a -class GST, mfaGSTM2-2, with 96% amino acid homology to the human hGSTM2. The enzyme mfaGSTM2-2 was predominantly active towards the endo -epoxide, whereas another enzyme, GSHA-GST, for which the encoding cDNA was not cloned, had activitytowards the exo-epoxide of aflatoxin. However, the activity was about two orders of magnitude lower than that of the rodent -class GSTs, mGSTA3-3 and hepatic the 8,9-epoxide to those of macaques (Macaca nemestrina ), but GST activity towards the epoxide was below the detection limit in the former two species (Bammler et al., 2000). Stresser et al.(1994a) examined the influence of dietary indole-3-carbinol (found in cruciferous vegetables) on the relative levels of different CYP isozymes known to meta-bolize aflatoxin B 1in rats. Diets containing 0.2% (w/w) indole-3-car- binol given for seven days were shown the microsomal concentrations ofCYP1A1, 1A2 and 3A1/2 (24-, 3.1- and 3.8-fold, respectively, compared with rats recei-ving a control diet), with a smaller effect on 2B1/2 (1.7-fold) and no effect on CYP2C11.The influence of dietary indole-3-carbinol on the aflatoxin B 1glutathione detoxication pathway and aflatoxin B1-DNA adduct formation was also investigated. After seven days of feeding a diet containing indole-3-carbinol (0.2% intraperitoneal injection and killed after 2 h. The diet with indole-3-carbinol inhibited the formation of aflatoxin B1-DNA adducts in the liver by 68%, based on analysis of DNA-bound radioactivity (Stresser et al., 1994b). IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 2224.2 Toxic effects 4.2.1 Humans Reports of toxic effects of aflatoxins in humans were reviewed in the previous IARC monograph (IARC, 1993). There are data suggesting that children are more vulnerable than adults to acute hepatotoxicity resulting from ingestion of aflatoxin. In 1988, 13 Chinese children diedof acute hepatic encephalopathy in Perak, Malaysia (Lye et al 1995). Common symptoms included vomiting, haematemesis and seizures; jaundice was detected inseven cases and all children had liver dysfuntion with elevated serum concentrations aminotransferase). The deathsoccurred 1-7 days after hospital admission and were associated with consumption ofChinese rice noodles shortly before the outbreak. Aflatoxins were found in blood andorgans from the children (Chao et al., 1991). Pesticides, carbon tetrachloride and mush- room poisons were not found. The flour used to make the noodles was found to containaflatoxin. Adults who presumably consumed the same contaminated food were notreported to have been affected (Lye et al., 1995). Children suffering from protein-energy malnutrition in developing countries may also be exposed to aflatoxin. In a study conducted in South Africa, aflatoxin concen-trations in serum were higher in 74 children with protein-energy malnutrition than in 35age-matched control children. The control group, however, had a higher concentration ofaflatoxins in urine (Ramjee et al. , 1992). [Possible explanations for this result are that aflatoxin metabolism is affected in children with protein-energy malnutrition or thatmalnourished children are more highly exposed.] A second study compared children withprotein-energy malnutrition with high ( n= 21) and undetectable ( n= 15) aflatoxin concentrations in serum and urine. The aflatoxin-positive group of children with protein-energy malnutrition showed a significantly lower haemoglobin level ( p = 0.02), longer duration of oedema ( p = 0.05), an increased number of infections ( p = 0.03) and a longer duration of hospital stay ( p = 0.008) than the aflatoxin-negative group (Adhikari et al., 1994). This finding confirmed results of an earlier study which suggested that malarialinfections were increased in children exposed to aflatoxin, as determined on the basis ofthe amounts of aflatoxin-albumin adducts (Allen et al., 1992). However, a similar study from the Philippines gave inconclusive results (Denning et al., 1995). [The Working Group noted that in these studies estimates of aflatoxin exposures were not available andthat possible confounders were not considered.] 4.2.2 Experimental systems No primary studies on the toxicity of aflatoxins were found other than those summarized in IARC (1993) and Eaton and Groopman (1994). Experimental carcinogenicity studies with aflatoxin B1reported previously (IARC, 1993) described preneoplastic lesions of various types in addition to tumours of the liverAFLATOXINS 223(mainly hepatocellular carcinomas) in Syrian hamsters) and non-human primates (rhesus, cynomolgus and African green monkeys). There have been numeroussubsequent studies in aflatoxin B 1-exposed animals, especially rats, of GSTP-positive foci in the liver. Particular emphasis has been placed on modification by different co-exposures of the development and frequency of these foci. Often, there was an increasein the number of GSTP-positive by L-buthionine sulfoximine (which depletes reduced glutathione) and inhibition of their appearance or rate of development by pheno-barbital, anti-oxidants and various sulfur compounds, including dithiolethiones (e.g.,Bolton et Gopalan et al., et al., 1998). (a)Immunosuppression Studies on the immunosuppressive effects of aflatoxins published before 1993 were reviewed in the previous monograph (IARC, 1993). Aflatoxins modulate the immune system in domestic and laboratory animals after dietary intake of up to several milligrams per kg feed (Hall & Wild, 1994; Bondy &Pestka, 2000). The major effects involve suppression of cell-mediated immunity, mostnotably impairment of delayed-type hypersensitivity, which has been a consistent obser-vation at low dose levels in various species (Bondy & Pestka, 2000). Other notableeffects include suppression of non-specific humoral substances, reduced antibody forma-tion, suppression of allograft rejection, decreased phagocytic activity and decreasedblastogenic to mitogens (Pier & Denning, 1987; WHO,1990). Strong modification of cytokine secretion and interleukin gene expression hasalso been observed in vitro with mycotoxins, including aflatoxins (Han et al ., 1999; Moon et al., 1999; Rossano et al., 1999). The immune system of developing pigs was affected by maternal dietary exposure to aflatoxin B 1or aflatoxin G1during gestation and lactation. Motility and chemotaxis of neutrophils were inhibited in piglets from afla-toxin-treated sows (Silvotti et al., 1997). In a further study, thymic cortical lymphocytes were depleted and thymus weight was reduced in piglets from sows exposed to afla-toxin B 1(800 ppb [ g/kg] in diet) from day 60 of gestation up to day 28 of lactation (Mocchegiani et al., 1998). The effects of aflatoxin B1on growing rats have been shown to be similar to those in adult animals. Weanling rats [strain unspecified] were given oral doses of 60, 300 or600g/kg bw aflatoxin B 1in corn oil every other day for four weeks. Aflatoxin B1selec- tively suppressed cell-mediated immunity, assessed by measuring the delayed-typehypersensitivity at the 300- and 600- g/kg bw doses (Raisuddin et al. , 1993). In order to determine the effect of aflatoxin B 1on the activation of toxoplasmosis, CF1 mice were injected with the cyst-forming parasite Toxoplasma gondii one month before aflatoxin B1was given by gavage daily for 50 days at 100 g/kg bw. Cysts deve- loped in the brains of all mice, but the lesions were judged to be more severe in the afla-toxin B 1-treated animals (Venturini et al., 1996).IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 224Several studies have been reported on the effect of aflatoxin on isolated alveolar macrophages, but only few experiments in intact animals. One such study involved maleFischer 344 rats and female Swiss mice that were exposed to aflatoxin B 1by either aerosol inhalation or phagocytosis at an estimated dose of 16.8 g/kg bw. The effect persisted for about two weeks. The effects after intratracheal exposures were similar but occurred at approximately 10-fold higher doses. Additionally,intratracheal administration of aflatoxin B 1suppressed the release of tumour necrosis factor (TNF ) and inhibited peritoneal macrophage phagocytosis (Jakab et al., 1994). The overall picture from studies of immunosuppressive effects of aflatoxins in animals is of increased susceptibility to bacterial and parasitic infections and an adverseeffect on acquired immunity, as evidenced by experimental challenge with infectiousagents after vaccination (reviewed by Denning, 1987). In contrast to the evidence of theimmunosuppressive action of aflatoxins in animal studies, evidence in humans comesonly from in-vitro experiments. Extremely low doses of aflatoxin B 1(0.5-1.0 pg/mL) in cultures of human monocytes in vitro were shown to decrease phagocytosis and micro- bicidal activity against Candida albicans (Cusumano et al., 1996). Concentrations as low as 0.05 pg/mL were shown to reduce the release of interleukins 1 and 6 and TNF (Rossano et al., 1999). Mycotoxin-induced immune disruption may influence suscepti- bility to childhood infections, but may also increase later susceptibility to hepatocellularcarcinoma through the child's reduced immune response to hepatitis B virus (HBV) andrisk of subsequent development of chronic HBV-carrier status (see Section 4.5.3). 4.3 Reproductive and developmental effects Reproductive and developmental effects of aflatoxins were reviewed in the previous monograph (IARC, 1993). Aflatoxins cross the placental barrier, and there is some evi-dence that concentrations in cord blood are higher than those in maternal blood(Lamplugh et al. , 1988). Malformations and reduced fetal weight have been found in mice administered high doses (32-90 mg/kg bw) of aflatoxin intraperitoneally. Nocorresponding effect was seen after oral treatment (Tanimura et al. , 1982; Roll et al. , 1990). In rats, decreased fetal weight and behavioural changes, but not malformations,have been found at dose levels of around 2-7 mg/kg bw (Sharma & Sahai, 1987). 4.3.1 Humans Several studies have reported high levels of free aflatoxins in maternal and umbilical cord blood in humans living in areas where consumption of large amounts of food highlycontaminated with aflatoxins is suspected or has been demonstrated in previous studies.However, the chemical analysis in each study relied on a single method and the resultswere not confirmed by other means. A number of studies have reported effects in infants,AFLATOXINS 225but in most studies, various confounders were not controlled for and exposure levels were not investigated. Aflatoxins have been reported to occur in up to 40% of samples of breast milk collected from women in tropical Africa (Hendrickse, 1997) (see also Section 1.3.3( b)). Concentrations of aflatoxin M1were measured in breast milk of women from Victoria (Australia) and Thailand as a biomarker for exposure to aflatoxin B1. Afla- toxin M1was detected in 11 of 73 samples from Victoria (median concentration, 0.071 ng/mL) and in five of 11 samples from Thailand (median concentration,0.664 ng/mL) (El-Nezami et al. , 1995). In a survey of the occurrence of aflatoxins in mothers' breast milk carried out in Abu Dhabi and involving 445 donors, 99.5% of samples contained concentrations of afla-toxin M 1ranging from 2 pg/mL to 3 ng/mL (Saad et al., 1995). Maxwell (1998) reviewed the presence of aflatoxins in human body fluids and tissues in relation to child health in the tropics. In Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and SierraLeone, 25% of cord blood samples contained aflatoxins, primarily M 1and M2, in variable amounts (range for aflatoxin M1: 7 ng/L-65 g/L). Of 35 cord serum samples from 17 (48%) contained aflatoxin concen- trations of 0.064-13.6 nmol/mL (mean, By comparison, only two (6%) of35 maternal sera obtained immediately after birth of the child contained aflatoxin (mean,0.62 nmol/mL). These results demonstrate transplacental transfer and indicate thataflatoxin is concentrated by the feto-placental unit (Denning et al., 1990). A study of 480 children (aged 1-5 years) in Benin and Togo examined aflatoxin exposure in relation to growth parameters. Mean concentrations of aflatoxin-albuminadducts in the blood were 2.5-fold higher in fully weaned children than in those whowere still partially breast-fed. There was a strong negative correlation between afla-toxin-albumin adduct levels in the blood and both height-for-age (stunting) and weight-for-age (being underweight) compared with WHO reference population data after adjust-ment for age, sex, weaning status, socioeconomic status and geographical location. Thesedata suggest that aflatoxin may inhibit growth in West African children (Gong et al. , 2002). In a small study of the presence of aflatoxin in cord blood in Ibadan, Nigeria, a signi- ficant reduction in birth weight was found in jaundiced neonates, who had significantlyhigher serum aflatoxin concentrations compared with babies without jaundice (Abuluet al., 1998). In a study to investigate whether aflatoxins contribute to the occurrence of jaundice in Ibadan, blood samples were obtained from 327 jaundiced neonates and 60 non-jaundiced controls. Aflatoxins were detected in 24.7% of jaundiced neonates and in16.6% of controls. Analysis of the data indicated that either glucose-6-phosphatedehydrogenase deficiency or serum aflatoxin are risk factors for neonatal jaundice; oddsratios were significantly increased: et al., 1995).IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 226Aflatoxins were detected in 14 of 64 (37.8%) cord blood samples from jaundiced neonates compared with 9 of 60 (22.5%) samples from non-jaundiced control babies inanother study in Nigeria, but the difference was not statistically significant (Ahmedet al., 1995). Aflatoxins were detected in 37% of cord blood samples in a study of 125 pregnancies in rural Kenya, with 53% of maternal blood samples being aflatoxin-positive. There wasno correlation between aflatoxins in maternal and cord blood. A significantly lower meanbirth weight of infants born to aflatoxin-positive mothers was recorded for femalebabies, but not for males (De Vries et al., 1989). In cord blood collected from 625 babies in Nigeria, aflatoxins were detected in 14.6% of the samples. There was no significant difference in birth weight between thegroups positive or negative for aflatoxins (Maxwell et al., 1994). In a study of the presence of the imidazole ring-opened form of aflatoxin B 1-DNA adducts (see Figure 3) in placenta and cord blood, of 120 (57.5%) placentas containedthe adduct at 0.6-6.3 mol/mol DNA and 5 of 56 (8.9%) cord blood samples contained the adduct at 1.4-2.7 mol/mol DNA. The results indicate that transplacental transfer of aflatoxin B 1and its metabolites to the progeny is possible (Hsieh & Hsieh, 1993). A random sampling of semen from adult men, comprising 50 samples collected from infertile men and 50 samples from fertile men from the same community in Nigeria,revealed the presence of aflatoxin B 1in 40% of samples from infertile men compared with 8% in fertile men. The mean concentration of aflatoxins in semen of the infertilemen was significantly higher than that in semen of fertile men. Infertile men with afla-toxin in their semen showed a higher percentage of spermatozoal abnormalities (50%)than the fertile men (10-15%) (Ibeh et al., 1994). 4.3.2 Experimental systems (a)Developmental toxicity studies Behavioural effects were observed in offspring born to Jcl:Wistar rats given subcuta- neous injections of 0.3 mg/kg bw aflatoxin B1per day on gestation days 11-14 or 15-18. At birth, the number of live pups and their body weight were lower than those ofcontrols. There were no effects on maternal body weight during gestation or lactation.The exposure produced a delay in early response development, impaired locomotor coor-dination and impaired learning ability. Exposure on days 11-14 of gestation appeared toproduce more effects than later exposure (Kihara et al., 2000). Aflatoxin B 1produced embryonic mortality and decreased embryo weight and length when injected into embryonating chicken eggs. The number of abnormal embryos wasnot significantly increased (Edrington et al. , 1995). (b)Reproductive toxicity studies Effects suggesting severe impairment of fertility, i.e., reductions in ovarian and uterine size, increases in fetal resorption, disturbances of estrus cyclicity, inhibition ofAFLATOXINS 227lordosis and reduction in conception rates and litter sizes, were observed in Druckrey rats exposed to 7.5 mg/kg bw aflatoxin B1per day for 14 days. An aflatoxin B1blood concen- tration of 86.2 [ g/L] ppb was found the exposed animals (Ibeh & Saxena, 1997a). Female Druckrey rats were given oral doses of 7.5 or 15 mg/kg bw aflatoxin B1daily for 21 days. Dose-dependent reductions were seen in the number of oocytes and largefollicles. The blood hormone levels and sex organ weight were also disturbed (Ibeh &Saxena, 1997b). Male mature rabbits were given oral doses of 15 or 30 g/kg bw aflatoxin B 1every other day for nine weeks followed by a nine-week recovery period. Body weight, relativetestes weight, serum testosterone, ejaculate volume, sperm concentration and spermmotility were reduced and the number of abnormal sperm was increased in a dose-dependent manner. These effects continued during the recovery period. Simultaneoustreatment with ascorbic acid (20 mg/kg bw) alleviated the effects of exposure to afla-toxin B 1during the treatment and recovery period (Salem et al. , 2001). The reproductive performance of female mink (Mustela vison) given a diet contai- ning 5 or 10 ppb [ g/kg] total aflatoxins from naturally contaminated corn for 90 days was not impaired compared with a control group. Body weights of the kits were signifi-cantly decreased at the 10-ppb dose at birth and in both exposed groups at three weeksof age. Kit mortality was highest in the 10-ppb group and reached 33% by three weeksof age. In the 10-ppb dose group, analysis of milk samples showed very low concen-trations of aflatoxin metabolites (Aulerich et al. , 1993). In an experiment to determine the effects of aflatoxin B 1(2-16 ppb [ g/L] in medium) on the in-vitro fertilizing ability of oocytes and epididymal sperm of albino rats,a significant reduction of the mean number of oocytes fertilized was observed, as well asa significant decrease in sperm motility (Ibeh et al., 2000). 4.4 Genetic and related effects 4.4.1 Humans (a)General DNA and protein adducts of aflatoxin have been detected in many studies of human liver tissues and body fluids (IARC, 1993). Some studies related the level of adductsdetected to polymorphisms in metabolizing enzymes, in order to investigate interindivi-dual susceptibility to aflatoxin. Wild et al . (1993b) measured serum aflatoxin-albumin adducts in 117 Gambian children in relation to GSTM1 genotype and found no difference in adduct levels by genotype. In a larger study of 357 adults in the same population, aflatoxin-albumin adduct levels were examined in relation to genetic polymorphisms the GSTM1 , GSTT1 was associated with a modest increase in aflatoxin-albumin adduct levels and this effect was restrictedIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME by urinary cortisol metabolite ratios, was also not associated with adduct level. The main factors affectingthe level of aflatoxin-albumin adducts were place of residence (rural areas higher thanurban areas) and season of blood sample collection (dry season higher than wet season)(Wild et al. , 2000). Kensler et al . (1998) also found no association between afla- toxin-albumin adducts and GSTM1 genotype in 234 adults from Qidong County, China. The role of polymorphisms in the DNA repair enzyme, XRCC1, in influencing the levels of aflatoxin B 1-DNA adducts in samples of placental DNA was studied in women at a Taiwanese maternity clinic. The presence of at least one allele of polymorphism,399Gln, was associated with a two- to three-fold higher risk of having detectable afla-toxin B 1-DNA adducts compared with subjects homozygous for the 399Arg allele. However, when the association between and tertiles of adduct level wasexamined, the 399Gln allele was associated with intermediate but not high adduct levels.The authors suggested that this may reflect saturation of repair pathways (Lunn et al. , 1999). Studies of the types of genetic alteration associated with exposure to aflatoxin in vivo have been less extensive. In human subjects from Qidong County, China, aflatoxin expo-sure was determined as high or low (dichotomized around the population mean) by afla-toxin-albumin adduct level in serum and compared with the HPRT mutation frequency in lymphocytes. A raised HPRT mutant frequency was observed in subjects with high compared with low aflatoxin exposure (OR, 19; 95% CI, 2.0-183) (Wang et al., 1999b). The levels of chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei and sister chromatid exchange were studied in 35 Gambian adults, 32 of whom had measurable concentrations of afla-toxin-albumin adducts. There was no correlation within this group between thecytogenetic alterations and aflatoxin-albumin adducts in peripheral blood at the indivi-dual level. In a further study, blood samples of 29 individuals of the same Gambiangroup were tested for DNA damage in the single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assaybut no correlation was observed with aflatoxin-albumin adducts or GSTM1 genotype (Anderson et al., 1999). (b)TP53 mutations in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Molecular analyses of human HCC have revealed a high prevalence of an AGG to AGT (arg to ser) transversion at codon 249 of the TP53 tumour-suppressor gene (249ser mutation) in tumours from areas of the world with reported high aflatoxin exposure (Montesano et al., 1997). A large number of studies have been published since 1993 on aflatoxin exposure and TP53 mutations; two recent meta-analyses examined the relationship between aflatoxin exposure, HBV infection and TP53 mutations in 20 (Lasky & Magder, 1997) and in 48 published studies (Stern et al ., 2001). Table 15 summarizes the published data and the key findings are described below. [It is importantto note that the specificity of TP53 mutations in relation to aflatoxin exposure is asso- ciated only with G to T transversions at the third base of codon 249, whereas the meta-analysis by Stern et al. (2001) included a few G to T transversions in the second base ofAFLATOXINS 229IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 230 Table 15.

The authors of the meta-analyses pointed out that many studies, particularly the earlier ones, looked only for the presence or absence of the specific codon 249ser mutation and as a consequence may have overemphasized the importance of this parti-cular mutation among the total of TP53 mutations in HCC.] The vast majority of these studies have not directly assessed either population expo- sure or individual exposure to aflatoxin in relation to TP53 mutations. Instead, estimates were made from data on aflatoxin levels in food, frequency of consumption of thosefoods and extrapolation to expected aflatoxin levels based on climatic conditions likelyto promote aflatoxin production. This limits the interpretation of these data. Montesanoet al. (1997) attempted to use biomarker data on human exposure to provide information additional to the estimates based on geographical origin of the samples. Fujimoto et al. (1994) studied 25 HCC tissue samples from Qidong County, China, an area of high aflatoxin exposure, and nine HCC samples from Beijing with lower afla-toxin exposure. Thirteen of 25 tumours (52%) from Qidong carried the 249 sermutation, while none of the nine from Beijing did. Shimizu et al. (1999) studied 31 HCC tissue samples from different parts of the Jiang-su province. In the northern region of thisprovince, where aflatoxin exposure is expected to be lower, one of 15 (8%) tumoursshowed a 249 sermutation, while in the southern part, including Haimen City, nine of 16 (56%) HCC samples showed this mutation. Scorsone et al . (1992) found the 249ser mutation in 21 of 36 (58%) of HCC tumour tissue samples from Qidong. In contrast, of 26 HCC examined in Hong Kong, only one (4%) had the specific 249sermutation, although another tumour had a G to T transversion at the second nucleotide (Ng et al., 1994a,b).

(2001)samples from Hong Kong and in 4/20 (20%) from Shanghai. This mutation was not found in 16 samples from Japan and 17 from the USA, although there were other muta-tions in exon 7 in the Japanese samples. In areas of expected low aflatoxin exposure (including Japan, Republic of Korea, Europe and North America), the prevalence of codon 249 mutations is extremely low(< 1%) and even those that do occur tend to be at the second nucleotide rather than thethird. Oda et al. (1992) analysed 140 HCC tissue samples (128 Japanese, six Korean, four Indonesian and two Taiwanese); of these, only one Japanese and one Indonesianshowed the specific 249 sermutation. The limited information on residence and ethnicity in many studies has been commented upon (Laskey & Magder, 1997). Hollstein et al. (1993) adducts and liver afla- toxin B1-DNA adducts from 15 Thai patients, but only one had measurable concen- trations of albumin adducts in serum. In none of the samples were aflatoxin B1-DNA adducts found. Only one had the specific 249sermutation. In another study of 16 HCC cases from Mexico (Soini et al., 1996), three tumours contained the 249sermutation; of these, sera were available for two patients and both contained aflatoxin-albumin adducts.Aflatoxin-albumin adducts were detected in sera from all of a further 14 patients withoutthe mutation in the corresponding HCC. Since chronic HBV infection is a strong and specific risk factor for HCC and afla- toxin exposure commonly co-occurs with viral infection, it is important to examinewhether the 249 sermutation is seen only in the presence of chronic HBV infection. Although it is clear from the studies summarized below of HCC in North America,Europe and Japan that HBV alone does not induce the 249 sermutation, the high pre- valence of HBV infection in aflatoxin-endemic areas has made it hard to establishwhether both risk factors are required for the mutation to occur. Lasky and Madger (1997) summarized thirteen studies that both ascertained HBV status and analysed TP53 mutations. Data were available on 449 patients, of whom 201 were positive and 248 negative for HBV markers. The association between aflatoxinexposure and the 249 sermutation was still observed when the analysis was restricted to HBV-positive patients in the groups with high and low aflatoxin exposure. However, thenumber of HBV-negative patients with high aflatoxin exposure was too small to allow asimilar comparison in HBV-negative cases. Overall, it appears that the 249 sermutation related to aflatoxin exposure is not explained by any confounding introduced by possibleassociations between aflatoxin and HBV . It remains unclear at what stage in the natural history of HCC the TP53 mutation occurs. Some information is available from the analysis of histologically normal liversamples from patients resident in areas reportedly differing in aflatoxin exposure level.Aguilar et al. (1993, 1994) examined non-tumorous liver tissue from small numbers of HCC patients from Qidong (China), Thailand and the USA and demonstrated thepresence of TP53 AGG to AGT mutations (in codon 249) at a higher frequency in samples from China than in those from Thailand or the USA. By use of an allele-specificpolymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, Kirby et al. MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 232mutation in non-tumorous liver DNA from five of six HCC patients in Mozambique; none of seven samples from North American patients had a positive signal in the assay.These observations suggest that this type of mutation is found in histologically normalcells of patients with HCC. The TP53 249 sermutation has also been detected in blood samples from HCC patients, patients with cirrhosis and individuals without clinically diagnosed liverdisease. Kirk et al. (2000) compared 53 HCC patients, 13 patients with cirrhosis and 53 control subjects in The Gambia with 60 non-African French patients, 50 of whom hadHCC and 10 had cirrhosis. The 249 sermutation was detected by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-PCR in circulating DNA in plasma from 19 (36%) of theHCC patients, two (15%) cirrhosis patients and three (6%) of the African controlsubjects. The prevalence of the 249 sermutation did not differ between HBsAg-positive and -negative individuals. The mutation was not detected in any of the French plasmasamples. No tumour tissue was available from the Gambian patients and so the presenceof the same mutations in the corresponding HCC could not be confirmed. The detectionof the 249 sermutation in circulating DNA in the plasma of non-cancer patients again could reflect either an early neoplastic event or exposure to aflatoxin. Jackson et al. (2001) examined 20 paired plasma and HCC samples from patients from Qidong County, China, for the presence of the TP53 249sermutation analysed by short oligonucleotide mass spectrometry. Eleven tumours were positive for the mutationand the same mutation was detected in six of the paired plasma samples. An additionalfour plasma samples were positive for the mutation in the absence of a detectable muta-tion in the corresponding tumour. The authors suggested that this might be due to othernon-sampled HCCs in those patients. In contrast to the findings of Aguilar et al. (1993), no 249 sermutations were detected in DNA from normal tissue adjacent to the HCC. (c)Other genetic alterations in human HCC It would be unexpected if aflatoxin carcinogenesis were exclusively associated with a specific TP53 mutation, given the multiple genetic alterations observed in human HCC. Consequently, several studies have tested the hypothesis that aflatoxin exposure isassociated with other specific genetic alterations. In the study by Fujimoto et al. (1994) described above, while the 249 sermutation was more frequent in samples from Qidong than in those from Beijing, additional differenceswere found in the pattern of loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Specifically, in tumours fromQidong, four of 14 informative cases (28%) showed LOH on chromosome 4 (4p11-q21)and nine of 10 (90%) and 11 of 19 (58%) showed LOH on chromosome 16q22.1 and16q22-24, respectively. In contrast, none of six informative cases from Beijing showedLOH at 16q22-24 and none of five at 4p11-q21. Wong et al . (2000) studied 83 HCC samples from patients undergoing curative resection. Of these, 50 were from China (30 from Hong Kong, 20 from Shanghai), 16from Japan and 17 from the USA. The Chinese subjects were all HBV-positive, theJapanese patients were HCV-positive and the patients from the USA were HBV-negative.AFLATOXINS 233In eight subjects (four from Hong Kong and four from Shanghai), single-strand confor- mation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing of exons 5 to 9 of the TP53 gene revealed the 249sermutation. However, the authors also performed comparative genomic hybridization. In HCC from Shanghai, there were significantly more alterationsper sample in these HBV-related cases than in those from Hong Kong or in the HCCsfrom Japan and the USA; approximately double the number of alterations per sample wasobserved in Shanghai compared with Hong Kong. The most frequent changes respon-sible for this increase were deletions on chromosomes 4q, 8p and 16q and gain of 5p. Theauthors suggested that this might reflect broader genetic effects of aflatoxin than simplythe 249 sermutation in the TP53 gene. These studies show that, in addition to TP53 mutations, geographical location may influence other genetic alterations in HCC, but the data are insufficient to ascribe any ofthese specifically to aflatoxin exposure. 4.4.2 Experimental systems (a)General Aflatoxin B1induces mutations in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 DNA synthesis, chromosomal aberrations, sister chromatid exchange,micronucleus and in-vivo and in-vitro mamma-lian systems (IARC, 1993; for references and details on results published since 1993, seeTable 16). Aflatoxin B 1can induce mitotic recombination in addition to point mutations. This has been demonstrated in both yeast and mammalian cells. In human lymphoblastoidcells, aflatoxin B 1treatment led to mitotic recombination and LOH. A reversion assay demonstrated aflatoxin B1-induced intrachromosomal recombination in a mutant cell line derived from V79 cells harbouring an inactivating tandem duplication in the Hprt gene. Aflatoxin B1also induced recombination in minisatellite sequences in yeast expressing recombinant human CYP1A2. In addition, liver tumours derived from HBV-transgenic mice treated with aflatoxin B 1transplacentally contained rearrangements in minisatellite sequences, but no such alterations were observed in tumours from HBV-transgenic mice not exposed to aflatoxin B 1(Kaplanski et al., 1997). This suggests that aflatoxin can promote genetic instability in addition to point mutations. Mitotic recom-bination and genetic instability may therefore be alternative mechanisms by which afla-toxin contributes to genetic alterations such as LOH in HCC (see Section 4.4.1( c)). As expected, aflatoxin B 1is significantly more mutagenic following metabolic acti- TA98 and TA100 without S9 was approximately 1000 times lower than in the presence of S9. Splenic lymphocytes were examined for mutant frequency at the Hprt locus in Fischer 344 rats exposed to aflatoxin B1. Hprt mutants (frequency, 19.4-31.0 \u00d710-6) were induced after a three-week exposure of male Fischer 344 rats to aflatoxin B1by repeated intragastric dosing to a total dose of 1500 g/kg bw.

In an intermittent feeding trial, Fischer 344 rats (aged four weeks at the start of the trial) were exposed either to ( a) control diet, ( b) various concentrations of aflatoxin B1 (0.01, 0.10, 0.04, 0.4 or 1.6 ppm [mg/kg]) in the diet for three four-week periods sepa- rated by four-week periods of control diet or ( c) a tumorigenic dose of aflatoxin B1 (1.6 ppm) in the diet continuously for 20 weeks. A dose-dependent increase in the Hprt mutant frequency in splenic lymphocytes was observed after the second four-weekfeeding period. This effect was further enhanced after the third four-week feeding period,at which time a particularly strong response was observed with the 0.4-ppm dose (meanmutant frequency > 70 \u00d710 -6). These results may be explained by accumulation of DNA damage in splenic lymphocyte DNA (Morris et al. , 1999). The species differences in susceptibility to the toxic and carcinogenic effects of afla- toxins (Section 4.1.2) are reflected in the differing activities of microsomal preparationsto produce genetic damage following aflatoxin treatment. Human, mouse and rat liverpreparations were used to activate aflatoxin B 1and the induction of sister chromatid exchange in human mononuclear leukocytes was examined. In leukocytes treated withaflatoxin B 1activated by human liver microsomes from six different donors, there was a 10-fold interindividual variation in the mean number (1.1-11.6) of sister chromatidexchanges per cell. The induction of chromatid exchange was correlated withCYP1A2 phenotype (using model substrates) in the same with GSTM1 genotype or epoxide hydrolase phenotype. Mouse microsomes were more effective thanrat or human at activating aflatoxin B 1to induce sister chromatid exchange. The addition of mouse but not human or rat liver cytosol reduced aflatoxin B1-induced genotoxicity (Wilson et al. assays ovary the Hprt gene in Chinese hamster ovary K1BH4 cells were performed with aflatoxin B1metabolized by liver S9 either from chick embryos or rats; the effect of coumarin as a chemoprotectant was also examined. In theGptassay, 1 M aflatoxin B 1induced 25-fold more mutants when chick S9 was used than with rat S9. Coumarin (50 and 500 M) decreased the mutant frequency by 52 and 88% with the chick embryo-activated aflatoxin B1but had no effect on the frequency following activation with rat S9. In K1BH4cells, a dose of 1 M aflatoxin B1induced approximately sixfold more Hprt mutants per 106clonable cells when activated by chick embryo than by rat liver S9 (Goeger et al. , 1998). Male rats and mice were treated with single doses of aflatoxin B1(0.01-1.0 mg/kg bw) and the frequency of chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei in bone marrow andthe amount of aflatoxin B 1-albumin adducts in peripheral blood were measured. In rats, both chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei showed increased frequency at dosesabove 0.1 mg/kg, whereas in mice only a slight increase in chromosomal aberrations wasseen with the highest dose (1.0 mg/kg) and no effect on micronuclei was detected. In B1-albumin adduct levels were correlated with chromosomal aberrations at the individual level (Anwar et al., 1994). Mutations in vivo were also studied in lambda/ lacI(Big Blue\u00ae) transgenic C57BL/6 mice and Fischer 344 rats treated with aflatoxin B1. Six mice were given a single intra- peritoneal injection of 2.5 mg/kg bw aflatoxin B1but no mutations were detected in the liver 14 days after treatment. In contrast, in six rats treated with 0.25 mg/kg bw afla-toxin B 1, there was a nearly 20-fold increase in mutant frequency (mean, 49 \u00d710-5) com- pared with controls. In mutated lacIDNA isolated from rats treated with aflatoxin B1, the predominant mutations (78%) were GC to TA transversions, compared with 11% ofspontaneous mutations of this type in control rats. Of the G to T transversions in thetreated rats, 71% were at CpG sites. In particular, 5 -GCG G-3and 5 -CCG C-3 sequences were hotspots (target G underlined) (Dycaico et al., 1996). Transgenic mice were developed carrying both the human CYP3A7 gene, expressed in the small intestine but not kidney, and the rspL gene from Escherichia coli as a target for mutations. Microsomal preparations from the small intestine of these transgenic micehad higher capacity to convert aflatoxin B 1to a mutagen in the Ames test with Salmo- nella typhimurium TA98 strain than did kidney microsomes from the same mice or small intestine and kidney microsomes from non-transgenic mice. In addition, the target rspL gene in mice carrying the CYP3A7 transgene contained a significantly higher mutation frequency in the small intestine than kidney or than either organ in mice non-transgenicfor CYP3A7 (Yamada et al., 1998). A number of differences have been reported in metabolic activity of S9 fractions from organs other than liver. Ball et al. (1995) compared the ability of tracheal and lung S9 from rabbit (male, New Zealand white), hamster (male Syrian golden) and rat (maleSprague Dawley) to induce aflatoxin B 1mutations in the TA98 strain of Salmonella typhimurium . Trachea from hamster and rabbit and lung from rabbit showed a positive response in the assay. In hamsters, trachea S9 was more efficient than lung S9 inproducing aflatoxin B 1-induced mutations, while in rabbits the opposite was true. (b)TP53 mutations in animal tumours In order to test the plausibility of an association between aflatoxin exposure and TP53 mutations, HCC or preneoplastic lesions from several species have been examined for mutations at the codon corresponding to codon 249 in humans, referred to as 'codon249 equivalent' (Wild & Kleihues, 1996). In contrast to the specific mutations found in human HCC from areas with high expo- sure to aflatoxin, no G to T transversions in 'codon 249 equivalent' have been identifiedin animal tumours. Two major limitations to making a valid comparison are the differentDNA sequences in this region of the TP53 gene across species and the relatively few animal tumours analysed. In ducks, for example, the third nucleotide is not a guanine buta cytosine and no mutations were observed at 'codon 249 equivalent' (Duflot et al ., 1994). In all the non-primates studied, codon sequences with any base following CGwould lead to a silent mutation at the third nucleotide, each base change resulting inIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 HCC did not carry any mutation at codon 249, but only four HCC (two from one animal) were analysed (Fujimoto et al., 1992). Preneoplastic lesions have been examined to define the time point in the natural history of HCC when the TP53 mutation occurs. Hulla et al. (1993) examined six hyper- plastic nodules from rat liver following intraperitoneal treatment with 150 g/kg afla- toxin B1for 10 days (2 \u00d75 days with a two-day break in between, followed by partial hepatectomy three weeks later and sacrifice after a further three weeks) and found nomutations at the codon 249 equivalent. Female AC3F 1(A/J [numbers unspecified], weeks of age, received intraperitoneal injections of aflatoxin B1three times per week for eight weeks (total dose, 150 mg/kg bw). Mice were killed between 6 and 14 months later. Of the 71lung tumours examined, 79% showed positive nuclear p53 staining. SSCP analysis ofmicrodissected tumour samples revealed mutations in different codons in exons 5, 6and 7. Direct sequencing showed 26 mutations which included nine G:C to A:T transi-tions, 11 A:T to G:C two T:A to A:Tand one A:T to C:G). The high mutation frequency and heterogeneous staining patternsuggested that TP53 mutations occur relatively late in aflatoxin B 1-induced mouse lung tumorigenesis (Tam et al., 1999). Lee et al. (1998) treated 10 male Sprague-Dawley rats with 37.5 g aflatoxin B1five times per week for eight weeks by gavage and a further 20 with the same treatment afterpartial hepatectomy. Of the latter group, 13 of 17 rats that survived to 60 weeks aftertreatment had either liver tumours (5), preneoplastic nodules (7) or both (1). Of the sixsurviving rats from the group that received aflatoxin B 1alone, two had liver tumours, one had liver focal lesions and one had both. All rats were killed at 60 weeks and livertumours and preneoplastic lesions were excised. A total of 19 abnormal liver specimenswere obtained (10 liver focal lesions and nine liver tumours). The PCR SSCP methodwas used to screen the five rat livers (29%) exhibited abnormal conforma- tional polymorphisms, all five being from the group receiving aflatoxin B 1after partial hepatectomy. No TP53 alterations were detected in four samples from the group that received aflatoxin B1alone. One liver tumour contained a silent mutation at codon 247 (CGG to CGT, Arg to Arg). Aflatoxin B1activated with quail liver microsomes transformed BL9 rat epithelial cells in vitro and these transformed cells induced liver tumours in nude mice. However, the tumours did not contain mutations in codons 242-244 of the TP53 gene (spanning the equivalent to codon 249 in human TP53 ) (Stanley shrews ( Tupaia ), which can be infected human HBV , were used to study aflatoxin B1-induced mutations in the presence or absence of viral infection. Park et al. (2000) studied eight tree shrews, four infected with HBV at 12 weeks of age and four not infected. Two of the uninfected and all four infected animalswere treated with 400 g/kg bw aflatoxin B 1per day for six days. Five liver tumours were detected upon sacrifice at age 2-3 years, four from HBV- and aflatoxin-treatedAFLATOXINS 239animals and one from one of the two animals receiving aflatoxin B1alone. No specific TP53 mutations were observed in relation to the codon 249 hotspot. TP53 mutations in extrahepatic tumours induced by aflatoxin have been rarely studied. Two cholangiocarcinomas, a spindle-cell carcinoma of the bile duct, a haeman-gioendothelial sarcoma of the liver sarcoma of the tibia from rhesusand cynomolgus monkeys aflatoxin B 1were analysed (Fujimoto et al ., 1992), but no codon 249 mutations were found. Lung tumours induced in female AC3F1 mice by 150 mg/kg bw aflatoxin B1(divided into 24 doses over eight weeks) were microdissected and TP53 mutations were shown to be frequent events by SSCP and direct sequencing. Most mutations were base substitutions of different types and thesewere distributed across exons 5-7 of the gene (Tam et al., 1999). Lung cells isolated from AC3F 1mice seven weeks after treatment with aflatoxin B1 (2\u00d750 mg/kg bw, given two weeks apart) were examined for point mutations in the Ki- rasgene. Ki- ras mutant alleles were detected in Clara cells but not in other enriched cell fractions. This result indicates the susceptibility of Clara cells to Ki- rasactivation, an early event in aflatoxin B1-induced mouse lung tumorigenesis (Donnelly & Massey, 1999). (c)Sequence-specific binding to DNA and induction of mutations Aflatoxin B1is metabolically activated to its 8,9- exo-epoxide, which reacts to form the 8,9-dihydro-8-( N7-guanyl)-9-hydroxy aflatoxin B1(AFB1-N7-Gua) adduct (see Section 4.1.2). ring of the guanine adductpromotes depurination and consequently, apurinic site formation. Under slightly alkalineconditions, the imidazole ring of AFB 1-N7-Gua is opened and forms a more stable and persistent ring-opened aflatoxin B1-formamidopyrimidine adduct. Investigations have been conducted to establish which is the most likely precursor of the mutations inducedby aflatoxin B 1. The mutations induced by aflatoxin B1in a number of experimental systems are certainly consistent with the main carcinogen binding occurring at guanine in DNA,leading to G to T transversions (IARC, 1993). When a pS189 shuttle vector was afla-toxin B 1-modified and then replicated in human Ad293 cells, predominantly G to T trans- versions were detected (Trottier et al., 1992). However, other types of mutation have also been observed with aflatoxin B1. Levy et al. (1992) transfected an aflatoxin B1-modified shuttle vector into DNA repair-deficient (XP) or -proficient human fibroblasts, and exa-mined mutations in the supF marker gene. Higher mutation frequencies were observed in the DNA repair-deficient cells and the location of mutations was significantly affectedby repair proficiency. The majority of mutations were at GC base pairs: 50-70% were Gto T transversions, but G to C transversions and G to A transitions were also frequent. Apolymerase stop assay was used to examine the location of aflatoxin B 1binding within the shuttle vector, but no strong correlation was found between initial binding sites andsubsequent hotspots for mutation. This suggests that the processing of the adducts, e.g.,IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 240during DNA replication and repair, can influence not only the overall mutation frequency but also the distribution of mutations. An intrasanguineous host-mediated assay was used to determine the pattern of muta- genesis induced by aflatoxin B1in the lacI gene of E. coli bacteria recovered from rat liver. Most of the 281 mutations analysed were base substitutions at GC base pairs; overhalf were GC to TA transversions, with other mutations evenly divided between GC toAT transitions and GC to CG transversions (Prieto-Alamo et al., 1996). In a human lymphoblastoid cell line (h1A2v2) expressing recombinant human CYP1A1 enzyme, aflatoxin B 1(4 ng/mL; 25 h) produced a hotspot GC to TA trans- version mutation at base pair 209 in exon 3 of the HPRT gene in 10-17% of all mutants (Cariello et al ., 1994). This hotspot occurred at a GGG GGG sequence (target base underlined). Bailey et al. (1996) studied the induction of mutations with two of the principal forms of DNA damage induced by aflatoxin B1, namely the AFB1-N7-Gua adduct and the consequent apurinic sites, by adduct or an apurinic site was used to transform E. coli . The predominant mutations with AFB1-N7-Gua were G to T trans- versions targeted to the site of the original adduct (approximately 74%), with lowerfrequencies of G to A transitions (13-18%) and G to C transversions (1-3%). UsingE. coli strains differing in biochemical activity of UmuDC and MucAB \u2014 proteins involved in processing of apurinic sites by insertion of dAMP \u2014 the authors showed thatthe mutations observed with the AFB 1-N7-Gua were not predominantly a simple result of depurination of the initial adduct. A significant number of base substitutions werelocated at the base 5 to the site of the original adduct, representing around 13% of the total mutations. This induction of mutations at the base adjacent to the original site ofdamage was not observed with apurinic sites as the mutagenic lesion. This was suggestedto reflect interference with DNA replication following the intercalation of aflatoxin B 1 8,9-epoxide (Gopalakrishnan et al., 1990). Earlier studies suggested general sequence preferences for aflatoxin B1binding dependent on the target guanine being located in a sequence of guanines or with a 5 cytosine (IARC, 1993). The base 3 to the modified G appears less consistently predictive of reactivity. Results on sequence-specific binding have been reviewed (Smelaet al., 2001). In this context, the question has been raised as to whether cytosine methyl- ation affects the binding of aflatoxin B 1. Ross et al. (1999) examined the effect of CpG methylation on binding of aflatoxin B18,9-epoxide to an 11-mer oligodeoxynucleotide containing the sequence of codons 248 and 249 of the TP53 gene (see Section 4.4.1( b)). Binding to methylated or unmethylated fragments of the human HPRT gene was also investigated. In neither instance did cytosine methylation affect aflatoxin B1binding to guanines within the sequence. In contrast, Chen et al. (1998) reported strongly enhanced binding of aflatoxin B1to methylated compared with non-methylated CpG sites in TP53 mutational hotspots, including codon 248, using an UvrABC incision method. TheAFLATOXINS 241difference between the two studies could reflect the different methods, sequence contexts of the target bases or the methods used to detect DNA adducts (Ross et al., 1999). 4.5 Mechanistic considerations 4.5.1 Specificity of 249sermutation in the TP53 gene A number of experimental approaches have been used to examine the plausibility of a causal link between aflatoxin-induced DNA damage and the common AGG to AGTtransversion mutation at codon 249 of the TP53 gene in human HCC from areas where aflatoxin exposure is high. Analysis of TP53 mutations induced by aflatoxin B 1reveals that G to T transversion is the most common base substitution (see Section 4.4.1( b)). A number of studies have examined the sequence specificity of the induction of either DNAdamage or mutations in the TP53 gene 1991; Aguilar et al ., 1993; Denissenko et al., 1998, 1999). In these experimental systems, aflatoxin B 1induces both damage and mutations at the third nucleotide of codon 249, with some evidence of prefe-rential targeting of this latter site in comparison to the adjacent guanine (second nucleo-tide of codon 249) or guanines in surrounding codons. However, the degree of targetingto codon 249 does not appear to be sufficient by itself to explain the mutational specifi-city observed in human HCC. Aflatoxin B 1-DNA adducts at other sites within the TP53 gene would also induce G to T transversions, with alterations of amino acids and asso-ciated changes in p53 protein function, but these mutations are far rarer than the codon249 sermutation in HCC from areas where aflatoxin exposure is high. The possible effect of the codon 249sermutation on p53 protein function and any selective growth advantage conferred on hepatocytes carrying this mutation is also ofimportance. Overall, the codon 249 sermutation in TP53 appears insufficient to immor- talize human hepatocyte cells in culture, but it does confer a growth advantage topreviously immortalized cells (Ponchel et al., 1994; Forrester et al., 1995; Schleger et al., 1999). These cell culture studies are consistent with a selective growth advantageresulting from the codon 249 sermutation, but do not fully explain the high prevalence of this mutation in the TP53 gene in human HCC. However, in-vitro studies generally do not address the role of the mutation in the intact tissue and the studies mentioned abovedid not assess the role of co-infection with HBV and its possible influence on both theinduction and clonal selection of TP53 codon 249 sermutations. Sohn et al. (2000) trans- fected human liver epithelial cells with the HBx gene \u2014 encoding the HBVx protein \u2014 and these cells were more sensitive to the cytotoxic action of aflatoxin B18,9-epoxide and to induction of apoptosis and mutations at codon 249, possibly as a result of alteredexcision repair of the aflatoxin B 1-DNA adduct (Hussain & Harris, 2000).IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 2424.5.2 Modulation of the effects of aflatoxin with chemopreventive agents The understanding of human metabolism of aflatoxin B1(see Section 4.1) and the extensive literature on chemoprevention of aflatoxin B1-induced carcinogenesis in experimental animals have provided a rationale for chemoprevention studies in humanpopulations (Kensler et al., 1999). Notably, agents that induce hepatic GST and aflatoxin aldehyde reductase (AFAR) in rats give rise to decreased aflatoxin-DNA and -proteinadduct formation and inhibition of aflatoxin-associated carcinogenicity (Roebuck et al., Groopman et al., 1993; Kensler et al., 1997; Groopman & Kensler, 1999). Consequently, a similar modulation of the balance between aflatoxinactivation and detoxification in humans has been sought and two chemopreventiveagents, oltipraz and chlorophyllin, have been evaluated in clinical trials in China. The protective action of oltipraz is based on inhibition of the enzyme CYP1A2, resulting in reduced formation of the aflatoxin B 18,9-epoxide and aflatoxin M1, and induction of GST enzymes, resulting in increased excretion of the 8,9-epoxide gluta-thione conjugate as a mercapturic acid (Morel et al., 1993; Langou\u00ebt et al., 1995). In Chinese subjects exposed to aflatoxin through consumption of their regular diet,concurrent dietary intake of oltipraz was shown to modulate aflatoxin metabolism byincreasing excretion of the mercapturic acid and decreasing urinary aflatoxin M 1concen- trations and blood aflatoxin-albumin levels (Jacobson et al., 1997; Kensler et al., 1998; Wang et al., 1999a). Chlorophyllin is an anti-mutagen in genotoxicity assays in vitro and in vivo (Dashwood et al ., 1998). Mechanistic studies of aflatoxin B1-induced hepatocarcino- genesis in rainbow trout have revealed that chlorophyllin acts as an 'interceptor mole-cule' through the formation of tight molecular complexes with aflatoxin B 1(Breinholt et al., 1995). Consequently, it may diminish the bioavailability of aflatoxin B1, leading to reduced DNA-adduct formation and tumour development (Breinholt et al ., 1999). Chlorophyllin has also been evaluated in a chemoprevention trial in China and consump-tion of 100 mg of this compound at each meal during four months led to an overallreduction of 55% ( p= 0.036) in median urinary AFB 1N7-Gua com- pared with placebo controls (Egner et al., 2001). The above clinical trials confirm that aflatoxin metabolism occurring in people exposed to the toxin through the diet is consistent with the metabolic pathways deducedfrom in vitro and animal model studies. These trials also provide proof of principle that aflatoxin metabolism can be modulated in vivo to reduce genotoxic damage; this provides a basis for prevention strategies through dietary modulation. 4.5.3 Interactions of hepatitis B virus and aflatoxins In countries with a high incidence of HCC, endemic infection with HBV is often associated with exposure to aflatoxins. Prospective cohort studies from Asia haveobserved a multiplicative increase in risk for HCC in individuals chronically infectedwith HBV and exposed to dietary aflatoxins (see Section 2). Experimental studies inAFLATOXINS 243HBV-transgenic mice and woodchucks also suggest a synergism between the two risk factors in the induction of HCC (Sell et al. , 1991; Bannasch et al. , 1995). An under- standing of the molecular mechanisms behind this interaction is relevant to public healthmeasures aimed at reducing HCC incidence. These mechanisms are considered brieflybelow; for more detailed information, the reader is referred to a number of review articles(Harris & Sun, 1986; Wild et al., 1993a,b; JECFA, 1998; Sylla et al., 1999; Wild & Hall, 1999). One possible mechanism of interaction between the virus and the chemical carci- nogen is HBV infection altering the expression of aflatoxin-metabolizing enzymes. Thishas been addressed most extensively in HBV-transgenic mouse lineages carrying thegene for HBsAg, where CYP isozymes, namely 1A and association al. , 1996; Kirby et 1994a), but only in lineages in which transgene expression was associated with induction of liver injury (Chomarat et al., 1998; Chemin et al., 1999). Similar induc- tion of CYP enzymes is observed with liver injury associated with bacterial and parasiticinfections (Kirby et al. , 1994b; Chomarat et al. , 1997), suggesting a general mechanism involving liver injury per se rather than a specific effect of HBV on enzyme expression. The modifying effects of HBV-related transgene expression are not limited to CYPenzymes but also include effects on GST enzymes (Chemin et al., 1999). Kirby et al. (1996a) showed increased CYP2A6 and CYP3A4 activity in human liver in relation tohepatitis infection. Human liver specimens with evidence of HBV infection had signifi-cantly lower total GST activity than non-infected livers (Zhou et al. , 1997). In HBV- transfected HepG2 human hepatoma cells, expression of GST -class enzymes was significantly decreased (Jaitovitch-Groisman et al., 2000). Some studies have examined aflatoxin metabolism in HBV-infected individuals exposed to the toxin through the diet. Cortisol metabolism was measured as a marker ofCYP3A4 activity in relation to aflatoxin-albumin adducts in 357 Gambian adults. Noassociation was observed between CYP3A4 activity and either HBV infection status oradduct levels. The level of aflatoxin-albumin adduct was not related to the HBV statusof the individual, including HBV DNA and HBe antigen, which are markers of activeviral replication. In addition, there was no correlation between adducts and serum trans-aminases, markers of liver injury (Wild et al., 2000). In a study of nine adult Gambian HBV carriers and 11 non-carriers with measured dietary intakes of aflatoxin, nodifferences in levels of urinary aflatoxin-DNA adducts were observed between the twogroups (Groopman et al., 1992). These data suggest that the aflatoxin-albumin and uri- nary aflatoxin-DNA adducts are not influenced by HBV infection in adults. In contrast,in HBV-infected Gambian children there was a higher level of aflatoxin-albumin adductsthan in non-infected children, an observation consistent with altered aflatoxin meta-bolism (Allen et al. , 1992; Turner et al ., 2000). Similar observations of higher afla- toxin-albumin adduct levels in HBsAg carriers have been reported in a study of 200Chinese adolescents (Chen et al., 2001).IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 244Thus overall, there is potential for HBV infection to modulate aflatoxin metabolism but the effects are likely to be complex, involving the possibility of both altered acti-vation and detoxification. An alternative mechanism of interaction between HBV and aflatoxin is that carci- nogen exposure may modulate the course of viral infection and replication. In ducklingsinfected with duck hepatitis virus and treated with aflatoxin B 1, there was a significant increase in markers of viral replication in liver and serum (Barraud et al. , 1999, 2000), supporting the hypothesis that aflatoxins can enhance hepadnaviral gene expression.Human hepatoma HepG2 cells transfected with HBV and treated with aflatoxin B 1also showed an increase in the concentration of transcription factors that may influence HBVexpression (Banerjee et al., 2000). A further hypothesis for the probable interaction of the two risk factors is that the DNA adducts formed by aflatoxin are more likely to be fixed as mutations in thepresence of the increased cell proliferation induced by chronic HBV infection. In summary, plausible mechanisms of interaction between aflatoxins and HBV exist, but to date no conclusion can be drawn as to the most relevant mechanism in terms ofthe synergistic effects observed in epidemiological studies. 5. Summary of Data Reported 5.1 Exposure data Aflatoxins are a family of fungal toxins produced mainly by two Aspergillus species which are especially abundant in areas of the world with hot, humid climates. Aspergillus flavus , which is ubiquitous, produces B aflatoxins. A. parasiticus , which produces both B and G aflatoxins, has more limited distribution. Major crops in which aflatoxins areproduced are peanuts, maize and cottonseed, crops with which A. flavus has a close asso- ciation. Human exposure to aflatoxins at levels of nanograms to micrograms per dayoccurs mainly through consumption of maize and peanuts, which are dietary staples insome tropical countries. Maize is also frequently contaminated with fumonisins. Afla-toxin M 1is a metabolite of aflatoxin B1in humans and animals. Human exposure to afla- toxin M1at levels of nanograms per day occurs mainly through consumption of afla- toxin-contaminated milk, including mothers' milk. Measurement of biomarkers is beingused increasingly to confirm and quantify exposure to aflatoxins. 5.2 Human carcinogenicity data Studies evaluated in V olume 56 of the IARC Monographs led to the classification of naturally occurring aflatoxins as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) . Recent studies have incorporated improvements in study design, study size and accuracy of measurement ofmarkers of exposure to aflatoxin and hepatitis viruses.AFLATOXINS 245In a large cohort study in Shanghai, China, risk for hepatocellular carcinoma was elevated among people with aflatoxin metabolites in urine, after adjustment for cigarettesmoking and hepatitis B surface antigen positivity. No association was observed betweendietary aflatoxin levels, as ascertained by a diet frequency questionnaire, and risk forhepatocellular carcinoma. There were four reports from cohort studies in Taiwan, China, although three of them partly overlapped. Selected subjects in the three overlapping studies were enrolled, wereinterviewed, had biological specimens taken, and were followed up intensively for livercancer. In nested case-control studies, including some prevalent cases, subjects withexposure to aflatoxin, as assessed by biomarker measurements, had elevated risks forliver cancer, after adjustment for hepatitis B surface antigen positivity. The effect due toaflatoxin exposure was especially high among those who were positive for hepatitis Bsurface antigen, but there were few liver cancer cases negative for hepatitis B surfaceantigen. The other Taiwan study was carried out in a large cohort of chronic carriers ofhepatitis B virus. These subjects were interviewed at baseline, had biological specimenstaken, and were followed up intensively for liver cancer. Several aflatoxin metabolitesand albumin adducts were measured in a nested case-control series. Subjects with quan-tified levels of most of the biomarkers of exposure to aflatoxin showed elevated risk forliver cancer. In two studies in Qidong, China, cohorts of hepatitis B carriers were tested for bio- markers of aflatoxin and followed up for liver cancer. In both studies, subjects with afla-toxin biomarkers had excess risks for liver cancer. In a Sudanese case-control study of liver cancer, a relationship was found between reported ingestion of peanut butter and liver cancer in a region with high aflatoxin conta-mination of peanuts, but no such relationship in a region with low contamination ofpeanuts. In a hybrid ecological cross-sectional study in Taiwan, China, a number of subjects were selected from eight regions; for each subject several biomarkers of aflatoxin andhepatitis B viral infection were assessed in relation to the liver cancer rates in the regionof residence. There were correlations between aflatoxin metabolites and liver cancerrates after adjustment for hepatitis B status. The overall body of evidence supports a role of aflatoxins in liver cancer etiology, notably among subjects who are carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen. Nevertheless, theinterpretation of human studies is hampered by the difficulties in properly assessing anindividual's lifetime exposure to aflatoxins and the difficulties in disentangling theeffects of aflatoxins from those of hepatitis infections. Novel biomarkers, some stillunder development and validation, should bring greater clarity to the issue. 5.3 Animal carcinogenicity data Extensive experimental studies on the carcinogenicity of aflatoxins led to a previous IARC Monographs evaluation of the evidence as follows: sufficient evidence for carcino-IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 246genicity of naturally occurring mixtures of aflatoxins and of aflatoxins B1, G1and M1, limited evidence for aflatoxin B2and inadequate evidence for aflatoxin G2. The principal tumours induced were liver tumours. Carcinogenicity studies in experimental animals since 1993 were limited to a few experiments in rats, trout, mice, tree shrews and woodchucks. Under certain conditions,including increased pressure, decontamination of feed containing aflatoxins by ammo-niation almost completely eliminated the induction of hepatic tumours in rats. Studies introut showed that ammoniation of aflatoxin-contaminated maize significantly reducedthe incidence of liver tumours. In trout fed non-fat dried milk from cows fed ammoniatedor non-ammoniated aflatoxin-contaminated whole Less hepatic tumours were induced in trout afterexposure to aflatoxin M 1than with aflatoxin B1. One aflatoxin metabolite, aflatoxicol, elicited a slightly higher hepatic tumour response in fry and fish embryos than afla-toxin B 1. A study in transgenic mice overexpressing transforming growth factor showed no increased susceptibility to induction of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas afterintraperitoneal administration of aflatoxin B 1. In another study, induction of hepato- cellular tumours by aflatoxin B1was significantly enhanced in transgenic mice hetero- zygous for the TP53 gene and expressing hepatitis B surface antigen. The tumour response for aflatoxin B1was reduced in the absence of either one of these risk factors. The presence of the TP53 246sermutant not only enhanced the synergistic effect of hepa- titis B virus and aflatoxin B1but also increased tumorigenesis due to aflatoxin B1in the absence of hepatitis B virus. In tree shrews, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas was significantly increased and the time of occurrence was shortened in animals treated with aflatoxin B1 and infected with (human) hepatitis B virus compared with aflatoxin B1-treated animals. Woodchucks infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus were more sensitive to the carcino-genic effects of aflatoxin B 1than uninfected woodchucks. The combined woodchuck hepatitis virus/aflatoxin B1 treatment not only reduced the time of appearance but also resulted in a higher incidence of liver tumours. In conclusion, recent studies continue to confirm the carcinogenicity of aflatoxins in experimental animals. 5.4 Other relevant data Metabolism of aflatoxin B1in humans has been well characterized, with activation to aflatoxin B18,9-exo-epoxide resulting in DNA adduct formation. CYP1A2, 3A4, 3A5, 3A7 and GSTM1 enzymes among others mediate metabolism in humans. The expressionof these enzymes can be modulated with chemopreventive agents, resulting in inhibitionof DNA-adduct formation and hepatocarcinogenesis in Oltipraz is a agent that increases glutathione conjugation and inhibits some cytochromeP450 enzymes. Results from clinical trials in China using oltipraz are consistent withAFLATOXINS 247experimental data in showing that, following dietary exposure to aflatoxins, modulation of the metabolism of aflatoxins can lead to reduced levels of DNA adducts. Aflatoxin B1is immunosuppressive in animals, with particularly strong effects on cell-mediated immunity. Exposure to aflatoxin results in increased susceptibility tobacterial and parasitic infections. Human monocytes treated with aflatoxin B 1had impaired phagocytic and microbicidal activity and decreases in specific cytokinesecretion. Studies have linked human exposure to aflatoxins to increased prevalence ofinfection. Aflatoxins cross the human placenta. Aflatoxin exposure has been associated with growth impairment in young children. Malformations and reduced fetal weight have beenseen after mice were treated intraperitoneally with high doses of aflatoxin. In rats,decreased pup weight and behavioural changes have been found at low doses. Effectssuggesting impairment of fertility have been reported in female and male rats and in malerabbits. Aflatoxin B 1is genotoxic in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems in vitro , including human cells, and in vivo in humans and in a variety of animal species. It forms DNA and albumin adducts and induces gene mutations and chromosomal alterations includingmicronuclei, sister chromatid exchange and mitotic recombination. In geographical correlation studies, exposure to aflatoxin is associated with a specific G to T transversion in codon 249 of the TP53 gene in human hepatocellular carcinoma. This alteration is consistent with the formation of the major aflatoxin B 1-N7-guanine adduct and the observation that G to T mutations are predominant in cell and animalmodel systems. The high prevalence of the codon 249 mutation in human hepatocellularcarcinoma, however, is not fully explained in experimental studies either by thesequence-specific binding and mutation induced by aflatoxin B 1or by altered function of the p53 protein in studies of hepatocyte growth and transformation. Current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms contributes to the understanding of the nature of the interaction between hepatitis B virus and aflatoxins in determining riskfor hepatocellular carcinoma. Infection with hepatitis B virus may increase aflatoxinmetabolism; in hepatitis B virus-transgenic mice, liver injury is associated with increasedexpression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Glutathione S-transferase activity is also reduced in human liver in the presence of hepatitis B virus infection. Othermolecular mechanisms are, however, also likely to be relevant to aflatoxin-inducedcarcinogenesis. On the basis of the data described above, the existing Group 1 evaluation of naturally occurring aflatoxins was reaffirmed. 5.5 Further research needs Some research areas are identified here for the purpose of assisting in any future update by an IARC Monographs Working Group.

AFLATOXINS IN FOODS AND FEEDS: FUNGAL SOURCES, FORMATION AND STRATEGIES FOR REDUCTION 1. Major Mycotoxins and Crops Five types of mycotoxins of agricultural importance occur in staple crops (Miller, 1995): fumonisins, mycotoxins can cause various forms of poisoning inanimals and in humans, and some are carcinogenic (Table 1). Aflatoxins are produced byAspergillus species in nuts and oilseeds, particularly maize, peanuts (groundnuts) and cottonseed, especially in tropical and subtropical climates. Fumonisins are produced byFusarium verticillioides (formerly known as F . ) and the closely related F . proliferatum , in maize and sorghum. Ochratoxin A occurs in cereals as a result of growth of Penicillium verrucosum and in other crops, especially grape products (grape juice, wines and dried vine fruit), coffee and long-stored commodities as a result ofgrowth of several Aspergillus species. Deoxynivalenol, nivalenol and zearalenone are formed as a result of growth of F . graminearum and F . culmorum in maize, wheat, barley and other small grains (JECFA, 2001). Ergot, the toxic product of the fungus Claviceps purpurea which grows on rye and to a lesser extent on other grains, was historically a significant source of epidemic poisoning in Europe, but due to effective inspection ofgrain it is rarely a public health problem today in Europe and North America. Some crops are infected by only one toxigenic fungus: aflatoxins in peanuts and cottonseed, and ochratoxin A in susceptible crops are usually found by themselves. Insmall grains, trichothecenes and zearalenone usually occur together as the result ofinfection by one or more Fusarium species. Of greater importance, fumonisins and aflatoxins, and to a lesser extent trichothecenes and zearalenone, frequently occur simul-taneously in maize. Any conclusions regarding reduction strategies should take this intoaccount. This Annex deals only with aflatoxins, but many of the points made have relevance to the other toxins. -275-IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 276Table 1.

Limiting the formation of aflatoxins in such commodities cannotusually be achieved by any single technique. To be effective, approaches to this problemrequire an overall strategy, which involves a knowledge of crops likely to be affected, thetime when infection by the fungi is likely to occur, and careful management of crops bothbefore and after harvest. Once aflatoxins have been formed, reduction again relies on arange of strategies, which if well managed can result in the removal of the major part ofaflatoxin contamination. Contaminated crops can be used for animal feed after chemicaltreatment. This Annex provides an overview of the crops and conditions that favour afla-toxin contamination, and the various management strategies available to limit formationor reduce levels of aflatoxins in commodities. 2.2 Fungi producing aflatoxins Aflatoxins in food and feed crops are almost entirely produced by the common fungi Aspergillus flavus and the closely related species A. parasiticus . A. flavus produces only B aflatoxins while A. parasiticus produces both B and G aflatoxins & Boller, Dorner et al. , & Pitt, 1988; Pitt, 1993). Several other Aspergillus species are now known to produce aflatoxins but they are of little practical importancein foods. 2.3 Occurrence of toxigenic species in foods 2.3.1 Aspergillus flavus A. flavus is the most widely reported food-borne fungus outside north-temperate areas. It is especially abundant in the tropics: A. flavus was isolated from 97% of nearly 500 peanut samples examined from south-east Asian sources over the years 1989-91, withan average infection rate of more than 40% of all surface-disinfected kernels examinedfrom Thailand and the Philippines, and more than 60% of those from Indonesia. Formaize, the figures were 89% of 380 samples, at an average of 38% of all grains infectedfrom Indonesia and the Philippines, and 17% of those from Thailand (Pitt & Hocking,1997). Levels in food commodities from more temperate climates, such as Australia or the USA, are much lower. A. flavus was present in only 1.2% of surface-disinfected maizeANNEX 277kernels and in less than 0.1% of all oats and wheat kernels examined from a large number of samples in the USA (Sauer et al. , 1984). The major food and feed commodities where A. flavus is found are peanuts (McDonald, 1970; Pitt et al. , 1993, 1998), maize (Diener et al., 1983; Pitt et al. , 1993, 1998) and cottonseed (Simpson & Batra, 1984). Spices of many kinds frequently containA. flavus (ICMSF, 1998). From time to time, A. flavus occurs in most types of tree nuts, including pistachios, pecans, hazelnuts and walnuts, copra and kola nuts (Pitt Hocking,1997). Aflatoxins are sometimes produced in these commodities (Pohland & Wood,1987). Low levels of A. flavus in small grain cereals and pulses, and many other kinds of foods, e.g. soybean, have been reported, but the possibility of significant aflatoxin accu-mulation is much lower (Pitt et al. , 1994; Pitt & Hocking, 1997; 2.3.2 Aspergillus parasiticus A. parasiticus seems to be less widely distributed than A. flavus . During a major study, more than 30 000 A. flavus cultures from south-east Asian foods were isolated and identified, but not more than 20 isolates of A. parasiticus were found. Although A. para- siticus is certainly widely distributed in soils and foodstuffs in the USA, Latin America, South Africa, India and Australia, it is essentially unknown in south-east Asia. LikeA. flavus , it is a tropical and subtropical species, less prevalent in warm temperate zones, and rare in the cool temperate regions of the world. The most important food source ispeanuts, in which A. parasiticus is endemic. Other types of nuts may be infected, inclu- ding hazelnuts and walnuts, pistachios and pecans. A. parasiticus is much less common than A. flavus on grains, and perhaps does not invade maize at all. A variety of other minor sources have been reported (Pitt & Hocking, 1997). 2.4 Formation of aflatoxins in foods A fundamental distinction must be made between aflatoxins formed in crops before or immediately after harvest, and those occurring in stored commodities or foodproducts. In subtropical and tropical areas, certain crop plants, notably peanuts, maizeand cottonseed are associated with A. flavus , or in the case of peanuts, also for A. para- siticus , so that invasion of plants and developing seeds or nuts may occur before harvest. This is the cause of the frequent occurrence of high levels of aflatoxins in these crops,and is the reason for the difficulties still being experienced in eliminating aflatoxins fromthese commodities. In contrast, A. flavus is less common in other plants, seeds or nuts before harvest. In consequence, aflatoxins are not normally a problem with other cropsat harvest and their elimination relies on preventing post-harvest contamination, by rapiddrying and good storage practice (Pitt, 1989; Chatterjee et al. , 1990; Miller, 1995). Therefore, if infection of peanuts and maize by A. flavus could be controlled before harvest, excessive aflatoxin production would not normally occur in storage, even undersomewhat unsatisfactory conditions. In temperate maize production, A. flavus conta-IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 278mination is associated mainly with insect damage during drought conditions (Miller, 1995). 2.5 Formation of aflatoxins in susceptible crops 2.5.1 Peanuts Peanuts are susceptible to infection by both A. flavus and A. parasiticus (Hesseltine et al. al. , 1987; Pitt & Hocking, 1997). The primary source of these fungi is soil, where high numbers may build up because some peanuts are not harvested,but remain in the ground and act as a nutrient source (Griffin & Garren, 1976a). Unculti-vated soils contain very low amounts of A. flavus , but soils in peanut fields usually contain 100-5000 propagules (spores) per gram (Pitt, 1989). Under drought stress condi-tions, this number may rise to 10 4or 105/g (Horn et al. , 1995). Large numbers of A. flavus spores are also airborne over susceptible crops (Holtmeyer & Wallin, 1981). Direct entry to developing peanuts through the shell by A. flavus in the soil appears to be the main route of nut infection (Diener et al. , 1987). Infection can also occur through the pegs and flowers (Wells & Kreutzer, 1972; Griffin & Garren, 1976b; Pitt,1989). A. flavus sometimes grows within peanut plants themselves. Growth in plant tissue is not pathogenic, but commensal: neither the seed pod (Lindsey, 1970) nor theplant (Pitt, 1989; Pitt et al. , 1991) shows any visible sign of colonization by the fungus. A variety of factors influence invasion of developing peanuts by A. flavus . Infection occurs before harvest only if substantial numbers of spores or other propagules(thousands per gram of soil) exist in the soil. Other important factors are drought stress(Sanders et al. , 1981) and soil temperatures around 30 \u00b0C (Blankenship et al. , 1984; Sanders et al., 1984; Cole et al. , 1985; Cole, 1989; Dorner et al. , 1989) during the last 30-50 days before harvest (Sanders et al. , 1985) . 2.5.2 Maize So far as is known, maize is infected only by A. flavus (Lillehoj et al. , 1980; Angle et al. , 1982; Horn et al. , 1995). In temperate areas, the most important route for entry of A. flavus to maize is through insect damage (Lillehoj et al. , 1982; Bilgrami et al. , 1992; Miller, 1995). Invasion via the silks (the styles of the female maize flower) is alsopossible (Marsh & Payne, 1984; Diener et al. , 1987). (32-38 \u00b0C) stress increases infection (Jones et al. , 1980). The critical time for high temperatures to favour infection is between 16 and 24 days after inoculation at silking (Payne, 1983).The time of infection is also important: inoculation two to three weeks after silk emer-gence produced much higher rates of infection than inoculation one or five weeks aftersilking (Jones et al. , 1980).ANNEX 2792.5.3 Cottonseed A. flavus is also a commensal in the cotton plant (Klich et al., 1984). Infection occurs through the nectaries (natural openings in the cotton stem), which are important in polli-nation (Klich & Chmielewski, 1985), or through cotyledonary leaf scars (Klich et al., 1984). Upward movement occurs in the stem towards the boll, but not downwards fromboll to stem (Klich et al. , 1986). Insect damage is also a potential cause of infection (Lee et al. , 1987), but insects are often well controlled in cotton crops. As in peanuts and maize, temperature appears to be a major environmental factor in pre-harvest infectionof cottonseed (Marsh et al. , 1973; Simpson & Batra, 1984). Daily minimum temperatures above 24 \u00b0C, in combination with precipitation exceeding 2-3 cm, appear to lead toextensive aflatoxin formation (Diener et al. , 1987). 3. Management of Aflatoxin Contamination A variety of approaches exist to limit aflatoxin production in crops. Limiting aflatoxins in crops before and immediately after harvest involves strategies aimed atreducing drought stress, by irrigation and weed control, by control of insect damage andby the use of fungicides. Improvements in harvesting procedures, better drying, andsorting of defective grains or nuts are all beneficial. The principles of safe storage arewell known, and cannot be overemphasized. Physical methods to reduce aflatoxins incrops are widely practised, especially in developed countries. The technology involvedin these approaches to limiting and reducing aflatoxins are relatively simple andinexpensive, and can be practised even by small-scale farmers. For heavily contaminatedcommodities, the use of chemical treatments can effectively reduce aflatoxins, but thenuse of the resulting materials is limited to animal feed. These procedures, systems andapproaches are outlined below. 3.1 Intervention strategies Interventions to reduce aflatoxin-related exposures can be considered in terms of those which are applicable at the individual level or those applicable at the communitylevel (Figure 1). 3.1.1 Individual level Dietary changes to avoid foods contaminated with aflatoxin are rarely an option in countries of high exposure where staple foods are contaminated (e.g. maize or peanuts).However, efforts to improve crop and dietary diversity must be made. Sorting procedurescan be of value, but require education at the consumer level. Chemoprevention aims todiminish the toxicological effects of aflatoxins once exposure has occurred. ClinicalIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 280trials of two chemopreventive agents, oltipraz and chlorophyllin, have demonstrated that aflatoxin metabolism can be modified in vivo and the levels of aflatoxin bound to DNA and proteins can be reduced as a result. This approach may be valuable in individuals atparticularly high risk of exposure. Work on these chemical agents also provides avaluable scientific basis for the exploration of dietary constituents consumed by popu-lations exposed to aflatoxins, which may modify the toxicity of the aflatoxins in a similarway. 3.1.2 Community level (a)Limiting aflatoxin formation in susceptible crops before and after harvest In peanuts, it appears likely that infection by A. flavus while nuts are still in the ground is a prerequisite for high levels of aflatoxins to be formed after harvest (Pitt,1989). In the absence of high pre-harvest infection levels, and with rapid and effectivedrying, peanuts can be produced free of any appreciable level of aflatoxin. The majorcauses of pre-harvest infection are high numbers of propagules in the soil, and droughtstress during the days leading up to harvest (see Section 2.5.1). Partial control of propagule numbers can be achieved by crop rotation: in particular, numbers of A. flavus in soil decrease under small grain cultivation or pasture. Irrigation, which eliminates drought stress, is regarded as the most effective method for reducingANNEX 281 Figure 1. Intervention strategies Intervention strategy Community levelPre-harvest Reduce crop stress Crop resistance to aflatoxin \u2014 selection or genetic engineering Biocontrol e.g. nonaflatoxigenic fungal strains Post-harvest Drying Sorting and storage Chemical detoxificationIndividual levelDietary change Physical sortingChemoprevention e.g. oltipraz, chlorophyllinaflatoxin formation in peanuts (Pettit et al. , 1971; Cole et al. , 1982). However, peanuts throughout the world are recognized as a drought-resistant crop and are mostly grownunder dry culture, with irrigation reserved for more moisture-sensitive crops such as riceor vegetables. In many areas where peanuts are grown, irrigation is not an option. Underthese circumstances, reduction in drought stress by good agricultural practices can be abeneficial approach. For example, weed control and wider spacing between peanut rowscan both assist in reducing drought stress (Rachaputi, 1999). Rapid drying of peanutsusing mechanical dryers as soon as possible after pulling has a major effect in reducingthe levels of aflatoxins in peanuts. For maize also, irrigation and improved farm management practices have a beneficial effect on aflatoxin formation (Payne et al. , 1986). Resistant breeding stocks have been identified (Widstrom et al. , 1987; Campbell & White, 1995) and resistant maize geno- types, dependent on kernel pericarp wax (Guo et al. , 1995; Brown et al. , 1999) or kernel proteins (Huang et al. , 1997) have been developed recently. As maize is usually dried in the field, rapid drying techniques are not commonly practised, but should be in tropicalcountries. Cottonseed is a by-product of cotton production, so field drying is normal. Breeding of cotton without nectaries has been proposed as one means of limiting A. flavus access to cotton bolls (Klich & Chmielewski, 1985). Genetic engineering may offer novel ways of limiting pre-harvest contamination by mycotoxins, provided attention is paid to questions of importance specifically to deve-loping countries (Wambugu, 1999). Genetic approaches to aflatoxin control include engi-neering of genes in Aspergillus species to influence the ability of the fungus to colonize the host plant. An alternative approach is to select or engineer varieties of cereal grainsand oilseeds resistant to fungal infection or aflatoxin biosynthesis by the fungus onceinfection occurs. (b)Control of aflatoxin formation in other crops before and after harvest Entry of A. flavus into pistachio nuts depends on the time of splitting of hulls. Nuts in which hull splitting occurs early are much more susceptible to A. flavus invasion on the tree (Doster & Michailides, 1995). It is known that some cultivars are more prone toearly splitting than others, and this is especially important where nuts are harvested fromthe ground, after contact with the soil. In tree nut crops, various techniques, including timing of harvesting, are used to keep aflatoxin formation to a minimum. Figs are sometimes infected by A. flavus , both because of their unique structure deve- loped for insect fertilization and also because figs are harvested from the ground in somecountries. Immature figs are not colonized by A. flavus , but once they are ripe infection occurs readily and fungal growth continues during drying (Buchanan et al. , 1975; Le Bars, 1990). The proportion of figs infected is only about 1% (Steiner et al. , 1988). IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 282(c)Control of aflatoxins in dried food commodities by physical means A range of physical factors control fungal growth: temperature, water activity ( aw), pH, gas atmospheres and oxygen concentration (Pitt & Hocking, 1997) together with theuse of insecticides or preservatives in some cases. The pH of any commodity cannot bealtered (Wheeler et al. , 1991), while temperature is usually not controllable in bulk storage. Gas atmospheres are increasingly used in developed countries to limit insectgrowth, and, if well maintained, can also limit fungal growth (Hocking, 1990). Storageof grain in a phosphine atmosphere used to control insects at a water activity of 0.80 or0.86 reduced growth of Aspergillus flavus , but had little effect on the survival of spores (Hocking & Banks, 1991). In practice, in most storage systems, a wis the principal variable that can be modified for preserving commodities. The basic advice for handling any grain, nut, other bulk food commodity or feed after harvesting is to dry it rapidly and completely and to keep it dry. Food commoditiesare perishable, and must be kept free of insect infestations or water ingress or heating andcooling gradients which will cause migration of moisture. Full description of themethods for successful storage is beyond the scope of this document. Many good textson grain storage exist: those by Champ and Highley (1988), Champ et al. (1990) and Highley et al. (1994) are recommended. The prime consideration for storage of grains and nuts is to maintain the moisture content below that which permits fungal growth of any sort over a normal storage life,about one year, i.e. at a water activity below 0.65. This corresponds to different moisturecontents for different commodities: 8% for peanuts and other nuts, 12% for grains and22% for raisins, which contain a higher level of soluble carbohydrate (Iglesias & Chirife,1982). The limits for growth of A. flavus are now reasonably well defined: A. flavus is able to grow between 10-12 \u00b0C and 43-48 \u00b0C, with an optimum near 33 \u00b0C (Pitt & Hocking,1997); the minimum a wfor growth is near 0.82 at 25 \u00b0C, 0.81 at 30 \u00b0C and 0.80 at 37 \u00b0C (Pitt & Miscamble, 1995). Growth can occur over the pH range 2-11 at least, at 25-37 \u00b0C, with optimal growth over a broad range from pH 3.4 to 10 (Wheeler et al. , 1991). A. parasiticus is very similar physiologically to A. flavus (Pitt & Hocking, 1997). Data from Pitt and Miscamble (1995) were used to provide a predictive model for A. flavus growth in relation to water activity and temperature (Gibson et al. , 1994). Aflatoxin production has been reported to occur at water activity as low as 0.82 but is very slow below about 0.90 and optimal above 0.99, i.e. near the water activity of freshgrains or nuts (ICMSF, 1996; Gqaleni et al. , 1997). It is evident that reduction of water activity of fresh commodities to below 0.80 will positively prevent aflatoxin production. However, it must be kept in mind that holdingcommodities above a water activity of 0.65 renders them susceptible to the growth offungi. As such fungi grow, they release water by metabolism and produce heating, bothof which in due course lead to conditions conducive to aflatoxin production. To preventANNEX 283aflatoxin production in stored commodities, bulk foods or feeds, water activity must be maintained below 0.70 (Pitt & Hocking, 1997). (d)Reduction of aflatoxins in stored commodities by physical means For some crops, notably maize and figs, it is possible to sort grains or fruit using ultraviolet light, under which aflatoxins (and perhaps some other compounds) producebright greenish yellow fluorescence. This test (qualitative but not quantitative) is bestcarried out on cracked maize grains (Shotwell et al., 1972; Shotwell, 1983), but can be used on whole dried figs (Steiner et al. , 1988; Le Bars, 1990). Sorting out contaminated fruit, together with toxin analysis, has been effective in controlling aflatoxins in figs(Sharman et al. , 1991). Sieving of contaminated maize has been shown to reduce afla- toxin and the co-occurring fumonisin (Murphy et al., 1993). During wet milling of maize, aflatoxin is segregated primarily in the steep water (40%) and fibre (38%) and germ (6%), with less in the gluten and starch (1%)(Bennett & Anderson, 1978; Wood, 1982; Njapau et al., 1998). In dry milling of maize, artificially contaminated rice and durum wheat, less than 10% of the aflatoxin in the ori-ginal material remained in the prime products (grits and low-fat flour) (Schroder et al., 1968; Scott, 1984). After peanuts are shelled, several physical procedures such as colour sorting, density flotation, blanching and roasting are routinely used by processors to reduce aflatoxinlevels by 99% (Park, 1993a; L\u00f3pez-Garc\u00eda et al. , 1999). The colour sorting process was developed originally to reject commercially unacceptable discoloured nuts, regardless ofcause, but as fungal growth is a prime cause of discolouration, the process is also aneffective non-destructive means of removing most nuts containing aflatoxins. In cropsunder severe drought stress, peanuts begin to dry in the ground, and under these condi-tions luxuriant growth of A. flavus can occur, with high aflatoxin production. In this case, blanching to remove skins and roasting to increase discolouration permits effectivecolour sorting to be carried out. Roasted peanuts must be sold under inert gas atmo-spheres to suppress development of rancidity (Read, 1989). Colour sorting of other commodities is not easy. No effective non-chemical testing technique exists for cottonseed or pistachios and, as with other commodities, non-destructive chemical assays are not available. The extent to which aflatoxins are destroyed during heating is largely dependent on the process used. Less than 25% of the aflatoxin content of a commodity is destroyed byboiling water (Christensen et al., 1977; Njapau et al. extrusion (Cazzaniga et al., 2001) and autoclaving (Stoloff et al., 1978). However, dry roasting of peanuts can reduce aflatoxin levels by up to 80% (Conway et al., 1978; Njapau et al., 1998). Heating of peanut oil at 250 \u00b0C for 3.5 h reduced aflatoxin by 99% (Peers & Linsell, 1975). Heating at neutral pH at 125 \u00b0C had little effect on fumonisin, usually present as a co-contaminant in maize, but heating above 150 \u00b0C causes significant reduction in levelsof fumonisin in processed maize products (Dupuy et al., 1993; Jackson et al., 1996a,b).IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 2843.2 Chemical methods The alkali process usually practised to produce refined table oil completely removes aflatoxin (ICMSF, 1996). The use of chemicals to inactivate, bind or remove aflatoxins has been studied exten- sively. Any such procedure must effectively inactivate or remove the toxin, while main-taining the nutritional and technological properties of the product and without generatingtoxic reaction products (L\u00f3pez-Garc\u00eda & Park, 1998). Food safety demonstration studiesmust be conducted to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. To date, thesechemical methods have been approved only for the reduction of aflatoxins in animal feedcommodities. Reacting the toxin chemically with another compound intentionally intro-duced in the vicinity of the toxin molecule holds the greatest promise for rapid and effec-tive removal or inactivation of aflatoxin. Among such techniques are the use of chemo-sorbents and ammoniation. Other than the demonstrated reduction in bioavailability ofaflatoxin as a result of hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate binding (Phillips et al. , 1988), ammoniation is the only chemical inactivation process that has been shown todestroy aflatoxin efficiently in cottonseed and cottonseed meal, peanuts and peanut mealand maize (Park et al., 1988; Park & Price, 2001). 3.2.1 Aflatoxin-binding agents Adsorption of aflatoxin using activated carbons, clays and aluminosilicates has been demonstrated in a number of studies. Bentonite clays (Masimango et al ., 1979) and activated charcoal (Decker, 1980), both used in oil purification, can adsorb up to 92% ofaflatoxin present. A phyllosilicate clay currently used as an anti-caking agent has beenshown to bind aflatoxin tightly and diminish markedly its uptake into the circulatorysystem, preventing aflatoxicoses and reducing levels of aflatoxin M 1in milk (Phillips et al., 1988). The specificity of the clays and their potential for binding nutrients in addi- tion to aflatoxin remains a concern. Further research is required to determine whetherthese materials can be used in human foods. 3.2.2 The ammoniation process The ammoniation process has been used to reduce aflatoxin levels in feed ration components in order to prevent the presence of aflatoxin in tissues and animal productssuch as milk. In the USA, the States of Arizona, California and Texas permit the ammo-niation of cottonseed products. Texas has, in addition, approved the ammoniation proce-dure for aflatoxin-contaminated corn, but the treated corn may only be used in finishingbeef cattle diets. Ammoniation is used in Brazil, France, Mexico, Senegal, Sudan andsome states of the USA to lower aflatoxin contamination levels in animal feeds. The twoprocedures in widespread use are: ( a) a high-pressure and high-temperature process (HP/HT) used at treatment plants, and ( b) an atmospheric-pressure and ambient-tempe- rature procedure (AP/AT) that can be used on the farm (Table 2). The HP/HT processANNEX 285involves spraying the contaminated product with anhydrous ammonia (or introduction of ammonia gas) and water in a contained vessel. The treatment conditions, i.e. amount ofammonia (0.5-2%), moisture (12-16%), pressure and temperature (80-120 \u00b0C) vary according to the initial levels of aflatoxinin the product (Park & Price, 2001). The AP/AT process also uses anhydrous ammonia and water, but the commodity is packed in a plastic silage-type bag or more recently simply covered with a tarpaulin andsealed. The sealed container is then held for 14-42 days, depending on the initial afla-toxin levels and the ambient temperature (25-40 \u00b0C); higher aflatoxin levels and a lowerambient temperature require a longer holding time. Similarly, the amount of ammonia(1-5%) can be varied according to the initial level of aflatoxin present and the moisturecontent of the material to be treated. Completion of treatment has to be predetermined inthe HP/HT process, whereas with the AP/AT technique, the bag is probed and testedperiodically until the results show that aflatoxin levels are equal to or below 20 ppb (Park& Price, 2001). The addition of a formaldehyde anti-caking agent can improve the process (Prevot, 1986) and leads to no changes in milk production and composition (Calet, 1984).However, the addition of formaldehyde is not recommended in view of potential humanexposure (see IARC, 1995). (a)Aflatoxin/ammonia chemistry Sequential fractionation of meals spiked with uniformly 14C-labelled aflatoxin B1 (Park et al ., 1984) has allowed the partial isolation (Figure 2) and identificationIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 286 Table 2.

Hydrolytic scission of the aflatoxin lactone ring \u2014 the first step in thereaction \u2014 readily occurs under basic conditions, but is reversible when the ammo-niation process is carried out under less drastic conditions. Under HP/HT and well con-trolled AP/AT conditions, the reaction proceeds to low-molecular-weight compounds,among them aflatoxin D 1(molecular weight 286) and others of molecular weight 256 and 236 (Park et al., 1988). (b)Efficacy of aflatoxin decontamination using ammonia Studies with peanuts, cottonseed and corn have demonstrated the effectiveness of the ammoniation process (Dollear et al ., 1968; et al ., 1984; Martinez et al., 1994; Neal et al., 2001). Other studies are summarized in Table 3. (c)Safety of ammoniated commodities In vitro , sub-chronic and chronic studies have shown no mutagenic or tumorigenic lesions or toxic effects related to the HP/HT ammoniation procedure. Metabolism studiessuggest poor absorption of decontamination reaction products compared withaflatoxin B 1. Livestock feeding studies with feedlot beef, dairy cattle, poultry, turkeys and ducklings have shown that the toxic effects observed following exposure to aflatoxincontamination are absent after ammoniation. These studies have been reviewed (Parket al., 1988; Park & Price, 2001).ANNEX 287 Figure 2. Scheme for isolation and approximate concentrations of aflatoxin- ammonia reaction products in cottonseed and corn meals From Park & Price (2001) TLC, thin-layer chromatographyLactating mammals that ingest aflatoxin B1 deposit the 4-hydroxylated metabolite, aflatoxin M1, in their milk. Since infants and children have potentially greater vulnera- bility and sensitivity than adults, monitoring levels of aflatoxin M1in milk is important. Among human foods of animal origin, the rate of feed-to-tissue transfer of aflatoxin ishighest for milk (Tables 4 and 5). Therefore, aflatoxins or their metabolites are not foundin edible tissues except milk from animals fed aflatoxin-contaminated feed. Theconversion rate of aflatoxin B 1 to aflatoxin M1in milk has been shown to vary between 1.1 and 14.7% for dairy rations containing between 20 and 800 ppb aflatoxin B1(Price et al., 1982; Fremy & Quillardet, 1985; Bailey et al. , 1994). It is higher than 1% when the amount of ingested aflatoxin B1is low. The primary purpose of the ammoniation pro- cedure was to reduce aflatoxin M1residues in milk, and numerous studies have demons- trated its efficacy in eliminating aflatoxin residues in milk (Price et al. , 1982; Fremy et al., 1987; Bailey et al. , 1994). Overall, decontamination reaction products in the feed matrix are usually derived from < 1% of the original aflatoxin content and large portions of these products areIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 288 Figure 3.

Outstanding Health Questions in Aflatoxin Management Increased liver cancer incidence associated with aflatoxins occurs in areas of the world with chronic high levels of toxins, frequently exceeding the regulatory levels underconsideration by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (2001) by large amounts,sometimes factors of 10 or 100, and endemic infection with hepatitis B or C viruses(HBV or HCV). Some basis exists for quantifying the effects of aflatoxin exposure onliver cancer risk, and for the greater impact of aflatoxins in areas of high HBV or HCVIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 290 Table 4.

However, uncertainty remains regarding (1) the health effects of occasional high exposures occurring due to unusual weather patterns, incomparison with those due to normal chronic exposure; (2) the effect of combinations ofmycotoxins, e.g. aflatoxins and fumonisins, on cancer risk; and (3) the broader healtheffects of aflatoxin exposure. Under the latter consideration, the most important aspectsare (1) the greater sensitivity of children to acute toxicity of aflatoxins as compared withadults; (2) the in-utero effects of aflatoxins, known to cross the placenta; (3) the immuno-suppressive effects of aflatoxins, which may influence susceptibility to infectiousdisease; (4) the suppressive effects of aflatoxins on the interactionsbetween HCV , HBV and aflatoxins in liver cancer development in various populationsin the world. The areas mentioned are important ones for future research, to provide information of direct relevance to public health decisions regarding aflatoxin exposure. 5. Previous Recommendations Although some countries with fully developed market economies have enforced regulations on aflatoxins for some 30 years, it is only recently that a broader consensushas been developed on the impact of aflatoxins and other agriculturally important toxinson human populations. The health effects include those resulting from exposure in foods,from reductions in the quality of the crops affected and from reduced animal production.The health consequences of lowered income are also pertinent in some communities.This consensus was reached when the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization/WorldHealth Organization (FAO/WHO) Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) esta-blished an hypothetical standard for aflatoxins (JECFA, intakes (PMTDIs) weekly (PTWI) for ochratoxin A (JECFA, 2001). For aflatoxin andfumonisin, exposure in excess of the PMTDI occurs in much of Africa as well as partsof Asia and South America. JECFA attempted to separate the portion of risk of liver cancer attributable to afla- toxin from the risk attributable to other factors (JECFA, 1998, 2001). JECFA modelleddose-response curves from laboratory animal studies as well as human epidemiologicalstudies of aflatoxin carcinogenicity. The risk of liver cancer from aflatoxin consumptionwas significantly higher (perhaps 30-fold) in individuals who were chronically infectedwith hepatitis B virus (hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive) than in those whowere not (HBsAg-negative). It was concluded that populations such as those in western Europe and the USA with a low prevalence of HBsAg-positive individuals or populations with a low mean intakeof aflatoxins are unlikely to achieve a decrease in liver cancer cases from more stringentANNEX 291aflatoxin standards (such as lowering the regulatory hypothetical standard for afla- toxin B1in peanuts from 20 g/kg to 10 g/kg) (JECFA, 2001). Populations with a high prevalence of HBsAg-positive persons and high aflatoxin intake would benefit from reductions of aflatoxin intake, and such a reduction in afla-toxin intake could be achieved without loss of valuable food sources and risk of mal-nutrition or starvation (JECFA, 1998). The FAO/WHO/UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme) (1999) conference, representing 38 countries and 10 international organizations, made a seriesof recommendations reflecting a new perspective on the health and economic impact ofmycotoxins in staple foods. It was recommended that: Surveillance should be targeted to staple foods. HACCP (hazard analysis: critical control point) principles can be used to highlight the roles that fungal ecology, crop physiology and agronomic practicesplay in mycotoxin contamination prevention and control. The stakeholders in the production chain, particularly farmers, should be made aware of the importance of measures to reduce mycotoxin contamination. Before recommending the introduction of crops or new genotypes into new envi- ronments, consideration should be given to the potential for increased [toxigenic]fungal infections. Training programmes for the development of practical control and management strategies should be [developed and] conducted in developing countries in orderto set up strong mycotoxin management programmes. 6. Trade in Crops Mycotoxin contamination in crops is a major determinant of trade for all economies. Typically, the higher-quality grain or nuts are traded and the poorer-quality productremains with the farmer for consumption at the village level or for use in animalproduction. Major risks exist in this situation, especially where unseasonable rains orother climate variations result in excessive mycotoxin contamination of crops, whereconsumer standards for urban customers increase, or where commodities intended forinternational trade are upgraded by sampling or sorting. Where industrialized domestic animal production takes place, there are a number of strategies to make use of crops with undesirable mycotoxin concentrations. Theseinclude dilution with other feed ingredients, addition of absorbents for aflatoxins, addi-tions of sugar and, where permitted, ammoniation. In developing countries, however,diverting grains contaminated with aflatoxins into rural animal protein production mayresult in a substantial reduction in feed conversion as well as increased herd or flockmortality and morbidity. The economic impact of such reduced feed conversion can eli-minate the expected increased return on investments in animal protein production.IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 292Furthermore, the reduced animal production increases protein energy malnourishment in vulnerable groups, e.g. children and pregnant women. 7. Conclusions This Annex has dealt in general terms with a number of very complex issues. Many areas have been highlighted which are in need of much future research to provide infor-mation that is directly relevant not only to public health, but also to availability of awholesome food and feed supply worldwide. The following general conclusions andrecommendations emerged from the deliberations of the Working Group. 1. Limiting aflatoxin occurrence in crops before harvest can be achieved by limiting drought and high temperature stress, controlling weeds, reducinginsect damage, using effective harvesting techniques and reducing Aspergillus spore numbers in soil by crop rotation. 2. Genetic engineering may offer new ways of limiting the pre-harvest contami- nation of some crops by aflatoxins. 3. Aflatoxins can be controlled in susceptible crops after harvest by controlling factors which affect fungal growth, e.g. water activity, temperature, gasatmospheres, and the use of insecticides or preservatives. The prime consi-deration for storage of grains and nuts is to maintain the water activity (bycontrol of moisture content) below the limit for fungal growth. 4. Aflatoxin levels can be reduced in stored commodities by physical means, such as colour sorting, density flotation, blanching and roasting. 5. Where approved, aflatoxin levels in commodities destined for animal feeds can be reduced by chemical processes. Such processes include agents which bindaflatoxins, such as adsorbent clays, and the ammoniation process. The mainuse for ammoniation is in elimination of aflatoxin from feed for dairy cows. 6. Increased liver cancer incidence associated with aflatoxin exposure occurs in areas of the world where chronic high levels of aflatoxins (often many timeshigher than regulatory limits) and endemic infection with HBV or HCV occurtogether. Populations with a low prevalence of HBV chronic carriers and a lowmean aflatoxin intake are unlikely to achieve a decrease in liver cancer casesby introducing lower aflatoxin limits. In contrast, in populations with a highprevalence of HBV chronic carriers and high exposure to aflatoxin, measuresto reduce aflatoxin exposure would be desirable and beneficial.ANNEX 2938.

Six general analytical methods have been reported: thin-layer the determination of fumonisins B 1and B2in maize and corn (maize) flakes was collaboratively studied. The method involves double extraction withacetonitrile-methanol-water (25:25:50), clean-up through an immunoaffinity column,and after derivatization with ortho -phthaldi- aldehyde. This method has been proposed as the AOAC Official Method 2001.14, FirstAction (Visconti et al., 2001). The majority of studies have been performed using LC analysis of a fluorescent deri- vative (WHO, 2000). There are no validated biomarkers for human exposure to fumo-nisin B 1. Many studies, both in vivo and in vitro , have demonstrated a correlation between disruption of sphingolipid metabolism \u2014 as measured by an increase in free sphinganine\u2014 and exposure to fumonisin B 1(WHO, 2000, 2002). Sphingolipids are a highly diverse class of lipids found in all eukaryotic cells. Their biological functions are equally diverse: the compounds serve as structural componentsrequired for maintenance of membrane integrity, as receptors for vitamins and toxins, assites for cell-cell recognition and cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion, as modulators ofreceptor function and as lipid second messengers in signalling pathways responsible forcell growth, differentiation and death (Merrill et al. , 1997). Ceramide synthase is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of sphingolipids. Alterations in the ratio free sphinganine/free sphingosine, a consequence of ceramide synthase inhi-bition, are now used as a biomarker for exposure to fumonisins in domestic animals andhumans. The mechanistic aspects of the effects of fumonisins on sphingolipid meta-bolism are discussed more fully in Section 4.5.1. Methods have been reported for extraction of fumonisin B 1from human urine (Shetty & Bhat, 1998), plasma and urine of rats (Shephard et al., 1992a, 1995a), bile of VOLUME 82 302et al., 1994b), liver, kidney and muscle of beef cattle (Smith & Thakur, 1996) and milk (Maragos & Richard, 1994; Scott et al., 1994; Prelusky et al., 1996a). 1.2 Formation Fumonisin B1was isolated in 1988 by Gelderblom et al. (1988). It was chemically characterized by Bezuidenhout et al. (1988), and shortly thereafter as 'macrofusine' by Laurent et al . (1989a), from cultures of Fusarium verticillioides (Sacc.) Nirenberg as Fusarium moniliforme al. , 1979) as well as Gibberella fujikuroi (Leslie et al. , 1996). The absolute stereochemical configuration of fumonisin B1(see section 1.1.2) was determined by ApSimon (2001). Fumonisin by ) isolated from Africa, the Americas, Oceania (Australia), Asia and Europe (Gelderblom et al., 1988; Ross et al., 1990; Nelson et al., 1991; Thiel et al., 1991a; Chelkowski & Lew, 1992; Leslie et al., 1992; Nelson et al., 1992; Miller et al., 1993; Logrieco et al., Miller et al., al., 1997). Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici has also been shown to synthesize B fumonisins (Abbas & Riley, 1996). Fumonisins can beproduced by culturing strains of the Fusarium species that produce these toxins on steri- lized maize (Cawood et al., 1991) and yields of up to 17.9 g/kg (dry weight) have been obtained with F . verticillioides strain MRC 826 (Alberts et al for fumonisin B2have been obtained liquid fermen- tations and high recoveries of the toxins are possible (Miller et al., 1994). The predo- minant toxin produced is fumonisin B1. Fumonisin B1frequently occurs together with fumonisin B2, which may be present at levels of 15-35% of fumonisin B1(IARC, 1993; verticillioides and F . proliferatum are among the most common fungi associated with maize. These fungi can be recovered from most maize kernels including those thatappear healthy (Bacon & Williamson, 1992; Pitt et al., 1993; Sanchis et al., 1995). The level of formation of fumonisins in maize in the field is positively correlated with theoccurrence of these two fungal species, which are predominant during the late maturitystage (Chulze et al., 1996). These species can cause Fusarium kernel rot of maize, which is one of the most important ear diseases in hot maize-growing areas (King & Scott,1981; Ochor et al., 1987; De Le\u00f3n & Pandey, 1989) and is associated with warm, dry ears and/or insect damage (Shurtleff, 1980). 1.3 Use Fumonisin B1is not used commercially.FUMONISIN B1 3031.4 Occurrence Fumonisins have been found worldwide, primarily in maize. More than 10 com- pounds have been isolated and characterized. Of these, fumonisins B1, B2and B3are the major fumonisins produced. The most prevalent in contaminated maize is fumonisin B1, which is believed to be the most toxic (Thiel et al., 1992; Musser & Plattner, 1997; Food and Drug Administration, 2001a,b). A selection of data on the occurrence of fumo-nisin B 1in maize and food products is given in Table 1. (a)Formation in raw maize The concentrations of fumonisins in raw maize are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, drought stress and rainfall during pre-harvest andharvest periods. For example, high concentrations of fumonisins are associated with hotand dry weather, followed by periods of high humidity (Shelby et al., 1994a,b). Magan et al. (1997) have studied the effects of temperature and water activity ( a w) on the growth of F . moniliforme and F . proliferatum . Growth increases with 0.92 to 0.98) is maximum at 30 \u00b0C for F . moniliforme and at 35 \u00b0C for F . proliferatum . High concentrations of fumonisins may also occur in raw maize that has been damaged by insects (Bacon & Nelson, 1994; Miller, 2000). However, maize hybridsgenetically engineered to carry genes from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt maize) that produce proteins that are toxic to insects, specifically the European maizeborer, have been found to be less susceptible to Fusarium infection and contain lower concentrations of fumonisins than the non-hybrid maize in field studies (Munkvold et al., 1997, 1999). (b)Occurrence in processed maize products One of the major factors that determine the concentration of fumonisins in processed maize products is whether a dry- or wet-milling process is used. The whole maize kernelconsists of the following major constituents: (i) starch, which is the most abundant cons-tituent from which maize starches and maize sweeteners are produced; (ii) germ, whichis located at the bottom of the centre of the kernel from which maize oil is produced;(iii) gluten, which contains the majority of the protein found in maize kernel; and(iv) hull (pericarp), which is the outer coat of the kernel from which maize bran isproduced. Dry milling of whole maize kernel generally results in the production of fractions called bran, flaking grits, grits, meal and flour. Because fumonisins are concentrated inthe germ and the hull of the whole maize kernel, dry milling results in fractions withdifferent concentrations of fumonisins. For example, dry-milled fractions (except for thebran fraction) obtained from degermed maize kernels contain lower concentrations offumonisins than dry-milled fractions obtained from non-degermed or partially degermedmaize. Industry information indicates that dry milling results in fumonisin-containingfractions in the following order of descending fumonisin concentrations: bran, flour,IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 304FUMONISIN B1 305 Table 1.

(2000)meal, grits and flaking grits. Consequently, maize products such as corn bread, maize grits and maize muffins made from the grits and flour fractions may contain low concen-trations of fumonisins. Ready-to-eat breakfast cereals made from flaking grits, such ascorn (maize) flakes and puffed type cereals, contain very low concentrations (from non-detectable to 10 ppb) of fumonisins (Stack & Eppley, 1992). Wet milling of whole maize generally results in the production of fumonisin- containing fractions in the following order of descending fumonisin concentrations:gluten, fibre, germ and starch. No fumonisins have been detected in the starch fractionobtained from wet milling of fumonisin-contaminated maize. The starch fraction isfurther processed for production of high-fructose maize syrups and other maizesweeteners (JECFA, 2001). Therefore, products of these types do not contain any detec-table concentration of fumonisins. Maize oil, extracted from maize germ and refined,does not contain any detectable fumonisins (Patel et al., 1997). The gluten and fibre fractions from the wet-milling process do contain fumonisins; these fractions are used toproduce animal feed, such as maize gluten meal and maize gluten feed (JECFA, 2001). Another process to which whole maize may be subjected is nixtamalization, which consists of boiling the raw maize kernels in aqueous calcium hydroxide solution (lye),cooling and washing to remove the pericarp and excess calcium hydroxide. The washedkernels are then ground to produce the 'masa', from which maize chips and tortillas aremade. This process has been shown to reduce concentrations of fumonisins in raw maizekernels (Dombrink-Kurtzman & Dvorak, 1999). However, the reaction product, hydro-lysed fumonisin B 1(HFB1) is highly hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic (V oss et al. , 1996a, 1998, 2001a). Available data indicate the presence of low concentrations (4-82 ppb ( g/kg)) of fumonisins in sweet maize (Trucksess et al., 1995). Fumonisins can be present in beer but at low concentrations (4.8-85.5 ppb ( g/L)) 1998; Hlywka & Bullerman, 1999), but distilled spirits made from maize do not contain fumonisins (Bennett & Richard, 1996). The fermentation process does notdestroy fumonisins and 85% of the toxin may be recovered in fermented products.Products from ethanol fermentations generally used as animal feeds may be detrimentalif consumed by pigs or horses (Bennett & Richard, 1996). Broken kernels of maize which have been screened from bulk lots of maize before any milling process contain higher concentrations of fumonisins than whole kernels, andare often used in animal feeds. Higher fumonisin concentrations are found in maizescreenings. Fumonisin-contaminated maize at concentrations of 330 and residues milk (Maragos & Richard, 1994; Scott et al., 1994; Becker et al., 1995; Richard et al., 1996), eggs (Vudathala et al., 1994) and meat (Prelusky et al., 1994, 1996a,b; Smith & Thakur, 1996) have been either unde- tectable or were detected at extremely low concentrations.FUMONISIN B1 307(c)Formation in commodities other than maize Fumonisins have also been reported in other food products, notably sorghum in Botswana, Brazil, India, South Africa and Thailand (Bhat et al. Gamanya & Sibanda, 2001). In these countries, about 40% of the samples screened contained lowconcentrations of fumonisin B 1(0.11-0.55 mg/kg). However, higher amounts (up to 7.8 mg/kg) were observed in rain-damaged sorghum, still lower than the concentrationsreported for maize (up to 65 mg/kg) (Vasanthi & Bhat, 1998). Other commodities inwhich fumonisin B 1has been detected include millets, rice, wheat, barley, cereal-based food products, soybean and pastes and animal feeds (Nelson et al. , 1992; Castella al. , in black (80-280 mg/kg) as well as in some medi- cinal plants, such as leaves of the orange tree (350-700 mg/kg) and leaves and flowersof the linden tree (20-200 mg/kg) (Martins et al. , 2001). Twenty-five asparagus plants affected by crown rot were analysed for Fusarium infestation and fumonisin contamination. F . proliferatum was found in all plants. Fumo- nisin B 1was detected in crowns and stems at concentrations of 7.4 and 0.83 mg/kg dry weight, respectively (Logrieco et al. , 1998). Co-occurrence of fumonisins and aflatoxins in maize is reviewed in the monograph on aflatoxins in this volume. 1.5 Human exposure to fumonisins A number of estimates of human exposure to fumonisins have been made. In a preli- minary estimate for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA, exposure tofumonisins for consumers of maize in the USA was estimated as 0.08 g/kg bw per day (Humphreys et al. , 1997; WHO, 2000). In Canada for the period 1991 to early 1995, Kuiper-Goodman et al. (1996) estimated human exposure to be 0.017-0.089 g/kg bw per day. In Switzerland, mean daily intake of fumonisins has been estimated to be0.03 g/kg bw (Zoller et al., 1994). As a conservative estimate, de Nijs et al. (1998c) found that in the Netherlands 97% of individuals with gluten intolerance had a daily exposure of at least 1 g fumonisin B 1 and 37% of at least 100 g; in the general population it was estimated that 49% and 1%, respectively, were exposed to these levels of fumonisin B1. Human exposures in the Transkei, South Africa, were earlier estimated to be 14 and 440 g/kg bw fumonisin B1 per day for good quality and mouldy maize, respectively (Thiel et al., 1992). More recent estimates of probable daily intake by South Africans vary from 1.2 to 355 g/kg bw per day in a rural population in Transkei and mycelia of F . verticillioides (Tejada- Simon et al. , 1995), occupational inhalation exposure could be a problem, but data are lacking on airborne levels of fumonisins during the harvesting, processing and handlingof fumonisin-contaminated maize. In a study conducted in China, urine was collected from volunteers before and after consumption of a fumonisin B 1-contaminated diet for one month. The ratio of free sphin- ganine to free sphingosine (Sa/So) was increased threefold in the urine of the men, butwas unchanged in that of the women. This increase was also apparent when the data werepooled for men and women and grouped into those individuals who had estimatedintakes of fumonisin B 1greater than or less than 110 g/kg bw per day (Qiu & Liu, 2001). This result is similar to that reported for swine, where the sphinganine/sphingosine ratio became significantly different from controls at a fumonisin B1intake of 500 g/kg bw per day (Rotter et al., 1996). 1.6 Regulations and guidelines The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) has recommended a provisional maximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI) of 2 g/kg bw for fumonisins B1, B2and B3, alone or in combination (JECFA, 2001). An official tolerance value for dry maize products (1 mg/kg fumonisin B1plus fumo- nisin B2) has been issued in Switzerland (Canet, 1999). The recommended maximum levels for fumonisins in human foods and in animal feeds in the USA that the FDA considers achievable with the use of good agricultural andgood manufacturing practices are presented in Tables 2 and 3. Human exposure to fumo-nisins should not exceed levels achievable with the use of such practices (Food and DrugAdministration, 2001c). 2. Studies of cancer in humans Studies on the relationship between Fusarium verticillioides (formerly known as toxic secondary metabolites) and oesophageal cancer in areas of South Africa and China weresummarized in V olume 56 of the IARC Monographs (IARC, 1993). The evidence in humans was judged to be ' inadequate ' at that time. The only subsequent study that investigated the relationship between fumonisins and cancer was carried out in the People's Republic of China. Yoshizawa and Gao (1999)collected 76 corn samples from the homes of oesophageal cancer patients, selected atrandom in Linxian, China (a high-risk area for oesophageal cancer) as well as 55 samplesfrom homes of peasant families with no oesophageal cancer patient in Shangqiu (a low-FUMONISIN B1 309risk comparison area). Homegrown samples of corn intended for human consumption were collected in 1989, 1995 and 1997 (Yoshizawa et al ., 1994; Yoshizawa fumonisin B1in the high- and low-risk areas, respectively, were 872 and 890 ng/g in 1989, 2730 and 2702 ng/g in 1995, and 2028 and2082 ng/g in 1997. Maximum concentrations were 2960, 21 and 8290 ng/g in thehigh-risk 8470 in the low-risk area, respectively, in thethree years studied. There was no significant difference in any of the measured fumonisinlevels between the two areas ( p> 0.05). The percentages of samples with detectableIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 310 Table 2.

Based on local dietary habits, the estimated daily intake of fumonisin B 1was 1.6-1.9 times higher in the high-risk than in the low-risk area for oesophageal cancer.The authors noted that aflatoxin B 1was detected at very low levels in corn samples from both of the areas. [The Working Group noted that cancer families in high-risk areas werecompared with non-cancer families in low-risk areas.] 3. Studies of Cancer in Experimental Animals Toxins derived from Fusarium moniliforme were considered by a previous Working Group in 1992 (IARC, 1993). Since that time, new data have become available and thesehave been incorporated into the monograph and taken into consideration in the presentevaluation.FUMONISIN B1 311 Table 3.

The maize sample was obtained from feed being fed to horsesduring an outbreak of equine leukoencephalomalacia (ELEM). A group of 12 control ratswas fed a commercial rodent chow (Purina 5001) (Wilson et al., 1985). No aflatoxins were detected in the maize diet (detection limit, < 0.9 g/kg), which was deficient in many nutrients including choline and methionine. Maize samples contained monili-formin (2.82 mg/kg) and C (0.39 mg/kg), but no trichothecene or aflatoxin (Thielet al., 1986). Retrospective mycological and chemical analyses indicated the presence of F . verticillioides and Aspergillus flavus as major fungal total fumo- nisin B (fumonisin B 1and B2) concentration of 33.1 mg/kg, while only trace amounts of aflatoxin B1and B2 ranging between 0.05 and 0.1 g/kg were detected (JECFA, 2001). A mean fumonisin B intake of between 1.6 and 2.0 mg/kg bw per day was estimated basedon an apparent feed intake of 50-60 g/kg bw per day (Wilson et al., 1985; JECFA, 2001). One of the treated rats died after 77 days, three were killed on days 123, 137 and 145,and the remaining eight animals were killed on day 176: all animals showed multiplehepatic nodules, large areas of adenofibrosis and cholangiocarcinomas. The controls hadno liver lesions. 3.1.2 Studies using fungal culture material Rat: A group of 31 female Wistar rats [age unspecified] was fed a diet containing maize bread inoculated with F . verticillioides . After 554-701 days of feeding, four papillomas and two carcinomas had developed in the forestomach. No epithelial lesionof the forestomach was seen in a control group of 10 female rats fed conventional maizebread, not inoculated with the mould, for 330-700 days (Li et al. , 1982). [The Working Group noted the inadequate reporting of the study.] Groups of 20 male BD IX rats (weighing 80-100 g) were fed commercial rat feed containing F . verticillioides MRC 826 mouldy meal (freeze-dried or oven-dried) at levels of either 8% for up to 57 or 75 days or 4% for 286 days followed by 2% until 763 days(Marasas et al., 1984). The estimated intakes of fumonisin B were 138 (8% in diet), 69 (4%) and 32 (2%) mg/kg bw per day for the respective diets, with an average feed intakeof 32 g feed/kg bw per day (JECFA, 2001). All rats given 8% diet between 57 and 75days had severe liver damage. Among rats fed the 4%/2% freeze-dried diet regimen andsurviving beyond 450 days, 12/14 had hepatocellular carcinomas and 10/14 had hepaticductular carcinoma. In rats fed the 4%/2% oven-dried material, 12/16 had hepato-cellular carcinoma and 9/16 had hepatic ductular carcinoma. In both treatment groupsIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 312with freeze-dried or oven-dried diet, three rats had pulmonary metastases. No liver tumours were seen in rats fed control diet (Marasas et al., 1984). Groups of 30 male BD IX rats, weighing approximately 110 g, were fed for 27 months freeze-dried culture material of F . verticillioides MRC 826 at levels from 0.25% to 0.75% in either a semi-synthetic diet (marginally deficient in certain vitamins andminerals) or a semi-synthetic diet containing 5% culture material of . verticillioides MRC 1069 (to contain 18.2 mg/kg fusarin C). control rats received commercialmaize (5%) in the diet. Fumonisin B intake of between 4 and 13 mg/kg bw fumonisin B 1 in the rats fed MRC 826 was estimated assuming consumption of 32 g/kg bw feed perday. In animals fed the MRC 826 diet and necropsied between 23 and 27 were observed. were 1/22 neoplastic nodule and 1/22 suchlesions were seen in 13/21MRC in 4/21 826-treated animals other of the oesophageal epithelium in12/21 rats fed the MRC 826 diet (Jaskiewicz et al., 1987). 3.2 Oral administration of purified fumonisin B1 3.2.1 Mouse Groups of 48 male and female B6C3F1mice, four weeks of age, were fed fumonisin B1(> 96% pure, ammonium salt) at concentrations of 0, 5, 15, 80 or 150 mg/kg of diet (males) and 0, 5, 15, 50 or 80 mg/kg of diet (females) in NIH 46 diet over a period oftwo years (equivalent to average daily doses of ~0.6, 1.7, 9.5 and 17 mg/kg bw for malesor 0.7, 2.1, 7.0 and 12.5 mg/kg bw for females). Survival of the female mice was signi-ficantly reduced in the group treated with 80 mg/kg fumonisin B 1(60%), while that in treated male mice was not significantly different from the controls. The low incidence ofspontaneous liver tumours in control female (11%) and male (26%) mice compared withhistorical controls was ascribed to feed restriction, as previously suggested by Hasemanet al. (1998). After two years, the incidences of hepatocellular adenomas in 9/45 for the groups treated with 0, 5, 15, 50 and 80 mg/kg of diet, respectively. The incidences ofhepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in treated males were not significantlyincreased compared with control males (National Toxicology Program, 2000). [Noanalyses to determine the presence of Helicobacter hepaticus were reported.]FUMONISIN B1 3133.2.2 Rat Two groups of 25 male BD IX rats, weighing between 70 and 80 g, were fed a semi- purified diet (intentionally marginally deficient in minerals and vitamins) in the absenceor presence of 50 ppm (mg/kg diet) fumonisin B 1 (90% pure) for 26 months (Gelderblom et al., 1991). An average daily fumonisin B1intake of 1.6 mg/kg bw was calculated on the basis of a mean average feed intake of 32 g/kg bw per day (JECFA, 2001). Groups offive treated and five control rats were killed at 6 and 12 months. At 6 months, regenera-tive nodules were observed in all animals and cholangiofibrosis was observed in all butone; at 12 months, regenerative nodules and cholangiofibrosis were observed in allanimals. In all 15 rats that died or were killed between 18 and 26 months, hepatocytenodules, cholangiofibrosis and cirrhosis were observed. Hepatocellular carcinomas, twoof which metastasized \u2014 one to the heart and lungs and one to the kidneys \u2014 were alsoobserved in 10/15 animals (Gelderblom et al., 1991). Four groups of 20 male BD IX rats, weighing approximately 100 g, were fed a semi- purified diet (intentionally marginally deficient in minerals and vitamins) containing 0,1, 10 or 25 mg/kg of diet fumonisin B 1(purity, 92-95%) over a period of two years. The mean intakes of fumonisin B1(mg/kg bw) were 0.005, 0.03, 0.3 and 0.8 for control, low-, mid- and high-dose groups, respectively. The survival rates at two years were16/20, 14/20, 18/20 and 17/20 in the four groups, respectively. There was a significant(p< 0.05) increase in the incidence of portal fibrosis (5/17), ground glass foci (7/17) and hepatocyte nodules (9/17) the liver of the rats fed fumonisin B 1at 25 mg/kg of diet. One rat had a large focal area of adenofibrosis. Some of these hepatic changes weredetected to a smaller extent in rats treated with fumonisin B 1at 1 and 10 mg/kg of diet. No such lesions were observed in the livers of control rats (Gelderblom et al., 2001a). Groups of 40-48 male and 40-48 [40 for the 15-mg/kg group] female Fischer 344 rats, eight weeks of age, were fed fumonisin B1(> 96% pure, ammonium salt) at concen- trations of 0, 5, 15, 50 or 100 mg/kg of diet for females and 0, 5, 15, 50 or 150 mg/kg ofdiet for males in a powdered NIH 36 diet that was available ad libitum over a period of two years (equivalent to average daily doses of 0, 0.25, 0.8, 2.5 and 7.5 mg/kg bw forfemales and 0, 0.3, 0.9, 3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg bw for males). Survival rates were similar inthe treated and control rats. In males at two years, the incidences of renal tubuleadenomas were 0/38, [ p= 0.0001] for the controls and increasing doses, respectively. The occurrence of renal tumours in males was accompanied by an increasedincidence of renal tubule epithelial cell hyperplasia at two years (2/48, 1/40, 4/48, 8/48 of the male rats receiving fumonisin B 1at 0, 5, 15, 50 and 150 mg/kg of diet, respectively). In female rats, there were no significant fumonisin B1-dependent changes in the incidence of tumours. One renal adenoma was detected in a female rat fed fumo-nisin B 1at 50 mg/kg of diet, and one renal tubule carcinoma was detected in a female rat fed 100 mg/kg (National Toxicology Program, 2000). IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 314A re-evaluation of the renal pathology of the National Toxicology Program (2000) study characterized toxic lesions as cytotoxic/regenerative (graded from 0 to 4) and aty-pical tubule hyperplasia (Hard et al., 2001). There was a progressive increase in the grade of severity of the former lesion in the rats fed 15, 50 and 150 mg fumonisin B 1per kg of diet. Atypical hyperplasia was observed (6/48) the kidneysof the rats fed 50 mg/kg and also in the group fed 150 mg/kg (8/48 adenomas, 10/48carcinomas). Two of 8 and the 50- and 150-mg/kg treatment groups,respectively, metastasized to the lung. Only one of the 18 carcinomas displayed theconventional reasonably differentiated phenotype. Cellular pleomorphisms were noticedin 3/8 and 1/10 carcinomas in rats fed 50 and 150 mg/kg, respectively. Among the carci-nomas observed in these studies, 61% were an anaplastic variant. [The Working Groupnoted that this re-evaluation did not affect the conclusions of the National ToxicologyProgram (2000) study.] 3.3 Administration with known carcinogens and other modifying factors 3.3.1 Mixtures of fumonisins Rat: Groups of six male Fischer rats, 10 days of age, were given an intraperitoneal injection of N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) (15 mg/kg bw) and fed ground maize con- material of F . proliferatum (8-11 mg/kg in the absence or presence of nutrient supplementation for a period of 30 days, at which time animals were killed. No aflatoxins were detected in themaize, while nutritional modulation stimulated the toxic effects in the rats treated withthe nixtamalized and untreated maize cultures in rats. Hepatocellular adenomas deve-loped in 83% and 14% of the rats on diets containing the untreated and nixtamalizedmaize cultures, respectively. Cholangiomas were induced in 33% of the animals in bothgroups (with or without nixtamalization) (Hendrich et al., 1993). [The Working Group noted the small number of animals.] 3.3.2 Purified fumonisins Mouse : Three groups of 15 female SENCAR mice, seven weeks of age, were treated with a single application of 390 nmol 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene (DMBA) on their shaven backs. After one week, fumonisin B1was applied at doses of 0, 1.7 or 17 nmol twice a week and continued for 20 weeks. The highest dose of fumonisin B1induced skin tumours in all the mice with an average of 3.6 tumours per animal. In a similarexperiment, groups of 10 female SENCAR mice were given a single intraperitonealinjection of 1.8 mg NDEA per mouse followed by fumonisin B 1treatment (0.0025 % in the drinking-water) for 20 weeks. Lung tumours were found in 90% of the mice treatedFUMONISIN B1 315with NDEA and fumonisin B1, while none were observed in the mice treated with NDEA alone (Nishino et al., 2000). Rat: In an initiation/promotion study in male BD IV rats, the promotional activity of fumonisin B1was tested with N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine as initiator. Fumonisin B1did not show any activity as a tumour promoter in the oesophagus over a 48-week period(Wild et al. , 1997). Rainbow trout : Groups of 150 three-month-old rainbow trout fry were fed diet containing 0, 3, 23 or 104 mg/kg fumonisin B 1(> 90% pure) for 34 weeks. No liver tumours were seen when the fish were killed at 60 weeks. Groups of 150 three-month-old rainbow trout fry pretreated with 100 mg/kg aflatoxin B 1were fed diets containing 0, 3, 23 or 104 mg/kg fumonisin B1for 42 weeks. At 60 weeks, promotion of liver tumours was seen at 23 mg/kg (61% of fish had gross or confirmed tumours) and 104 mg/kg (74%of fish had gross or confirmed tumours). Groups trout frypretreated (MNNG; 35 mg/kg) were containing 0, 3, 23 or 104 mg/kg fumonisin B 1. At 60 weeks, promotion of liver tumours was seen in fish given 104 mg/kg fumonisin B1(55%) compared with 33% of fish treated with MNNG only (Carlson et al., 2001). 4. Other Data Relevant to an Evaluation of Carcinogenicity and its Mechanisms 4.1 Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion 4.1.1 Humans No studies of the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of fumonisin B1 in humans have been reported. Chelule et al. (2001) measured fumonisin B1in staple maize and in faeces in rural and urban populations in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa.Faecal concentrations were of the same order of magnitude as those in the maizeconsumed. 4.1.2 Experimental systems Studies have been conducted with fumonisins B2biosynthesized using deuterated or 14C-labelled methionine, at C-12 and C-16 or C-21 and C-22 (the methyl groups and see section 1.1.2), respec-tively (Plattner & Shackelford, 1992; Alberts et al., 1993). 1,2-[ 14C]Acetate has also been used, resulting in fumonisin labelled uniformly along the backbone with some label inthe two tricarboxylic acid side-chains (Blackwell et al., 1994). In these studies, the two forms of [ 14C]fumonisin B1had specific activities of 36 and 650 Ci/mmol, respectively, and radiochemical purities of > 95%.IARC of fumonisin B1and of fumonisin B2in rats are similar, involving rapid distribution and elimination (Shephard et al., 1995c). In B2is excreted 1999). The quantity of fumonisin B1detected in plasma after oral administration to pigs, laying hens, vervet monkeys, dairy cows and rats was very low. In rats (BD IX, Fischer344, Sprague-Dawley, Wistar) given [ 14C]fumonisin B1orally, accumulation of radio- activity in tissues was also very low. This demonstrates that absorption is very poor(< 4% of dose) (Shephard et al., 1993; also poorly (2-< 6% of dose) in vervet monkeys, dairy cowsand et al., 1994; Shephard al., 1994a,b; Prelusky et al., 1996b). In orally dosed laying hens and dairy cows, systemic absorption based on plasma levels andaccumulation of radioactivity in tissues was estimated to be < 1% of the dose (Scottet al., 1994; Vudathala et al., 1994; Prelusky et al., 1995). In rats and pigs given [ 14C]fumonisin B1via the diet or by gavage, 14C was distri- buted to various tissues, with the liver and kidney containing the highest concentrationof radiolabel (Norred et al., 1993; Prelusky et al., 1994, 1996b). In chickens given a single oral dose of [ 14C]fumonisin B1, trace amounts of radioactivity were recovered in tissues, but no residues were detectable in eggs laid during the 24-h period after dosing(Vudathala et al., 1994). No fumonisin B 1or aminopentol hydrolysis products were reco- vered in milk from cows that had received an oral dose of fumonisin B1(Scott et al., 1994). In pregnant rats dosed intravenously with [14C]fumonisin B1, approximately 14% and 4% of the dose was recovered in liver and kidney, respectively, after 1 h. In contrast,the uteri contained 0.24-0.44%, individual placentae contained 0-0.04% and total fetalrecovery of radioactivity was 0.015% of the dose per dam (V oss et al., 1996b). When [ 14C]fumonisin B1was administered by IX, Sprague-Dawley, initial (subsequent to thedistribution phase) was rapid (half-life, approximately 10-20 min) with little evidence ofmetabolism (Shephard et 1992b; Norred et al., 1993; Shephard et al., 1994c). In the elimination kinetics based on intraperitoneal or intravenous dosing of fumonisin B 1 are consistent with a one- (Shephard et al., 1992b) or two-compartment model (Norred et al., 1993). However, one study using Wistar rats dosed orally with fumonisin B1indi- cated that the kinetics were probably best described by a three-compartment model(Martinez-Larranaga et al., 1999), as was the case in swine (see below). In vervet monkeys, as in rats, the radioactivity was widely distributed and rapidly eli- minated (mean half-life, 40 min) after intravenous injection of [ 14C]fumonisin B1 (Shephard et al ., 1994a). The elimination kinetics after oral dosing in non-human primates have not been determined; however, peak plasma levels of fumonisin B1and B2 occurred between one and several hours after a gavage dose of 7.5 mg/kg bw in vervetmonkeys and the plasma concentrations ranged from 25-40 ng/mL for fumonisin B 2to of [14C]fumonisin B1from blood after an intravenous injection was best described by a three-compartment model (half-lives, 2.2, 10.5 and 182 min, respec-tively, averaged over five animals). Cannulation of the bile duct (which prevents entero-hepatic circulation) resulted in much more rapid clearance, which was best described bya two-compartment model. A similar effect of bile removal was observed whether thedosing was intravenous or intragastric. The elimination half-life in pigs dosed intra-gastrically without bile removal was 96 min (averaged over four animals). The studieswith pigs clearly show the importance of enterohepatic circulation of fumonisin B 1in pigs. As with rats, over 90% of radioactivity was recovered in the faeces, with less than1% recovered in urine after an oral dose of [ 14C]fumonisin B1(Prelusky et al., 1994). After intraperitoneal injection in rats, B1was excreted unchanged in et al., monkeys after intravenous injection, there was evi- dence of metabolism to partially hydrolysed fumonisin B1and to a much lesser extent the fully hydrolysed aminopentol backbone in faeces. In urine, 96% of the radioactivity wasrecovered as fumonisin B 1(Shephard et al., 1994a). In further experiments, it was shown that metabolism was likely to be mediated by the bacteria in the gut, since partiallyhydrolysed and fully hydrolysed fumonisin B 1were recovered in faeces vervet monkeys (Shephard et al., 1995b). In-vitro studies using primary rat hepatocytes with microsomal preparations (Cawood et al., 1994) and with a renal epithelial cell line (Enongene et al., 2002a,b) indi- cated that there was no metabolism of fumonisin B1in these systems. In rats given three oral doses of [14C]fumonisin B1at 24-h intervals, the specific radioactivity in liver and kidney increased with each successive dose and remainedunchanged for at least 72 h after the last dose (Norred et al., 1993). In pigs, it was esti- mated that exposure to dietary fumonisin B 1at 2-3 mg/kg feed would require a with- drawal period of at least two weeks for the [14C]radiolabel to be eliminated from liver and kidney (Figure 1; et al., 1996b). Fumonisins B1, B2and B3and products were detected in the hair of vervet monkeys exposed to fumonisin B1 in the feed and of Fischer rats after oral exposure to culture material of F . verticillioides containing fumonisins (Sewram et al., 2001). Fumonisins do not appear to be metabolized in animal systems in vitro or in vivo , apart from some evidence for removal of the tricarboxylic acid side-chains. This isthought to be effected by the microbial flora of the gut. 4.1.3 Comparison of humans and animals Several experiments have indicated that the rate of elimination of fumonisin B1is a function of body weight. In mice, elimination is very rapid, whereas fumonisin B1is predicted to be retained much longer in humans (Figure 2; Delongchamp & Young,2001). IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 318FUMONISIN B1 319 Figure 1. Percentage cumulative recovery of fumonisin B1in urine and faeces of swine fed [14C]fumonisin B1(uniformly labelled) at 3 mg/kg diet from days 1 to 12, then 2 mg/kg diet from days 13 to 24 and clean feed from days 25 to 33 Adapted from Prelusky et al. (1996b)IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 320 Adapted from Delongchamp & Young (2001) The data for mouse and human are extrapolated from the linear regression model.Figure 2. Allometric relationship between body weight and fumonisin B1half-life for elimination 4.2 Toxic effects 4.2.1 Humans As noted above, Chelule et al. (2001) reported that fumonisin levels in faeces were of the same order of magnitude as those in the maize consumed. In a study conducted inChina, urine was collected from volunteers before and after consumption of a fumo-nisin B 1-contaminated diet for one month. The ratio of free sphinganine to free sphingo- sine (Sa/So) was increased threefold in the urine of the men, but was unchanged in thatof the women. This increase was also apparent when the data were pooled for men andwomen and grouped into those individuals who had estimated intakes of fumonisin B 1 greater than or less than 110 g/kg bw per day (Qiu & Liu, 2001). For a detailed discussion of the effects of fumonisin B1on sphingolipid metabolism, see section 4.5.1. One report from India described gastric and other symptoms possibly associated with high exposures to fumonisins from consumption of rain-damaged mouldy sorghum ormaize (Bhat et al., 1997). 4.2.2 Experimental systems Studies on culture material were reviewed in IARC (1993), WHO (2000) and in the background papers for the 56th Meeting of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee onFood Additives (JECFA, 2001). Because, for most species, there are now adequatestudies using fumonisin B 1with reported purities of 96-98%, these will be emphasized here (Bondy et al., 1996; Rotter et al., 1996; National Toxicology Program, 2000). The single-dose LD50of fumonisin B1is unknown. Single gavage 200 mg/kg bw fumonisin B1significantly inhibited hepatocyte proliferation when given to male Fischer rats six hours after partial hepatectomy (Gelderblom et al., 1994). In male Sprague-Dawley rats, intravenous of fumonisin B1at 1.25 mg/kg bw resulted in histological changes in the outer medulla of the kidney, with an increasednumber of mitotic figures and apoptosis followed by severe nephrosis (Lim et al., 1996). Equine leukoencephalomalacia (ELEM) syndrome is caused by ingestion of fumo- nisin B 1in contaminated feed and is characterized by the presence of liquefactive necrotic lesions in the white matter of the cerebrum (Marasas et al., 1988). The first symptoms are lethargy, head pressing and inability to eat or drink, followed by convul-sions and death after several days. In addition to the brain lesions, histopathologicalabnormalities in liver and kidney have been reported in horses orally dosed with purefumonisins (Kellerman et al., 1990). Marasas et al. (1988) reported that high doses of fumonisin B 1 induced fatal hepatotoxicity with mild brain lesions, while low doses caused mild hepatotoxicity and severe brain lesions. Fatal liver disease in the absence ofany brain lesions was induced in a mare by intravenous injection of large doses of fumo-nisin B 1, while gastric intubation of the mycotoxin had no effect (Laurent et al., 1989b). However, signs of neurotoxicosis and liver lesions in the absence of elevated clinicalchemistry parameters, and ELEM concurrent with significant liver disease have beenFUMONISIN B1 321observed in horses and ponies after ingestion of feeds naturally contaminated with fumo- nisins at low concentrations (Wilson et al., 1992; Ross et al., 1993). The development of brain lesions in the absence of major liver lesions does not preclude a contribution of bio-chemical dysfunction in non-brain tissue to the development of brain lesions. Length ofexposure, level of contamination, individual animal differences, previous exposure orpre-existing liver impairment may all contribute to the appearance of the clinical disease(Ross et al., 1993). The lowest dietary dose observed to induce ELEM was 22 mg/kg fumonisin B 1 in a diet formulated with naturally contaminated maize screenings: one pony died ofELEM after consumption of contaminated diet for 235 days, of which the final 55 days'diet contained 22 ppm fumonisin B 1(Wilson et al ., 1992). Analysis of feeds from confirmed cases of ELEM indicated that consumption of feed with a fumonisin B1con- centration greater than 10 mg/kg diet is associated with increased risk of development ofELEM, whereas a concentration less than 6 mg/kg is not (Ross et al., 1994). The mini- mum toxic dose of pure fumonisins is unknown. In swine, fumonisin B 1 causes damage to the liver, lungs and cardiovascular and immune systems. Liver lesions have been induced with fumonisin-contaminated maizescreenings at 1.1 mg/kg diet). Intravenous exposures resulted in changes similar to those recorded in rodents including necrosis and cell proliferation (Motelin et al., 1994; Haschek et al., 2001). When pure fumonisin B1 was fed to Yorkshire swine at dietary levels of 0.1, 1 or 10 mg/kg (0.005, 0.052 or 0.496 adrenals), no histopathological signs of organ damage were observed.There were changes in sphingolipid ratios in lung, liver and kidney at the highest dose,as well as increased serum cholesterol (Rotter et al., 1996). Fumonisin B 1 given to young adult swine at several doses up to 1 mg/kg in the diet resulted in changes in serum choles-terol and in altered carcass fat distribution at 0.05 mg/kg bw (Rotter et al., 1997). Lung oedema occurs in pigs following very high fumonisin B 1exposure ( 100 ppm in diet, or 16 mg/kg bw per day). Clinical signs of lung oedema typically occur 2-7 days after exposure, and usually include dyspnoea, weakness, cyanosis anddeath (Osweiler et al., 1992; Haschek et al., 2001). At necropsy, the animals exhibit varying degrees of interstitial and interlobular oedema, with pulmonary oedema andhydrothorax, with varying amounts of clear yellow fluid accumulating in the pleuralcavity (Colvin & Harrison, 1992; Colvin et al., 1993). Fumonisin B 1is believed to be a negative osmotropic agent causing decreased cardiac contractility. It has been hypo-thesized that the cardiovascular alterations are a consequence of sphingosine-inducedinhibition of L-type calcium channels. Pulmonary oedema results from left-sided heartfailure (Smith et al., 1996, 2000; Haschek et al., 2001). Porcine pulmonary oedema was produced within 3-4 days after pigs started consuming a diet of culture material thatprovided 20 mg/kg bw fumonisin B 1per day (Smith et al. , 1999). There are no published studies on pulmonary oedema induced by oral exposure to pure fumonisin B1. IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 322Because poultry are very resistant to fumonisins, toxicity studies all involve culture material obtained from fermentation of autoclaved corn inoculated with cultures of afumonisin-producing fungus (WHO, 2000). Approximately 200 broiler chicks were fedF . verticillioides M-1325 culture material from hatching to 21 days. The concentrations of fumonisin B 1were 75, 150, 225, 300, 375, 450 and 525 mg/kg feed. The total dietary fumonisin levels (B1 + B2 + B3) were reported as 89, 190, 283, 389, 481, 592 and681 mg/kg feed. Broilers fed diets containing 89 and 190 ppm of the mixture showed nosignificant difference from controls in feed intake, weight gain, feed conversion, organweights, haematology or clinical chemistry. Compared with controls, all chicks fed dietscontaining fumonisins had significantly increased ( p< 0.05) serum sphinganine:sphin- gosine ratios. Histopathological examination of an extensive array of tissues showed nolesions or incidental findings in any treatment group. Isolated foci of hepatic necrosiswith mild heterophil and moderate to severe periportal granulocytic cell proli-feration were noted only in broilers fed at least 283 mg/kg total fumonisins (Weibkinget al. , 1993). In an attempt to identify food-borne carcinogens contributing to the high incidence of oesophageal cancer in the Transkei region of the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa,various food mixtures, collected from households of local inhabitants, were fed to BD IXrats for 829-980 days. Diets consisted of maize, beans and a salt mixture with or withoutthe addition of edible wild vegetables called imifino (Purchase et al., 1975). Based on reported fumonisin levels in maize from the Transkei during six different seasons and anapparent mean dietary intake of the BD IX rats of 32 g/kg bw feed per day, a total fumo-nisin intake of 0.65-1.4 mg/kg per day was estimated (Rheeder et al., 1992). Advanced toxic lesions in the liver included extensive bile duct proliferation, hepatocellular dege-neration and development of hyperplastic liver nodules (Purchase et al., 1975). In male BD IX rats fed 1 g/kg fumonisin B 1in the diet for 33 days, major changes seen in the liver included bile duct proliferation, fibrosis and hepatocyte nodules.Changes in kidney were mild and included fatty changes and scant necrosis in the proxi-mal convoluted dosing with 238 mg/kg bw fumonisin B 1per day caused the death of three of four rats and produced lesions in liver with minor changes in kidney.Severe disseminated acute myocardial necrosis and severe pulmonary oedema wereobserved in two rats. At lower dosages but with longer exposures (9-12 days), patho-logical changes were observed in liver. Early signs of bile duct proliferation and fibrosis,radiating from the portal areas, were noticed and the nuclei of a few hepatocytes wereenlarged (Gelderblom et al., 1988). Additional feeding studies were performed using concentrations of 25-750 mg fumonisin B 1per kg diet. Histopathological lesions in the liver (hepatocyte nodules) after 21 days were observed in rats that had received the high doses (750, 500 and 250 mg/kgdiet), with severity decreasing with decreasing dose. A few necrotic cells were detectedin the liver of rats treated with 50 mg fumonisin B 1per kg diet, whereas no lesions were observed at the 25-mg/kg dietary level (Gelderblom et al. , 1994, 1996a). FUMONISIN B1 323Hepatocyte injury was investigated in male Fischer 344 rats fed a diet containing fumonisin B1at 250 mg/kg for five weeks. Fumonisin B1induced hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis mainly in zone 3 of the liver lobule. Hepatocyte injury and death werereflected by desmin-positive hepatic stellate cell proliferation and marked fibrosis, withchanges in architecture and formation of regenerative nodules. Oval cell proliferationwas noted from week 2 and occurred in parallel with continuing hepatocyte mitotic acti-vity. Nodules developed and, at later time points, oval cells were noted inside some ofthe nodules (Lemmer et al., 1999a). Male and female Fischer 344 rats were fed doses of approximately 12, 20, 28 or 56 mg/kg bw fumonisin B 1per day for 28 days (National Toxicology Program, 2000). Body weight in both males and females was decreased at doses 20 mg/kg bw per day. The kidney was more sensitive to fumonisin B1-induced changes in males than in females, but the liver was more affected in females than in males. The earliest cellularresponse in both liver and kidney was increased apoptosis accompanied by increased cellproliferation. Structural degeneration as a result of apoptosis was noted in both liver andkidney. In females, the lowest effective dose for bile duct hyperplasia and decreased liverweight was 56 mg/kg bw per day and that for liver degeneration and increased hepato-cellular mitosis was 28 mg/kg bw per day. The lowest effective dose for increasedhepatocellular apoptosis was 20 mg/kg bw per day. Decreased kidney weight, increasedstructural degeneration and increased renal tubule epithelial cell apoptosis were seeneven at 12 mg/kg bw per day in males but only at 20 mg/kg per day in females (Howard et al., 2001). Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed 15, 50 or 150 mg fumonisin B 1per kg of diet over a period of four weeks. The estimated daily intake of fumonisin B1was 1.4, 4.4 and 13.6 mg/kg bw for males and 1.4, 4.1 and 13.0 mg/kg bw for females. Inliver, mild histopathological changes were observed by light microscopy only in rats fedthe high dose. Nephrotoxic changes were found in the proximal convoluted tubules inmales fed diets containing 15 mg fumonisin B 1per kg and in females at diets con- taining 50 mg/kg. Serum levels of enzymes, cholesterol and triglycerides were increased at dietary fumonisin B1 concentrations of 150 mg/kg (V oss et al., 1993, 1995a). Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were given oral doses of 1, 5, 15, 35 or 75 mg/kg bw fumonisin B1daily for 11 days. Histopathological changes in the kidneys were similar to those seen in other studies, males being more sensitive, with a lowesteffective dose of 1 mg/kg bw per day versus 5 mg/kg bw for females. Hepatotoxicity wasassociated with reduced liver weight, as well as increased vacuolization of adrenal cortexcells, which occurred in female and male rats treated at doses 15 mg/kg bw per day. Elevated cholesterol concentrations in serum were observed in female rats at doses5 mg/kg bw per day, but only at the highest dose (75 mg/kg bw per day) in males. Serum glucose was significantly reduced and alanine transaminase, aspartate transami-nase and creatinine were significantly elevated at the highest dose in males, and in thetwo highest-dose groups in females. Single-cell necrosis and mitosis were seen at dosesof 15 to 75 mg/kg bw per day in both males and females. Mild lymphocytosis in theIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 324thymic cortex of B1-treated rats was evident at 5 mg/kg bw per day in males and at 75 mg/kg bw per day in females (Bondy et al. , 1996, 1998). Male RIVM rats were treated with fumonisin B1at 0.19, 0.75 or 3 mg/kg bw per day by gavage for 28 days. The treatment had no effect on body weight, but kidney weightwas significantly reduced in the highest-dose group. Increased apoptosis in the medullaof the kidney and renal tubule cell death were seen in the mid- and high-dose groups butnot at the 0.19-mg/kg bw dose. There was no histological indication of liver toxicity (deNijs, 1998). Male BALB/c mice were given five subcutaneous injections of fumonisin B 1in sterile water over a period of five days at doses of 0.25, 0.75, 2.25 or 6.75 mg/kg bw perday. Apoptosis was detected in the liver at doses above 0.75 mg/kg bw and in the kidneysat all doses. The relative kidney weights (% of bw) were decreased at all dose levelsexcept 0.75 mg/kg bw per day, while no effect was observed with respect to relative liverweights (Sharma et al., 1997; Tsunoda et al., 1998). In adult male and female B6C3F 1mice treated with daily doses of 1, 5, 15, 35 or 75 mg/kg bw fumonisin B1by gavage during 14 days, hepatotoxicity was observed in both sexes, but kidney toxicity was seen only in females. Females were more sensitivethan males to the effects in liver and kidney. Single-cell necrosis was detected in the liverat doses 35 mg and 15 mg/kg bw per day in males and females, respectively. Hepa- tocyte mitosis was elevated in males at 75 mg/kg bw per day and in females at 5 mg/kg bw per day. Mild single-cell necrosis in the kidney was detected in the cortical andmedullary tubules only in female mice at per day. Males ( 35 day) and females ( 15 mg/kg bw day) exhibited moderate few female mice that received 35 mg/kg bw per day (Bondy et al., 1997). Male and female B6C3F 1mice were fed 99, 163, 234 or 484 mg fumonisin B1per kg of diet over a period of 28 days (National Toxicology Program, 2000). The average dailyintake of fumonisin B 1was slightly higher in females than in males. Males developed liver lesions at 484 mg/kg in the diet, while such changes were seen in females at all doselevels. The lowest effective doses with respect to liver pathology were 93 mg/kg bw perday in males and 24 mg/kg bw per day in females. Fumonisin B 1at 1, 3, 9, 27 or 81 mg/kg of diet was fed to male and female B6C3F1 mice over a period of 90 days. The mean daily intake of fumonisin B1was 0.3, 0.8, 2.4, 7.4 or 23 mg/kg bw for males and 0.3, 1, 3, 9.7 or 29 mg/kg bw significantly increased in the high-dosefemale mice, while no effect was reported in male mice. The clinical findings paralleledhistological observations in the liver of the female mice, which were mainly restricted tothe centrilobular zone. No lesions were reported in the kidneys of the mice (V oss et al., 1995b). FUMONISIN B1 3254.2.3 corn. Feeding nixtamalized F . verticillioides corn culture material containing 58 mg/kg HFB1to rats during four weeks caused lesions in the liver and kidney that were indistinguishable from thosecaused by feeding culture material that was not nixtamalized and contained predo-minantly fumonisin B thelial cells into the limina and an increased nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio. However, theextent and severity of the liver lesions, the decrease in weight gain and the elevation offree sphingoid bases were less in animals that received the nixtamalized culture materialthan in rats that received non-treated material, even though the molar concentration ofHFB 1(58 g/g [98.5 nmol/g]) in the culture material diets that had not been nixtamalized (V oss et al., 1996c). Male Fischer 344 rats (8-10 animals per group) were treated by gavage with 1.4, 4.2, 14.3, 21.0 or 35.0 mg/kg bw fumonisin B1(92-95% pure) per day for 14 days. After 14 days, degenerative changes in the liver were seen in the two high-dose groups andincluded apoptosis, mild proliferation of oval cells and increased mitotic figures. Oneweek after the start of the fumonisin B 1treatment, separate groups were treated either intravenously with 100 mol/kg bw lead nitrate, by partial hepatectomy or with a single gavage dose of 2 mL/kg bw carbon tetrachloride to stimulate cell proliferation. Threeweeks after the fumonisin B 1treatment, rats were (2-AAF)/partial hepatectomy or 2-AAF/carbon of placental glutathione S-transferase (GSTP)-positive lesions was monitored two weeks later. In groups receiving partial hepatectomy orcarbon tetrachloride during the initiation phase followed 2-AAF/partial hepatectomy, respectively, enhanced induction of GSTP-positivelesions was observed in the high-dose groups. This effect was not seen in the grouptreated with the mitogen lead nitrate followed by 2-AAF/partial hepatectomy(Gelderblom et al., 2001b). A total of 38 male Fischer 344 rats were divided into four groups and fed 250 mg fumonisin B 1per kg diet (92-95% pure; fumonisin intake, 16.4 mg/kg bw per day) for five weeks in the absence or presence of 1-2% dietary iron in a modified AmericanInstitute of Nutrition (AIN) 76 diet. One group received dietary iron but no fumonisin B 1 and one group received the control diet. The dietary iron treatment included one week at2%, one week on control diet followed by two weeks at 1% to avoid excessive toxiceffects. Two animals in each treatment group and one control rat were killed at three andfour weeks, and the remaining rats (six per group) were sacrificed after five weeks.Hepatocyte necrosis, mitosis and apoptosis and GSTP-positive showed fewer GSTP-positive lesions \u00b10.52 lesions/cm2). The concentration of alanine transaminase in serum was increased, reflecting hepato-toxicity, in both the fumonisin B 1- and fumonisin B1/iron-treated groups. Body weight gain was decreased in the fumonisin B1-, iron- and fumonisin B1/iron-treated groups, while relative liver weights were decreased only in the fumonisin B1-treated rats. Lipid peroxidation in the liver was increased in fumonisin B1/iron- and iron-treated rats (Lemmer et al., 1999b). Male Fischer 344 rats (5-8 per group) were fed modified AIN-76 diets containing 250 mg fumonisin B1per kg diet for three weeks. Other groups received 17 g/kg bw aflatoxin B1per day by gavage for 14 days (total dose, 240 g/kg bw) or a single intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg/kg bw N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA). The three groups were compared using the resistant hepatocyte model (Semple-Roberts et al. , 1987) which consisted of treatment with 20 mg/kg bw 2-AAF by gavage on each of threeconsecutive days followed by partial hepatectomy on day 4. The induction of GSTP-positive lesions was monitored three weeks after the latter treatment. GSTP-positivelesions were increased by treatment with both fumonisin B 1and aflatoxin B1in combi- nation with the 2-AAF/partial hepatectomy promoting stimulus, but to a much lesserextent than by treatment with NDEA (ratio 1:3:10 for fumonisin B 1, aflatoxin B1and NDEA). In a second set of experiments, the separate and combined effects of aflatoxinB 1and fumonisin B1on the induction of GSTP-positive lesions were determined in the absence of the 2-AAF/partial hepatectomy promoting treatment. When rats were treatedsequentially with aflatoxin B 1followed three weeks later by fumonisin B1, a synergistic interaction was found based on increased numbers and size of the GSTP-positive lesionsin the liver (total of 72, 5 and 1.6 lesions consisting of more than 5 cells/cm 2for aflatoxin B1+ fumonisin B1, aflatoxin B1and fumonisin B1, respectively (Gelderblom et al ., 2002). 4.3 Reproductive and developmental effects 4.3.1 Humans A specific role for fumonisins in the development of neural tube defects was suggested after the appearance of a cluster of such defects in Texas associated withconsumption of corn from the heavily fumonisin-contaminated 1989 corn crop(Hendricks, 1999). More recent studies have shown that fumonisin B 1inhibits folate metabolism in cultured cells (Stevens & Tang, 1997). The relationship between folatedeficiency and neural tube defects is well established, but there are no specific studies toconfirm the association with exposure to fumonisins.FUMONISIN B1 3274.3.2 Experimental systems (a)Developmental and reproductive toxicity studies Pregnant CD CRL rats were given oral doses of 0, 1.875, 3.75, 7.5 or 15 mg/kg bw fumonisin B1per day on gestation days 3-16. Feed consumption and body weight gain were significantly decreased at the 15-mg/kg bw dose. Fetal body weights at day 17 weresimilar in control and treated groups, but in day-20 fetuses, female weight andcrown-rump length were significantly decreased at the highest dose. In day-17 animals,dose-related increases in sphinganine/sphingosine ratios were seen in maternal livers,kidneys and serum. Sphinganine/sphingosine ratios in maternal brains were not affected,nor were those of fetal kidneys, livers or brains (Collins et al., 1998a). In a similar study using dose levels of 0, 6.25, 12.5, 25 or 50 mg/kg bw fumonisin B 1per day, maternal toxicity and fetal toxicity were seen at the 50-mg/kg bw dose. The effects on the fetusesincluded increased numbers of late deaths, decreased body weight and crown-rumplength and increased incidence of hydrocephalus and skeletal anomalies. Dose-relatedincreases in sphinganine/sphingosine ratios were seen in maternal livers, kidneys, serumand brain, but not in fetal livers, kidneys or brain (Collins et al., 1998b). The data from these two studies suggest either that fumonisin B 1does not cross the placenta, the observed fetal toxicity being a secondary consequence of maternal toxicity, or that apotential direct effect of fumonisin B 1on fetal development is not related to changes in sphinganine/sphingosine ratios in the fetuses. Groups of pregnant Fischer 344 rats were dosed by gavage daily on gestation days 8 to 12 with 30 or 60 mg/kg bw purified fumonisin B1or with a fat-soluble extract of F . proliferatum /corn culture that would provide a dose of approximately 60 mg fumo- nisin B1per kg body weight. Lower fetal litter weight and delayed ossification were observed in the rats given 60 mg/kg bw fumonisin B1, but not in rats bw fumonisin B1or the fat-soluble extract (Lebepe-Mazur et The neurobehavioural and developmental effects of fumonisin B1were studied in Sprague-Dawley rats treated by gavage on gestation days 13-20 with 0, 0.8 or 1.6 mg/kgbw fumonisin B 1obtained from culture material or 0, 1.6 or 9.6 mg/kg bw purified fumo- nisin B1. There was no effect on reproductive outcomes or offspring body weight through adulthood in either experiment. Some effects on acoustic startle response and playbehaviour were found in male but not in female offspring prenatally treated with anydose of purified fumonisin B 1. Fumonisin B1treatment had no effect on complex maze performance or open field and running wheel activity (Ferguson et al. , 1997). Pregnant Charles River CD-1 mice were treated orally with a semipurified extract of F . verticillioides culture providing 0, 12.5, 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg bw fumonisin B1daily on gestation days 7-15. Maternal mortality was observed at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kgbw. Signs of liver damage and decreased maternal body weight gain were observed at25 mg/kg bw. The percentage of implants resorbed was increased at all doses in a dose- dependent manner. The number of live fetuses per litter and the mean fetal body weightIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 328were decreased and the incidence of ossification deficits, short and wavy ribs and hydro- cephalus was increased at the 50- and 100-mg/kg bw doses (Gross et al., 1994). Pregnant Charles River CD-1 mice were administered 0 to 100 mg/kg bw pure fumo- nisin Doses 25 mg/kg bw induced maternal liver lesions and a dose-dependent increase in the incidence and severity of hydrocephalus inthe fetuses. Reduced fetal body weight was found at 50 mg/kg bw, while increased frequency of resorptions and decreased litter size were present only at 100 mg/kg bw.Doses 25 mg/kg bw increased the sphinganine/sphingosine ratios in maternal but not fetal livers. The effects of fumonisin B 1on the fetuses and the alteration of the sphinga- nine/sphingosine ratio in maternal but not fetal liver suggest that the effects offumonisin B 1on the fetuses are not mediated by changes in sphinganine/sphingosine ratios in the fetuses. The association with effects on the maternal liver may indicate thatdevelopmental effects are mediated by maternal hepatotoxicity (Reddy et al., 1996). Six groups of Syrian hamsters with 0-18 mg/kg gavage daily on days 8-12 of gestation and killed on day 15. The treatment caused fetal death, decreased fetal body weight and skeletal variationsconsistent with delayed development in a dose-dependent manner, without causingmaternal toxicity (Penner et al., 1998). on gestation days 8-10 or 12, reduced maternal weight gain was observed atdoses 8 mg/kg bw. Maternal aspartate transaminase and total bilirubin, used as indices of maternal hepatotoxicity, showed no significant difference between groups. At doseshigher than 2 mg/kg bw fumonisin B 1, there was an increased incidence of prenatal loss (death and resorptions). At 12 mg/kg bw, all litters were affected and 100% of the fetuseswere dead and resorbing (Floss et al., 1994a). A significant increase in litters with fetal deaths occurred in Syrian hamsters given 18 mg/kg bw purified fumonisin B 1or (18 B1 plus 4.5 mg fumonisin B2) by gavage on gestation days 8 and 9. There were no clinical signs of maternal intoxication (Floss et al., 1994b). New Zealand White rabbits were dosed by gavage on gestation days 3-19 with 0.5 at the 0.5- and 1.0-mg/kg bw doses (10-20%), but there was no difference in maternal weight gainduring pregnancy. Fetal weight and liver and kidney weights were decreased at 0.5 and1.0 mg/kg bw. Increased sphinganine/sphingosine ratios were found in maternal serum,liver and kidney, but there was no significant effect of fumonisin B 1on the sphinga- nine/sphingosine ratio in fetal brain, liver or kidney (LaBorde et al., 1997). Diet formulated with culture material of F . verticillioides strain MRC 826 to provide 0, 1, 10 or 55 mg fumonisin B1per kg diet was fed to male and female rats beginning 9 and 2 weeks before mating, respectively, and continuing throughout the mating, gesta-tional and lactational phases of the study. Nephropathy was found in males at dietarydoses of 10 mg/kg and in females fed 55 mg/kg diet. No significant reproductive effects were found in males or dams and fetuses examined on gestation day 15, or damsFUMONISIN B1 329and litters on postnatal day 21. Litter weight gain in the 10- and 55-mg/kg groups was slightly decreased; however, gross litter weight and physical development of offspringwere not affected. Increased sphinganine/sphingosine ratios were found in the livers ofdams from the high-dose group on gestation day 15. However, sphinganine/sphingosineratios in abdominal slices containing liver and kidney of fetuses from the control andhigh-dose groups did not differ. In an additional experiment, two dams were given anintravenous injection of 101 g [ 14C]fumonisin B1 on gestation day 15. After 1 h, about 98% of the dose had disappeared from the maternal blood, but only negligible amountsof radioactivity were found in the fetuses (V oss et al., 1996b). (b)Mechanistically oriented developmental toxicity studies Doses of 0.8 or 8 mg/kg bw of fumonisin B1were given subcutaneously to male Sprague Dawley rats on postnatal day 12. Brain tissue and blood were collected at tentime points up to 24 h after fumonisin B 1administration. The sphinganine levels in brain and plasma showed dose-dependent increases; the brain sphinganine level during the24 h was much higher than plasma sphinganine, with an area under the concen-tration-time curve (AUC) ratio of 40:1. In addition, fumonisin B 1was found in the brain tissue after the higher dose. These data indicate that alterations of the brain sphinganinelevels are the result of a direct action of fumonisin B 1on the brain rather than transport of peripheral sphinganine to the brain (Kwon et al., 1997a). Subcutaneous dosing of Sprague-Dawley rats with 0.4 or 0.8 mg/kg bw fumonisin B1 from postnatal day 3 to day 12 resulted in reduced body weight gain and decreasedsurvival. Both sphinganine concentration and sphinganine/sphingosine ratios in the brainwere increased at the higher dose. To investigate the effects of limited nutrition onsphinganine levels and myelinogenesis, rats were given 0.8 mg/kg bw fumonisin B 1or subjected to limited nutrition (temporary removal from dam in the postnatal period) andcompared with a saline control group. Sphinganine levels were increased in rats treatedwith 0.8 mg/kg fumonisin B 1, but not in those given limited nutrition. Myelin deposition was decreased in both the nutritionally limited and the fumonisin B1-exposed rats. These data indicate that sphingolipid metabolism in developing rats is vulnerable tofumonisin B 1, while hypomyelination associated with fumonisin B1may be mediated by limited nutrition (Kwon et al., 1997b). Concentration- and time-dependent increases in sphinganine/sphingosine ratios were found in developing chick embryos after injection of 72 or 360 g of fumonisin B1per egg. A close correlation was observed between disruption of sphingolipid metabolismand tissue lesions detectable by light microscopy (Zacharias et al., 1996). 4.4 Genetic and related effects 4.4.1 Humans No data were available to the Working Group.IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 3304.4.2 Experimental systems (see Table 4 for references) Fumonisin B1was not mutagenic in TA100, TA98 or TA97 or in the SOS repair test with Escherichia coli , whereas a positive result was reported from a Mutatox\u00aeassay (luminescence induction) in the absence of metabolic activation. The compound did not induce unscheduled DNAsynthesis in liver cells of rats in vitro or in vivo and no evidence for DNA-adduct formation with oligonucleotides in vitro was found; however, positive results were obtained in chromosomal aberration assays and in the micronucleus test with rathepatocytes. Furthermore, evidence for induction of DNA damage by fumonisin B 1was found with C6 rat brain glioma cells and human fibroblasts in vitro , and in spleen and liver cells isolated from fumonisin B1-exposed rats. The in-vivo effect could be reversed with -tocopherol and selenium (Atroshi et al., 1999). Positive results were obtained in micronucleus assays in vitro with human-derived hepatoma (HepG2) cells but not with rat hepatocytes. In bone marrow of mice, an increase in formation of micronuclei wasfound after intraperitoneal injection of fumonisin B 1, whereas in a transformation study with a mouse embryo cell line, no response was observed. 4.5 Mechanistic considerations There are no published data demonstrating that fumonisins form DNA adducts (WHO, 2002). Early studies indicated that fumonisin B1gave negative results in bacte- rial mutation assays and in the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay using primary rat hepa-tocytes (IARC, 1993). More recent studies with rat hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo using the Comet assay (DNA migration) have shown that fumonisin B 1induces DNA damage in rodent- and human-derived et al., 1999; Erlich et 2002; et al., 2002) and also chromosomal aberrations or micronucleus formation in human hepatoma cells (Erlich et al ., 2002) and primary rat hepatocytes (Knasm\u00fcller et al., 1997). In some studies, addition of antioxidants reduced the amount of DNA damage,leading to the conclusion that oxidative stress is the cause of the DNA damage (Atroshiet al., 1999; Mobio et al., 2000b). Numerous studies since the previous evaluation of fumonisins (IARC, 1993) have demonstrated that fumonisins alter signalling pathways that control cell behaviour.Thorough reviews of the biochemical and cellular mechanisms implicated infumonisin B 1toxicity and carcinogenicity are available (WHO, 2000; Allaben et al ., 2001; WHO, 2002) and form the basis for much of what follows. Two biochemical modes of action proposed to explain fumonisin-induced diseases in animals, including cancer, invoke disruption of lipid metabolism as the initial phase.Both hypothesized mechanisms are supported by data on carcinogenicity in animalmodels (Gelderblom et al., 20001a,b,c; Merrill et al., 2001; Riley et al., 2001; WHO, 2002) and are similar in many respects.FUMONISIN B1 331IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 332 Table 4.

In line with findings in human cell lines (Biswal et al., 2000; Charles et al., 2001), human primary cell cultures (Tolleson et al., 1999), non-human primates (Van der Westhuizen et al., 2001) and all other animals tested (reviewed in WHO, 2000, 2002), human exposure tofumonisins is also associated with evidence of disruption of sphingolipid metabolism(Qiu & Liu, 2001). Alterations in the free sphinganine/free sphingosine ratio, a conse-quence of ceramide synthase inhibition, are now used as a biomarker for exposure tofumonisins in domestic animals (Riley et al., 1994a,b) and humans (Van der Westhuizen et al., 1999; Qiu & Liu, 2001; Ribar et al., 2001). Turner et al. (1999) reviewed potential problems of using sphingoid base ratios as a functional biomarker for exposure to fumo-nisin B 1in humans. The second biochemical mechanism proposes changes in polyunsaturated fatty acids and phospholipid pools (Gelderblom et al., 1996b). This mechanism is supported by data from studies with rat liver (reviewed in WHO, 2002) and human cell lines (Pinelli et al., 1999; Seegers et al., 2000). The cellular consequences of both biochemical modes of action provide support for a non-genotoxic mechanism of carcinogenicity. It is proposed that alterations in cellgrowth, death and differentiation due to disruption of lipid-mediated signalling andregulatory pathways lead to an imbalance between the rates of apoptosis and proli-feration and that this imbalance is a critical determinant in the process of hepato- andnephrotoxicity and tumorigenesis in animal models (reviewed in WHO, 2002). 4.5.1 Interference with sphingolipid metabolism (a)Sphingolipid chemistry and function Sphingolipids are a highly diverse class of lipids found in all eukaryotic cells. The biological functions are equally diverse: the compounds serve as structural componentsrequired for maintenance of membrane integrity, as receptors for vitamins and toxins, assites for cell-cell recognition and cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion, as modulators ofreceptor function and as lipid second messengers in signalling pathways responsible forcell growth, differentiation and death (Merrill et al., 1997). (b)Inhibition of ceramide synthase In every cell line and animal, plant or fungus in which it has been tested, fumo- nisin B1inhibits This the tricarboxylic acid side-chains (fatty acyl-CoA domain) of fumonisin B 1 (Merrill et al., 2001) (Figure 3).IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 334(c)Sphingoid base accumulation When ceramide synthase is completely inhibited, either in vitro or in vivo , the intra- cellular sphinganine and sometimes sphingosine concentration increases rapidly. In vivo there is a close relationship between the amount of sphinganine accumulated and theexpression of fumonisin toxicity in liver and kidney (Riley et al. , 1994a,b; Tsunoda et al. , 1998; Riley et al., 2001; V oss et al. , 2001). Accumulated free sphingoid bases can persist in tissues (especially kidney) much longer than fumonisin B 1(most recently shown by Enongene et al., et al., 2001; Enongene et al. , 2002a,b). In urine from rats fed fumonisin B1, nearly all the free sphinganine is recovered in dead cells. A sub-threshold dose in rats or mice can prolong the elevation of free sphinganine in urineor kidney caused by a higher dose (Wang et al., 1999; Enongene et al., 2002a,b). Fumo- nisin B 1-induced elevation of free sphingoid base levels and toxicity are both reversible, although elimination of free sphinganine from the liver is more rapid than from thekidney (Enongene et al., 2000; Garren et 2002a,b). In fumonisin B feed, changes in the sphinganine/sphin- gosine ratio in serum were seen before hepatic enzymes were notably elevated (Wanget al., 1992; Riley et al., 1997).FUMONISIN B1 335 Figure 3. Proposed model illustrating how the tricarboxylic acid groups and free amino group of fumonisin B1mimic the fatty acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and free sphinganine respectively, in the active site of ceramide synthase. Forfumonisin B 1, the interaction is primarily electrostatic; for the normal substrates, there are also hydrophobic interactions involving partitioning into the lipid bilayer Modified from Merrill et al. (1996, 2001)(d)Sphingoid base metabolite, fatty acid to other pathways. when sphinganine accumulates,it is metabolized to sphinganine 1-phosphate. The breakdown of sphinganine 1-phos-phate results in the production of a fatty acid aldehyde and ethanolamine phosphate. Bothproducts are redirected increased of phosphatidylethanolamine (Badiani et al ., 1996). Disrupted sphingolipid metabolism leads to imbalances in phosphoglycerolipid, fatty acid metabolism andcholesterol metabolism via free of ceramide synthase can cause a wide spectrum of changes in lipid metabolism and associated lipid-dependent signalling pathways(reviewed in Merrill et al., 2001). (e)Disruption of sphingolipid metabolism and in-vivo toxicity Disruption of sphingolipid metabolism, as shown by statistically significant increases in free sphinganine concentration, usually occurs at or below doses of fumo-nisin that cause liver or kidney lesions in short-term studies with rats, rabbits, mice, pigs,horses and many other species of animals and plants (reviewed in WHO, 2002). In somestudies, significant increases in free sphingoid bases occur at doses that are higher thanfor other markers of hepatic effects (Liu et al., 2001). Nevertheless, many studies show a close correlation between elevation of free sphinganine levels and increased apoptosisin liver and kidney (Riley et al., 2001). For example, fumonisin B 1induced an increase in the sphinganine/sphingosine ratio in kidney tissue and urine, which correlated withincreased incidence of non-neoplastic and neoplastic kidney lesions in a long-termfeeding study with Fischer 344/N Nctr rats (National Toxicology Program, 2000;Howard et al., 2001). However, in livers of female B6C3F 1/Nctr mice, elevation of free sphinganine and the sphinganine/sphingosine ratio were significantly increased onlyafter 3 and 9 weeks at 50 and 80 mg fumonisin B 1per kg of diet, doses that also induced liver adenoma and carcinoma (National Toxicology Program, 2000). Fumonisin B1-induced hepatotoxicity in both female and male Sprague-Dawley rats in vivo was associated with free sphinganine concentrations in liver tissue of approxi- mately 20 nmol/g fresh tissue. At the non-hepatotoxic dietary concentration of 50 ppm[mg/kg] fumonisin B 1, the free sphinganine levels were 12 and 4 nmol/g tissue in females and males, respectively. In contrast, nephrotoxic concentrations of fumonisin B1in the diet (50 ppm for females, 15 ppm for males) were associated with free sphinganine levelsof 146 and 129 nmol/g tissue, respectively. For the female rats, this was a 10-foldincrease of free sphinganine over the level measured at the non-nephrotoxic concen-tration of 15 ppm fumonisin B 1in the diet (V oss et al. , 1996a). This is similar to the renal free sphinganine concentrations (100-134 nmol/g fresh tissue) associated withIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 336significantly nephropathy and the hepatic free sphinganine concentrations (5-15 nmol/g fresh tissue) associated with significantly increased hepatopathy in maleBALB/c mice (Sharma et al., 1997; Tsunoda et al., 1998). Fumonisin B 1is not a com- plete carcinogen in the rainbow trout model; however, a close correlation was reportedbetween the elevated level of free sphinganine in liver and fumonisin B 1-mediated promotion of aflatoxin B1-induced hepatocarcinogenicity (Carlson et al., 2001). (f)Free sphingoid bases as functional biomarkers in humans Several studies have examined the use of the elevation of free sphinganine in human urine or blood as an indicator of exposure to fumonisin B1, with mixed success. For example, van der Westhuizen et al. (1999) found no relationship between urine or serum sphingoid base levels and dietary fumonisin B1intake. However, in this study, the levels of fumonisin B1in the diet were low. A recent study conducted in China found that the free sphinganine to free sphingosine ratio was significantly greater in urine collected inhouseholds with an estimated fumonisin B 1intake above 110 g/kg bw/day (Qiu & Liu, 2001). A study conducted in the endemic nephropathy area of Croatia found statisticallysignificant differences (compared with control groups) in free sphingoid bases in serumand urine of individuals living in the region but not affected by endemic nephropathy.However, in this study dietary exposure to fumonisin B 1was not established, although exposure to a mycotoxin or environmental factor that impaired sphingolipid metabolismwas suggested (Ribar et al., 2001). (g)Sphingolipid metabolites and apoptosis Numerous studies using cultured cells have demonstrated sphingolipid-dependent mechanisms for inducing apoptosis. For example, accumulation of excess ceramide,glucosylceramide (Korkotian et al. , 1999) or sphingoid bases, or depletion of ceramide or more complex sphingolipids have all been shown to induce apoptotic or oncotic celldeath (WHO, 2000; Merrill et al. , 2001; Riley et al. , 2001; WHO, 2002). Conversely, the balance between sphingosine 1-phosphate and ceramide is critical for signalling prolife-ration and cell survival (Spiegel, 1999). It can be expected that there will also be a diver-sity of alterations in cellular regulation resulting from imbalances in sphingolipid meta-bolite and product pools resulting from inhibition by fumonisin B 1of ceramide synthase (Figure 4). This is best demonstrated by the numerous recent studies with fumonisin B1 identifying cell processes that are ceramide-mediated; for example, the ability of fumo-nisin B 1to protect oxidant-damaged cells from apoptosis and to alter the proliferative response (WHO, 2000; Riley et al. , 2001; WHO, 2002). In addition to the many studies cited previously, experiments with fumonisin B1have revealed new roles for de-novo ceramide production of apoptosis et al. , 2001; Zhong et al. , 2001). In many of the examples cited above, short-termFUMONISIN B1 337treatment with fumonisin B1protected against ceramide-mediated cell death. In contrast, prolonged exposure to fumonisin B1in vivo and in vitro is toxic to cells and induces apoptosis (WHO, 2000, 2002). Perhaps the best evidence for a cause-and-effect relation-ship between disruption of sphingolipid metabolism and the toxic effects of fumonisin B 1 has come from studies conducted in vitro using inhibitors of serine palmitoyltransferase to prevent sphinganine accumulation and reverse the increased apoptosis and altered cellgrowth induced by fumonisin B 1treatment (WHO, 2000; Kim et al. , 2001; et al. , 2001; Yu et al. 2001; He et al. , 2002; WHO, 2002). (h)Depletion of complex sphingolipids Depletion of more complex sphingolipids also plays a role in the abnormal behaviour, altered morphology and altered proliferation of fumonisin-treated cells (WHO, 2000;Merrill et al., 2001; Riley et al., 2001; WHO, 2002), and this has been proposed as a mechanism in fumonisin B 1-induced nephrotoxicity in male rats (Hard et al., 2001) through the disruption of cell-cell interactions. Numerous studies have demonstrated theIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 338 Figure 4. Pathways of sphingolipid biosynthesis and turnover in a mammaliancell. In boxes are the known biological activities affected by fumonisin B 1(FB1) inhibition of ceramide synthase and associated with changes in the biosynthesisof various sphingolipid intermediates and products For additional details, see Merrill et al. (2001); Riley et al. (2001) Sphingosine 1-P, sphingosine 1-phosphateability of fumonisin to alter the function of specific glycosphingolipids and lipid rafts (membrane associations of sphingolipids, ceramide-anchored proteins and other lipids).Examples of these functions are inhibition of folate transport, bacterial toxin binding andtransport (e.g., Shigella and cholera toxin), cell-cell and cell-substratum contact and cell- cell communication (WHO, 2000; Riley et al., 2001; Merrill et al. , 2001; WHO, 2002). (i) Increased dihydroceramide in vivo In fumonisin-treated animals (pigs, horses, mice), there is an increased amount of complex sphingolipids containing sphinganine as the long-chain sphingoid-base back-bone (see for example, Riley et al., 1993). The ceramide generated from these complex sphingolipids is dihydroceramide, which is inactive in ceramide signalling and does notinduce death of oxidant-damaged hepatocytes (Arora et al., 1997). Dihydroceramide is also enriched in mouse hepatoma-22 cells, in which sphinganine comprised 37% of theceramides as compared with 5% in normal rat liver (Rylova et al., 1999). (j) Hypothesized cellular mechanism In cultured cells, the balance between the intracellular concentration of sphingolipid effectors that protect cells from apoptosis (decreased ceramide, increased sphingosine1-phosphate) and the effectors that induce apoptosis (increased ceramide, increased freesphingoid bases, increased fatty acids) determines the observed cellular response(reviewed in Merrill et al., 2001; Riley et al., 2001). Cells sensitive to the proliferative effect of decreased ceramide and increased sphingosine 1-phosphate will be selected tosurvive and proliferate. Conversely, when the increase in free sphingoid bases exceedsthe ability of a cell to convert sphinganine/sphingosine to dihydroceramide/ceramide ortheir sphingoid base 1-phosphate, free sphingoid bases will accumulate to toxic levels.Cells that are sensitive to sphingoid base-induced growth arrest will cease growing andinsensitive cells will survive. Thus, the kinetics of fumonisin B 1elimination (rapid), the affinity of fumonisin B1for ceramide (competitive and reversible) and the kinetics of fumonisin-induced sphinganine elevation will influence the time course,amplitude and frequency of variations in the concentration of intracellular ceramide,sphingoid base-1 phosphates and free sphinganine in tissues of animals consumingfumonisins (Enongene et al., 2002a,b). This is important, because the balance between the rates of apoptosis and cell proliferation is a critical determinant in the process ofhepato- and nephrotoxicity and tumorigenesis in animal models (Dragan et al., 2001; Howard et al., 2001; V oss et al., 2001). At the cellular level, it is hypothesized that apop- totic necrosis should be considered to be similar to oncotic necrosis (as defined in Levinet al., 1999), in that both will lead to a regenerative process involving sustained cell proliferation (Dragan et al., 2001; Hard et al., 2001). Numerous endogenous processes can cause DNA damage that, if unrepaired, can give rise to a mutation in the DNA.Increased cell proliferation may thus involve replication of mutated DNA, resulting in anincreased risk for cancer (Dragan et al., 2001).FUMONISIN B1 3394.5.2 Interference with fatty acid and glycerophospholipid metabolism (a)Importance of fatty acids Essential fatty acids are major constituents of all cell membrane glycerophospho- lipids, sphingolipids and triglycerides. In addition to their important role as structuralcomponents of all cell membranes, essential fatty acids are precursors of many bioactivelipids known to regulate cell growth, differentiation and cell death. (b)Interference with fatty acid metabolism In rat liver and primary hepatocytes exposed to fumonisin B1, changes in the phos- pholipid profile and fatty acid composition of phospholipids indicate that fumonisin B1 interferes with fatty acid metabolism (Gelderblom et al., 1996b). The following summary is taken from the review by Gelderblom et al. (2001a) and the WHO monograph (WHO, 2002). (c)Altered lipid metabolism in rat hepatocytes in vitro Gelderblom et al. (1996b) showed that, in fumonisin B1-treated rat hepatocytes, the pattern of changes in specific polyunsaturated fatty acids suggested disruption of the 6 desaturase and cyclo-oxygenase metabolic pathways (Figure 5). These changes wereconsidered to be important in the fumonisin B 1-induced toxicity observed in primary hepatocytes (Gelderblom et al., 2001a; WHO, 2002). (d)Altered lipid metabolism in rat liver in vivo In-vivo studies have confirmed that fumonisin B1disrupts fatty acid and phospho- lipid biosynthesis, but the pattern of changes is different from that observed in vitro (Gelderblom et al ., 1997). Major changes are associated with both the phosphatidyl- ethanolamine and the phosphatidylcholine phospholipid fractions, while cholesterollevels are increased in both the serum and liver (Gelderblom et al., 2001a; WHO, 2002). A characteristic fatty acid pattern (Figure 6) is seen in the liver of rats exposed to dietaryfumonisin B 1levels associated with the development of preneoplastic lesions and in liver of rats fed fumonisin B1after treatment with cancer initiators. (e)Altered signalling for cell survival At the fumonisin B1doses that have been shown to alter fatty acid and glycero- phospholipid profiles in rat liver, there are numerous changes in expression of proteinsknown to be involved in the regulation of cell growth, apoptosis and cell differentiation(WHO, 2002). For example, expression of factor factor (TGF ), TGF c- all short-term feeding of fumonisin B1. Overexpression of TGF 1could play a role in the increased apoptosis, while the increased expression of the proto-oncogene c- myc could contribute to the enhanced cell proliferation that is required for the tumour progressionIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 340observed in the liver of rats and mice exposed to hepatotoxic levels of fumonisin B1 (Figure 6). Increased expression of c- myc and TGF 1may also play a role in the promotion of liver tumours by fumonisin B1 (Lemmer et al., 1999a). (f)Altered cell cycle progression B1disruption of sphingolipid metabolism and altered membrane pho- spholipids in the liver of BD IX rats have been suggested to cause the changes seen inseveral proteins (e.g., cyclin D1, retinoblastoma protein) that regulate cell cycle pro-gression. Accumulation of cyclin D1 was due to post-translational stabilization of theprotein (Ramljak et al., 2000). Fumonisin B 1-induced alterations in cellular glycerophospholipid content and the sphingomyelin cycle have been proposed to interact so as to modify a variety of cellularprocesses, resulting in the increased apoptosis and altered hepatocyte proliferation thatare seen in liver of rats fed toxic doses of fumonisin B 1(Figure 6). The balance between lipid mediators generated via the cyclo-oxygenase-2 and ceramide cycle could regulateprocesses related to cell proliferation and apoptosis. As summarized in Figure 6, fumo-nisin B 1-induced changes in ceramide, prostaglandins and other lipid mediators could alter the growth and survival of normal hepatocytes. Overexpression of TGF 1andFUMONISIN B1 341 Figure 5. A model for the proposed interference by fumonisin B1(FB1) with delta 6 (6) desaturase activity and consequent effects on the fatty acid composition of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and changes in thecyclo-oxygenase metabolic pathway For additional Gelderblom PGE1and PGE2, prostaglandin E1and E2c-myc and oxidative damage could further enhance apoptosis and alter cell growth in affected hepatocytes (Gelderblom et al., 2001a; WHO, 2002). (g)Hypothesized cellular mechanism Fumonisin B1has been shown to alter cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo . The fumonisin B1-induced effects on membrane lipids and the resultant effects on signalling pathways that involve lipid mediators could create an environment in which the growthof normal cells is impaired. Differential inhibition of cell proliferation is a possiblemechanism by which hepatocytes resistant to fumonisin B 1-induced inhibition of cell growth are selectively stimulated, while growth of normal hepatocytes is inhibited. Thisselective inhibition of normal cell growth could increase the chances of survival of DNA-damaged hepatocytes, resulting in an increased likelihood of cancer development(Gelderblom et al., 2001a; WHO, 2002). IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 +, stimulatory; -, inhibitory or decreased; ?, response may be either increased or decreased (see Section 4.5.1); SM, sphingomyelinModified from Gelderblom 2 () (+)Figure 6. Proposed biochemical effects and cellular responses associated with fumo- nisin B1 (FB1)-induced alterations in and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)Three lines of evidence support the hypothesis that fumonisin B1-induced alterations in lipid metabolism contribute to the establishment of a growth differential in rat liverthat could influence the process of neoplastic development. First, fumonisin B 1induces an increase in phosphatidylethanolamine and arachidonic acid (C20 : 4 6) (Gelderblom et al., 2001a), lipid mediators that are known to regulate many processes related to cell growth, such as proliferation and apoptosis (Khan et al., 1995; Gelderblom et al., 1999; Pinelli et al., 1999; Seegers et al., 2000; Abel et al., 2001). Second, the decrease in the concentration of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in hepatocytes exposed to fumo-nisin B 1will produce a more rigid membrane structure, resulting in increased resistance to lipid peroxidation. Third, lipid metabolites, and in particular glycerophospholipids,are important components of many cellular signalling systems that control the balancebetween cell growth and cell death. Thus, changes in these lipid pools will alter responseto growth factors and other mediators of cell survival. Fumonisin B 1-induced disruption of lipid metabolism and the consequent induction of oxidative damage and lipid peroxidation (Abel & Gelderblom, 1998; WHO, 2002)could be important events leading to DNA damage, whereas changes in the balance ofthe different cell regulatory molecules such as those seen in livers of rats fed fumonisinB 1are likely to be involved in the induction of a growth differential that selectively stimulates the survival of damaged hepatocytes and the development of cancer in rats. 4.5.3 Other biochemical mechanisms Several in-vitro studies with fumonisins have found changes in cellular regulation and cell functions that have been attributed to processes other than lipid metabolism(WHO, 2000, 2002). Many of these effects could be relevant to the organ toxicity offumonisins. Examples are the direct or indirect effects on protein kinase C (Huang et al. , 1995; Yeung et al., 1996), activity of extracellular regulated kinases (Pinelli et al. , 1999), altered DNA and increased lipid peroxidation (Mobio et al. , 2000a,b) and alterations in the tumour necrosis factor (TNF ) signalling pathways (He al. , 2001; Sharma et al. , 2001). 5. Summary of Data Reported and Evaluation 5.1 Exposure data Fumonisin B1is the most prevalent member of a family of toxins produced by several species of Fusarium moulds which occur mainly in maize. Fumonisin B1conta- mination of maize has been reported worldwide at mg/kg levels. Human exposure occursat levels of micrograms to milligrams per day and is greatest in regions where maizeproducts are the dietary staple.FUMONISIN B1 3435.2 Human carcinogenicity data No new studies on the human carcinogenicity of fumonisins were available to the Working Group. 5.3 Animal carcinogenicity data Fumonisin B1has been tested for carcinogenicity by oral administration in one study in mice, one study in male rats and one study in male and female rats. In female mice, itcaused an increase in hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas. In one study in male rats,it caused an increase in cholangiocarcinomas and hepatocellular carcinomas. In the otherrat study, it induced renal tubule carcinomas in male rats, over half of which wereclassified as a rare highly malignant variant. Fumonisin B 1has also been shown to promote tumours in mouse skin and trout livers when 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene and aflatoxin B1, respectively, were used as tumour initiators. 5.4 Other relevant data Fumonisins are poorly absorbed, rapidly excreted and not metabolized in animal systems. The half-life for elimination in animal species is directly related to the averagebody weight of the species, suggesting that the half-life in humans will be longer thanthose determined experimentally in rats and other animals. Fumonisin B 1is hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic in all animal species tested. The earliest histological change to appear in either the liver or kidney of fumonisin-treated animals isincreased apoptosis followed by regenerative cell proliferation. While the acute toxicityof fumonisin is low, it is the known cause of two diseases which occur in domesticanimals with rapid onset: equine leukoencephalomalacia and porcine pulmonary oedemasyndrome. Both of these diseases involve disturbed sphingolipid metabolism and cardio-vascular dysfunction. Fumonisin B 1causes developmental toxicity in several animal species. In rats, mice and rabbits, developmental effects occurred at dose levels associated with disruption ofsphingolipid metabolism and maternal toxicity in liver and kidney. Postnatal dosing causes decreased survival of rat pups and results indicate that sphingolipid metabolism is vulnerable after birth. Fumonisin B 1is inactive in bacterial mutation assays and in the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay with rat hepatocytes, but induces DNA damage, such as micronuclei,in vitro and in vivo . In some studies, addition of antioxidants reduced the DNA-damaging effects of fumonisin B 1, suggesting that the effects may be due to oxidative stress. Disruption of various aspects of lipid metabolism, membrane structure and signal transduction pathways mediated by lipid second messengers appears to be an importantIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 344aspect of all the various proposed mechanisms of action of fumonisin B1, including its mechanism of carcinogenicity. Fumonisin sphingolipid, phospholipid and is observed both in vitro andin vivo in all animal models and in a single human study. Disruption of sphingolipid metabolism by fumonisin B1in animal and human systems in vitro causes cell death and regenerative cell proliferation mediated through sphingolipid signalling pathways. The kinetics of the increases and decreases in thevarious bioactive sphingolipid pools in liver, kidney, lung and heart are correlated withthe observed toxicity. 5.5 Evaluation There is inadequate evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of fumonisins. There is sufficient evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of fumonisin B1. Overall evaluation Fumonisin B1is possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) . 6.

Typical specifications are: of the technical product is at least 95%. Virtually the sole impurity found in naphthalene obtained from coal tar is benzo[ b]thiophene (thia- naphthene). Methylindenes are essentially the only impurities found in naphthalenederived from petroleum (BUA, 1989). Trade names for naphthalene include: chromatography is used extensively to determine the naphthalene content of mixtures. Naphthalene can be separated easily from thionaphthalene, the methyl- anddimethylnaphthalenes and other aromatics. Analysis of other impurities may require theuse of high-resolution capillary columns (Mason, 1995). Selected methods for theanalysis of naphthalene in various media are presented in Table 1.IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 368 1Calculated from: mg/m3= (relative molecular mass/24.45) \u00d7ppm, assuming a temperature of 25 \u00b0C and a pressure of 101 kPa NAPHTHALENE 369Table 1.

Naphthalene has long been produced by the destructive distillation of high-temperaturecoal tars, called carbonization or coking (IARC, 1985). Coal tar was the traditionalsource of naphthalene until the late 1950s when it was in short supply, and the generationof naphthalene from petroleum by dealkylation of aromatics-rich fractions from refor-ming and catalytic cracking became commercially viable (IARC, 1989). In 1960, thefirst petroleum-naphthalene plant was brought on stream in the USA and, by the late1960s, petroleum-derived naphthalene accounted for over 40% of total US naphthaleneproduction. The availability of large quantities of ortho -xylene during the 1970s undercut the position of naphthalene as the prime raw material for phthalic anhydride. In1971, 45% of phthalic anhydride capacity in was based on naphthalene, ascompared with only 29% in 1979 and 17% in 1990. The last dehydroalkylation plant forpetroleum naphthalene was shut down late in 1991 (Mason, 1995). World production of naphthalene in 1987 was around one million tonnes; about one- fourth came from western Europe (210 thousand tonnes), one-fifth each from Japan (175thousand tonnes) and eastern Europe (180 thousand tonnes) and one-eighth from theUSA (107 thousand tonnes). In 2000, over 90% of naphthalene in the USA was producedfrom coal tar; most naphthalene in western Europe was produced from coal tar; and allnaphthalene produced in Japan was from coal tar (Lacson, 2000). Naphthalene supplyand demand by major region in 2000 is presented in Table 2. Available information onproduction trends in Japan, the USA and western Europe is summarized in Table 3. Information available in 2001 indicated that crude naphthalene was manufactured by 36 companies in China, six companies in Japan, four companies each in Brazil andRussia, three companies each in Spain and the USA, two companies each in Argentina,India and Ukraine, and one company each in Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Bosnia,Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Italy, Korea (Republic of), Mexico, theNetherlands, Turkey and the United Kingdom.

Naphthalene (grade unspecified) was manufactured by 39companies in China, three companies in Ukraine, two companies each in Germany andMexico, and one company each in Brazil, India, Japan, Russia, Turkey, the UnitedKingdom and the USA (Chemical Information Services, 2001). 1.3 Use The main use for naphthalene worldwide is the production of phthalic anhydride by vapour-phase catalytic oxidation, particularly in Japan and the USA, where thisaccounted for 73% and 60% of naphthalene demand, respectively, in 1999. Phthalicanhydride is used as an intermediate for polyvinyl chloride plasticizers, such as di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate. Naphthalene is also used in the manufacture of a wide variety ofintermediates for the dye industry; in the manufacture of synthetic resins, celluloid,lampblack and smokeless powder; and in the manufacture of hydronaphthalenes(Tetralin (tetrahydronaphthalene), Decalin (decahydronaphthalene)) which are used assolvents, in lubricants and in motor fuels (Mason, 1995; Lacson, 2000; O'Neil et al. , 2001). Naphthalene sulfonates represent a growing outlet for naphthalene. The products are used as wetting agents and dispersants in paints and coatings and in a variety of pesti-cides and cleaner formulations. Naphthalene is also a starting material for the manu-facture of 1-naphthyl- N-methylcarbamate (carbaryl), an insecticide, and several other organic compounds and intermediates (Mason, 1995; Lacson, 2000). The use of naphthalene as a moth-repellent and insecticide is decreasing due to the introduction of chlorinated compounds such a para-dichlorobenzene. In 2000, about 6500 tonnes of naphthalene were used (in Japan (1100 tonnes), the USA (450 tonnes) andEurope (5000 tonnes)), in moth-proofing and fumigation. Another new use for naph-thalene is in production of polyethylene naphthalene for making plastic beer bottles. Ithas also been used in veterinary medicine in dusting powders, as an insecticide and inter-nally as an intestinal antiseptic and vermicide (Sax & Lewis, 1987; Agency et al. , 2001). Consumption of naphthalene by major region in selected years is presented in Table 4 .NAPHTHALENE 3731.4 Occurrence 1.4.1 Natural occurrence Naphthalene, discovered in 1819 by A. Garden (BUA, 1989), is a natural constituent of coal tar and crude oil, which are major contributors to its presence in the environment.They contain up to 11% and 1.3% of the chemical, respectively (BUA, 1989; O'Neilet al. , 2001). Forest fires also contribute to the presence of naphthalene in the envi- ronment, as the chemical is a natural combustion product of wood (Agency for ToxicSubstances and Disease Registry, 1995a). 1.4.2 Occupational exposure From the National Occupational Exposure Survey conducted between 1981-83, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) estimated that approxi-mately 113 000 workers, about 4.6% females, in 31 major industrial groups were poten-tially exposed to naphthalene in the USA. The top six industries, by total workers,accounted for over 50% of the total potentially exposed workers. The petroleum and coalproducts and oil and gas extraction industries were among the top three industries andcomprised about 21.4% of the workers potentially exposed to naphthalene. An estimated1840 agricultural services workers were exposed to naphthalene; over 87% were females(National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 1990; National ToxicologyProgram, 1992).IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 374 Table 4.

On the basis of the major results summarized in Table 5, the following ranking of respiratoryexposure to naphthalene in the major industries can be made: creosote impregnation> coke manufacturing > asphalt industry > other industries. Exposure to naphthalene hasalso been extensively measured in Germany. Samples collected between 1991 and 1995were predominantly from wood manufacturing (50%), construction (16%) and metal-working and machine construction (12%). Ninety-five per cent of the available 183measurements from 94 factories were below the analytical limit of detection (1.0 mg/m 3 for a 2-h sampling time). Only in the manufacture of repellents and perfumed disin-fectants were concentrations above the limit of detection (Bock et al., 1999). Naphthalene is the most abundant component of creosote vapour and constitutes 10-16 wt% of creosote oils (Nylund et al., 1992). Dermal wipe samples were taken in a study among asphalt workers; less than 10% of the samples showed detectable concen-trations ranging from 5.5 to 520 ng/cm 2(Hicks, 1995). Urinary naphthols have been measured as biomarkers of occupational exposure to naphthalene (Bieniek, 1997) (see Section 4.1.1( c)). 1.4.3 Environmental occurrence The extensive use of naphthalene as an intermediate in the production of plasticizers, resins, insecticides and surface active agents, its presence as a major component of coaltar and coal-tar products such as creosote and its inclusion in a wide variety of consumerproducts (e.g., moth-repellents) has led to its frequent occurrence in industrial effluentsand outdoor and indoor environments (Agency for Toxic Substances and DiseaseRegistry, 1995a,b; Environmental Protection Agency, 2001). Naphthalene has been identified in the USA by the Environmental Protection Agency (2001) and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (1995b) as one of themost commonly found substances at hazardous waste sites on the 'National PrioritiesList'. In the USA, naphthalene is listed as one of 189 hazardous air pollutants under theClean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Title III) of the Environmental Protection Agencywhich mandates reduction of its emissions (Environmental Protection Agency, 1990b;Kelly et al ., 1994). Naphthalene features in the Canadian Priority List of hazardous substances (Fellin & Otson, 1994). The general population is exposed to naphthalene principally by inhalation of ambient and indoor air, with naphthalene-containing moth-repellents and tobacco smokeas the main contributors. Another source is the use of kerosene heaters (Traynor et al., 1990). Assuming an urban/suburban average air concentration of 0.95 g/m 3and an inhalation rate of 20 m3per day, it has been estimated that the average daily intake of naphthalene from ambient air in the USA is 19 g (Howard, 1989; Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 1995a). Much lower exposure to naphthalene mayoccur from ingestion of drinking-water and/or food. Estimated exposure from drinking-NAPHTHALENE 375IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 376 Table 5.

(a)Air Most of the naphthalene entering the environment is discharged to the air (92.2%), the largest releases (more than 50%) resulting from the combustion of wood and fossilfuels and the off-gassing of naphthalene-containing moth-repellents and deodorants. In1989, about 12 million pounds [5.5 million kg] were released from these sources. Thehighest atmospheric concentrations of naphthalene have been found in the immediatevicinity of specific industrial sources and hazardous waste sites (Agency for ToxicSubstances and Disease Registry, 1995a). Air emissions in the USA reported to theEnvironmental Protection Agency decreased from 1598 tonnes for 473 industrial faci-lities in 1989 to 1224 tonnes for 744 industrial facilities in 1999 (Environmental Pro-tection Agency, 2001). The median ambient air concentration of naphthalene determined at nine locations (84 samples) in the USA was 1.2 g/m 3(Kelly et al., 1994). In another series of data from 1970-87, the average concentration of naphthalene in ambient air at several locations inthe USA was 0.991 ppb [5.19 g/m 3] for 67 samples, 60 of which were from source- dominated locations (Shah & Heyerdahl, 1988). In the USA, the Environmental Protection Agency (2000) reviewed studies and calculated summary statistics for concentrations of chemicals in indoor air from selectedsources, including naphthalene. Studies were selected which provided the best availableestimates of 'typical concentrations' in indoor environments. These sources included theBuilding Assessment Survey and Evaluation (BASE) study, National Association ofEnergy Service Companies (NAESCO) study and School Intervention Studies (SIS). Thedata are reported in Table 6. [The Working group noted the unusually high outdoor airconcentration in the School Intervention Studies, the fact that it is based on only threepositive observations and that the original data in this review are unpublished.]IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 378 Table 6.

An average naphthalene concentrationof 170 g/m 3in outdoor air in a residential area of Columbus, OH (Chuang et al., 1991) and a concentration of 3.3 g/m3naphthalene in ambient air in Torrance, CA, have also been reported (Propper, 1988; Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 1995a). Average naphthalene concentrations in ambient air at five hazardous waste sites and one landfill in New Jersey ranged from 0.42 to 4.6 g/m3(range of arithmetic means) (LaRegina et al., 1986). Naphthalene wasfound at concentrations of less than 0.6 ng/m3 in the air above shale-oil wastewaters in Wyoming (Hawthorne & Sievers, 1984). Naphthalene was found in particulate matter in the atmosphere of La Plata, Argentina, at concentrations ranging from 0.18 \u00b11.05 ng/m3to 13.2 \u00b11.30 ng/m3when sampled on seven occasions between September 1984 and June 1986 (Catoggio et al., 1989). In a study to compare naphthalene concentrations (among 35 volatile organic com- pounds) in indoor and outdoor air in northern Italy in 1983-84, the mean values foundin indoor and outdoor samples were 11 and 2 g/m 3, respectively, with the median indoor/outdoor ratio being 4 for 11 samples (De Bortoli et al., 1986). Average indoor air concentrations in various residential areas in the USA ranged from 0.75 to 1600 g/m3(Chuang et al., 1991 (measurements done in 1986-87); Wilson & Chung, 1991). A more representative upper limit concentration of naphthalene inindoor air of 32 g/m 3was recorded in buildings in heavy traffic urban areas of Taiwan (Hung et al., 1992). In a study of the effect of smoking on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon levels, including naphthalene, in eight homes in the USA, naphthalene was found in the livingroom of homes of smokers (with gas heating and electric cooking) and homes of non-smokers (electric heating and cooking) at concentrations of 2.2 g/m 3and 1.8 g/m3, respectively, and the respective outdoors concentrations of naphthalene were 0.33 and0.11 g/m 3(Wilson & Chuang, 1991). In a summary of concentrations of volatile organic compounds in 230 homes in Germany, naphthalene was found at a mean concentration of 2.3 g/m3with a range of < 1.0-14 g/m3; the 50th and 90th percentiles were 2.1 and 3.9 g/m3, respectively (Gold et al ., 1993). In a study of the relationship between climatic factors and the concentrations of 26 volatile organic compounds in Canadian homes in 1991, naphtha-lene concentrations in the winter, spring, summer and autumn were 3.24, 1.10, 3.82 and8.10 g/m 3, respectively (Fellin & Otson, 1994). In a comparison of naphthalene concentrations in the indoor air of 50 normal and 38 'sick' homes (in which peoplecomplained about the odour or had symptoms) in Finland, naphthalene was found at amedian concentration of 0.31 g/m 3in normal homes (with 6% of normal houses having 1.5-3.1 g/m3), while in 'sick' has been identified in the emissions of diesel light-duty vehicles (2-6 mg naphthalene released per km 'distance' driven on a chassis dynamometer)NAPHTHALENE 379(Scheepers & Bos, 1992). The average concentration of naphthalene reported inside automobiles in commuter traffic was about 4.5 g/m3(L\u00f6fgren et al., 1991). (b)Water Naphthalene released to the atmosphere may be transported to surface water and/or soil by wet or dry deposition. About 2-3% of naphthalene emitted to air is transported toother environmental media by dry deposition (Coons et al ., 1982; Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 1995a). Naphthalene is degraded in water by photo-lysis and biological processes. The half-life for photolysis of naphthalene in surfacewater is about 71 h, but in deeper water (5 m) it is estimated to be 550 days (Agency forToxic Substances and Disease Registry, 1995a). Surface water discharges of naphthalene from 744 industrial facilities in the USA in 1999 amounted to 17.7 tonnes, as reported to the Toxics Release Inventory. An additional73 tonnes of naphthalene were discharged though underground injection (EnvironmentalProtection Agency, 2001). About 5% of all naphthalene entering the environment isreleased to water, mostly arising from coal tar production and distillation processes(Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 1995a). Naphthalene was detected in 7% of 630 ambient water samples in the USA at a median concentration of less than 10 g/L, as shown in an analysis of 1980-82 data from the Environmental Protection Agency STORET (STOrage and RETrieval) database(Staples et al ., 1985; Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 1995a). Naphthalene was also detected in 11% of 86 urban run-off samples up to 1982 at concen-trations ranging from 0.8 to 2.3 g/L (Cole et al., 1984). In the USA, naphthalene was detected in 35% of samples of groundwater at an average concentration of 3.3 mg/L at five wood-treatment facilities (Rosenfeld & Plumb,1991) and in leachate or groundwater plume from industrial and municipal landfills atconcentration ranges of < 10-19 mg/L and 0.1-19 mg/L, respectively (Brown & Donnelly,1988). Naphthalene was detected in groundwater samples from three wells at concen-trations of 380, 740 and 1800 g/L, respectively, near an underground coal gasification site in north-western Wyoming (Stuermer et al., 1982). Concentrations of naphthalene ranging from < 0.2 to 63 g/L were detected at five out of six landfill sites in southern Ontario (Barker, 1987). Naphthalene was found at concentrations of 4.3 and 8.8 g/L in two groundwater samples collected near an Orange County landfill site in central Florida(and not in surface water) in 1989-90, but not in 1992-93; this was believed to result fromthe decomposition of municipal solid waste (Chen & Zoltek, 1995). Naphthalene has been infrequently reported in drinking-water (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 1995a). It was found in four samples of drinking-waterextracts at concentrations ranging from 6 to 16 ng/L in Athens, GA, in 1976 (Thruston,1978) and in another area in the USA at concentrations up to 1.4 g/L (Coons et al., 1982). Naphthalene was measured in samples of raw river water from the Adige River, Italy, collected at 19 sampling stations in the Trento province, during two campaigns in 1989,IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 380and detected at average concentrations of 51 ng/L (range, 3-109) and 284 ng/L (range, 3-2240), respectively (Benfenati et al., 1992). It was also detected in two polluted rivers, Bes\u00f3s and Llobregat, in Barcelona, Spain, in 1985-86 at mean concentrations of 1300(SD, 150) ng/L and 180 (SD, 130) ng/L, respectively (Gomez-Belinchon et al., 1991). Naphthalene was one of the main aromatic hydrocarbons detected (at a concentration of0.02 g/L) in surface waters of Admiralty Bay, King George Island, Antarctica, during the summers of 1989, 1990, 1992 and 1993 (B\u00edcego et al., 1996). Naphthalene was found at concentrations of 0.5-35 ng/L (arithmetic mean, 12 ng/L) over 15 months at a coastal site near piers extending into Vineyard Sound, MA, USA. Adominant wintertime source considered was use of space-heating oil, with higherconcentrations of naphthalene found in the winter and lowest concentrations found in thesummer (Gschwend et al., 1982). (c)Soil and sediments Releases of naphthalene to land from 744 industrial facilities in the USA in 1999 amounted to 66 tonnes (Environmental Protection Agency, 2001). In untreated agricultural soils, naphthalene has been found at concentrations ranging from 0 to 3 g/kg in 1942-84 (Wild et al., 1990). It has been found at 6.1 (SD, 0.2) mg/kg in coal tar-contaminated soil (Yu et al., 1990), at 16.7 mg/kg in soil from a former tar-oil refinery (Weissenfels et al., 1992; Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 1995a) and at up to 66 g/kg in sludge-treated soils (Wild et al., 1990). In the USA, naphthalene was reported to be detectable in 7% of 267 sediment samples (with the median concentration for all samples of less than 500 g/kg) entered into the Environmental Protection Agency STORET database (1980-82) (Staples et al., 1985). Naphthalene has been detected in contaminated sediments in Texas, USA, at average concentrations of 54.7 and 61.9 g/kg at 10 m and 25 m from an oil platform and in nearby non-contaminated estuarine sediments at 2.1 g/kg in 1982-85 (Brooks et al., 1990). It was found at 200 mg/kg in a tar-contaminated sediment of the River Warnowat Schwaan near Rostock, Germany, in August 1989 (Randow et al., 1996). Naphthalene was found in all four Canadian marine sediments analysed (representing varying concen-trations and sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contamination) at concen-trations ranging from 0.1 to 115 mg/kg dry sediment (Simpson et al., 1995). Naphthalene concentrations ranging from < 2 to 20.2 mg/kg dry wt were reported in three out of four sediments from lakes in the Northwest Territories in Canada (Lockhartet al., 1992). Primarily due to oxygen limitation, naphthalene persists in coal tar-conta- minated surface sediments (Madsen et al., 1996). Naphthalene concentrations in soils and sewage sludges are usually less than 1 mg/kg in the United Kingdom (Wild & Jones,1993).NAPHTHALENE 381(d)Biodegradation Studies on biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in soil suggest that absorption to organic matter significantly reduces the bioavailability and thus thebiodegradability of naphthalene (Heitzer et al., 1992; Weissenfels et al., 1992; Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 1995a). Reported naphthalene half-lives insoil vary considerably. The estimated half-life of naphthalene reported for a solid wastesite was 3.6 months, while in typical soils more rapid biodegradation is expected to occur(Heitkamp et al. , 1987; Howard, 1989). Biodegradation of naphthalene is accomplished via the action of aerobic micro- organisms and generally declines precipitously when soil conditions become anaerobic(Klecka et al., 1990). Naphthalene biodegrades to carbon dioxide in aerobic soils with salicylate as an intermediate product (Heitzer et al., 1992; Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 1995a). Although polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are persistent in a strictly anaerobic environment, naphthalene can be degraded anaerobically under sulfate-reducingconditions: it was oxidized to carbon dioxide in petroleum-contaminated marine harboursediments in San Diego, CA (Coates et al., 1997). (e)Food Naphthalene was detected in only two of 13 980 samples of foods analysed in six states of the USA in 1988-89 (Minyard & Roberts, 1991). Naphthalene is not generallyreported to be present in fish, but has been detected in shellfish in the USA, with concen-trations ranging from 5 to 176 g/kg in oysters, from 4 to 10 g/kg in mussels and from < 1 to 10 g/kg in clams (Bender & Huggett, 1989). Naphthalene was found in 1993 in many samples of edible portions of nine types of shrimp and fish in Kuwaiti seafood at concentrations ranging from 2 to 156 g/kg dry wt. These elevated concentrations of naphthalene were attributed to the pollution of Kuwait'sterritorial waters with crude oils as a result of oil spillage during the Gulf War or thechronic pollution due to oil production, transportation or natural seepage from theseabed. Naphthalene constituted the highest burden of the 14 polycyclic aromatic hydro-carbons screened (Saeed et al., 1995). Mean concentrations of naphthalene of 19.5 g/kg dry wt have been found in edible muscle of fish collected from the Red Sea coast of Yemen (DouAbul et al ., 1997). Naphthalene has been found at maximum concentrations of 27.7 g/kg and 137 g/kg in muscle and liver tissue, respectively, of burbot fish from lakes in the Northwest Terri-tories in Canada (Lockhart et al., 1992). Naphthalene has also been detected in various fish species collected from the Gulf of Naples, Italy, e.g., in muscle samples of anchovy, comber and rock goby at concen-trations of 63, 4 and 20 g/kg wet wt, respectively, and in razor fish, wart venus and short-necked clams, at levels of 20, 25 and 32 g/kg wet wt, respectively (Cocchieri et al., 1990). IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 382Naphthalene was measured in 1987-88 in six species of aquatic organisms (sea mullet, bony bream, blue catfish, mud crab, pelican and the silver gull) from the BrisbaneRiver estuarine system in Australia. The mean concentrations ( 8 pelican,21.0 (276; 3 samples) and silver gull, 31.6 (395; 3 samples) (Kayal & Connell, 1995). Naphthalene was identified in the neutral fraction of roast beef flavour isolate (Min et al., 1979). Use of a mathematical model of naphthalene migration into milk from an atmosphere having a relatively high level of naphthalene suggested that naphthalene is first absorbedby the packaging material (low-density polyethylene). It was cautioned that when low-density polyethylene is used as the packaging material, the concentration of naphthalenevapour in the storage area should be kept low to minimize the transfer of naphthalene tomilk (Lau et al., 1995). (f)Miscellaneous sources In the USA, naphthalene was found in mainstream cigarette smoke at a concentration of 2.8 g per cigarette and at 46 g per cigarette in the sidestream smoke from one commercial unfiltered cigarette, and at a concentration of 1.2 g in the smoke from a filtered 'little' cigar (Schmeltz et al., 1976). Naphthalene has been detected in ash from municipal refuse and hazardous waste incinerators. It was found in seven of eight municipal refuse ash samples at6-28 000 g/kg, with higher concentrations detected in bottom ash than in fly ash (Shane et al., 1990) and in five of 18 ash samples from hazardous waste incinerators at 0.17-41 (mean, 4.1) mg/kg (Carroll & Oberacker, 1989). (g)Human tissues and secretions Naphthalene was found in 40% of human adipose tissue samples at concentrations ranging from < 9 to 63 g/kg in a National Human Adipose Tissue Survey (NHATS) in the USA in 1982 (Stanley, 1986). Naphthalene was also detected (concentrations notreported) in six of eight selected breast milk samples from women in four cities in theUSA (Pellizzari et al., 1982). It was also released in expired air from three out of eight individuals at concentrations of 1.5, 2.4 and 0.12 g/h, respectively (Conkle et al., 1975). 1.5 Regulations and guidelines Occupational exposure limits and guidelines for naphthalene are presented in Table 7.NAPHTHALENE 383IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 384 Table 7.

Studies of Cancer in Humans Case reports A cluster of cancer cases in a naphthalene purification plant was reported in the former East Germany (Wolf, 1976, 1978). This plant operated between 1917 and 1968and a total of 15 employees were reported to have worked in this unit of the plant duringthe preceding 20-30 years. Seven employees were diagnosed with cancer, including fourcases of laryngeal cancer. Diagnosis was established between 1964 and 1973 and the ageat diagnosis was 60-71 years. The incidence rate for laryngeal cancer in the former EastGermany in 1970 was given as 6.3 per 100 000. The four workers had been exposed for7-31 years. The limit value for exposure to naphthalene at that time was 20 mg/m 3, with peak values of 50 mg/m3. Concomitant exposure to various tar products was mentioned. All four cases were reported to have been smokers. [The Working Group noted that noinference on the carcinogenicity of naphthalene can be drawn from these observations.] Ajao et al. (1988) reported on 23 consecutive cases of colorectal carcinoma admitted during June 1982 and May 1984 to a university college hospital in Nigeria. Eleven ofthese patients were 30 years or younger at diagnosis. Based on family history, procto-sigmoidoscopy, barium enema and autopsy, no indication of familial polyposis amongthese cases was ascertained. Half of the patients mentioned a history of taking Kafura , a local indigenous treatment for anorectal problems, which contains naphthalene. Theother half of the patients did not know whether they had been given Kafura during early childhood. [The Working Group noted that no inference on the carcinogenicity ofnaphthalene can be drawn from these observations.] 3. Studies of Cancer in Experimental Animals 3.1 Oral administration Rat: A group of 28 BD I and BD III rats [sex and number of each strain not speci- fied], about 100 days old, was fed a diet [not specified] containing naphthalene (spectro-graphically pure) in oil [type unspecified] at a dose of 10-20 mg per day on six days perweek, for 100 weeks. Animals were kept under observation until they died. The averagelife expectancy was 800 days, which was said to be similar to that of control rats [nodetails were provided regarding control animals]. All animals were subjected to necropsywith histopathological examination of abnormal tissues only. No tumours were found inany of the rats examined. (Schm\u00e4hl, 1955). [The Working Group noted the small numberof animals used and the incomplete reporting of this study.]NAPHTHALENE 3853.2 Inhalation exposure 3.2.1 Mouse Groups of 70 male and 70 female B6C3F1mice, 10-11 weeks of age, were subjected to whole-body exposure to 0 or 10 ppm (0 or 52 mg/m3) naphthalene (> 99% pure) and a group of 135 males and 135 females to 30 ppm naphthalene (157 mg/m3) in inhalation chambers for 6 h per day, five days per week, for 104 weeks. During periodsof non-exposure, animals were housed in groups of five. Mean body weight of exposedmice was slightly lower than that of the controls throughout the study. Survival rates atthe end of the study were significantly lower in control male mice than in exposed malesdue to wound trauma and secondary infection related to fighting (survival: controls,26/70 Survival in theexposed female mice was similar that of controls: controls, (86%); 10 ppm,57/65 (88%); and (76%). a significant increasein the incidence of bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas in One bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma was noted in a high-dose female. Exposed male micealso showed an increased incidence of bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas and carcinomas ppm dose groups, respectively). Non-neoplastic changes were seen only in the lungsand nose. A dose-related increase in bronchiolo-alveolar and 30-ppm dose groups, respectively). Virtually all exposed animalsbut none of the controls had nasal chronic inflammation, respiratory epithelial hyper-plasia and metaplasia of the olfactory epithelium (National Toxicology Program, 1992). In a screening assay based on increased multiplicity and incidence of lung tumours in a strain of mice highly susceptible to the development of this neoplasm, groups of 30female A/J mice, 8-10 weeks of age, were exposed in inhalation chambers to 0, 10 or30 ppm [0, 52 or 157 mg/m 3] naphthalene (purity, 98-99%) for 6 h per day, on five days per week, for six months. Survival was unaffected by treatment. At the end of the experi-mental period, survivors were killed and examined for pulmonary adenomas. Exposureto 10 or 30 ppm did not cause a significant increase in the incidence of lung adenomascompared with concurrent controls, but histopathological evaluation of the lungs showedan increase in numbers of alveolar adenomas per tumour-bearing mouse but not inadenomas per mouse compared with the concurrent controls (controls, 21% (0.21 \u00b10.39 (Adkins et al., 1986).IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 3863.2.2 Rat Groups of 49 male and 49 female Fischer 344/N rats, six weeks of age, were exposed in inhalation chambers to 0, 10, 30 or 60 ppm [0, 52, 157 or 314 mg/m3] naphthalene (> 99% pure) for 6 h per day, on five days per week, for 105 weeks. Mean body weightsof all exposed groups of male rats were less than that of the chamber control groupthroughout the study, but mean body weights of exposed groups of females were similarto that of the chamber control group. Survival rates in all exposed groups were similarto that of the chamber controls. At the end of the study, 24/49, 22/49, 23/49 and 21/49males and 28/49, 21/49, 28/49 and 24/49 females were alive in the 0, 10, 30 and 60 ppmgroups, respectively. Neuroblastomas of p= 0.001, Poly-3 in the 0, 10, 30 and 60 ppm groups, respectively. In addition, adenomas of the nasal respiratory test) and in the 0, 10, 30 and 60 ppm groups, respectively. These olfactory neuroblastomas and respiratory epitheliumadenomas had not been observed in the larger database of historical controls in NationalToxicology Program two-year inhalation studies in which animals were fed NationalInstitute of Health (NIH)-07 diet or in the smaller National Toxicology Program database[all routes] in which they were fed NTP-2000 diet. In addition to the nasal neoplasms,the incidences of a variety of non-neoplastic lesions of the nasal tract in both male andfemale rats were significantly increased in naphthalene-exposed animals compared withcontrols (see Section 4.2.2( b)) (National Toxicology Program, 2000). 3.3 Intraperitoneal administration 3.3.1 Mouse A group of 31 male and 16 female CD-1 mice received intraperitoneal injections of a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) ondays 1, 8 and 15 of life. The total dose received was 1.75 mol per mouse. Groups of 21 male and 21 female mice receiving DMSO alone served as vehicle controls. [Thenumber of mice in the above four groups are reported as the effective number of micethat survived at least six months of treatment and not the starting number.] Mice wereweaned at 21 days, separated by gender and maintained until termination at 52 weeks, atwhich time they were necropsied and gross lesions as well as liver sections were exa-mined histologically. There was no increase in the incidence of tumours in the naphtha-lene-treated mice compared with the vehicle controls (LaV oie et al. , 1988).NAPHTHALENE 3873.3.2 Rat Ten BD I and BD III rats, 100 days old [sex and number of each strain not specified], received weekly intraperitoneal injections of 20 mg naphthalene (spectrographicallypure) as a 2% solution in 'specially purified oil' for 40 weeks and were held under obser-vation until they died. The average age at death was 900 days, which was reported to besimilar to that of controls [no details were provided regarding control animals]. Allanimals were necropsied with histopathological examination of abnormal tissues only.No tumours were found in any of the rats examined (Schm\u00e4hl, 1955). [The WorkingGroup noted the small number of animals used and the limited reporting of this study.] 3.4 Subcutaneous administration Rat: Ten BD I and BD III rats, 100 days old, [sex and number of each strain un- specified] received weekly subcutaneous injections of 20 mg naphthalene (spectro-graphically pure) as a 2% solution in 'specially purified oil' for 40 weeks and were keptunder observation until they died. The average age at death was 700 days, which wasreported to be similar to that of controls [no details were provided regarding controlanimals]. All animals were necropsied with histopathological examination of abnormaltissues only. No tumours were found in any of the rats examined (Schm\u00e4hl, 1955). [TheWorking Group noted the small number of animals and the limited reporting of thisstudy.] Groups of 38 white inbred rats [age, strain and sex unspecified] received seven sub- cutaneous injections of 0 or 50 mg/kg bw naphthalene (purified by chromatography) asa 15% solution in sesame oil at intervals of around 14 days extending over 3.5 months.Survival was poor due to infectious pneumonia [agent unspecified], with 5/38 treated and11/38 vehicle controls alive at 12 months and 0/38 treated and 4/38 vehicle controls aliveat the termination of the study at 18 months. In the test group, a total of five sarcomas(one uterine and four lymphosarcomas) and a single mammary fibroadenoma developedand, in the control group, a single sarcoma and a single mammary fibroadenoma (Knake,1956). [The Working Group noted the small number of animals, the poor survival and thelimited reporting of this study.]IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 3884. Other Data Relevant to an Evaluation of Carcinogenicity and its Mechanisms 4.1 Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion 4.1.1 Humans (a)Absorption No studies were found that quantitatively determined the extent of absorption of naphthalene in humans following oral or inhalation exposure. Naphthalene can beabsorbed through the skin. Kanikkannan et al . (2001a) examined permeation of JP-8 (jet fuel) containing 0.26% (w/w) naphthalene through human skin in vitro . For 18 samples of human skin, the steady-state flux was 0.45 g/cm 2per hour and the permeability coefficient was 2.17 \u00d710-4cm per hour. (b)Distribution In a survey, naphthalene was detected in 40% of the human adipose tissue samples tested, with concentrations up to 63 ng/g lipid (Stanley, 1986). Naphthalene has also beenidentified in samples of human breast milk [incidence not clear; concentrations notreported] (Pellizzari et al., 1982). (c)Metabolism The major metabolic pathways of naphthalene are illustrated in Figure 1. Naphtha- lene is metabolized first to naphthalene 1,2-oxide (2, see Figure 1), which can yield1-naphthol (3, see Figure 1) or be converted by epoxide hydrolase to trans -1,2-dihydro- 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene ( trans -1,2-dihydrodiol) (5, see Figure 1). The hydroxyl group of 1-naphthol may also be sulfated or glucuronidated. The 1,2-dihydrodiol can also beconverted to 2-naphthol (10, see Figure 1). The epoxide is also a substrate for glutathioneS-transferase, yielding glutathione conjugates which are eventually eliminated as mercapturic acids. Boyland and Sims (1958) showed that trace quantities of a precursorof 1-naphthyl mercapturic acid, tentatively identified as an N-acetyl- L-cysteine deri- vative, are eliminated in human urine after oral administration of 500 mg naphthalene.Tingle et al. (1993) examined the metabolism of naphthalene by human and mouse liver microsomes. The ratio of the trans -1,2-dihydrodiol to 1-naphthol was 8.6 for human microsomes compared with 0.4 for microsomes from phenobarbital-treated mice, indi-cating the ready detoxification of the epoxide to the diol in humans. Buckpitt and Bahnson (1986) measured the metabolism of naphthalene by human lung microsomes derived from two individuals and detected naphthalene dihydrodiolNAPHTHALENE 389IARC VOLUME 82 390Figure 1.

These metabolites were also identified in animal studies, as discussed in Section 4.1.2. Urinary metabolites of naphthalene are useful biomarkers of exposure. mg/L(4.35 mg/g creatinine) (geometric at the end of the workshift.For 24 non-occupationally exposed individuals, the mean urinary concentration 0.13 mg/L (Bieniek, 1994). 1-Naphthol, 2-naphthol and 1,4-naphtho-quinone (14, see Figure 1) were identified in the urine of 69 coke-plant workers exposedto a geometric mean air concentration of for 1-naphthol and0.70-0.82 for 2-naphthol. There was a linear relationship between the overall concen-tration of naphthols in urine and the naphthalene concentration in air (Bieniek, 1997). Ina further study of a coke plant, Bieniek (1998) measured the concentrations of 1-naphtholand 2-naphthol in urine from eight workers in coke batteries, 11 workers in the sortingdepartment and 29 workers in the distillation department. The mean urinary con-centrations of 1-naphthol and 2-naphthol were 294 and 89 mol/mol creatinine for the coke-battery workers, 345 and 184 mol/mol creatinine for the sorters and 1100 and 630mol/mol creatinine for the distillation workers, respectively. Andreoli et al. (1999) examined 15 urine samples from workers in a naphthalene- producing plant who were exposed to 0.1-0.7 mg/m 3naphthalene. At the end of the workshift, the concentrations of 2-naphthyl mg/L, is the most abundant component of creosote (Heikkil\u00e4 et al ., 1987), urinary excretion of 1-naphthol was determined in three assembly workershandling creosote-impregnated wood. The average airborne concentration of naphtha-lene in the breathing zone was approximately 1 mg/m 3. The average end-of-shift concen- tration of 1-naphthol in urine changed from 254-722 creatinine on Monday to creatinine on Friday. The same metabolite was measured in the urine of six workers exposed to creosote in a plant impregnating railroad ties(Heikkil\u00e4 et al. , 1997). As measured by use of personal air samplers, the mean airborne concentration of naphthalene in the workers' breathing zone was 1.5 (range,0.37-4.2) mg/m 3. The mean end-of-shift concentration of 1-naphthol was 20.5 (range, 3.5-62.1) mol/L. There was a good correlation ( r= 0.745) concentrations of airborne naphthalene and urinary No 1-naphthol was detected (limit ofdetection < 0.07 mol/L) in the urine of five non-exposed controls. Hill et al. (1995) measured 1-naphthol and 2-naphthol in the urine of 1000 adults without occupationalexposure \u2014 a subset of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III \u2014who may have been exposed to low levels of naphthalene or pesticides that would yieldIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 392these naphthols as metabolites. The frequency detection was 86% for 1-naphthol and 81% for 2-naphthol. The mean concentrations were 15 and 5.4 g/g creatinine, respec- tively. Concentrations of 1-naphthol ranged up to 1400 g/g creatinine. Yang et al. (1999) examined the relationship between certain enzyme poly- morphisms and naphthalene metabolism in 119 men who were not occupationallyexposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. A polymorphism in exon 7 of the CYP1A1 gene was not related to urinary naphthol excretion. the c1/c2 CYP2E1 excreted higher concentrations of 2-naphthol in the urine than smokers with the c1/c1 genotype. Smokers deficient in glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) concentrations (without correction for creatinine) ofboth 1-naphthol and 2-naphthol. Nan et al. (2001) examined the effects of occupation, lifestyle and genetic poly- morphisms of GSTT1 on the concentrations of 2-naphthol in the urine of 90 coke-oven workers in comparisonwith 128 university students. The urinary excretion of 2-naphthol was higher in the coke-oven workers mol/mol creatinine) than in the students (2.09 mol/mol creati- nine). In the control group, the excretion was higher in smokers (3.94 mol/mol nonsmokers concentrations were workers with the c1/c2 or c2/c2 genotypes than in those with c1/c1 genotype of CYP2E1 . Urinary 2-naphthol concentrations were also higher in the urine of GSTM1 -null workers than in GSTM1 -positive workers. 4.1.2 Experimental systems (a)Absorption, distribution and excretion Early studies indicated that in rats naphthalene is well absorbed from the gastro- intestinal tract (Chang, 1943). When naphthalene was fed to white male rats (weight,about 300 g) [strain unspecified] at a concentration of 1% (w/w) in the diet, none wasdetected in the faeces. Similarly, when it was administered as a single dose by stomachtube (0.1 g), it was not measurable in the faeces. Eisele (1985) examined the distribution of [ 14C]naphthalene in laying pullets, swine and dairy cattle following oral administration. In pullets given a dose of 0.44 mg, themajor site of deposition was the kidney followed by fat, lung and liver. Following acuteadministration of 2.46 mg in swine, the major site of deposition was fat, where the levelwas up to 10 times higher than that in liver. After chronic administration (0.112 mg perday for 31 days), the lung, liver and heart were major sites of accumulation. In cows,chronic exposure (5.115 mg per day for 31 days) led to deposition primarily in the liver. When [ 14C]naphthalene was applied dermally (3.3 g/cm2; total dose, 43 g) to male Sprague-Dawley rats, the plasma half-life for absorption was 2.1 h and that for elimi-nation was 12.8 h. The highest concentration of radioactivity 48 h after dosing was foundin the skin followed by ileum, duodenum and kidney. Seventy per cent of theradioactivity was found in the urine in the first 48 h, with 3.7% appearing in the faecesNAPHTHALENE 393and 13.6% in the expired The primary urinary metabolites identified were 2,7-di- hydroxynaphthalene (31.1% of the total radioactivity in the first 12 h), 1,2-dihydroxy-naphthalene (7, see Figure 1) (17.2%), 1,2-naphthoquinone (8, see Figure 1) (11.4%),2-naphthol parent compound the radioactivity (Turkall et al. , 1994). [The Working Group noted that 2,7-dihydroxynaphthalene has not been identified as a major metabolite in other studies.] Kilanowicz et al. (1999) studied the distribution, metabolism and excretion of tritiated naphthalene given intraperitoneally at a dose of 20 mg/kg bw to male IMP:Wistrats. Approximately 88% of the radioactivity was excreted in urine (68%) and faeces(20%) in the first 72 h, with maximum blood concentrations observed 2 h after dosing.The elimination of radioactivity from the blood was biphasic with half-lives of 0.8 and99 h. [The Working Group noted that the 99-h half-life component may have been due totritium exchange.] The highest initial tissue concentrations were found in fat, liver andkidneys. Urinary metabolites were identified as primarily the parent naphthalene,1-naphthol and 2-naphthol with smaller amounts of 1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxy-naphthalene (1,2-dihydrodiol) and methylthionaphthalenes. Sartorelli et al. (1999) investigated the percutaneous penetration of naphthalene from lubricating oil in vitro using full-thickness monkey skin. The flux for naphthalene was 0.274 nmol/cm 2per hour, which permeation of naphthalene in JP-8 + 100 jet fuel, which contained 0.26%(w/w) naphthalene and was spiked with [ 14C]naphthalene, using a pig ear skin model. The steady-state flux was 0.42 g/cm2per hour, similar to that of nonane but less than for tridecane. (b)Metabolism \u2014 species comparison Corner and Young (1954) compared the urinary metabolites of naphthalene in rats, rabbits, mice and guinea-pigs [strains unspecified] following administration of a singledose of naphthalene mg/kg bw) either orally or by intraperitoneal injection. 1-Naph-thol and its glucuronide and sulfate were identified in the urine of all four species (withthe exception of the glucuronide in guinea-pigs). 2-Naphthol was detected in all fourspecies but no conjugates of this metabolite were found. Although 1,2-dihydro-1,2-di-hydroxynaphthalene (1,2-dihydrodiol) was found in the urine of all four species, 1,2-di-hydroxynaphthalene was present only in urine of guinea-pigs. Rabbits and rats excretedmore 2-naphthol than 1-naphthol, mice than 2-naphthol. As in humans, a precursorof 1-naphthyl mercapturic acid has been detected as a urinary metabolite in all rodentspecies tested (Boyland & Sims, 1958); the amounts of this metabolite present in theurine of mice, rats and hamsters were greater than those observed in guinea-pigs, whichwere greater than those in humans. However, these data did not take into considerationthe widely different doses given: mice, rats, hamsters, guinea-pigs and humans receivedtotal doses of 20, 100, 100, 400 and 500 mg per animal, respectively. Chen and DoroughIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 394(1979) investigated the formation of glutathione conjugates using [14C]naphthalene given to female Spague-Dawley of 100 mg/kg bw[ 14C]naphthalene, 65% of the water-soluble fraction of the radioactivity in urine was identified as glutathione-derived conjugate (premercapturic acid) over a 72-h period.Total recovery of radioactivity was 74% after 72 h, with 60% present in the urine and14% in the faeces. 1,2-Dihydro-1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene and 1-naphthol (60%)were the ether-extractable fraction, which accounted for 6% ofthe administered dose. Summer et al. (1979) found a dose-dependent increase in the uri- nary excretion of mercapturic acid conjugates in given 30, 75 or200 mg/kg bw naphthalene by stomach tube but did not find any such increase inchimpanzees ( Pan troglodytes S.). A similar lack of a significant role for glutathione con- jugation in primates was observed in ) (Rozman et al. noted that standards of naphthalene mercapturates were notavailable in these studies and the analytical method employed may have underestimatedthe amounts of mercapturates present in the urine samples.] Horning et al. (1980) gave naphthalene (100 mg/kg bw) to male Sprague-Dawley rats and identified 21 oxygenated metabolites in the urine, all but onebeing generated via epoxidation. Along with those identified in other studies, the totalnumber of known naphthalene metabolites was 31, excluding mercapturic acids, conju-gates and related compounds. Bakke et al. (1985) gave [ 14C]naphthalene orally to male Sprague-Dawley rats and found 4.6% of the 14C dose as naphthols or their glucuronides in the urine by 24 h. In addition, they found 1,2-dihydro-1-hydroxy-2 S-(N-acetyl)- cysteinylnaphthalene (11, see al. (1990) showed that a consistent percentage of a dose of either trans- 1S-hydroxy-2 S-glutathionyl-1,2-dihydronaphthalene or trans -1R-hydroxy- 2R-glutathionyl-1,2-dihydronaphthalene administered intravenously to male Swiss Webster mice was eliminated as the corresponding diastereomeric mercapturic acid in theurine. In contrast, a significant percentage of a dose of trans -1R-glutathionyl-2 R-hydroxy- 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene (14-25%, depending on the dose) was metabolized to(2-hydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalenylthio)pyruvic acid. These observations indicate thatmercapturic acids generated by conjugation at the C2 position of the napththalene nucleuscan be used to assess the stereochemistry of naphthalene metabolism in vivo . Pakenham et al. (2002) showed that 24-35% of an intraperitoneal dose of [ 14C]- naphthalene was eliminated as mercapturates by both mice and rats at 24 h after dosing.For both species, this percentage was the same over a wide dose range (3.12-200 mg/kgbw). In contrast, after inhalation exposure, the amounts of mercapturic acid in mouseurine were approximately twice those in rat urine at the same level of exposure. Over a24-h period, approximately 100-500 mol/kg bw mercapturates were eliminated in of 50-200 total mercapturic acids were eliminated, while rats exposed to the same concentrations eliminated 0.6-67 mol/kg bw. Jerina et al . unspecified] liver microsomes to examine naphthalene metabolism in vitro and identified naphthalene 1,2-oxide (2, see Figure 1) as an intermediate in the formation of all major metabolites including glutathione conju-gates. Bock et al. (1976) used hepatocytes from male Sprague-Dawley rats to show that 1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene glucuronide was a major metabolite ofnaphthalene. Usanov et al. (1982) compared the metabolism of naphthalene by microsomal prepa- rations from rat liver and rabbit lung [strains and sex not specified] by measuring theformation of 1-naphthol. The metabolic efficiency, i.e. the rate of hydroxylation per nmolof cytochrome P450, was 7.35 times higher in rabbit lung than in rat liver microsomes. d'Arcy Doherty et al. (1985) examined the metabolism of 1-naphthol by a reconsti- tuted cytochrome P450 system from male Wistar rats and identified the products as 1,2-and 1,4-naphthoquinones (8 and 14, see Figure 1). Smithgall et al. (1988) examined the metabolism of trans -1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene ( trans -1,2-dihydrodiol) to the ortho -quinone by cytosolic dehydrogenase from rat liver, and investi- gated the reactivity of the ortho -quinone with the cellular nucleophiles, cysteine and glutathione. The results showed that ortho -quinones formed by enzymatic oxidation of dihydrodiols may Buckpitt andcoworkers (Buckpitt & Warren, 1983; Buckpitt et al., 1984, 1985) examined the relation- ships among the initial steps in the oxidative metabolism of naphthalene, conjugationwith glutathione and metabolites of naphthalene to covalently bindto protein in tissues of male Swiss Webster mice given intraperitoneal doses of[ 14C]naphthalene. Binding of naphthalene in lung, liver and kidney was similar in vivo , but the rate of microsomal metabolic activation of naphthalene was much lower in thekidney than in liver or lung. Phenobarbital pretreatment increased the binding in all threetissues but only at the highest dose (400 mg/kg bw). 1-Naphthol was shown not to be anobligate intermediate in the binding process. The metabolism of naphthalene by mouse,rat and hamster pulmonary, hepatic and renal microsomal preparations was compared byBuckpitt et al . (1987). In all cases, glutathione adducts derived from naphthalene 1,2-oxide were formed and overall activity was particularly high in mouse lung, with aparticular preference in this tissue for the formation of the naphthalene 1 R,2S-oxide isomer (10:1 ratio with the 1 S,2R-isomer). Lanza et al . (1999) examined the ability of microsomal fractions from human lymphoblastoid cells expressing recombinant human CYP2F1 enzyme to metabolizenaphthalene were derivedfrom naphthalene 1 S,2R-oxide (see Table 8), in contrast to the findings in mice (Buckpitt et al., 1992) (see Figure 2). In view of the mouse lung as a target tissue, a number of investigators have examined species, tissue isozyme specificities in naphthalene the principal pulmonary enzyme in the mouse asIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 396P450m50b [CYP2F2], which formed predominantly naphthalene 1 R,2S-oxide (see Table 8 and Figure 2).

Whenlungs dihydrodiol predominatedas metabolites. Chichester et al. (1991, 1994) demonstrated that Clara cells isolated from male Swiss Webster mice metabolized naphthalene to the dihydrodiol and glutathioneconjugates. Microsomal preparations glutathione S-transferases) metabolized naphthalene to the dihydrodiol as a minor product and formed a single glutathione adduct, derived from the 1 R,2S-isomer of naphthalene oxide, as the major product, whereas the dihydrodiol predominated in intactcells. Buckpitt et al. (1992) determined the rates of formation and the stereochemistry of metabolites of naphthalene mucosa and in microsomes from lung and liver of mice (Swiss Webster), rats(Sprague-Dawley), hamsters (Syrian golden) and rhesus monkeys ( Macaca mulatta ) (see Table 9 for details). Metabolism by mouse lung was considerably greater than that by thelungs of the rat, hamster and monkey. Using total diol and conjugates for comparison, theactivity of mouse lung was two orders of magnitude higher than that of the monkey lung.In mouse lung there was preferential formation of the naphthalene 1 R,2S-oxide, as judged from the stereochemistry of the glutathione conjugates. In microdissectedairways, the extent of metabolism of naphthalene to the dihydrodiol and the glutathioneconjugates was much higher in the airways of Swiss Webster mice compared withSprague-Dawley rats or Syrian golden hamsters. In all three species, the rate of meta-bolism was higher in the distal airways than in the trachea (Buckpitt et al., 1995). In mice, there was a high degree of stereoselectivity, the only glutathione conjugate beingIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 398 Table 9.

Airways of mice formed the dihydro- diol and naphthalene 1 R,2S-oxide at rates substantially higher than those of rats. Immunolocalization of CYP2F2 correlated well with the sites of metabolism, inagreement with the findings of Nagata et al. (1990) and Ritter et al. (1991) as to the importance of this isoenzyme. This was confirmed in later studies (Shultz et al., 1999), in which CYP2F2, expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda andTrichoplusia ni cells by use of a baculovirus expression vector system, metabolized naphthalene with a high degreeof to naphthalene also substrates forpurified CYP2F2 (Shultz et al., 2001). Willems et al. (2001) developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for naphthalene administered by inhalation or by intravenous injection to Fischer 344 ratsand B6C3F 1mice. Model simulations for exposure by inhalation indicated that approxi- mately 88-96% of the absorbed naphthalene was metabolized by rats and 96-98% bymice. The overall percentage of naphthalene metabolized by mice exposed to 30 ppm[157 mg/m 3] was higher than for rats exposed to 60 ppm [314 mg/m3] because of the higher ventilation and metabolic rates in mice. The steady-state concentrations in thelungs of the mice and rats were similar at the same level of naphthalene exposure. Cumu-lative metabolism of naphthalene by the lung was markedly higher in the mouse than inthe rat. The rates of metabolism did not increase proportionally with concentration,suggesting saturation of metabolism in this organ. The model indicated that the meta-bolism of naphthalene by the liver was similar in the two species. 4.2 Toxic effects 4.2.1 Humans The major toxicological responses reported in humans from acute exposure to naphthalene have been haemolytic anaemia and cataracts (Zuelzer et 1958; Zinkham & Childs, 1958). Poisoning from naphthalene has been accidental or suicidal and occurs as a result of either inhalation offumes containing naphthalene or by ingestion of mothballs (Ojwang et al., 1985; Todisco et al., 1991). Accidental ingestion of household products containing naphthalene, such as mothballs or deodorant blocks, frequently occurs in children. Twelve cases of haemo-lytic anaemia in children secondary to the ingestion of naphthalene were reportedbetween 1949 and 1959 (Anziulewicz et al., 1959). Each child had either sucked or swallowed mothballs. Haemolytic anaemia was also observed in babies exposed tonaphthalene from mothball-treated diapers, blankets or clothes (Anziulewicz et al., 1959; Valaes et al ., 1963). In 1990, 2400 cases of accidental naphthalene ingestion were reported to 72 poison control centres in the USA. Nearly 90% of these cases occurred inchildren under six years of age (Woolf et al., 1993). Haemolytic anaemia has also been associated with ingestion of naphthalene-containing anointing oil (Ostlere et al., 1988).NAPHTHALENE 399Siegel and Wason (1986) reviewed a number of case studies to examine the haemato- logical properties of naphthalene; one day after exposure, Heinz-body haemolyticanaemia leads to a sharp fall in haemoglobin, haematocrit and red blood cell counts and,in some cases, to concurrent leukocytosis. Reticulocytosis then follows with a gradualrestoration of normal blood levels, except in cases of severe poisoning. Individuals with decreased glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in their ery- throcytes are sensitive to haemolytic anaemia following exposure to naphthalene,although toxic reactions have also been observed in individuals without red cell defects.Four black patients (three male and one female) who had been exposed to naphthalenewere found to have haemolytic anaemia. One of the patients was a newborn whosemother had ingested mothballs. All four patients had red blood cell glucose-6-phosphatedehydrogenase deficiency (Zinkham & Childs, 1958). [The Working Group noted that in all of these cases the amount of naphthalene ingested was not reported.] Additional data on the effects of exposure to naphthalene in infants and children are presented in Section 4.3.1. 4.2.2 Experimental systems (a)In-vivo studies with single doses The LD50of naphthalene in CD-1 mice bw for females (Shopp et al., 1984). Naphthalene causes cataracts in rats (Rathbun et al., 1990; Tao et al., 1991), rabbits (van Heyningen, 1979) and mice (Wells et al., 1989). Haemolytic anaemia has not been reported in experimental animals. The biochemical pathways that modulate the cataractogenicity of naphthalene were probes and naphthalene bioactivation and detoxificationin C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice (Wells et al., 1989). These mouse strains differ in suscep- tibility to the induction of CYP enzymes and were also found to cause cata-racts. Pretreatment of the mice with SKF525A or severaltypes of antioxidants, free radical- trapping -phenyl- N-tert-butylnitrone, decreased the incidence of cataracts. Cata- racts pretreatment with followed by naphthalene did notdevelop cataracts. These results support the hypothesis that the cataractogenesis bynaphthalene in C57BL/6 mice requires CYP-catalysed bioactivation to a reactive inter-mediate and that detoxification is dependent upon glutathione. The lack of cataractIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 400induction in DBA/2 mice after naphthalene or its metabolites 1,2- or 1,4- naphthoquinone suggests that these mice may be unable to convert the latter into freeradical prevent the development of naphthalene-induced cataracts inrats. This action is believed to involve inhibition of the reduction of naphthalenedihydrodiol to 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene (Xu et al., 1992; Lou et al., 1996). Male rats of five strains (4-5 weeks of age), including two pigmented (Long-Evans and BrownNorway) and three albino (Sprague-Dawley, Wistar were givennaphthalene by gavage at 500 mg/kg bw per day for three days, then 1000 mg/kg bw perday for up to six weeks. Each experiment included groups treated with vehicle alone(control), naphthalene, naphthalene plus AL\u00d81576 or AL\u00d81576 given at 10 mg/kg bw per day by gavage one hour before thenaphthalene feeding. Naphthalene induced cataracts in all five strains. During adminis-tration of naphthalene, whole-lens glutathione levels were 20-30% lower than those ofcontrols. After four weeks of administration, an almost 20-fold increase in the content ofprotein-glutathione mixed disulfides was observed in the lenses. AL\u00d81576 completelyprevented all morphological and chemical changes in the lenses of naphthalene-treatedrats (Xu et al., 1992). To determine whether pigmentation is required for naphthalene- induced cataract formation, Murano et al. (1993) studied the progression of cataracts in Brown Norway and Sprague-Dawley rats that had received an oral dose of naphthalene(1000 mg/kg bw) every other day for six weeks. The changes in the lens were qualita-tively similar in the two strains, but the cataract progressed more uniformly and morerapidly in the Brown Norway rats. An intraperitoneal injection of 0.05-2.0 mmol/kg bw naphthalene in corn oil in C57BL/6J g) caused a specific bronchiolar lesion characterizedby a dilation of Clara cells with loss of apical projections. The Clara cells later becameexfoliated from large areas of the bronchioles. After loss of the Clara cells, abnormalitiesappeared on the surface of the ciliated cells and, within 48 h after administration ofnaphthalene, there was rapid division of the remaining cells. The repopulated Clara cellswere distributed randomly in the bronchioles, with gradual re-establishment of theclassic canal-like pattern of 200-375 mg/kg bw naphthalene in male Swiss Webster mice produced highly selective necrosis of the bronchiolar epithelial cells but no necrosisin the kidney or liver. This pulmonary damage was more severe when the mice werepretreated with diethyl maleate (which depletes glutathione) and less severe after pre-treatment with piperonyl butoxide (which inhibits CYP enzymes). In contrast, SKF 525A (another CYP inhibitor) before treatment with naphthalene damage. Intraperitoneal injection of mg/kgbw [ 14C]naphthalene resulted in covalent binding of naphthalene-derived radioactivity to tissue macromolecules, with the highest levels of binding in lung, liver and kidney. Thelevel of binding corresponded with rapid depletion of glutathione in both the lung andNAPHTHALENE 401liver. Pretreatment with diethyl increased the material, while piperonyl butoxide and SKF 525A decreased the binding by 75% and 50%, respec-tively (Warren et al., 1982). O'Brien et al. (1985) studied the species-dependent pulmonary toxicity of naphtha- lene. Male Swiss T.O. mice (weighing 20-25 g) and male Wistar-derived rats (weighing200-225 g) were given intraperitoneal doses of naphthalene at 200-600 and 400-1600mg/kg bw, respectively. The lungs, livers, kidneys and spleen were removed 24 h afterthe injection and prepared for light microscopy. In mice, there was selective damage tothe non-ciliated bronchiolar epithelial (Clara) cells at low doses of naphthalene. At highdoses of naphthalene, vascular and hydropic degeneration of cells in the proximal convo-luted tubule was observed together with protein casts in the collecting ducts. Tissuedamage was not observed in the lung, liver or kidney of rats that received up to600 mg/kg bw naphthalene. Non-protein sulfhydryl was depleted in a time-dependentmanner in the lungs, liver, spleen and kidneys of naphthalene-treated mice, but only inthe lung and liver of treated rats. Administration of 1-naphthol (200 mg/kg bw to miceand 200-250 mg/kg bw lead to depletion of non-protein sulfhydryl levelsor tissue damage in the liver, lung or kidney of either species. Covalent binding andmetabolism of naphthalene were approximately 10-fold greater in mouse lung micro-somes than in rat lung microsomes. The authors attributed the differences in naphthalene-induced toxicity in mice and rats to differences in metabolism between the two species. Intraperitoneal injection of 1.6-4.7 mmol/kg bw (200-600 mg/kg male ddY mice resulted in a dose-dependent increase in lung damage mainly in thebronchiolar region, with no damage following a dose of 0.78 mmol/kg (100 mg/kg bw).The response was enhanced by diethyl maleate treatment. Increasing the dose of naphtha-lene from 1 to 3 mmol/kg bw resulted in a decrease in pulmonary glutathione levels.Naphthalene did not affect lipid peroxidation or phospholipid content in the lungs. Inlung slice preparations, the covalent binding of naphthalene was increased or decreasedwhen the mice had been pretreated with inducers or inhibitors of CYP enzymes, respec-tively (Honda et al., 1990). A single intraperitoneal injection of 2 mmol/kg bw naphthalene in ddY mice resulted in a 50% reduction of carbonyl reductase activity and microsomal mixed-function oxi-dase activities in the Clara cells (Matsuura et al., 1990). Naphthalene was given by intraperitoneal injection to Swiss Webster bw). The animals were killed 24 h later for identification of the specificsites of the respiratory tract affected by the treatment (nasal cavity and tracheobronchialairway tree). In mice, the injury to the tracheobronchial epithelium was dose-dependentand Clara cell-specific. At 50 mg/kg bw, produced swelling and vacuolationof Clara cells in terminal bronchioles. The number of terminal bronchioles with vacuo-lated Clara cells and the number of Clara cells within the terminal bronchioles thatshowed vacuolation mg/kg bw, almost all non-ciliated cells lining terminal bronchioles in miceIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 402were exfoliated and necrotic. In contrast, no effect was observed on Clara cells or ciliated cells of terminal bronchioles in rats treated with up to 1600 mg/kg bw naphthalene. Onlyminor changes in Clara cells at some terminal bronchioles were observed in hamstersdosed with 800 mg/kg bw naphthalene. The nasal cavity showed injury in theolfactory epithelium in a dose- and species-dependent manner, with rats being the mostsensitive species (Plopper et al., 1992a). A morphometric comparison of changes in the epithelial population of the terminal bronchioles and lobar bronchi showed that Claracells and ciliated cells in mice were affected by treatment with naphthalene, while thebronchiolar epithelium of rats and hamsters was insensitive to this treatment (Plopperet al., 1992b). In a companion study, Buckpitt et al. (1992) demonstrated that the stereo- chemistry of the epoxidation of naphthalene may be important in the target tissue (lung)and species selectivity (mouse) of naphthalene toxicity (see Section 4.1.2( b)). Female FVB/n mice (2-4 months of age) were given an intraperitoneal injection of 0, 50, 100 or 200 mg/kg bw naphthalene in corn oil and killed at various time points toinvestigate the phenotypic changes in airway epithelial cells after acute Clara cell injury.Clara cell cytotoxicity from naphthalene resulted in the exfoliation of epithelial cellscontaining CC10 protein, a Clara cell secretory protein. This exfoliation occurred at thesame time (24 h after treatment) as a reduction in the levels of mRNA for CC10 andCYP2F monooxygenase. (CDK1), marker ofcell cycling, was detected in a large number of cells in and around the bronchioles andterminal bronchioles 48 h after treatment with naphthalene. The airways were re-popu-lated with immature epithelial cells lacking normal levels of CC10 mRNA and over-expressing the mRNA for surfactant protein B. At 72 h after injection of naphthalene, areduction in the number of CDK1 mRNA-positive cells was observed, except at theairway bifurcations, where increased expression of mRNA CDK1 was observed relativeto the 48-h time point. The results suggest that the repair of acute airway epithelial cellinjury induced by naphthalene occurs in overlapping stages, beginning with clearance ofdead cells followed by the proliferative re-population of injured areas and maturation ofnewly re-populated regions (Stripp et al., 1995). Naphthalene (300 was administered intraperitoneally to male FVB/n mice (7-9 weeks of age) 36-72 h before intraperitoneal administration of [ 3H]thymidine (20 Ci/mmol) at a dose of 2.5 Ci/kg bw. Lungs were removed five days after treatment. Naphthalene toxicity resulted in pulmonary neuroendocrine-cell hyperplasia, which wascharacterized by increased numbers of neuroepithelial bodies without significantchanges in the number of isolated pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and with increased[ 3H]thymidine labelling of cells that produce calcitonin gene-related peptide, a marker of neuroendocrine cells. These results suggest a key role of neuroendocrine cells in thereparative process of airway epithelial cell renewal after naphthalene-induced injury inmice (Stevens et al., 1997). Five days after an intraperitoneal injection of naphthalene (300 mg/kg bw) to male FVB/n mice (12-14 weeks of age), an abundance of pulmonaryneuroendocrine cells and neuroepithelial bodies was observed along the main axialpathway of the right middle lobe of the lung. Calcitonin gene-related peptide was usedNAPHTHALENE 403to identify the location, size and number of these cells in the airways. Neuroepithelial bodies were significantly increased in number and pulmonary neuroendocrine cells weresignificantly enlarged in naphthalene-treated lungs compared with controls (Peake et al., 2000). Immature Clara cells of neonatal mice are more susceptible to the toxicity of naphthalene than are mature Clara cells of adult mice. Vacuolation and exfoliationassociated with cytotoxicity of Clara cells were dose-dependent when 7-day-old, 14-day-old or adult Swiss Webster mice were given a single intraperitoneal injection of 0, 25, 50or 100 mg/kg bw naphthalene in corn oil and killed 24 h later. The range of doses atwhich Clara cell injury occurred varied with age, with the youngest animals being themost susceptible. The 7- and 14-day-old mice were more sensitive to the toxicity ofnaphthalene despite the fact that, at these ages, the airways have lower ability to activatenaphthalene to its reactive intermediates compared with adult mice (Fanucchi et al ., 1997). To define the repair pattern of Clara cells after massive injury, male Swiss Webster mice (2-3 months of age) were given an intraperitoneal injection of naphthalene(200 mg/kg bw) in corn oil and the lungs were evaluated at various times up to 14 daysafter treatment. Clara cells of terminal bronchioles were vacuolated and swollen on day 1after the naphthalene injection, exfoliated on day 2 and resembled those of the controlson day 14. Cell proliferation was increased within the epithelium and interstitium atday 1, reached a maximum at day 2 and was close to the control level at all other timepoints. Markers of Clara cell differentiation were barely detectable in the terminal bron-chiolar epithelium at days 1 and 2, clearly detectable at day 4 and returned to controllevels between days 5 and 14. The results showed that repair of the bronchiolar epi-thelium after naphthalene treatment involved distinct phases of cell proliferation anddifferentiation, including proliferation of cells other than Clara cells, and interaction ofmultiple cell types including non-target cells (Van Winkle et al., 1995). Swiss-Webster mice (8-10 weeks of age) were given an intraperitoneal injection of 0 or 200 mg/kg bw naphthalene and the temporal pattern of intracellular changes wasevaluated up to 6 h following treatment. Whole-lung preparations from these mice werestained with cell-permeant and -impermeant nuclear binding fluorochromes and exa-mined means of high-resolution light, electron and confocal fluorescence microscopy.These methods allowed the assessment of Clara cell necrosis and cell permeability on thesame samples. After acute exposure to naphthalene in vivo , early stages of injury to bronchiolar Clara cells included swelling of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and blebformation, followed by increases in cell membrane permeability (Van Winkle et al ., 1999). In a study in which mice were treated similarly, intracellular glutathione content was measured and compared with the degree of cytotoxicity up to 3 h after treatment. Loss ofintracellular glutathione is an early event that precedes initial signs of cellular damage.Once glutathione concentration dropped below 25% of the control, injury was irre-versible (Plopper et al., 2001). IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 404Male Swiss Webster mice and male were exposed to naphtha- lene for 4 h via whole-body inhalation (West et al., 2001). Other groups of mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of 0, 50, 100, 200 or400 mg/kg bw naphthalene. Inhalation exposure of rats to naphthalene did not result inany detectable changes in the airway epithelial cells. In mice, exposure to naphthalene atconcentrations above 2 ppm [10.5 mg/m 3] resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in Clara cell injury. At low concentrations, naphthalene caused injury in the proximalairways, while at high concentrations, there was injury both in proximal airways and inthe more distal conducting airways. Parenteral exposure of mice to naphthalene causedinjury that was limited to the distal airways at low dose ( 200 mg/kg bw), while at higher doses (> 300 mg/kg bw), the injury also included the proximal conducting air-ways. The higher sensitivity of the distal airways was initially attributed to higher ratesof naphthalene metabolism (Buckpitt et al., 1995), but the results of West et al. (2001) suggest that cells throughout the airways are equally sensitive and that sensitivity diffe-rences between proximal and distal airways to naphthalene treatment may be due todifferences in the distribution of the compound, although there are no data to support thissuggestion. In conclusion, the pattern of injury after exposure to naphthalene is species-specific and highly dependent on route of exposure. The ability of naphthalene to cause oxidative stress was assessed in female Sprague- Dawley rats (weighing 160-180 g) given vitamin E succinate for three days and thenadministered 1100 mg/kg bw naphthalene as a single oral dose on day 4. Another groupof rats received naphthalene alone. Naphthalene induced oxidative stress as measured byincreased lipid peroxidation in mitochondria in liver and brain and reduction of gluta-thione concentrations in these organs. The treatment also increased DNA single-strandbreaks in liver tissue, and induced an increase in membrane fluidity in liver and brainmicrosomes, together with increases in the urinary elimination of malonaldehyde,formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acetone. These indices of oxidative stress were lessstrong in the rats that had been pretreated with vitamin E succinate (Vuchetich et al., 1996). [The Working Group noted the high dose used in this study.] (b)In-vivo studies with multiple doses Yamauchi et al. (1986) reported that daily administration of oral doses [number of days not given] of 1 g/kg bw naphthalene to male Wistar rats (weighing 150-170 g)resulted in increases in levels of serum and liver lipid peroxides, suggesting enhancedlipid peroxidation. Oral administration of naphthalene in dose increments up to750 mg/kg bw over nine weeks also enhanced lipid peroxidation and decreased the acti-vity of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase in the liver of male rats(Germansky & Jamall, 1988). Male albino rats (weighing 100-125 g) were administered 1 g/kg bw naphthalene orally in refined groundnut oil daily for 10 days. Biochemical alterations in the liver,kidney and eye were evaluated. Significant changes were observed only in the liver,including increased liver weight, lipid peroxidation and aniline hydroxylase activity.NAPHTHALENE 405Alkaline phosphatase activity was slightly increased in the liver and eye. No significant changes were observed in the kidney (Rao & Pandya, 1981). [The Working Group notedthe high dose used in this study.] Male and female CD-1 mice were administered daily doses of 0, 27, 53 or 267 mg/kg bw naphthalene orally for 14 consecutive days or a suspension of 0, 5.3, 53 or 133 mg/kgbw naphthalene in corn oil daily for 90 consecutive days. Surviving animals were killed24 h after the final dose. In the 14-day study, naphthalene caused a decrease in bodyweight and thymus weight in male mice and decreases in body and spleen weights andincreases in lung weights in female mice, at the high dose only. In the 90-day study, thespleen weights were also reduced in the female mice at the high dose only. Immunotoxi-city end-points (e.g., humoral immune response, response to mitogens, delayed hyper-sensitivity response, popliteal lymph node response, bone-marrow stem cell number andbone-marrow function) did not show any significant change from controls after either 14days or 90 days of naphthalene administration. Although there was a slight alteration inhaematological parameters, no haemolytic anaemia was observed. Serum enzymes,electrolyte levels and hexobarbital sleep times did not show consistent or dose-dependentchanges after 14 or 90 days of naphthalene treatment. There was no treatment-relatedeffect on the hepatic mixed-function oxidase system or glutathione inhibition of hepatic aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activitywas observed in both males and females (Shopp et al., 1984). Bronchiolar airways from male Swiss Webster mice treated intraperitoneally with naphthalene daily for seven days (50, 100 or 200 mg/kg bw) differed only slightly fromthose of untreated control mice, with no evidence of necrotic or exfoliated cells. Incontrast, a single intraperitoneal dose (50, 100 or 200 mg/kg bw) causeda dose-dependent increase in the incidence and severity of bronchiolar epithelial cellnecrosis. Also, when mice were treated with intraperitoneal doses of 200 mg/kg bw dailyfor seven days and then challenged on day 8 with a dose of 300 mg/kg bw naphthalene,the bronchiolar injury was less severe than in mice treated with a single dose of300 mg/kg bw naphthalene. To evaluate the mechanism of this tolerance to naphthalene,the rate of formation of naphthalene 1 R,2S-oxide was measured in microsomes from treated (7 \u00d7200 mg/kg bw) and control mice. In lung microsomes from naphthalene- treated mice, there was a > 60% decrease in the rate of naphthalene metabolism com-pared with lung microsomes from controls. This effect was not seen in liver microsomesfrom these mice. However, there was no difference in the rate of formation of reactive,covalently bound naphthalene metabolites in vivo or in vitro (measured in lung micro- somal preparations) between tolerant and control mice (O'Brien et al., 1989). The bronchiolar epithelium of male Swiss Webster mice treated orally daily for seven days with 200 mg/kg bw naphthalene resembled that of control mice with respect to theciliated and non-ciliated cells and nuclear and cytoplasmic volumes. Subsequenttreatment of these mice with higher doses (300 mg/kg bw) did not cause the Clara cellinjury observed previously in untreated mice after a single injection of 300 mg/kg bwnaphthalene. Repeated exposure to naphthalene resulted in lower activities of CYPIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 reactive naphtha- lene metabolites to proteins in lungs of tolerant mice was similar to that in control mice(Lakritz et al., 1996). Male Swiss Webster mice were made tolerant by seven daily injections of 200 mg/kg bw naphthalene. The concentration of glutathione in the terminal airways, measured 24 hafter the last injection, was 2.7-fold higher than in vehicle control mice. A challenge doseof naphthalene (300 mg/kg bw, given on day 8) did not produce injury. However, tolerantmice that were allowed to recover for 96 h after the seventh injection were again suscep-tible to injury induced by a challenge dose, and the concentration of glutathione in theterminal airways had declined to control values. Tolerant mice treated on day 8 simulta-neously with the challenge dose of naphthalene and buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitorof -glutamylcysteine synthetase, appeared as susceptible to injury as naphthalene- challenged controls. These results showed that increased rates of glutathione synthesiswere critical for resistance to naphthalene toxicity in male Swiss-Webster mice (Westet al., 2000). A 10% solution (w/v) of naphthalene in corn oil was administered by gavage to Brown Norway rats at a dose of 0.7 g/kg bw per day for 102 days; control rats receivedcorn oil only. Two of the naphthalene-treated groups were given normal diet containingone of two types of aldose reductase inhibitor at concentrations known to inhibit sugarcataract formation in galactose-treated rats. The remaining naphthalene-treated groupsand the controls were given unmodified diet. Gradual, progressive development of zonalopacities with decreased lens glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activitieswas in a carboxylic acid a hydantoin-type aldose reductase inhibitor.These results led the authors to suggest an oxidative mechanism in naphthalene-inducedcataract formation (Tao et al., 1991). Rathbun et al. (1990) also showed the progressive development of cataracts in Black-Hooded rats given a daily dose of 1 mL of a 10%(w/v) solution of naphthalene in corn oil by gavage for up to 79 days, together with aprogressive loss of lens glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activity, i.e.,impairment of the defence system against oxidative damage. Holm\u00e9n et al. (1999) later demonstrated that 0.5 and 1.0 g/kg bw naphthalene given by gavage twice a week for 10weeks causes cataractous changes in Brown Norway rats. Male and female B6C3F 1mice (10-11 weeks of age) were exposed by inhalation to 0, 10 or 30 ppm [0, 52 or 157 mg/m3] naphthalene for 6 h per day on five days per week for 104 weeks (Abdo et al., 1992; National Toxicology Program, 1992). Naphthalene caused increased incidence and severity of chronic inflammation, metaplasia of theolfactory epithelium and hyperplasia of the respiratory nasal epithelium and chronicinflammation in the lungs of both male and female mice. In another chronic inhalationstudy, male and female Fischer 344 rats were exposed to 0, 10, 30 or 60 ppm [0, 52, 157or 314 mg/m 3] naphthalene for 6 h per day on five days per week for 105 weeks (National Toxicology Program, 2000). Non-neoplastic lesions that were observed inexposed rats at incidences greater than those in the chamber controls included atypicalNAPHTHALENE 407hyperplasia, atrophy, chronic inflammation epithelium; and glandular hyperplasia and squamousmetaplasia. The incidence and severity of these lesions increased with increasingexposure concentration. (c)In-vitro studies Naphthalene and its metabolic including 1,2-naphthoquinone and 1,4-naphthoquinone(0-100 M; 37 \u00b0C), were directly toxic to mononuclear leukocytes and depleted glutathione to 1.0% of control levels. The primary metabolite of naphthalene, the1,2-epoxide, was not cytotoxic at concentrations up to 100 M and did not deplete gluta- thione, suggesting that the quinones are responsible for the cytotoxicity of naphthalenein human mononuclear leukocytes (Wilson et al., 1996). Perfusion of the lungs of male Swiss Webster mice (4-5 weeks of age) with naphtha- lene (0.02-2 mM in Waymouth's medium for a one-hour period followed by 4 h inmedium) resulted in swelling and vacuolation of Clara cells. This was followed byconcentration-dependent losses of Clara cells from the bronchiolar epithelium. Pulmo-nary glutathione levels decreased over a range of 60% (at the 0.2-mM dose) to less than10% (at the 2-mM dose) of the corresponding control level. Following perfusion with[ 14C]naphthalene (1.67-167 M for 30 min followed by 4.5 h in medium), reactive metabolites were covalently bound to protein in the lung and perfusate. Total binding(nanomoles bound) and specific activity (nanomoles per milligram protein) increased inlung tissue with increasing concentrations of naphthalene (Kanekal et al., 1990). A sub- sequent study with this isolated perfused mouse lung system demonstrated that thecirculating epoxides of naphthalene play a significant role in naphthalene-induced lunginjury. Injury to Clara cells in lungs perfused with or secondary metabolitessuch as naphthoquinones, 1-naphthol and 1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene wasless dramatic than the effects observed following exposure to naphthalene 1,2-oxide(Kanekal et al., 1991). The metabolism and cytotoxicity of naphthalene and its metabolites were investi- gated in vitro in Clara cells isolated from male Swiss Webster mice (4-5 weeks of age). The cells were incubated for 2 or 4 h with 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mM naphthalene, 1,4-naphtho-quinone, 1,2-naphthoquinone, 1-naphthol, naphthalene 1,2-oxide and 1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene. The that were more toxic to the Clara cellsthan the parent compound were 1,4-naphthoquinone and naphthalene 1,2-oxide, inhibitor, of naphthalene 1,2-oxide, which suggested thatthe epoxide is a key participant in the process leading to the loss of cell viability inisolated Clara cells (Chichester et al., 1994).IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 408Airways microdissected from male Swiss Webster mice by filling the trachea with 1% agarose were maintained in culture for 8 h. When these explants were incubated with0.5 mM naphthalene, the vacuolation and exfoliation observed in vivo in bronchioles of mice 24 h after intra- peritoneal administration of naphthalene (100 cytotoxicity (Plopper determine whether the formation of reactive metabolites of naphthalene in defined target and non-target regions of the lung correlates with the susceptibility ofthese areas to naphthalene toxicity, the binding of metabolites in various cell types andin various subcompartments of the mouse lung was investigated. Binding was greater indistal bronchioles and isolated Clara cells incubated with [ 3H]naphthalene than in explants of mouse trachea or bronchus. Binding was also greater in mouse Clara cellsthan in mouse hepatocytes (non-target cells) or rat trachea cells (non-susceptiblespecies). There was a good correlation between cellular susceptibility to toxicity and theamount of reactive metabolite bound in vitro (Cho et al., 1994a,b). 4.3 Reproductive and developmental effects 4.3.1 Humans Sensorineural hearing loss was reported in an infant with neonatal hyperbilirubi- naemia from haemolysis due to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency andnaphthalene exposure. The baby had normal hearing at 13 days of age, but had developedprofound bilateral hearing loss by seven months of age. On the day of admittance tohospital, the infant had been dressed in clothes and placed on a blanket that had all beenstored in naphthalene mothballs for five years (Worley et al., 1996). In a survey of neonatal jaundice in association with household drugs and chemicals in Nigeria, the overall incidence of jaundice did not differ significantly in neonates fromhouseholds with or without a history of exposure to drugs or chemicals. Severe neonataljaundice, as judged by the need for exchange blood transfusion or death of the infant,was, however, significantly more frequent among neonates from families with a historyof naphthalene exposure than in those without (Familusi & Dawodu, 1985). [TheWorking Group noted that aflatoxin-contaminated food is a possible confounder in thispopulaton.] Melzer-Lange and Walsh-Kelly (1989) reported naphthalene-induced haemolysis in a black female infant deficient in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Fourteen of 24children identified as having glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency were diagnosed withhaemolysis associated with exposure to naphthalene-containing moth-repellents(Santucci & Shah, 2000). Acute haemolysis with the presence of Heinz bodies and fragmented erythrocytes occurred following inhalation of naphthalene in 21 newborn Greek infants, 12 of whomNAPHTHALENE 409had deficient glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in the erythrocytes (Valaes et al., 1963). Two case reports of haemolytic anaemia in newborn infants secondary to maternal ingestion of mothballs or inhalation exposure to naphthalene have been reported. Thisindicates that naphthalene and/or its metabolites can pass the al., 1959; Athanasiou et al ., 1997). [The Working Group noted that the exposure concentration of naphthalene was not reported.] 4.3.2 Experimental systems (a)Developmental toxicity studies vivo In CD-1 mice given 300 mg/kg bw naphthalene per day by gavage on gestation days 7-14, maternal lethality was increased, maternal weight gain was decreased and theaverage number of live offspring per litter was decreased. There was no concomitantincrease in the number of dead pups, suggesting that the smaller litter size was due toearly embryonic resorption (Plasterer et al. , 1985). In a teratogenicity study in New Zealand white rabbits treated by gavage with up to 120 mg/kg bw on gestation days 6-19, no signs of developmental or maternal toxicitywere found (Navarro et al. , 1992). When Sprague-Dawley rats were given intraperitoneal injections of 395 mg/kg bw naphthalene per day on days 1-15 of gestation, no evidence of maternal toxicity ordevelopmental toxicity was found (Hardin et al. , 1981). Some indications of developmental toxicity were observed when Sprague-Dawley rats were given up to 450 mg/kg bw naphthalene per day by gavage on gestational days6-15. Maternal weight gain was reduced in the groups that received 150 and 450 mg/kgbw per day. There was a significant trend towards decreased fetal body weight andtowards an increased percentage of adversely affected implants per litter (i.e., non-live ormalformed). An increased incidence of visceral malformations was reported, especiallyenlarged ventricles of the brain. The percentage of malformed fetuses per litter seen inthe 450-mg/kg bw group was 2.5 times greater than in controls, but this difference wasnot significant (Navarro et al. , 1991). (b)Developmental toxicity studies in vitro Preimplantation embryos of ICR mice exposed in vivo by intraperitoneal injection of the mother with 14 or 56 mg/kg bw naphthalene on gestational day 2 were collected ongestational day 3.5. Their subsequent in-vitro growth was markedly reduced during 72 hof culture. The viability and implantation capacity were also significantly inhibited (Iyeret al., 1990). In a study of the role of biotransformation on the rodent in-vitro preimplantation embryotoxicity of naphthalene, no toxic effects were observed in the absence of a rat S9activation system in the culture medium. In the presence of the S9 system, naphthalenecaused concentration-dependent embryolethality 410result indicates that the embryotoxicity of naphthalene is dependent on activation to reactive metabolites (Iyer et al., 1991). (c)Reproductive toxicity in male rats Perturbation of glutathione levels in the testes, epididymides and liver following a single intraperitoneal dose of naphthalene (500 mg/kg bw) was studied Sprague-Dawley decreased hepatic and epididymal glutathione, but had littleeffect on concentration in the testis. Chemical-induced lowering of glutathione levelsin the male reproductive tract may be a mechanism for potentiation of chemicallyinduced germ-cell mutations (Gandy et al., 1990). 4.4 Genetic and related effects 4.4.1 Humans No data were available to the Working Group. 4.4.2 Experimental systems (see Table 10 for references) Naphthalene has consistently been found inactive in standard bacterial mutagenicity tests. However, when it was tested in the presence of nitrogen-containing reagents underphoto-oxidizing or photolytic conditions, mutagenicity was observed, probably as aresult of formation of nitronaphthalenes or hydroxynitronaphthalenes (Suzuki et al ., 1982; Arey et 1992). Naphthalene also increased the mutagenicity of benzo[ a]pyrene towards Salmonella typhimurium in the presence of an exogenous metabolic activation system (Hermann, 1981). Naphthalene induced somatic mutations and recombination in the Drosophila melanogaster wing-spot test following larval feeding. It also induced sister chromatid exchange and, in the presence of exogenous metabolic activation, chromosomal aberra-tions in Chinese hamster ovary cells in vitro . Naphthalene did not induce gene mutations at the TKor HPRT locus in human MCL-5B-lymphoblastoid cells; however, an increase the frequency of CREST-negative micronuclei, indicative of clastogenicity, wasreported in this cell line. The naphthalene metabolites, 1,2-naphthoquinone and 1,4-naphthoquinone also caused an increase in sister chromatid exchange in dividing humanlymphocytes, while naphthalene 1,2-oxide was inactive. Oral exposure of mice and rats to naphthalene caused enhanced DNA fragmentation in brain and liver tissues, as judged from the presence of fragmented DNA in super-natants of homogenized tissue lysates. Mice were more sensitive to these effects, parti-cularly p53-deficient mice. Micronuclei were not induced in bone-marrow mice exposed to naphthalene in vivo . Adducts to haemoglobin, albumin and other proteins were found in liver, lung, kidney, brain tissue and blood cells of CFW andNAPHTHALENE 411IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 412 Table 10.

Such studies can provide insights into the relevanceof the rodent tumours (lung tumours in female but not male mice, and nasal tumours inmale and female rats) in predicting the carcinogenic response in humans. In general, mice appear to be more susceptible to lung tumour induction by epoxides and epoxide-forming chemicals than chloroprene induced lung tumours micebut not in rats (Lynch et al. , 1984; National Toxicology Program, 1984; Snellings et al., 1984; Toxicology Program, 1987; Owen et al. , 1987; Melnick et al., 1994; National Toxicology Program, 1998, 1999; Melnick & Sills, 2001). The determinantsunderlying the susceptibility of the mouse lung towards tumour formation may rely inpart on toxicokinetic considerations, but toxicodynamic determinants probably also playa role. If naphthalene 1,2-oxide is responsible for the lung tumours observed in mice,species differences in response at this organ may be due to a combination of higher ratesof naphthalene 1,2-oxide production in the Clara cells of the mouse lung, and, possibly,a greater susceptibility of the mouse lung to epoxide-induced carcinogenesis (NationalToxicology Program, 2000). 4.5.1 Interspecies differences in toxicokinetics and metabolism of naphthalene The initial step in naphthalene metabolism involves the formation of a 1,2-epoxide and this process is a key step in the generation of cytotoxic metabolites. Substantial diffe-rences in both the rates of epoxide formation and the stereochemistry of the epoxidesformed are observed between target tissues (mouse lung and olfactory epithelium, ratolfactory epithelium) olfactory epi-thelium). The rates of metabolism in lung microsomes from humans and non-humanprimates are very similar and are 10-100-fold lower than in lung microsomes fromrodents. CYP2F in mouse lung is important in the local metabolism of naphthalene andthis is likely to be a critical determinant cytotoxicity in themouse. 4.5.2 Interspecies differences in toxicodynamics and mode of action of naphthalene There is no evidence for mutagenic activity of naphthalene in the most widely used genotoxicity assays. For example, naphthalene was not mutagenic in the SalmonellaNAPHTHALENE 415assay with or without metabolic activation or in metabolically competent human lympho- blastoid cells at either of two loci tested. In contrast, positive results were obtained inassays for micronucleus formation, chromosomal aberrations and chromosomal recom-binations in vitro , consistent with a potential clastogenic mechanism of action. Some, but not all, of these tests required metabolic activation for induction of genotoxicity. It is notclear, however, which reactive naphthalene metabolite is responsible for the clastogenic,and presumably carcinogenic, effects, as evidence for the reactivity of both naphthalene1,2-oxide and naphthoquinone exists. Exposure to naphthalene causes cellular injury and increases cell replication rates, suggesting a cytotoxic mode of action. For example, intraperitoneal administration ofnaphthalene produces injury (swelling, vacuolation, exfoliation, necrosis) of the tracheo-bronchial epithelial Clara cells of mice but not of rats (Plopper et al., 1992a,b). In the same study, naphthalene was also cytotoxic to the olfactory epithelium of both rats andmice, but the effect was seen at much higher doses in mice, suggesting higher sensitivityof the rat nose. These site and species differences in toxicity correlate well with thehigher rates of metabolism by mouse lung tissue and rat nasal tissue; metabolism in vitro in pulmonary tissue fractions from human and non-human primates is 1-2 orders ofmagnitude lower than that in rodents. Overall, the proposed mechanism of action of naphthalene is that the higher rates of metabolism lead to cytotoxic metabolites in mouse lung, causing increased cell turnoverand tumours. The absence of rat lung tumours is entirely consistent with this mechanism.Significantly, the maximal rates of metabolism in human lung microsomes are about twoorders of magnitude lower than those in mice. The high rates of metabolism in rat nasalepithelium similarly lead to tissue damage and nasal tumours; however, the etiology ofthese nasal tumours, particularly the neuroblastomas, is not fully understood. 5. Summary of Data Reported and Evaluation 5.1 Exposure data Naphthalene is a commercially important aromatic hydrocarbon which is produced from coal tar and petroleum. It is used mainly as an intermediate in the production ofphthalic anhydride, naphthalene sulfonates and dyes and to a lesser extent as a moth-repellent. Human exposure to naphthalene can occur during its production, in creosotetreatment of wood, in coal coking operations, during its use as an industrial intermediate,as a result of its use as a moth-repellent, and as a result of cigarette smoking. 5.2 Human carcinogenicity data The only data available to the Working Group were two case series. No inference on the carcinogenicity of naphthalene could be drawn from these.IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 4165.3 Animal carcinogenicity data Naphthalene was tested for carcinogenicity by oral administration in one study in rats, by inhalation in one study in mice and one in rats and in one screening assay inmice, by intraperitoneal administration in newborn mice and in rats, and by subcuta-neous administration in two studies in rats. Exposure of rats by inhalation was associatedwith induction of neuroblastomas adenomas of the nasalrespiratory epithelium in males and females. Both of these tumours were considered tobe rare in untreated rats. In the screening assay study by inhalation using only femalemice, there was an increase in lung adenomas per tumour-bearing mouse. In the inhala-tion study in mice, there was an increase in the incidence of bronchiolo-alveolar ade-nomas in female mice. An apparent increase in the incidence of these tumours in malemice was not statistically significant. The studies by oral administration in rats, intra-peritoneal administration in mice and subcutaneous administration in rats were toolimited for an evaluation of the carcinogenicity of naphthalene. 5.4 Other relevant data Animal studies suggest that naphthalene is readily absorbed following oral or inha- lation exposure. Although no data are available from human studies on absorption ofnaphthalene, the determination of metabolites in the urine of workers indicates thatabsorption does occur, and there is a good correlation between exposure to naphthaleneand the amount of 1-naphthol excreted in the directly or through multiple metabolic steps. Naphthalene causes cataracts in humans, rats, rabbits and mice. Humans accidentally exposed to naphthalene by ingestion develop haemolytic anaemia, but there is no evi-dence of haemolytic anaemia in rodents. Cases of haemolytic anaemia have beenreported in children and infants after oral or inhalation exposure to naphthalene or aftermaternal exposure during pregnancy. Naphthalene causes lung toxicity in mice, but not rats, following either intraperi- toneal injection or inhalation exposure. In mice, the injury is dose-dependent and Claracell-specific. After repeated administration of naphthalene, mouse Clara cells becometolerant to the naphthalene-induced injury that occurs following a single dose of naphtha-lene. Acute and chronic exposure to naphthalene caused nasal toxicity in both mice andrats. In isolated mouse Clara cells, 1,4-naphthoquinone and naphthalene 1,2-oxide were more toxic than naphthalene. Injury to Clara cells in perfused lungs occurred at lowerconcentrations of naphthalene 1,2-oxide compared with naphthalene or its othermetabolites.NAPHTHALENE 417There is some evidence of developmental toxicity in rats and mice at dose levels that caused clear maternal toxicity. Clara cells of neonatal mice are more sensitive than thoseof adult mice to the cytotoxic effects of naphthalene. There is little evidence for induction of gene mutations by naphthalene. In contrast, positive results were obtained in assays for micronucleus formation, chromosomalaberrations and chromosomal recombinations in vitro , which are consistent with a clasto- genic potential. Overall, the proposed mechanism of carcinogenic action is that the higher rates of metabolism of naphthalene in mice lead to cytotoxic metabolites in the lung, causingincreased cell turnover and tumours. The absence of lung tumours in rats is entirelyconsistent with this mechanism. The maximal rates of metabolism measured in humanlung microsomes are about 10-100 times lower than those in mice. 5.5 Evaluation There is inadequate evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of naphthalene.

Sincethat time, new data have become available, and these have been incorporated into themonograph and taken into consideration in the present evaluation. 1.

Typical analysis of a commercial styrene product reported the following compo- nents: purity, 99.93%; benzene, < 1 chlo-rides chlorine), < 1 ppm; and sulfur, < 1 ppm (Chevron Phillips Chemical Co., 2001). 1.1.5 Analysis (a)Environmental monitoring Styrene in workplace air can be determined by capillary column gas chromatography (GC) with a flame ionization detector (FID). The sample is adsorbed on charcoal anddesorbed with carbon disulfide. This method (NIOSH Method 1501) has an estimatedlimit of detection of 0.001-0.01 mg per (Eller, 1984).IARC from: assuming \u00b0C) and pressure (101.3 kPa)EPA Method 8260B can be used to determine the concentration of various volatile organic compounds, including styrene, by GC-mass spectrometry (MS), in a variety ofmatrices, such as groundwater, aqueous sludges, waste solvents, oily wastes, tars, soilsand sediments. Samples may be analysed using direct injection, purge-and-trap, closed-system vacuum distillation, static headspace (solid samples), or desorption trappingmedia (air samples) (EPA Methods 5021, 5030, 5032, 5041); the practical quantificationlimits are 5 g/L for groundwater samples, 5 g/kg (wet weight) for low-level soil and sediment samples, 250 g/L for water-miscible liquid waste samples, 625 g/kg for high-level soil and sludge samples and 2500 g/L for non-water-miscible waste samples (Environmental Protection Agency, 1996). (b)Biological monitoring Biological methods for monitoring exposure to styrene have been reviewed (Guillemin & Berode, 1988; Lauwerys & Hoet, 1993; 1993; Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, 2001). Generally accepted biologicalmarkers of exposure are mandelic acid (2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetic acid) and phenyl-glyoxylic acid, the main metabolites of styrene (see Section 4.1.1( c)) in urine and styrene in blood. GC procedures have been described for the quantitative determination ofurinary phenylglyoxylic and mandelic acids, which involve solvent extraction of theacids and their subsequent determination as derivatives by GC-FID on packed or capil-lary columns (Guillemin & 1991). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is widely used for determination of these metabolites. The acids, which may or may not be solvent-extracted, are separated on reverse-phase columns and quantified with an ultraviolet(UV) detector (Ogata & Sugihara, 1978; Ogata & Taguchi, 1987, 1988; Chua et al., 1993). Styrene has been determined in blood by GC with FID or mass selective detectioneither after solvent extraction (Karbowski & Braun, 1978) or by head-space techniques(Pezzagno et al., 1985; Bartolucci et al., 1986; Brugnone et al., 1993). Measurement of adducts of styrene 7,8-oxide to the N-terminal valine in haemo- globin has been proposed for monitoring occupational exposure. After enrichment ofadducted globin chains by ion-exchange chromatography, the samples are after Edman degradation et al., 1993). Conjugation of styrene 7,8-oxide with glutathione, a minor metabolic pathway in humans, leads to specificmercapturic acid products that can be measured in the urine. Ghittori et al. (1997) measured these mercapturic acids and mandelic and phenylglyoxylic acids and styrenein the urine of 22 workers in a reinforced plastics plant, and assessed the correlation ofurinary metabolites with time-weighted-average (TWA) styrene exposures measured bypersonal dosimetry. coefficients of individual or total mercapturic acids (asg/g creatinine) with TWA styrene exposure ranged up to 0.56, compared with corre- lation coefficients of 0.86 and 0.82 styrene exposure. STYRENE 439Methods of isotope-dilution GC-MS have been described for determination of styrene and styrene 7,8-oxide in blood. Styrene and styrene 7,8-oxide were measureddirectly in pentane extracts of blood from 35 reinforced plastics workers exposed to4.7-97 ppm [20-414 mg/m 3] styrene. Positive ion chemical ionization allowed detection of styrene at concentrations greater than 2.5 g/L blood and styrene 7,8-oxide at concen- trations greater than 0.05 g/L blood. An alternative method for measurement of styrene 7,8-oxide used a reaction with valine followed by derivatization with pentafluorophenylisothiocyanate and analysis via negative ion chemical ionization GC-MS-MS (styrene7,8-oxide detection limit, 0.025 g/L blood). The detection limits for styrene 7,8-oxide by these two methods were 10-20-fold lower than those of the GC assays reportedearlier, based upon either electron impact MS or FID (Tornero-Velez et al. , 2001). Elia et al . (1980) found an excellent correlation (correlation coefficient, 0.96) between styrene exposure and urinary mandelic acid either alone or in combination withphenylglyoxylic acid. Ikeda et al. (1982) found a good correlation (correlation coeffi- cient, 0.88) in 96 male workers in glass fibre-reinforced boat production plants betweenstyrene concentration in air by personal sampling and the combined measurements ofmandelic and phenylglyoxylic acid corrected for creatinine. Droz and Guillemin (1983)developed a biological model for the absorption, distribution and elimination of styrene.They examined its validity against data for 60 workers in 10 field studies in the polyesterindustry and found a good correlation. Pezzagno et al . (1985) exposed 14 male and six female volunteers to styrene (273-1654 mol/m 3for 1-3 h) and found a correlation coefficient of 0.93 between expo- sure and levels of unchanged styrene in urine. Ong et al. (1994) studied 39 male workers exposed to concentrations of styrene less than 40 ppm [170 mg/m3] (time-weighted average) and compared end-of-shift breath levels, blood concentrations of styrene, uri-nary styrene levels and urinary styrene metabolite levels with exposure levels; the bestcorrelation was observed between blood styrene and styrene in air, while correlation waspoor between styrene in urine and styrene in air. There were good correlations betweenstyrene in air and mandelic acid and phenylglyoxylic acid in urine, but the best corre-lation was found between exposure and the sum of the two acids in urine corrected forcreatinine. L\u00f6f and Johanson (1993) exposed two volunteers to 26, 77, 201 and 386 ppm styrene (110, 328, 856 and 1672 mg/m 3) for 2 h during light (50 W) physical exercise. A non- linear relationship between styrene in air and styrene in blood was observed which wasattributed to metabolic saturation at exposure levels of 100-200 ppm. 1.2 Production Styrene was first isolated in 1831 by distillation of storax, a natural balsam. Com- mercial production of styrene via dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene began in Germany in1925 (Tossavainen, 1978; Lewis et al., 1983; National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 1983; Chen, 1997).IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 440Styrene is produced mainly by catalytic dehydrogenation of high-purity ethyl- benzene in the vapour phase. Typical catalysts are based on ferric oxide with the addi-tives chromia (Cr 2O3) (stabilizer) and potassium oxide (coke retardant) (Lewis et al., 1983). Fractionation of the product results in separation of high-purity styrene, un-converted ethylbenzene and minor reaction by-products such as and benzene(WHO, 1983; James & Castor, 1994; Chen, 1997; Ring, 1999). A smaller amount of styrene is produced as a co-product from a propylene oxide process. In this route, ethylbenzene is oxidized to its hydroperoxide and reacted withpropylene to yield propylene oxide. The co-product methyl phenyl carbinol is thendehydrated to styrene (Mannsville Chemical Products Corp., 1987; Collins & Richey,1992; James & Castor, 1994; Chen, 1997; Ring, 1999). Data on the 1998 global production (and production capacity) and consumption of styrene by region are presented in Table 1. Information available in 2001 indicated that styrene was produced by 21 companies in China, 10 in the USA, nine in Japan, six in Korea (Republic of), four each in Germany,Russia and the Ukraine, three each in Brazil, Canada, France, Mexico and theNetherlands, two each in Azerbaijan, Belgium, Singapore and the United Kingdom andone each in Argentina, Australia, Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, India,Iran, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Spain and Thailand (Chemical Information Services, 2001). 1.3 Use Worldwide, styrene is one of the most important monomers for polymers and co- polymers that are used in an increasingly wide range of applications. The major uses forstyrene are in plastics, latex paints and coatings, synthetic rubbers, polyesters andstyrene-alkyd coatings (Collins & Richey, 1992).

Packaging is the single largest application for styrene-containing resins, particularly foams, used as fillers and cushioning. Construction appli-cations include pipes, fittings, tanks, lighting fixtures and corrosion-resistant products.Household goods include synthetic marble, flooring, disposable tableware and mouldedfurnishings. Transport applications range from tyres to reinforced plastics and auto-mobile body putty (Mannsville Chemical Products Corp., 1987). Most styrene is converted to polystyrene resins, which are readily moulded and are compatible with a range of colourants, modifiers and fillers. These are used extensivelyin the fabrication of plastic packaging, disposable beverage tumblers, toys and othermoulded goods. Expandable polystyrene beads are used for disposable cups, containersand packaging as well as for insulation. Copolymers and adducts are the second largestfamily of styrene derivatives. Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) and styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN) resins have a variety of applications, including in appliance, auto-motive, construction, pipes and electronics mouldings (Mannsville Chemical ProductsCorp., 1987). A variety of special resins have the styrene functionality. Styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), used for tyres and other elastomer applications, is the largest volume syntheticrubber produced in the USA. Styrene-butadiene latex is used for carpet backing andpaper processing. Styrene is the essential co-reactant and solvent in unsaturated poly-esters used in reinforced plastic fabrications, including boats, corrosion-resistant tanksand pipes and automobile body parts (Mannsville Chemical Products Corp., 1987).Typical use patterns for styrene worldwide in 1998 and in Canada, Japan, Mexico, theUSA and western Europe for selected years are presented in Tables 2 and 3.IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 442 Table 2.

Styrene has been found at very lowlevels in many agricultural products and foods, but it is not clear whether this styreneresults from natural processes within the plant (see Section 1.4.3 ( c)). 1.4.2 Occupational exposure The National Occupational Exposure Survey conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health between 1981 and 1983 indicated that 1 112 000employees in the USA were potentially exposed to styrene at work (National Institute forOccupational Safety and Health, 1993). The estimate was based on a survey of com-panies in the USA and did not involve actual measurements of exposure. Workers may be exposed in a number of industries and operations, including styrene production, production of polystyrene and other styrene-containing polymer resins,plastics and rubber products fabrication, fabrication of reinforced-polyester plastics com-posites and use of products containing styrene, such as floor waxes and polishes, paints,adhesives, putty, metal cleaners, autobody fillers and varnishes (National Institute forOccupational Safety and Health, 1983). (a)Production of styrene and polystyrene Average exposure to styrene in styrene production and polymerization factories has been reported rarely to exceed 20 ppm [85 mg/m3] and is usually due to occasional bursts and leakages of reactors, tubing and other equipment (Tossavainen, 1978). Surveysconducted in plants in the USA engaged in the development or manufacture of styrene-based products between 1962 and 1976 showed that the average exposure of employeesin all jobs was below 10 ppm [43 mg/m 3]. Peak concentrations of up to 50 ppm [213 mg/m3] were measured during the drumming of styrene. Batch polymerization of styrene in 1942 produced concentrations up to 88 ppm [375 mg/m3] during filling ope- rations; subsequent continuous in exposurelevels of 1 ppm [4.3 mg/m 3] or below (Ott et al., 1980). In a plant in the USA where styrene was produced and polymerized, the highest levels of styrene were found in poly-merization, manufacturing and purification areas (mean, 8-35 ppm [34-149 mg/m while levels of less than 5 ppm [21 mg/m3] occurred in maintenance, laboratory and packaging operations. Urinary mandelic acid and blood styrene were undetectable inIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 444most samples taken from these workers at the end of a shift: < 10 mg/g creatinine for mandelic acid (5 ng/mL) and < 2 ng/mL for styrene in blood. The maximal concen-trations were 140 mg/g creatinine for mandelic acid and 90 ng/mL for styrene in blood(Wolff et al., 1978). In a German styrene production, polymerization and processing plant, samples taken in 1975-76 in various areas of the plant contained none (< 0.01 ppm[0.04 mg/m 3]) to 6.8 ppm below 1 ppm [4.3 mg/m3]. In a part of the plant where polystyrene was manufactured, area samples in 1975 containedfrom none (< 0.01 ppm [0.04 mg/m 3]) to below 1 ppm [4.3 mg/m3]. Of 67 employees engaged in either area of the plant, six had urinary concentrations of mandelic acid above 50 mg/L (Thiess & Friedheim, 1978). Other substances that may be found in workplace air during the manufacture of styrene and polystyrene include benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, other alkylbenzenecompounds and ethylene (Ott et al ., 1980; Lewis et al ., 1983; National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 1983). Exposure to benzene was previously a primaryconcern in these processes. In the plant in the USA described above, the TWA concen-tration of benzene in styrene monomer manufacture was 0.3-14.7 ppm [1-47 mg/m 3] between 1953 and 1972. Samples taken in 1942 during a washing operation in the poly-merization plant contained up to 63 ppm [202 mg/m 3] benzene (Ott et al., 1980). styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) and other styrene- based polymers Concentrations of styrene in area samples and breathing-zone air measured in 1965 in various plants of a styrene-butadiene latex manufacturing company in the USA (seeabove) were 4-22 ppm [17-94 mg/m 3]. The initial stages of the process, including loading, operating and cleaning of polymerization reactors, involved the highest expo-sure, and operators in these job categories were exposed to concentrations ranging from3.6 to 7.3 ppm [15-31 mg/m 3] in 1973 (Ott et al., 1980). In two adjacent SBR production plants in the USA, the TWA concentrations of styrene were 0.94 and 1.99 ppm [4 and 8.5 mg/m3], 0.03-12.3 ppm [0.13-52.4 mg/m3] (Meinhardt et al., 1982). The mean concentrations in 159 personal air samples taken in 1979 in various departments at another SBR pro-duction plant in the USA were usually below 1 ppm [4.3 mg/m 3], except for factory service and tank farm workers, for whom the means were 1.69 and 13.7 ppm [7.2 and58.2 mg/m 3], respectively (Checkoway & Williams, 1982). Company data provided by five of eight SBR plants in the USA for the period 1978-83 gave an average styrene levelin 3649 samples from all plants of 3.53 ppm [15 ppm [61 mg/m3] (Matanoski et al., 1993). A study by Macaluso et al. (1996) of the same facilities as the Matanoski study used industrial hygiene data together with a seriesof air dispersion models to estimate how TWA styrene exposure levels in the styrene-butadiene resin industry may have changed since the 1940s. Their calculations suggestthat TWA exposures declined from an average of 1.8 ppm [7.7 mg/m 3] during the 1940s to 0.1 ppm [0.4 mg/m3] in the 1990s. STYRENE 445In a plant in the USA where acrylic ester-styrene copolymers [wrongly called poly- styrene by the authors] were produced, concentrations in the breathing zone in 50samples ranged from none detected (less than 1 ppb [4.3 g/m 3]) to 19.8 ppm of about 0.6 ppm [2.5 mg/m3]; the highest concentrations occurred during styrene unloading operations (Samimi & Falbo, 1982). The numerous other substances to which workers may be exposed in these processes include 1,3-butadiene, (Ott et al., 1980; Samimi & Falbo, 1982; National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 1983). Accelerators are chemical compounds thatincrease the rate of cure and improve the physical properties of natural and syntheticrubbers, including SBR. Thiuram sulfides and (c)Processing of styrene-based polymers Styrene was measured as a thermal degradation product in the air of a Finnish factory during the processing of polystyrene, impact polystyrene and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) resins. The mean concentrations (6 h) were 0.4, 0.1 and 0.06 mg/m3, respectively (Pf\u00e4ffli, 1982). Personal 8-h samples taken in 1978, 1979 and 1980 incompanies in the USA where polystyrene and ABS moulding was contained[17-285 mg/m 3] (Burroughs, Elesh, 0.01 mg/m3(below the limit of detection) (Ruhe & Jannerfeldt, 1980). Styrene is one of the volatile organic compounds released during extrusion and vulcanization of SBR. Rappaport and concentrations of61-146 ppb [0.3-0.6 mg/m 3] in the curing area of the press room of a company manu- facturing passenger-car tyres. Area samples taken in the vulcanization and extrusionareas of shoe-sole, tyre retreading and electrical cable insulation plants of 2-500 g/m 3(vulcanization) and 0-20 g/m3(extrusion) (Cocheo et al., 1983). A more complete description of the work environment encountered in the rubber products manufacturing industry may be found in a previous monograph (IARC,1982). (d)Manufacture of glass fibre-reinforced polyester products Occupational exposure to styrene is most extensive, with respect to number of workers and levels of exposure, in the fabrication of objects from glass fibre-reinforcedpolyester composite plastics, such as boats, tanks, wall panels, bath and shower units andautomotive parts (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 1983). Styreneserves as a solvent and a reactant for the unsaturated polyester resin, in which it consti-tutes about 40% by weight. In the open mould process, a releasing agent is usuallyapplied to the mould, a first coat containing pigments (gel coat) is applied, thenIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 446successive layers of chopped and/or woven fibre glass are deposited manually or with a chopper gun at the same time as the resin is sprayed or brushed on, and then the surfaceis rolled. During lamination and curing, about 10% of the styrene may evaporate into theworkplace air (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 1983; Crandall &Hartle, 1985). Exposure to styrene in this industry has been extensively documented andsummarized in several reports (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health,1983; WHO, 1983; Pf\u00e4ffli & S\u00e4\u00e4m\u00e4nen, 1993). Table 4 lists levels of occupational expo-sure to styrene (personal breathing zone samples) reported in various countries in thelarger studies. Among the biological monitoring methods available (Section 1.1.5( b)), measure- ments of mandelic acid and phenylglyoxylic acid (see Section 4.1.1( c)) in urine are the most commonly used biological indices of exposure to styrene. Table 5 gives the concen-trations of the classical biological indicators of exposure from various studies. Symanskiet al. (2001) examined the variation in urinary levels of mandelic acid and phenylglyo- xylic acid among workers exposed to styrene in the reinforced plastics industry. Levelsof phenylglyoxylic acid varied less than those of mandelic acid, as did metabolite levelsexpressed in terms concentration. Urinary metabolite levels werehighest for laminators and for samples collected at the end of the working week. Several factors influence the level of styrene in air. The manufacture of objects with large surface area, such as boats, truck parts, baths and showers, by the open-mouldprocess results in the highest exposure. Data from 28 plants producing reinforced plasticsproducts in the USA showed that the average exposure to styrene in open-mouldprocesses was two to three times higher than that ., 1985). In a detailed survey of 12 plants making fibreglass in Washington State, USA, 40% of 8-hsamples contained more than 100 ppm [430 mg/m 3]. Chopper gun operators had the highest exposure, followed by laminators and gel-coat applicators; boat-buildinginvolved higher exposures than any other sector. For 11 plants, a relationship was seenbetween level of exposure and the quantity of resin consumed per month per exposedemployee (Schumacher et al ., 1981). Similar results were reported by Sullivan and Sullivan (1986) in their survey of 10 plants in Ontario, Canada, who also noted thatalthough dilution ventilation and often auxiliary fans were used in almost all plants, therewas little use of local exhaust ventilation. This was also the case for boat construction inthe USA. Gel coaters have lower exposure because they generally work in ventilatedbooths (Crandall & Hartle, 1985). The presence of flexible exhaust ventilation hoses wasreported to reduce styrene concentrations by a factor of two at a boat constructioncompany in Japan (Ikeda et al., 1982). So-called 'low-styrene emission resins' are in theory promising for reducing exposure, but their potential to do so in the workplace hasnot been sufficiently validated and they are not widely used (A.D. Little, Inc., 1981;Sullivan & Sullivan, 1986; S\u00e4\u00e4m\u00e4nen et al., 1993). An extensive data source on exposures to styrene in the styrene composites manu- facturing industry is the report of a study conducted in 1986 by Cal/OSHA (1986).

(1980) NR, not reported; GM, geometric mean; GSD, geometric standard deviation a Median (range) in mg/Lstudy was an in-depth industrial hygiene survey of styrene and other workplace expo- sures. A total of 141 workplaces with 2600 workers were inspected, and in 50 of theseworkplaces, a total of 379 workers were monitored over a full work shift. Exposures weresampled by a charcoal tube method with personal sampling pumps, and in addition withpassive organic vapour dosimeters, and by analysis of the urine of 327 workers (85% ofthe study population) for mandelic acid. The focus of the study was on large open-mouldspray-up/lay-up operations. Styrene exposures at these processes ranged from 0.2 to288 ppm [0.85-971 mg/m 3] TWA for eight hours; the 8-h TWA arithmetic mean and the median for these sample ppm [183 mg/m3] and 34.0 ppm [145 mg/m3], respectively. In a comparison of worker exposure levels by industry, the Cal/OSHA studyshowed that the geometric mean exposure levels were tub/shower manufactu-ring facilities mg/m3]). Operations ranked according to percen- tage of exposures above 100 ppm (6%), miscella-neous plastics manufacturing (4%) and boat and tank manufacturing (none). Styrene exposures were measured for 82 Dutch workers at four plants where unsatu- rated polyester resins were applied to moulds in the production of glass fibre-reinforcedplastics (Geuskens et al., 1992). The study considered three resin application categories: filament winding techniques; hand laminating or spraying using more than 25 kg resinevery 4 h; hand laminating using less than 25 kg resin per 4 h; workers who were in theproduction area but did not come into direct contact with styrene were the control group.The geometric mean 8-h TWA concentrations for the four plants ranged from 11 to49 ppm [47-209 mg/m 3] for the workers who came into direct contact with styrene and from 5 to 16 ppm [21-68 mg/m3] for those who were in the production area but had no contact with styrene. Wong et al. (1994) followed 15 826 American workers in the reinforced plastics industry who had worked in areas with exposure to styrene for at least six monthsbetween 1948 and 1977. Using estimates of exposure based on current (around 1980)measurements and a historical assessment of work practices, plant design, process designand occupational hygiene factors, they divided their cohort into strata by cumulativestyrene exposure. Approximately 23% of the workers had estimated cumulative expo-sures exceeding 100 ppm-years. The estimated average exposure among members of thisgroup was 298 ppm-years. The Norwegian National Institute of Occupational Health reviewed a collection of more than 7000 styrene concentration measurements taken in 234 reinforced-plasticsproduction companies in Norway during the years 1972 through 1996 (Lenvik et al., 1999). Of these plants, 124 (accounting for 60.2% of the measurements) produced boats,65 (accounting for 30.2%) produced small items, five (accounting for 3.4%) producedcar body parts and another 40 (accounting for 6.2%) produced miscellaneous items.IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 452Since 1990, the long-term average measurements (sampling time more than 1 h) fell below 20 ppm [85 mg/m3] (except for a value slightly above 20 ppm in 1996). The analyses show a decrease in the median from 62 ppm [264 mg/m3] in the 1970s to 7.1 ppm [30 mg/m3] in the 1990s. A comprehensive approach to biological monitoring of 44 workers occupationally exposed to styrene in a hand lamination plant in Europe was performed by consideringseveral end-points, including styrene in workplace air, styrene in exhaled air, and styrenein blood. Other end-points included DNA strand breaks, chromosomal aberrations,immune parameters and genotyping of polymorphic genes (see Section 4.5). The set ofworkers consisted of four groups: the high-exposure group, consisting of hand lami-nation workers; the medium-exposure group, consisting mainly of sprayers; the low-exposure group, consisting of maintenance workers; and the control group, consisting ofnon-exposed clerks. The mean duration of exposure for the whole group was 13.0 years.The mean concentration of styrene in the workplace for the whole group was 101 mg/m 3 and the mean blood concentration of styrene was 601 g/L. For the high-, medium- and low-exposure groups, mean air (and blood) concentrations were 199 mg/m3(2098 g/L), 55 mg/m3(81 g/L) and 27 mg/m3(85 g/L) (Somorovsk\u00e1 et al., 1999). Measurement of biological indicators of exposure complements the picture based on air concentrations because biological levels incorporate the influence of other routes ofabsorption and of the use of personal protective equipment (see also Section 4.1).Despite early reports that percutaneous absorption of styrene was an important route ofexposure, measurement of biological indicators of the exposure of workers who did anddid not wear gloves and other forms of protective clothing indicated that absorptionthrough the skin makes a negligible contribution to overall exposure in the manufactureof glass fibre-reinforced polyester products (Brooks et al., 1980; Bowman et al., 1990; Truchon et al ., 1992). Wearing a respirator appropriate for organic vapours reduces exposure markedly, but not entirely (Brooks et al., 1980; Ikeda et al., 1982; Bowman et al., 1990; Truchon et al ., 1992). Respirators are worn most often by gel-coat and chopper gun operators but not by laminators, who consider that they hinder their work(Truchon et al., 1992). Single-use dust respirators, which provide no protection against styrene vapours, were often the only type of protection worn (Schumacher et al., 1981; Sullivan & Sullivan, 1986). Limasset et al. (1999) compared the level of styrene absorbed percutaneously with that absorbed by inhalation in a real situation in the glass fibre-reinforced polyesterindustry. The study protocol consisted of comparisons of the patterns of urinaryexcretion of styrene metabolites by four groups of workers, all of whom performed thesame task at the same time in the same workshop but wore the following differentprotective equipment: total protection with an insulating suit and mask, respiratoryequipment only, skin protection only, and no protection. The urinary excretion level ofthe group with total protection did not significantly differ from that of the group withrespiratory protection only. Percutaneous absorption was not a particularly importantpathway for styrene absorption during stratification work in the polyester industry.STYRENE 453Completely insulating personal protective equipment provided no greater level of protection than does a respirator at positive pressure alone. The protection afforded by respirators to styrene-exposed workers has also been evaluated by measuring the reduction in urinary excretion of styrene (Gobba et al ., 2000). Seven glass fibre-reinforced plastics workers not using respiratory protectiondevices were studied for a week. External exposure to styrene was evaluated by personalpassive sampling and the internal dose by measurement of urinary styrene. Workers thenwore half-mask respirators for a week and styrene exposure and internal dose werereassessed. Mean TWA concentrations of styrene for the morning half-shift for the firstweek ranged from 246.5 to 261.2 mg/m 3; mean levels for the second week ranged from 228.5 to 280.8 mg/m3. Mean TWA concentrations of styrene for the afternoon half-shift for the first week ranged from 169.2 to 330.2 mg/m3; mean levels for the second week ranged from 207.3 to 335.7 mg/m3. Mean urinary concentrations of styrene for the first week ranged from 80.0 to 96.1 g/L; for the second week, the means ranged from 31.5 to 47.2 g/L. The authors concluded that the protection afforded by negative-pressure half-mask respirators varies widely, and stressed the need to assess the effective reduc-tion of exposure whenever these devices are introduced for styrene-exposed workers.Measurement of urinary excretion of unmodified styrene was useful for the evaluation ofrespirator effectiveness in exposed workers. Other substances may be found in workplace air in plants for the production of un- saturated polyester-reinforced plastics, although at levels usually considerably lower thanthat of styrene. These include: solvents, mainly used to clean tools and equipment, suchas ketones (e.g., acetone), chlorinated hydrocarbons the reaction of peroxides with styrene; hydroquinone and ana-logues used quinone, catechol); dusts and fibres origi-nating mainly from filler and reinforcement materials (e.g., glass fibres, silica, asbestos);foaming agents such as isocyanates; and cobalt used as National Institute Occupational Safety and Health, 1983; Coggon et al., 1987; Jensen et al., 1990; Bellander et al., 1994). (e)Miscellaneous operations In a study of exposures of firefighters, air samples taken during the 'knockdown' phase of a fire contained styrene at a concentration of 1.3 ppm [5.5 mg/m3]; none was detected during the 'overhaul' phase (Jankovic et al., 1991). During working operations at a US hazardous waste site in 1983, a mean styrene concentration of 235 g/m3(maxi- mum, 678 g/m3) was measured in air for a group of workers nearest the areas where chemically contaminated materials were handled (Costello, 1983). During the manu-facture of polyester paints, lacquers and putties in Finland, occasional high exposure tostyrene was recorded, with 5% of measurements above 20 ppm mg/m 3]; use of theIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME in exposures below 1 ppm [4.3 mg/m3] (S\u00e4\u00e4m\u00e4nen et al., 1991). Application of polyester putty during cable splicing operations for a telephone companyin the USA resulted in short-term levels (3-16 min) ranging from 2 to 16 ppm[8.5-68 mg/m 3] in four samples (Kingsley, 1976). In a Japanese plant where plastic buttons were manufactured from polyester resins, the 8-h TWA concentration of styrenefor 34 workers was 7.1 ppm [30 mg/m maximum of 28 mg/m3] (Kawai et al., 1992). In four 100-min area air samples taken in 1982 at a college in the USA during a sculpture class in which polyester resins were used, styrene concentrations ranged from0.8 to 1.2 ppm [3.4-5.1 mg/m 3]; two personal breathing zone air samples contained 2.8 and 3.0 ppm [11.9 and 12.8 mg/m3]. The concentration of methyl ethyl ketone peroxide was below the detection limit (< 0.02 ppm) (Reed, 1983). Taxidermists who used polyester resins during specimen preparation were shown to be exposed for short periods (2-34 min) to concentrations of styrene ranging from 21 to300 mg/m 3(12 samples) (Kronoveter & Boiano, 1984a,b). In two cooking-ware manufacturing companies in the USA where styrene-based resins were used, the 8-h TWA concentrations of styrene ranged from 0.2 to 81 ppm[0.85-345 mg/m 3]; two short-duration samples (24 min) contained 142 and 186 ppm (605 and 792 mg/m3] (Fleeger & Almaguer, 1988; Barsan et al., 1991). 1.4.3 Environmental occurrence Human exposure to styrene has been assessed on the basis of a review of data in the published literature (Tang et al., 2000). The authors estimated that styrene exposure for the general population is in the range of from inhalation and from food intake. The inhaled styrene accounts for more than 90% of the total intake.The styrene in food occurs mainly by migration from polymer packaging materials. Theauthors also concluded that cigarette smoking is another important source of styreneintake for smokers. The intake of styrene due to smoking 20 cigarettes was estimated tobe higher than the total daily intake from food and air. A Canadian study estimated a daily total styrene intake for the Canadian general population ranging from below 0.19 to over 0.85 g/kg bw. Intakes from ambient air ranged from 0.004 up to 0.17 g/kg bw and those from indoor air from 0.07 up to 0.10 g/kg bw. Intake from food was calculated to range from below 0.11 to over 0.58 g/kg bw. The estimated intakes from drinking water and soil were negligible. Potential exposure from cigarette smoke, on the basis of the styrene content reported formainstream smoke (10 g per cigarette) and a smoking rate of 20 cigarettes per day, was estimated to be 2.86 g/kg bw per day for adults. The Canadian study estimated that styrene in food may represent a major exposure source for the general population (HealthCanada, 1993; Newhook & Caldwell, 1993).STYRENE 455(a)Air Styrene has been detected in the atmosphere in many locations. Its presence in air is due principally to emissions from industrial processes involving styrene and its polymersand copolymers. Other sources of styrene in the environment include vehicle exhaust,cigarette smoke and other forms of combustion and incineration of styrene polymers(WHO, 1983). Styrene emissions reported to the European Union by member countries (Bouscaren et al., 1987) are shown in Table 6. Air emissions in the USA, reported to the US Environ- mental Protection Agency by approximately 1500 industrial facilities, increased from15 600 tonnes in 1988 to 24 800 tonnes in 1999 (Environmental Protection Agency,2001a). Based on Environmental Protection Agency (1999) national emission estimates,the total styrene emissions for 1990 can be allocated as follows: on-road vehicles, 17 900tonnes (32.9% of total emissions); reinforced plastic composites production and boatmanufacturing, 21 700 tonnes (39.8%); and all other sources, 14 900 tonnes (33.9%).Ambient air levels of styrene sampled in the vicinity (< 500 m) of seven reinforcedplastic processors in three states in the USA ranged from 0.29 to 2934 g/m 3, and those in communities near the processors (500-1000 m) from 1.67 to 23.8 g/m3(McKay et al., 1982). Styrene levels of 1.1-6.6 g/m3were measured in air samples from the Pennsylvania Turnpike Allegheny Mountain Tunnel in 1979. The mean concentration inthe tunnel intake air was below 0.1 g/m 3(Hampton et al., 1983). Air concentrations of styrene in the vicinity of five rural hazardous waste sites in New Jersey, USA, ranged upto 66 g/m 3(LaRegina et al., 1986).IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 456 Table 6.

The 20 test stations are located in urbanareas, representing the greatest portion of the California population. Styrene is measuredon a 24-hour sample collected once each month. Based on data from the Board reflectingthe measurements for each test station for each month from 1989 to 1995, the averagereading for styrene was approximately 0.20 ppb [0.9 g/m 3] over six years. The detection level for styrene was 0.1 ppb [0.4 g/m3] and the highest measurement was 2.9 ppb [12.4 g/m3] (Styrene Information & Research Center, 2001). Styrene levels in ambient air were determined in a survey of 18 sites (mostly urban) in Canada in 1988-90. The mean concentrations in 586 24-h samples ranged from 0.09to 2.35 g/m 3. In a national survey of styrene levels in indoor air in 757 single-family dwellings and apartments, representative of the homes of the general population ofCanada in 1991, the mean 24-h concentration was 0.28 g/m 3, with values ranging from none detected (limit of detection, 0.48 g/m3) up to 129 g/m3(Newhook & Caldwell, 1993). For residential exposure, median concentrations obtained by personal air sampling are generally in the 1-3 g/m3range (Wallace et al., 1985; Wallace, 1986). Exposure to styrene is approximately six times higher for smokers than for nonsmokers, and tobaccosmoke is the major source of styrene exposure for smokers (Wallace et al. , 1987, 1989). Measurements in homes with and without smokers revealed that average styrene concen-trations in the homes of smokers were approximately 0.5 g/m 3higher than those in the homes of nonsmokers. Hodgson et al. (1996) also found that environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) can contribute significantly to indoor airborne styrene concentrations. ETSwas estimated to contribute 8% to the total styrene inhalation exposure of all non-smoking Californians (Miller et al. , 1998). Styrene is one of the hundreds of individual components that may be quantified in tobacco smoke (IARC, 1986; Darrall et al. , 1998; Health Canada, 1999; IARC, 2003). The styrene content of cigarette smoke has been reported to be 18-48 g per cigarette (WHO, 1983). Off-gassing of styrene from some styrene-containing household productsmay also contribute to indoor air levels (Kn\u00f6ppel & Schauenburg, 1989). In order to illustrate the relative significance of various sources of exposure to styrene, Fishbein (1992) estimated approximate exposure levels in several environmentsand compared nominal daily intakes from those sources (Table 7). Thermal degradation of styrene-containing polymers also releases styrene into ambient air (Hoff et al., 1982; Lai & Locke, 1983; Rutkowski & Levin, 1986). Gurman et al. (1987) reported that styrene monomer is the main volatile product of the thermal decomposition of polystyrene, comprising up to 100% of the volatiles in special labo-ratory conditions. V olatile organic compounds found at municipal structural fires have been charac- terized in order to identify sources of long-term health risks to firefighters. These com-pounds were identified and quantified using GC-MS in selected ion-monitoring mode.The compounds with the highest levels found were benzene, toluene and naphthaleneSTYRENE 457(see monograph in this volume); styrene and other alkyl-substituted benzene compounds were frequently identified (Austin et al., 2001). Little is known about factors that influence blood levels of volatile organic com- pounds in non-occupationally exposed populations. Possible relationships were exa-mined between recent self-reported chemical exposures and elevated blood volatileorganic compound levels among 982 adult participants in the Third National Health andNutrition Examination Survey in the USA. A strong relationship was found ( p< 0.001) between increasing lifetime pack-years of cigarettes smoked and elevated levels oftoluene, styrene, and benzene (Churchill et al., 2001). (b)Water Although styrene has been detected occasionally in estuaries and inland waters and in drinking-water, its presence is usually traceable to an industrial source or to improperdisposal (WHO, 1983; Law et al., 1991). In surveys of Canadian drinking-water supplies, the frequency of detection of styrene was low; when detected, it was generally at aconcentration below 1 g/L (Newhook & Caldwell, 1993). After accidental drinking- water contamination with styrene in Spain, transient levels up to 900 g/L were reported (Arnedo-Pena et al. , 2002). (c)Food Polystyrene and its copolymers have been used widely as food packaging materials, and residual styrene monomer can migrate into food from such packaging (WHO, 1983).Analysis of styrene in 133 plastic food containers from retail food outlets in the UnitedKingdom showed concentrations ranging from 16 to 1300 mg/kg; 73% of containers hadstyrene concentrations of 100-500 mg/kg, and only five containers had levels exceeding1000 mg/kg. The food in the containers had levels of monomer ranging from below 1 toIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 458 Table 7.

Similar surveys were carried out by the Food Safety Directorate in 1992 and 1994 in the United Kingdom, with styrene concentrations similar to those found in the 1983survey. Within each food type, higher levels of styrene were generally found for productswith high fat content or packed in small containers (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheriesand Food, 1994). Between 1991 and 1999, the Food and Drug Administration's Total Diet Study in the USA analysed 320 different foods and found styrene residues in 49 of them. In 258samples containing styrene, the mean concentrations for individual food items variedbetween 10 g/kg (eggs) and 274 g/kg (strawberries). The median concentration for the 49 foods was 21 g/kg (Food and Drug Administration, 2000). Several assessments have been made of estimated daily intake (EDI) of styrene in food packaged in polymers or copolymers of styrene. In 1981, the Food and Drug Admi-nistration in the USA measured the migration of styrene over a 24-h period from foam,impact and crystal polystyrene cups into 8% ethanol and water at 49 \u00b0C. The observed migration was 0.036, 0.064 and 0.210 g/cm 2, respectively. This corresponds to 6 g styrene from a 2 dL (8 oz.) foam cup. Migration from foam cups into hot water, tea andcoffee was one fifth of these levels: approximately 1 g from a 2 dL (8 oz.) cup (Varner & Breder, 1981). In a 1983 study, the EDI of styrene monomer from polystyrene foodpackaging, including polystyrene foam cups, was in the range of 1 to 4 g per day (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, 1989). More recently, Lickly et al. (1995) estimated total dietary intake of styrene monomer from polystyrene food-contactpolymers to be 9 g per day. Styrene has been detected at low levels (ppb) in several foods and beverages which had not previously been in contact with styrene-containing packaging materials (Maarse,1992a,b; Steele, 1992, Steele et al., 1994). Much higher levels (around 40 mg/kg) have been measured in cinnamon, and enzymatic degradation of cinnamic acid derivativeswas proposed as a possible source (Oliviero, 1906; Ducruet, 1984). The low-level occur-rence of styrene in other foods has been suggested to result from enzymatic and/ormicrobial activity, but it is unclear to what extent these processes are, in fact, responsiblefor the levels detected (Steele et al. , 1994; Tang et al. , 2000). 1.5 Regulations and guidelines 1.5.1 Exposure limits and guidelines Occupational exposure limits and guidelines for styrene are presented in Table 8. A tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 7.7 g/kg bw for styrene has been established by WHO (1993), with a guideline value of 20 g/L in drinking-water. The Environmental Protection Agency (2001b) has set a maximum contaminant level (MCL) for styrene inpublic water systems in the USA at 0.1 mg/L.STYRENE 459The Food and Drug Administration (2001) has established regulations for the use of polymers and copolymers of styrene in products in contact with food in the USA. Forstyrene and methyl methacrylate copolymers as components of paper and paperboard incontact with fatty foods, the monomer content in the copolymer is limited to 0.5%. Forstyrene-acrylic copolymers, the level of residual styrene monomer in the polymer shouldnot exceed 0.1% by weight.IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 460 Table 8.

Various reported correlations between the con-centration of styrene in air and those in venous blood and with mandelic acid and phenyl-glyoxylic acid levels in urine have been reviewed by Guillemin and Berode (1988),Lauwerys and Hoet (1993), Pekari et al. (1993) and the American Conference of Govern- mental Industrial Hygienists (2001). For example, the concentration of mandelic acid in urine that corresponds to inha- lation of 50 ppm styrene (213 mg/m 3) for 8 h would be approximately 800-900 mg/g creatinine at the end of a shift The phenylglyo- xylic acid concentration in urine that corresponds to an 8-h exposure to 50 ppm styrenewould be expected to be 200-300 mg/g creatinine at the end of a shift and about100 mg/g creatinine the following morning (Pekari et al., 1993; American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, 2001). The styrene concentration in blood thatcorresponds to an 8-h exposure to 50 ppm styrene would be expected to be 0.5-1 mg/LSTYRENE 461 Table 8 (contd) Country or region ACGIH (TLV) 2001 85 (A4, 426 852TWA Ceiling NIOSH (REL) 2000 213 426TWA Ceiling From American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) (2000, 2001); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (2001); (OSHA) (2001); Sosiaali-ja threshold limit value; PEL, permissible exposure level; REL, recommended exposure level; A4, not classifiable as a human carcinogen; Ca, suspected of having carcinogenic potential; ir, irritant; sk, absorption through the skin may be a signi- ficant source of exposure a Category 5, substances with carcinogenic and genotoxic potential, the potency of which is considered to be so low that, provided that the MAK value is observed, no significant contri- bution to human cancer risk is to be expectedat the end of a shift and about 0.02 mg/L in blood the following morning (Guillemin & Berode, 1988; American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, 2001). Each year, the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) (2001) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (2001) publish biologicalreference values for use in interpreting the results of biological monitoring for styrene inthe workplace. The results must be interpreted in relation to the different definitions ofthose reference values. ACGIH biological exposure indices are reference values intendedfor use as guidelines for evaluating potential health hazards in the practice of industrialhygiene. The indices represent the levels of the determinants that are most likely to beobserved in specimens collected from healthy workers exposed by inhalation to airconcentrations at the level of the threshold limit value (American Conference of Govern-mental Industrial Hygienists, 2001). In Germany, the biological tolerance value (BAT)for occupational exposures is defined as the maximal permissible quantity of a chemicalcompound or its metabolites, or the maximum permissible deviation from the norm ofbiological parameters induced by those substances in exposed humans. According tocurrent knowledge, these conditions generally do not impair the health of an employee,even if exposure is repeated and of long duration. The BAT values are conceived asceiling values for healthy individuals (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, 2001). Biological monitoring reference values for exposure to styrene, based on styrene metabolite levels in urine or styrene in blood, are given in Table 9.IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 462 Table 9.

Studies of Cancer in Humans 2.1 Case reports Cases of leukaemia and lymphoma were identified among workers engaged in the production of styrene-butadiene rubber (Lemen & Young, 1976), in the manufacture ofstyrene-butadiene (Block, 1976) and in the manufacture of styrene and polystyrene(Nicholson et al., 1978). A total of 16 cases of leukaemia and 9 of lymphoma were reported in these studies. In addition to styrene, exposure to benzene, 1,3-butadiene,ethylbenzene and other chemicals could have occurred in these operations. 2.2 Cohort studies (see Table 10) 2.2.1 Styrene manufacture and polymerization A study by Frentzel-Beyme et al. (1978) of 1960 workers engaged in the manu- facture of styrene and polystyrene in Germany between 1931 and 1976 showed no signi-ficant excess mortality from cancer. The cohort had accumulated 20 138 person-years.Follow-up was 93% for the German workers but only 29% for the non-German workersand there were only 74 deaths (96.5 expected) available for analysis. Only one deathfrom lymphatic cancer was observed. There were two deaths from pancreatic cancer (0.7expected). In 1975 and 1976, concentrations of styrene in the plant were generally below1 ppm [4.3 mg/m 3], but higher concentrations were occasionally recorded (Thiess & Friedheim, 1978). [The Working Group noted that insufficient information was providedto assess the risk for cause-specific deaths by exposure period or duration of exposure.] Ott et al. (1980) studied a cohort of workers at four plants in the USA where styrene- based products were developed and produced. Exposure to styrene varied by process andtime period. During container filling for batch polymerization in 1942, styreneconcentrations ranged from 5 to 88 ppm [21-375 mg/m 3]; in continuous polymerization and concentrations were below 10 ppm [43 mg/m3] and generally below 1 ppm in 1975 and 1976. Cohorts from each plant had been exposed between 1937and 1970 and were followed from 1940 to 1975. Other potential exposures includedbenzene, acrylonitrile, 1,3-butadiene, ethylbenzene, dyes and pigments. Age- and race-specific US mortality rates were used to calculate the expected numbers of deaths. A totalof 2904 workers with a minimum of one year of employment were included. Bond et al. (1992) updated the study, adding a further 11 years of follow-up. Based on this update,the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for all causes was 0.76 (95% confidence interval[CI], 0.70-0.82; 687 deaths), for all 0.69-0.95; 162 deaths)and was restricted toSTYRENE 463IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 464 Table 10.

Hodgson and Jones (1985) reported on 622 men who had worked for at least one year in the production, polymerization and processing of styrene at a plant in the UnitedKingdom between 1945 and 1974 who were followed until 1978. Of these, 131 men werepotentially exposed to styrene in laboratories and 491 in production of styrene monomer,polymerization of styrene or manufacture of finished products. No measurements ofexposure were provided, but many other chemicals were present in the workingenvironment. Expected numbers of deaths were calculated on the basis of national rates.There were 34 deaths (43.1 expected) among the 622 exposed workers. A significantexcess of deaths from lymphoma (SMR, 5.4; [95% CI, 1.1-16]; 3 deaths) was observed.An analysis of cancer registrations for this population revealed an additional case of lym-phatic leukaemia, giving a total of four incident cases of lymphatic and haematopoieticcancer, whereas 1.6 would have been expected from local cancer registration rates[standardized incidence ratio (SIR), 2.5; 95% CI, 0.67-6.4]. In addition, three incidentcases expected; [SIR, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.2-18]). 2.2.2 Use of styrene in reinforced plastics Okun et al. (1985) studied 5021 workers who had been employed in two reinforced- plastic boat-building facilities in the USA for at least one day between 1959 and 1978.On the basis of industrial hygiene surveys, 2060 individuals were classified as havinghad high exposure to styrene, with means in the two facilities of 42.5 and 71.7 ppm [181and 305 mg/m 3]. Of these, 25% had worked for less than one month, 49% had worked for one month to one year and only 7% had worked for more than five years. There were47 deaths in the high-exposure group (41.5 expected); no cases of lymphatic or haemato-poietic cancer were observed in the high-exposure group (approximately one expected)or in the full cohort (4.2 expected). Wong (1990) and Wong et al. (1994) reported on a cohort of 15 826 male and female employees who had worked at one of 30 reinforced-plastics plants in the USA for at leastsix months between 1948 and 1977. Workers were followed until 1989; vital status wasdetermined using Social Security Administration files, the National Death Index and therecords of credit agencies. A total of 307 932 person-years at risk were accumulated.Expected numbers of deaths were based on national age-, gender-, cause- and year-specific death rates for whites, as no information was available on race. Exposure tostyrene was calculated using a job-exposure matrix that included work history andcurrent and past time-weighted average exposures. A total of 1628 (10.3%) members ofthe cohort were found to have died, and death certificates were obtained for 97.4% ofthem. The overall SMR was 1.08 (95% CI, 1.03-1.13) the SMR from all cancers was1.16 (95% CI, 1.05-1.27). Mortality from cancers at a number of sites was increasedsignificantly; the SMRs for 468(95% CI, 1.4-5.2; 10 deaths); and other female genital organs, 2.0 (95% CI, 1.1-3.5; 13 deaths). In the cohort as a whole, no excess was observed for lymphohaematopoieticcancers (SMR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.56-1.2; 31 deaths), nor was there a strong suggestion ofexcess risk for any of these cancers in any of the subgroups analysed. The data wereanalysed by Cox regression with age, gender, length of exposure and cumulative expo-sure included in the model. Neither cumulative exposure nor length of exposure wassignificantly related to risk in the model for lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer. Nopositive dose-response relationship was found for any other cancer that was analysed.[The Working Group noted that the possibility that the inclusion of two correlatedindices of styrene exposure in the regression models may have artificially reduced thecoefficients of both.] Kogevinas et al. (1993, 1994a,b) included an extended follow-up of the study by Coggon et al. (1987) and parts of the material of Kolstad et al. (1993, 1994, 1995) and H\u00e4rk\u00f6nen et al. (1984). The study included 40 688 workers employed in 660 plants of the reinforced plastics industry and enrolled in eight subcohorts in Denmark, Finland,Italy, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Exposure to styrene was reconstructedfrom job and production records, environmental measurements and, in Italy, biologicalmonitoring. An exposure database was constructed on the basis of about 16 400 personalair samples and 18 695 measurements of styrene metabolites in urine. Styrene exposurelevels decreased considerably during the study period. The data from Denmark, consi-dered to be representative of all six countries, showed exposures of about 200 ppm[852 mg/m 3] in the early 1960s, about 100 ppm [430 mg/m3] in the late 1960s and about 20 ppm [85 mg/m3] in the late 1980s. The 40 688 workers accumulated 539 479 person- years at risk and were followed for an average of 13 years. Workers lost to follow-up andthose who emigrated constituted 3.0% of the total cohort, and in no individual cohort didthis proportion exceed 8.0%; 60% of the cohort had less than two years' exposure and9% had more than 10 years' exposure. The WHO mortality data bank was used tocompute national mortality reference rates by sex, age (in five-year groups) and calendaryear. No excess was observed for mortality from all causes [SMR, 0.96; neoplasms CI, (95% CI, 0.59-0.88; 106deaths) among unexposed workers. The mortality rate in exposed workers for neoplasmsof the lymphatic and haematopoietic tissues was not elevated (SMR, 0.98; 95% CI,0.72-1.3; 49 deaths) and was not associated with length of exposure. When the durationof exposure was two years or more and at least 20 years had elapsed since first exposure,the SMR for all lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers was 1.7 (95% CI, 0.70-3.6; sevendeaths) and that for leukaemia was 1.9 (95% CI, 0.40-5.7; three deaths). Evaluation ofrisk by job type showed no meaningful pattern. In an analysis by country, one of thecohorts in the United Kingdom and that in Denmark had moderately increased mortalityfrom lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer. There was no significant increase in theSMRs for other cancers; there was a nearly significant increase in risk for pancreaticSTYRENE 469cancer among workers in the highest exposure category ( ppm-years) (SMR, 2.6; 95% CI, 0.90-7.3; 10 deaths). Working Group noted that the overall SMR for theunexposed group was very low, possibly reflecting problems in ascertaining mortality insome subcohorts. This may have negatively biased the SMRs in this study.] In contrastwith the results of SMR analyses using the external referents, the results of internalanalyses did show some statistically significant elevations in risk related to exposure tostyrene. An increased risk for lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers was observed inPoisson regression models for average exposure ( p= 0.019), culminating in a relative risk of 3.6 (95% CI, 1.0-13; n= 8) for the highest category, > 200 ppm. A statistically significant trend ( p= 0.012) was also observed for time since first exposure, the relative risk reaching a peak after 20 years of 4.0 (95% CI, 1.3-12; n= 9). No trend was observed in the Poisson regression analysis with cumulative exposure or duration of exposure. In the study by Kolstad et al. (1993, 1994), 64 529 workers (53 731 men and 10 798 women) in 552 companies engaged in production of reinforced plastics were followed upfrom 1970 to the end of 1989 through the Danish national cancer registry and the nationalmortality database. [The Working Group noted that the females were excluded from theanalysis in the second paper by Kolstad et al. (1994) because 'the majority were not involved in the production of reinforced plastics'.] Information on the companies' acti-vities was obtained from two dealers. Altogether, 386 companies were classified as everproducing reinforced plastics (with 36 525 male workers) and 84 were classified as neverproducing (with 14 254 male workers); for 82 companies, the information was unknown.All 12 837 men and 2185 women from 287 plants where the main product was reinforcedplastics (involving more than 50% of the workforce in the plant) were included in thestudy by Kogevinas et al. (1993, 1994a,b). Fifty-three persons had disappeared from the follow-up and, in addition, 1104 had emigrated during the study period; the total loss tofollow-up was 1.9%. A total of 584 556 person-years were accumulated until death,emigration, disappearance or the end of the study (whichever came first). The meanannual levels of styrene exposure calculated for 128 of these companies reflect theexposures measured in the industry, which ranged from 180 ppm mg/m in 1976-88. Duration of employment was calculated from pension fund payments made beginning in 1964-89. However, in a small validationsub-study of 671 workers, the authors found errors in the records which led to under-estimation of duration of employment in the industry for about 40% of the workers andto overestimation for about 13%. There were too few women to provide statisticallystable results. Among men, there were a total of 4281 deaths in the cohort and 1915 inci-dent cases of cancer (SIR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.97-1.07). Within companies producingreinforced plastics, there were slight increases in risk for lymphatic and haematopoieticcancers (SIR, 1.2; 95% CI, for leukaemia (SIR, 1.2; 95% CI,0.88-1.7; 42 cases). A statistically significant increased risk for leukaemia was foundafter 10 years since first employment (SIR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.2; 32 cases); however, therisk was confined to workers employed for less than one year (SIR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4-3.6;20 cases). A significant increase in the incidence of leukaemia was observed for thoseIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 470who had been employed in 1964-70 (the period with the highest exposure to styrene) (SIR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0-2.2; 30 cases). [The Working Group noted that the misclassifi-cation of duration of employment that was noted by the authors would also have appliedto the Danish component of the European study.] Kolstad et al. (1995) also published results on solid cancers (not including lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers) among men within the reinforced plastics industry inDenmark. The study cohort was essentially the same as that in the previous studies(Kolstad et al. , 1993; Kogevinas et al. , 1994a,b; Kolstad et al. , 1994). There were 36 310 male workers from the reinforced plastics companies, and 14 293 workers in similarindustries not producing reinforced plastics (127 more workers than in the previousstudies). Altogether, 1134 solid cancers were observed during 1970-89 within thereinforced plastics industry (SIR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.93-1.1); there were 47 cases of rectalcancer (SIR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.58-1.0), 41 cases of pancreatic (SIR, 1.2; 95% CI,0.86-1.6) and 46 cases of tumours of the brain and nervous system (SIR, 0.97; 95% CI,0.71-1.3). The relative risk for pancreatic cancer incidence was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.1-4.5; 17cases) for employment with a high probability of exposure to styrene, and duration ofemployment at least one year, compared with no exposure. 2.2.3 Styrene-butadiene rubber manufacture A number of reports have presented results on the mortality of workers in the styrene-butadiene synthetic rubber (SBR) industry (McMichael et al et al., 1992; Matanoski et al., 1993). With some exceptions, these workers were included in the University of Alabama study. These earlier studies suggested an increased risk for lymphatic andhaematopoietic malignancies in the SBR industry, but generally did not provide data onexposure to styrene per se and are far less informative than the more recent investi- gations from the University of Alabama, which are described below. A study performed by researchers at the University of Alabama (Delzell et al. , 1996; Sathiakumar et al. , 1998) assessed the mortality experience of 15 649 male synthetic rubber workers employed for at least one year at eight SBR plants in the USA andCanada (information concerning exposure to 1,3-butadiene was summarized in IARC(1999)). A two-plant complex had been previously studied by Meinhardt et al. (1982) and the other six plants by Matanoski et al. (1990, 1993) and Santos-Burgoa et al. (1992). Complete work histories were available for 97% of the subjects. During 1943-91, the cohort had a total of 386 172 person-years of follow-up. Altogether 10 939 (70%)of the subjects were classified as being alive, 3976 (25%) were deceased and 734 (5%)were lost to follow-up. Information on cause of death was available for 97% of dece-dents. The observed total of 3976 deaths compared with 4553 deaths expected on thebasis of general population mortality rates for the USA and Ontario (SMR, 0.87; 95% CI,0.85-0.90). Cancer mortality was slightly lower than expected, with 950 deaths (SMR,0.93; 95% CI, 0.87-0.99). Lymphopoietic cancers accounted for number expected (SMR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.88-1.3). There were 48 observed deaths from leukaemia in the overall cohort (SMR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.97-1.7). There was astatistically significant workers in polymerization (15 2.1-7.9), which were three areas withpotential for relatively high exposure to 1,3-butadiene or styrene monomers. Among the'ever hourly-paid' workers with 10 or more years of employment and 20 or more yearssince hire, there was a significant excess of leukaemia deaths (28 deaths; SMR, 2.2;95% CI, 1.5-3.2). (2001) and Sielken & Valdez-Flores (2001) re-analysed the University of Alabama results on leukaemia deaths within the US and Canadian cohorts. In thesestudies, the exposure assessments for 1,3-butadiene and styrene were revised, as com-pared with the earlier report (Macaluso et al., 1996) and exposure estimates were deve- loped for dimethyldithiocarbamate (DMDTC). [The Working Group noted that, unlike inthe earlier report, assessment of exposure was performed after knowing the jobs anddepartments of the leukaemia cases.] Workers from two facilities had exposure recordsof insufficient quality and were dropped from the original study, leaving 13 130 menfrom six of the plants, and 59 deaths from leukaemia (medical records were obtained for48 cases and one case was an acute unspecified leukaemia) during 1943-91 (in 234 416person-years). Vital status was known for over 99% of the subjects, and death certificateswere available for 98% of the decedents. In the within-cohort comparisons (Poissonregression), unlike in the cohort (SMR) study, all leukaemia deaths (leukaemia beingeither an underlying or a contributing cause of death) were used; 49 of the leukaemiadeaths were confirmed from medical records. About 79% of the cohort subjects wereexposed to 1,3-butadiene, the median cumulative exposure being 71 ppm-years[301 mg/m 3-years], and 85% to styrene, with a median cumulative exposure of 17 ppm- years [72 mg/m3-years], and 62% cumulative exposure1of 373.9 mg-years/cm. Poisson regression analyses with the individual exposures indicateda positive and monotonically increasing association between grouped cumulative expo-sure to styrene (relative risks of 1.0, 1.2, 2.3 and 3.2, for exposures of 0, > 0-< 20.6,20.6-< 60.4 and 60.4 ppm-years) and leukaemia, and between exposure to 1,3-buta- diene and leukaemia. For both of the exposures, a statistically significant relative riskwas obtained for the highest cumulative exposure category (for styrene: relative risk, 3.2;95% CI, 1.2-8.8; 18 for DMDTC and leukaemia did not increasemonotonically, but a significantly increased relative risk was observed for each of theexposed groups. In models that included all three exposures, the exposure-responseIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 472 1The DMDTC exposure estimation procedure yielded: (1) an estimate of the concentration of DMDTC in the solution wetting the skin of the exposed worker (in mg/cm3); (2) an estimate of the skin surface exposed (in cm2); and (3) an estimate of the frequency and duration of exposure. The exposure intensity unit was (mg/cm3) \u00d7(cm2) = mg/cm.relationship for styrene became negative. The exposure-response relationship for 1,3- butadiene was weakly positive, and the exposure-response relationship for DMDTCremained irregular. A positive exposure-response model for styrene persisted in a modelthat included 1,3-butadiene (and not DMDTC). [The Working Group noted the strongcorrelation between exposure to styrene and 1,3-butadiene and considered this a majorobstacle to assessing risks due to styrene per se . The Working Group noted that levels of exposure to styrene in this industry were considerably lower than in studies withinreinforced plastics industries. The Working Group questioned whether there was suffi-cient justification for controlling for DMDTC in the analysis since there are noepidemiological or toxicological data suggesting that DMDTC is a potential carcinogen,although it does have toxic effects on haematopoietic tissues in rodents. The results froma previous analysis of this study, based on somewhat different subject pools, somewhatdifferent diagnostic criteria and an earlier exposure assessment (Macaluso et al., 1996), were slightly different from those reported by Delzel et al. (2001). The Working Group judged the more recent results to be the most informative.] 2.2.4 Other cohort studies In addition to the studies on occupational exposures, a study was conducted on lym- phatic and haematopoietic cancers among students attending a high school in Texas adja-cent to a styrene-butadiene facility (Loughlin et al. , 1999). A cohort of 15 403 students attending this school from 1963-64 to 1992-93 was identified. Altogether, 338 deathswere identified in the 310 254 person-years in the follow-up period from 1963 up to theend orhaematopoietic for both genderscombined). The only cause of death with a statistically significant excess was benignneoplasms (six deaths; [SMR, CI, 0.04-8.7; one deathamong women). All who died of benign neoplasms had brain tumours. [It was notexplicitly mentioned how many subjects (men or women) were lost to follow-up.Potential exposures to styrene or other chemical agents were not described.] A programme of biomonitoring for styrene was undertaken by the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health among workers who were exposed to styrene from 1973.Mandelic acid was used as a biomarker of styrene exposure. Anttila et al. (1998) carried out a cancer follow-up study among 2580 subjects who were tested between 1973 and1983. The overall mandelic acid level was 2.3 mmol/L (range, 0-47 mmol/L urine)during the monitoring period. Altogether 34 288 person-years were accrued in thefollow-up from 1973 up to the end of 1992. In the styrene-exposed cohort, 5549 urineSTYRENE 473mandelic acid samples were collected; for 84 samples (1.5%), the personal identifier could not be traced. There was no loss to follow-up among those whose personal iden-tifier had been traced successfully [the number of those who migrated was notmentioned.] There were 48 cases of cancer observed (SIR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.59-1.1); sixcases of rectal cancer (SIR, cases of pancreatic cancer (SIR,1.7; 95% CI, 0.34-4.9), six cases of nervous system cancer (SIR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.59-3.5)and two cases of lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer (SIR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.05-1.4;both of the cases had Hodgkin lymphoma). There was no evidence of an exposure-response relationship for any cancer site when mean lifetime mandelic acid level wasused as a surrogate for exposure to styrene. There were no cases of pancreatic cancerwithin this highest exposure category (0.8 cases expected). [The Working Group notedthat the relatively small size and low exposures of this cohort may have limited its powerto detect any association with lymphatic and haematopoietic neoplasms.] 2.3 Case-control studies Flodin et al. (1986) conducted a matched case-control study of 59 cases of acute myeloblastic leukaemia and 354 controls in Sweden to assess potential risk factors,which included radiation, medications and various occupational exposures. Cases wereaged 20-70 years and were identified at hospitals in Sweden between 1977 and 1982.Two series of controls were drawn from a population register: one was matched to casesfor sex, age (within five years) and location, and the other was a random populationsample. Information on exposure was obtained through a questionnaire mailed tosubjects. Of eight occupational exposures examined, styrene was reported by three casesand one control, leading to an estimated standardized odds ratio of 19 (95% CI, 1.9-357).[The Working Group noted the small numbers and the self-reported nature of the expo-sure estimates, which may be problematic for styrene.] A population-based case-control study of cancer comprised 3730 histologically confirmed male cases of cancer at 15 major sites (including non-Hodgkin lymphoma andHodgkin lymphoma) newly diagnosed between 1979 and 1986 in Montreal, Canada,aged 35-70 and ascertained in 19 major hospitals, as well 533 population controls(Siemiatycki, 1991; G\u00e9rin et al. , 1998; Dumas et al. , 2000). The exposure of each subject to 293 occupational agents was assessed by a group of chemists on the basis of jobs held,and cases of cancer at each site were compared with those in the rest of the study popu-lation, after adjustment for age, ethnic group, family income, alcohol drinking andtobacco smoking. Two per cent of the subjects were classified as ever having beenexposed to styrene. A synthetic form of cumulative exposures at low, medium or highlevel was also computed, based on the sum product of duration, frequency and concen-tration of exposure. The odds ratio for rectal cancer for any exposure to styrene was 1.7(95% CI, 0.7-4.5; six exposed cases) (Siemiatycki, 1991; Dumas et al. , 2000). A signi- ficant increase in the risk for cancer of the rectum was seen for medium to high exposurelevel (odds ratio, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.4-19; five in multiple-exposure models adjusting additionally for some other solvents). In the single-exposure models, the odds ratios for exposure to styrenewere: 1.2 (95% CI, 0.6-2.5, 11 exposed cases for any exposure) for colon cancer, 0.3(95% CI, 0.0-2.6; one exposed case for any exposure) for pancreatic cancer, 0.9(95% CI, 0.2-3.3; five exposed cases for medium to high exposure) for lung cancer, 2.0(95% CI, 0.8-4.8; eight cases for any exposure) for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 2.4(95% CI, 0.5-12; two exposed cases for any exposure) for Hodgkin lymphoma (G\u00e9rinet al. , 1998). [The Working Group noted that the exposure levels of the exposed subjects were probably lower than those in the cohort studies.] 3. Studies of Cancer in Experimental Animals Six studies in rats and four studies in mice by oral and inhalation routes of exposure to styrene were presented in the previous monograph (IARC, 1994a). These are includedhere in summary form together with reviews of new inhalation studies in rats and mice. Data on the carcinogenicity of styrene 7,8-oxide in experimental animals were evaluated as sufficient evidence in the same volume (IARC, 1994b). 3.1 Oral administration 3.1.1 Mouse Groups of 50 male and 50 female B6C3F1mice, six weeks of age, received daily administrations of 150 or 300 mg/kg bw styrene (purity, 99.7%) in corn oil by gavage onfive days per week, for 78 weeks, and the animals were killed after a further 13 weeks.Control groups of 20 male and 20 female mice received corn oil alone. The incidence ofbronchiolo-alveolar carcinomas in males was 0/20, 3/44 and 5/43, and 9/43 ( 0.024) for doses of 0, 150 and 300 mg/kg, respectively. There were no bronchiolo-alveolar carcinomas infemale mice. The of bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas in 0/20, 1/43and 3/43, respectively Institute, 1979a). [The Working Group noted thesmall number of control animals and that the incidence of both adenomas and carci-nomas combined was within the historical control ranges.] Groups of 50 male and 50 female B6C3F 1mice, six weeks of age, received a commercial mixture of -nitrostyrene ((2-nitroethenyl)benzene) (30% -nitrostyrene, 70% styrene) in corn oil; the styrene were 204 or 408 mg/kg bw, administeredby gavage, on three days per week, for 78 weeks. Animals were killed after a further 14weeks. Control groups of 20 male and 20 female mice received corn oil alone. Therewere no increases in the incidence of any tumours (National Cancer Institute, 1979b).[The Working Group noted that a mixture of styrene with -nitrostyrene was tested.]STYRENE 4753.1.2 Rat Groups of 50 male and 50 female Fischer 344 rats, six weeks of age, received daily doses of 1000 or 2000 mg/kg bw styrene (purity, 99.7%) in corn oil by gavage on fivedays per week, for 78 weeks; survivors were held until 105 weeks. Control groups of 20male and 20 female rats received corn oil alone. Due to increased treatment-relatedmortality in the 2000-mg/kg bw group, additional groups of males and females receiving0 and 500 mg/kg bw styrene per day in corn oil by gavage for 103 weeks were included.No treatment-related increase in the incidence of any type of tumour was observed(National Cancer Institute, 1979a). Groups of 50 male and 50 female Fischer 344 rats, six weeks of age, received commercial -nitrostyrene (30% -nitrostyrene, 70% styrene) in corn oil by gavage on three days per week, for 79 weeks, at styrene doses of 175 (females), 350 (males andfemales) and 750 (males) mg/kg bw; survivors were observed for an additional 29 weeks.No treatment-related increase in the incidence of any type of tumour was observed(National Cancer Institute, 1979b). Groups of 40 male and 40 female Sprague-Dawley rats, 13 weeks of age, were admi- nistered 0, 50 or 250 mg/kg bw styrene (99.8% pure) in olive oil by gavage on 4-5 daysper week for 52 weeks. Survivors were held until death. In males, there was no increasein tumour incidence. In females, there was a decreased incidence of malignant and mali-gnant plus benign mammary tumours at 250 mg/kg bw, which the authors attributed todecreased survival (Conti et al., 1988). [The Working Group noted the limited reporting of this study and the short duration of treatment.] Groups of 50 male and 70 female Charles River COBS (SD) BR rats, seven weeks of age, were administered 125 or 250 ppm (mg/L) styrene (> 98.9% pure) daily in thedrinking-water for two years. Groups of 76 male and 106 female rats received drinking-water alone. Dosing was limited by the solubility of styrene in water. Styrene intake wascalculated from the concentration, water consumption and body weight as being 7.7 and14 mg/kg bw per day in males and 12 and 21 mg/kg bw per day in females. No treatment-related increase in the incidence of any type of tumour was observed (Beliles et al., 1985). 3.2 Prenatal exposure followed by postnatal oral administration 3.2.1 Mouse A group of 29 pregnant O20 female mice, a strain very susceptible to the formation of lung tumours, was administered 1350 mg/kg bw styrene (99% pure) by gavage in oliveoil on day 17 of gestation. Pups (45 male, 39 female) were then given a high dose of1350 mg/kg bw styrene by gavage weekly following weaning. Treatment was terminatedafter 16 weekly doses due to toxicity and mortality. All mice were held until spontaneousdeath, euthanasia due to moribund condition, or until 120 weeks. Lung tumour incidencewas increased in both males (8/19 controls versus 20/23 treated ) and females (14/21IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 476controls versus 32/32 treated). No increase in tumours at other sites was observed (Ponomarkov & Tomatis, 1978). [The Working Group noted the high treatment-relatedtoxicity and mortality early in the study.] Using a similar study design, a group of 15 pregnant C57BL mice received 300 mg/kg bw styrene (99% pure) by gavage in olive oil on day 17 of gestation. Twenty-seven male and 27 female offspring received weekly gavage doses of 300 mg/kg bwstyrene from weaning for 120 weeks. There was no increase in the incidence oftreatment-related tumours (Ponomarkov & Tomatis, 1978). 3.2.2 Rat A group of 21 pregnant BD IV rats was given 1350 mg/kg bw styrene (99.8% pure) by gavage in corn oil on day 17 of gestation; 10 pregnant rats received corn oil only.Beginning at weaning, 73 male and 71 female offspring received 500 mg/kg bw styreneonce per week for 120 weeks; 36 male and 39 female control offspring received corn oilonce a week for 120 weeks. There was no increase in any tumour incidence in thestyrene-treated rats (Ponomarkov & Tomatis, 1978). 3.3 Inhalation exposure 3.3.1 Mouse Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice CD-1 mice, approximately four weeks of age, were exposed by whole-body inhalation to 0, 20, 40, 80 or 341 or682 mg/m 3] styrene vapour (> 99.5% pure) for 6 h per day, five days per week, for 104 (males) and 98 weeks (females). Due to mortality in control females (23/50 mice), thesurviving females were killed six weeks earlier than originally scheduled; all four treatedgroups had greater survival than the controls (32, 33, 34 and 35/50 for 20, 40, 80 and160 ppm dose groups, respectively). Other groups of 10 males and 10 females from eachexposure level were killed after 52 and 78 weeks. Male and female mice exposed to 80and 160 ppm had decreased body weights over the course of the study. Statistically signi-ficantly increased incidences of bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas were seen in malesexposed to 40, 80 or 160 ppm for 24 months (control, 15/50; 20 the incidences of bronchiolo-alveolar carcinomas were notincreased (4, 5, 3, 6 and 7/50 for 0, 20, 40, 80 and 160 ppm). In females, the incidencesof bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas in the groups exposed to 20, 40, and 160 ppm, but not80 ppm, for 22.5 months were statistically significantly increased (control, 6/50; 20 ppm,16/50 [ females, the incidences of bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma were 0, 0, 2, 0 and 7/50 ( p < 0.05) for 0, 20, 40, 80 and 160 ppm. The 14% incidence at 160 ppm was slightly higherthan the historical control range of 0-4% for the investigating laboratory (five oralstudies) and 0-13.5% for the breeder's database (nine oral studies). No increase in theSTYRENE 477incidence of lung tumours was seen in males or females at 12 or 18 months. The increase seen after 24 months was largely in small tumours, as demonstrated by a decreasedaverage tumour size compared with controls. The fact that increased tumour incidenceswas seen only later than 18 months and the small size of these tumours indicated thatthese were late-developing tumours. No difference in tumour morphology betweencontrol and treated mice was seen. Epithelial hyperplasia of the terminal bronchiolesextending into the alveolar duct was seen in a dose-related pattern at all interim andterminal necropsies. Hyperplasia was preceded by decreased eosinophilic staining ofClara cells and cellular crowding (Cruzan et al., 2001). 3.3.2 Rat Groups of 30 male and 30 female Sprague-Dawley rats, 12 weeks of age, were exposed by inhalation to 0, 25, 50, 100, 200 or 300 ppm [106, 213, 430, 850 or1280 mg/m 3] styrene (99.8% pure) for 4 h per day, five days per week, for 12 months (and then held until death). In females, malignant mammary or 300 exposure levels (Conti et al., 1988). [The Working Group noted the short duration of treatment, the incomplete reporting of the study and the highincidence of spontaneous mammary tumours in animals of this strain.] Groups of 60 male and 60 female Charles River CD rats, approximately four weeks of age, were exposed by whole-body inhalation to 0, 50, 200, 500 or 1000 850,2130 or 4260 mg/m 3] styrene (> 99.5% pure) for 6 h per day on five days per week for 104 weeks. Females exposed to 500 and 1000 ppm weighed less than controls throughoutthe study. However, there was a dose-related increase in survival; at termination, survivalwas 48, 47, 48, 67 and 82% in females exposed to 0, 50, 200, 500 and 1000 ppm,respectively. There were no increased incidences of tumours related to styrene exposure.A dose-dependent decrease in mammary tumours in females 0, 50, 200, 500 or 1000 ppm styrene, respectively,for two years. A decrease in benign mammary fibroadenomas (including those with epi-thelial atypia) levels, respectively (Cruzan et al., 1998). IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 4783.4 Intraperitoneal administration 3.4.1 Mouse In a screening assay based on multiplicity and incidence of lung tumours in a highly susceptible strain of mice (A/J), administration of 200 mol (~100 mg/kg bw) styrene by intraperitoneal injection three times per week for 20 doses, followed by observation for20 weeks, produced no increase in lung adenoma incidence in the styrene-treated micecompared with controls (Brunnemann et al., 1992). 3.4.2 Rat Groups of 40 male and 40 female Sprague-Dawley rats, 13 weeks of age, received four intraperitoneal injections of 50 mg styrene (99.8% pure) per animal in olive oil attwo-month intervals. Control groups received olive oil alone. The study was terminatedwhen the last rat died [duration unspecified]. There was no increase in tumour incidence(Conti et al., 1988). [The Working Group noted the incomplete reporting of data, the short duration of treatment and the low total dose.] 3.5 Subcutaneous administration Rat: Groups of 40 male and 40 female Sprague-Dawley rats, 13 weeks of age, received a single subcutaneous injection of 50 mg styrene (> 99% pure) per animal inolive oil. Control groups received olive oil alone. The study was terminated when the lastrat died [duration unspecified]. There was no increase in tumour incidence (Conti et al., 1988). [The Working Group noted the incomplete reporting of data and the single low-dose treatment.] 4. Other Data Relevant to an Evaluation of Carcinogenicity and its Mechanisms 4.1 Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion Studies on the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of styrene were evaluated in 1994 as part of a previous IARC monograph (IARC, 1994a), which may be consulted for moredetails on the earlier studies. 4.1.1 Humans (a)Absorption As noted previously (IARC, 1994a), the pulmonary retention of styrene is 60- 70% of the inhaled dose based on studies in both volunteers and workers (Stewart et al. ,STYRENE 4791968; Engstr\u00f6m et al ., 1978a,b; Ramsey L\u00f6f et al., 1986a,b). This has been confirmed by more recent studies (Johanson et al ., 2000; Wenker et al ., 2001a,b). Wrangskog et al. (1996) developed a simple one-compartment model for estimation of styrene uptake based on measurements of urinary excretion of mandelic and phenyl-glyoxylic acids. In human volunteers exposed by placing one hand in liquid styrene for 10-30 min, absorption was low, averaging 1 g/cm 2/min (Berode et al., 1985). Limasset et al. (1999) carried out a field study comparing urinary excretion of metabolites of styrene in fourgroups of workers who performed the same task but wore different protective equipment(see Section 1.4.1( d)), and concluded that percutaneous absorption of styrene was not an important contribution to the body burden. (b)Distribution Several studies have suggested that styrene accumulates in subcutaneous fat (Wolff et al., 1977; Engstr\u00f6m et al., 1978a,b). However, based on measurement of urinary meta- bolites, workers exposed to 37 ppm (160 mg/m3) styrene showed no accumulation during the working week (Pekari et al., 1993). As noted below, pharmacokinetic analysis of the disposition of styrene supports this conclusion. (c)Metabolism The metabolic pathways for styrene are shown in Figure 1. Styrene is primarily meta- bolized to styrene 7,8-oxide by cytochrome glycol and then to mandelic, phenylglyo-xylic and benzoic acids. Additional routes of metabolism include ring hydroxylation, butthis appears to be a minor pathway in humans. Pf\u00e4ffli et al . (1981) identified small amounts of 4-vinylphenol in the urine of workers exposed to styrene (less than 1% of theamount of mandelic acid excreted by these workers). Another pathway is conversion ofstyrene to 1- and 2-phenylethanol, which is further metabolized to phenylacetaldehyde,phenylacetic acid, phenylaceturic acid and hippuric acid. Styrene 7,8-oxide may also bemetabolized by conjugation with glutathione to form mercapturic acids. This appears tobe a minor pathway in humans, amounting to less than 1%. Ghittori et al . (1997) evaluated urinary excretion in 22 workers in a reinforced-plastics factory (seeSection 1.1.5( b)) and identified racemic N-acetyl- S-(2-phenyl-2- hydroxyethyl)cysteine. styrene uptake of 64%, the conversion to mercapturicacids was calculated to be between 0.021 and 0.325% of the dose. Korn et al . (1994) found a linear correlation between concentrations of styrene 7,8-oxide in the blood of workers exposed to styrene (10-73 ppm [43-310 mg/m 3]) and styrene in ambient air blood. At 20 ppm [85 mg/m3] styrene, the steady-state level of styrene From pathways by arrows. GSH, glutathioneFigure 1. Main metabolic pathways for styreneMany of urinary mandelic and phenyl- glyoxylic acids as biomarkers of exposure in workers (reviewed by Guillemin & Berode,1988) (see Section 1.1.5( b)). Stereochemical studies have been carried out on these meta- bolites. Korn et al. (1984) found the average ratio of L-mandelic acid to D-mandelic acid to be 1.62 in 11 male styrene-exposed workers and 1.44 in six female workers. In 20 malevolunteers exposed to styrene (360 mg/m 3) for 1 h while performing 50-W physical exercise, the average pulmonary retention was 62%, with mandelic acid and phenyl-glyoxylic acid accounting for 58% of the absorbed styrene. The maximum concentrationand area-under-the-curve for the free R-styrene glycol in blood were 1.3 and 1.7 times higher, respectively, than those of the S-styrene glycol. Cumulative excretion and renal clearance of conjugated styrene glycol were three and four times higher for S-styrene glycol than for R-styrene glycol, respectively (Wenker et al., 2001a). Studies in humans have attempted to assess interactions of chemicals that might alter styrene metabolism by comparing data on metabolite concentrations in urine of workersexposed to mixtures with historical information on workers exposed to styrene alone.Kawai et al. (1992) measured urinary metabolites of styrene in 34 male workers engaged in the production of plastic buttons and exposed to a mixture of styrene (mean concen-tration, 7 ppm [30 mg/m 3]), toluene and methanol. Styrene metabolism was similar to that reported previously in populations exposed to styrene alone (Ikeda et al. , 1982). This conclusion was supported by a subsequent study of 39 male workers co-exposed tomethanol and 12.4 ppm [53 mg/m 3] styrene (Kawai 1995). (1998) examined the urinary excretion of mandelic and phenylglyoxylic acids in 50 workersinvolved in the production of polyester buttons who were exposed to styrene (16-439 mg/m 3) and acetone (15-700 mg/m3). In groups with different levels of acetone co- exposure, the acetone had no effect on excretion of these metabolites. Similarly, De Rosaet al. (1993) monitored mandelic acid excretion in 22 workers exposed to styrene (22- 522 mg/m 3) and acetone (40-1581 mg/m3) and found no effect due to the co-exposure to acetone. Cern\u00fd et al . (1990) examined the metabolism of styrene (exposure concen- tration, 420 mg/m3) for 8 h with and without co-administration of ethanol (four doses of 14 g given at 2-h intervals) in five volunteers and found that this acute administrationdecreased the excretion of mandelic and phenylglyoxylic acids. To examine whetherexposure to styrene would increase styrene metabolism in subsequent exposures, Wanget al. (1996) used the data of Wigaeus et al. (1983) and L\u00f6f et al. (1986a) from a study in which two groups of subjects, one previously exposed to styrene and one not, wereexposed to 80 ppm [341 mg/m 3] styrene for 2 h, and estimated the metabolic rate constant based on a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model. No effect on styrenemetabolism was found, but the number of subjects in this study (six or seven per group)was limited. Johanson et al . (2000) exposed four volunteers for 2 h to 50 ppm [213 mg/m 3] [13C8]styrene vapour via a face mask while they performed light physical exercise. Two hours after exposure had ended, the concentration of styrene 7,8-oxide in blood reachedIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 482a maximum and averaged 6.7 nM. There was no evidence of glutathione conjugation or ring epoxidation. Individual differences in the metabolic response to styrene were studied in 20 male volunteers exposed on separate occasions to 104 and 360 mg/m3styrene for 1 h while performing 50-W exercise. Urinary mandelic and phenylglyoxylic acids were measuredto with enzyme-specific for CYP2E1, CYP1A2 and CYP2D6. No correlation was foundamong individuals between the blood clearance of styrene and the metabolic capacity.Based on the high apparent blood clearance of styrene (1.4 L/min), one explanationproposed by the authors is that styrene metabolism is limited by the blood flow to theliver, which has a similar value (Wenker et al. , 2001b). Symanski et al. (2001) examined inter- and intra-individual differences in urinary concentrations of mandelic and phenyl-glyoxylic acids based on 1714 measurements in 331 workers over the period 1985-99.Interindividual differences were greater for post-shift urine samples than for pre-shiftsamples. Hallier et al . (1995) measured R- and S-mandelic acids in the urine of 20 male workers exposed to 29-41 ppm styrene [124-175 mg/m 3]. The ratio of the R- to S-enan- tiomers of mandelic acid ranged from 0.7 to 2.2. This variation could not be explainedby differences in exposure levels and was attributed to interindividual differences instyrene metabolism, probably related to enzyme polymorphisms. The role of specific CYP isozymes in the metabolism of styrene has been examined. Nakajima et al. (1994a), using 12 different purified human isozymes, determined that CYP2B6 and CYP2E1 were the most active in human liver microsomes in formingstyrene glycol, and CYP2F1 was the most active in lung microsomes. Guengerich et al. (1991) also demonstrated the significance of CYP2E1 in styrene metabolism, usingdiethyldithiocarbamate as a specific inhibitor of CYP2E1 and correlations with chlorzo-xazone 6-hydroxylation \u2014 an indicator of CYP2E1 activity \u2014 in human liver micro-somes. Using antibodies against specific human CYP isozymes and by comparing ratesof styrene glycol formation by microsomes isolated from human livers, Kim et al. (1997) identified CYP2E1 and CYP2C8 as being the most important metabolic enzymes at lowstyrene concentration (0.085 mM), while CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 were most prominent ata high concentration of styrene (1.8 mM). Wenker et al. (2000) examined the stereospecificity and interindividual variation in microsomal epoxide hydrolase activity in 20 human liver samples. V max, Kmand Vmax/Km values for the substrates R- and S-styrene 7,8-oxides varied three- to five-fold between livers. The rate of hydrolysis of S-styrene 7,8-oxide was approximately five times slower than that of R-styrene 7,8-oxide, although the Kmwas six times higher for S-styrene 7,8-oxide. In a further report (Wenker et al., 2001c), an eightfold variation in Vmaxwas found for styrene metabolism by 20 human liver samples (0.39-3.2 nmol/mg protein/min), and, although CYP2E1 was found to be the most important cytochrome P450 iso-form, there was no correlation between the enzymic activity ( V maxor Km) and genetic polymorphisms of this enzyme.STYRENE 483Haufroid et al. (2001) examined possible influences of genetic polymorphisms in metabolic enzymes on the metabolism of styrene (average concentration, 18.2 ppm[77.5 mg/m 3]) in 30 workers from a glass fibre-reinforced plastics factory. The presence of the rare CYP2E1*1B allele was associated with increased excretion of urinary mandelic phenylglyoxylic acids Individualsdeficient in glutathione S-transferase (GST) M1 excreted less than one-half the amount of mercapturic acids, a minor pathway in humans, compared with GSTM1 - proficient individuals. De Palma et al. (2001) examined polymorphisms in GSTM1-1 and T1-1 and micro- somal mg/m 3, time-weighted average over 8 h). GSTM1-1 was identified as the primary isozyme for conjugation of glutathione with styrene 7,8-oxide. Workers GSTM1-1 excreted 5-6 times more phenylhydroxyethylmercapturic acids thandid individuals who GSTM1-1-deficient. No association was found between micro-somal epoxide hydrolase polymorphisms and excretion of the mercapturic acids. (d)Excretion Only small amounts of styrene (0.7-4.4%) are exhaled unchanged (see IARC, 1994a for details). This has been confirmed in more recent studies, in which 0.7-2.2% of theamount of inhaled styrene was found unchanged in the exhaled breath of four subjectsexposed to 50 ppm [213 mg/m 3] styrene for 2 h (Johanson et al. , 2000). Small amounts of styrene are also excreted unmetabolized in the urine (Pezzagno et al., 1985; Gobba et al. 1993). Ramsey et al. (1980) examined the pharmacokinetics of inhaled styrene (80 ppm [341 mg/m3]) in four human volunteers and calculated half-life values of 0.6 and 13.0 h for the two phases of elimination. Brugnone et al . (1993) measured styrene concentrations in blood of 76 exposed workers at the end of the work shift and the morning after, and reported a half-life of eli-mination of 3.9 h. 4.1.2 Experimental systems (a)Absorption McDougal et al. (1990) compared the dermal absorption of vapours from several organic chemicals in male Fischer 344 rats. The animals breathed fresh air through alatex mask. For styrene (3000 ppm [12 800 mg/m 3] for 4 h), a maximal concen- tration of about 10 g/mL and a permeability constant of 1.753 cm/h were reported. In a mixed exposure situation (inhalation and skin absorption), the skin uptake was estimatedto account for 9.4% of the total uptake in these rats. Morgan et al. (1991) examined the dermal absorption of styrene in Fischer 344 rats. When administered neat (2 mL ofstyrene in a sealed dermal cell), the peak blood level of styrene, reached after 1 h, was5.3 g/mL. Absorption decreased when the styrene was diluted with water. IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 484(b)Distribution An early study in which [14C]styrene labelled at the -carbon atom was administered subcutaneously to Wistar rats (0.10 mL of a 20% solution to 100-125-g rats [20 mg peranimal]) indicated that styrene was distributed rapidly (< 1 h) to tissues and thatexcretion of the radioactivity was primarily via the urine, with only a small fraction(2-3%) exhaled unchanged by the lung and approximately 12% appearing as 14CO2 during 24 h after dosing (Danishefsky & Willhite, 1954). Teramoto and Horiguchi (1979) 500 1000 ppm [2130 and 4260 mg/m3] styrene by inhalation for 4 h and found the highest concentration of styrene in adipose tissue. The biological half-life in this tissue was6.3 h, as opposed to 2.0-2.4 h in blood, liver, kidney, spleen, muscle and brain. No accu-mulation of styrene was found when rats were exposed to 700 ppm [2980 mg/m 3] for 4 h per day for five days. Withey and Collins (1979) exposed Wistar rats to styrene by inha-lation (50-2000 ppm [213-8520 mg/m 3] for 5 h) and found a proportionally increasing level of styrene uptake into blood. Tissue distribution was concentration-dependent, andthe concentration of styrene in the perirenal fat was higher than in any other tissue. Thisis probably a consequence of the high oil:blood partition coefficient of styrene (130; seeVan Rees, 1974). When [ 14C]styrene was administered orally to rats (20 mg/kg), the highest levels of radioactivity were found in the kidney followed by the liver andpancreas. Ninety per cent of the dose appeared in the urine within 24 h after dosing(Plotnick & Weigel, 1979). L\u00f6f et al. (1983, 1984) studied the effect of time and dose on styrene distribution and metabolism following intraperitoneal administration of styrene(1.1-4.9 mmol/kg bw) to NMRI mice. The highest concentrations of styrene weremeasured in adipose tissue, pancreas, liver and brain. Styrene 7,8-oxide concentrationswere highest in kidney and subcutaneous adipose tissue and lowest in lung. The highestconcentrations of styrene glycol were found in kidney, liver, blood and lungs. MaleWistar rats given styrene (100 mg/kg) by intubation excreted both R- and S-mandelic acids, with a preference towards excretion of the R-form (Drummond et al. , 1989). The uptake of styrene by the upper respiratory tract of the CD-1 mouse and Sprague- Dawley rat has been determined using a surgically isolated upper respiratory tract prepa-ration (Morris, 2000). In rats, steady-state uptake efficiency of styrene decreased withincreasing exposure concentration, with 24% and 10% efficiency at 5 and 200 ppm [21and 852 mg/m 3], respectively. In mice, the uptake efficiency \u2014 which did not maintain a steady state but declined during exposure \u2014 averaged between 42% and 10% at5-200 ppm. cytochrome P450, abolished theconcentration-dependence of the uptake efficiency in both species, providing evidencethat inhaled styrene is metabolized by nasal tissues and that this determines the concen-tration-dependence. STYRENE 485(c)Metabolism Watabe et al . (1978) clearly demonstrated the NADPH-dependent conversion of styrene to styrene 7,8-oxide in liver microsomes from male Wistar-King rats, with furtherconversion to styrene glycol by epoxide hydrolase. The role of glutathione conjugation in the metabolism of styrene was recognized by Seutter-Berlage et al. (1978), who characterized urinary mercapturic acids amounting to approximately 11% of an intraperitoneal dose of styrene (250 mg/kg bw) S-(phenacyl)cysteine, which ratio (Seutter-Berlage et al. , 1978; Delbressine et al., 1981). Watabe al. racemic styrene 7,8-oxide, and mmol/kg bw) to male Wistar rats and found the two major metabolites mentioned above. For the R-enantiomer, the rate of meta- bolism to mercapturic acid was 2.5 times higher than for the S-enantiomer. Nakatsu et al. (1983) similarly identified these metabolites in the urine of male Sprague-Dawley ratsafter intraperitoneal administration of styrene 7,8-oxide (100 mg/kg bw). Truchon et al. (1990) by inhalation (25-200 ppm[106-852 mg/m 3], 6 h per day, five days per week for four weeks) and found dose- dependent excretion of N-acetyl- S-(1-phenyl-2-hydroxyethyl)cysteine and N-acetyl- S-(2-phenyl-2-hydroxyethyl)cysteine in urine. Recent attention has focused on stereo- chemical aspects of the formation of these mercapturic acids. Coccini et al. (1996) exposed Sprague-Dawley rats subchronically to styrene (300 ppm [1280 mg/m3], 6 h per day, five days per week for two weeks). Urine was collected during the last 6 h ofexposure. Approximately 6.5% of the dose was recovered . dosed rats S- and racemic styrene 7,8-oxide (150 mg/kg bw) and found that the regioselectivity was similar for all three treatments, yielding a 2:1mixture of N-acetyl- S-(1-phenyl-2-hydroxyethyl)cysteine and N-acetyl- S-(2-phenyl- 2-hydroxyethyl)cysteine, acids was higherwith R-styrene 7,8-oxide (28% of the with (19%). In male B6C3F 1mice given an intraperitoneal injection 400 mg/kg 12.5% of the dose (Linhart et al., 2000). Several studies have focused on the influence of inducers and inhibitors of xenobiotic metabolism on the biotransformation of styrene. Treatment of female Wistar rats withsodium phenobarbital (37.5 mg/kg bw injected intraperitoneally, twice daily for fourdays) increased the metabolism of styrene (given by intraperitoneal injection of455 mg/kg bw on the fifth day), as determined by measurements of urinary metabolites(Ohtsuji & Ikeda, 1971). Sato and Nakajima (1985) found that treatment of male WistarIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 486rats with phenobarbital (oral dose of 80 mg/kg bw daily for three days) enhanced the hepatic microsomal metabolism of styrene approximately six-fold. Elovaara et al. (1991) compared the influence of acetone, phenobarbital and 3-methylcholanthrene on the uri-nary metabolites of male Han/Wistar rats exposed to styrene by inhalation (2100 mg/m 3 for 24 h) and found increases of 30-50% in the excretion of phenylglyoxylic acid andmandelic acid in the rats treated with acetone (1% in drinking-water for one week) butnot in the other groups. Co-administration by intraperitoneal injection of toluene(217 mg/kg bw) suppressed of (228 in Wistar rats(Ikeda et al ., 1972). Co-administration of ethanol (2 mM) decreased the uptake and metabolism of styrene (given as a 28.8- M solution) in a perfused rat liver system in fed animals and increased these parameters in fasted animals. This was associated withincreased levels of NADPH due to oxidation of ethanol (Sripaung et al., 1995). Salmona et al. (1976) compared formation of styrene 7,8-oxide and its further trans- formation to styrene glycol by epoxide hydrolase in microsomal preparations from diffe-rent tissues from CD rats and found mono-oxygenase and epoxide hydrolase activity inliver, lung and kidney, but not in heart, spleen and brain, with the highest activities inmale rat liver. When apparent hepatic V maxvalues for the metabolism of styrene to styrene 7,8- oxide by styrene mono-oxygenase were compared among species, the order was DunkinHartley guinea-pig > New Zealand rabbit > Swiss mouse > Sprague-Dawley rat(Belvedere et al., 1977). However, the order for the metabolism of styrene 7,8-oxide to styrene glycol by epoxide hydrolase was rat > maxratios for epoxide hydrolase vsstyrene mono-oxygenase were 3.9, 2.4, 1.6 and 1.4 for the rat, rabbit, guinea-pig and mouse, respectively. Watabe et al. (1981) reported that liver microsomal preparations from male Wistar rats preferentially exa- mined the stereoselectivity of styrene 7,8-oxide formation in the livers of male Sprague-Dawley rats and found an R- to S- ratio of 0.65. This ratio increased to 0.92 in pheno- barbital-treated rats. This R- to S-ratio contrasts with results indicating preferential formation of R-styrene 7,8-oxide in the liver of CD-1 mice (ratio R/S, 1.2-1.8) (Carlson, 1997a; Hynes et al., 1999) and in pulmonary microsomes from rabbits (ratio of 1.6) (Harris et al., 1986). Mendrala et al. (1993) compared the kinetics of styrene and styrene 7,8-oxide metabolism in rat, mouse and human livers in vitro . K mvalues for styrene epoxidation by mono-oxygenase were similar for the three species. The Vmaxvalues, however, varied from 13 nmol/min/mg protein for B6C3F1mice, 11 nmol/min/mg protein for Fischer 344 rats, 9.3 nmol/min/mg protein for Sprague-Dawley rats to 2.1 nmol/min/mg protein forhumans (average of five donors). V maxvalues for epoxide hydrolase were similar for all three species (14-15 nmol/min/mg protein). Nakajima et al. (1994a) compared the rates of styrene metabolism using microsomal preparations from different sources. At a low substrate concentration (0.085 mM), therates of hepatic metabolism protein/min), whereas at a high styrene concentration (1.85 mM), the rates were in the order of rat (4.21 nmol/mgprotein/min) to mouse (2.72 nmol/mg protein/min) to human (1.91 nmol/mg protein/min). Activity in pulmonary microsomes from 38 individuals was much lower (0.006-0.0125 nmol/mg protein/min) than in liver. Carlson et al. (2000) also observed low acti- vity for styrene metabolism in microsomal preparations from six human lungs. Styrene7,8-oxide formation was detectable in only one human sample (0.088 nmol/mg protein/min). [The Working Group noted that enzyme activity measurements based uponanalysis of whole organ homogenates do not reflect the substantial differences that existbetween cell types, as has been demonstrated by immunohistochemical methods forCYP2E1 and CYP2F2 in lung (Buckpitt et al., 1995; Green et al., 1997).] A few studies have described the formation of the ring-hydroxylated product 4-vinyl- phenol after exposure of rodents to styrene. Bakke and Scheline (1970) reported finding4-vinylphenol in amounts up to 0.1% of the dose in enzymatically hydrolysed urine ofmale (100 mg/kg bw). Similarly,Pantarotto et al. (1978) identified small amounts of 4-vinylphenol, 4-hydroxymandelic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-hydroxyhippuric acid in the urine of male Sprague-Dawley rats administered styrene intraperitoneally. More recently, when rats and micewere exposed by inhalation to [ ring-U- 14C]styrene, Boogaard et . (2000a) reported finding 14CO2, suggesting that ring hydroxylation may occur followed by ring opening. The fraction of the dose eliminated as 14CO2varied from 6.4-8.0% of the retained dose of styrene in mice to 2% of the retained dose in rats. Watabe et al. (1984) demonstrated the formation of 4-vinylphenol using 14C-labelled styrene and a rat hepatic microsomal preparation fortified with NADPH after addition of a large amount of unlabelled 4-vinyl-phenol as a trapping agent. They suggested that 4-vinylphenol was formed via the3,4-oxide but very rapidly metabolized to 4-hydroxystyrene-7,8-glycol. Carlson et al. (2001) were unable to confirm 4-vinylphenol formation when styrene was incubated withhepatic and pulmonary microsomal preparations from CD-1 mice and Sprague-Dawleyrats. However, considerable 4-vinylphenol-metabolizing activity, as determined by theloss of 4-vinylphenol, was observed in both mouse and rat liver and lung microsomalpreparations. This activity was three times higher in mouse liver microsomes than in ratliver microsomes and eight times higher in mouse lung microsomes than in rat lungmicrosomes, and it was completely absent in the absence of NADPH. Studies with cyto-chrome P450 inhibitors indicated the involvement of CYP2E1 and CYP2F2. Several studies have focused on the pharmacokinetics of styrene and some species comparisons. Ramsey and Young (1978) exposed Sprague-Dawley rats to styrene byinhalation at concentrations of 80, 200, 600 and 1200 ppm [341, 852, 2560 and5110 mg/m 3] for up to 24 h. The increase in styrene concentration in blood with increased exposure concentration was non-linear, indicating saturation of metabolism after about6 h of exposure. Filser et al. (1993) compared male Sprague-Dawley rats and B6C3F 1 mice exposed to styrene by inhalation in a closed chamber (550-5000 mg/kg bw). In both species, the rate of metabolism of the inhaled styrene was concentration-dependent. At exposure concentrations above 300 ppm[1280 mg/m 3], metabolism was progressively limited by metabolic capacity and was saturated at concentrations of approximately 700 ppm [2980 mg/m3] in rats and 800 ppm [3410 mg/m3] in mice. Little accumulation occurred at exposures below 300 ppm [1280 mg/m3] since uptake was rate-limiting. In rats and mice, intraperitoneal injection of styrene followed by analysis of exhaled styrene in the closed chamber resulted inconcentration-time curves in agreement with the applied pharmacokinetic model. Afteroral administration of styrene, the concentration-time curves showed considerable inter-animal variability. In a chronic inhalation study in Sprague-Dawley rats exposed (whole-body) to styrene vapour at 0, 50, 200, 500 or 1000 ppm [0, 213, 852, 2130 or 4260 mg/m 3] for 6 h per day, five days per week for 104 weeks, blood levels of styrene and styrene 7,8-oxidewere measured at the end of a 6-h exposure period during week 95. Styrene 7,8-oxide inblood was undetectable in males or females at 0 or 50 ppm. While the styrene 7,8-oxideconcentration in blood continued to increase with higher styrene exposure concentration,some saturation of metabolism was observed (Cruzan et al ., 1998). In CD-1 mice exposed to styrene vapour at 0, 20, 40, 80 or 160 ppm [0, 85, 170, 341 or 682 mg/m 3] for 98 weeks (females) or 104 weeks (males), blood levels of styrene and styrene7,8-oxide were measured at the end of a 6-h exposure period during week 74. Styrene7,8-oxide in blood was undetectable in males and females at 0 and 20 ppm. At higherexposure doses, concentration-dependent increases were observed for styrene andstyrene 7,8-oxide in blood, with no evidence for saturation of metabolism (Cruzan et al., 2001). Comparing the two studies, blood styrene concentrations in male and female ratsreached 2780 ng/mL and 1950 ng/mL at 200 ppm styrene exposure and blood styrene7,8-oxide concentrations reached 66 ng/mL and 28 ng/mL at this exposure level, respec-tively, whereas for mice the corresponding values at the highest dose (160 ppm) were1461 ng/mL and 20.1 ng/mL for styrene7,8-oxide in males and females, respectively. The effect of antibodies to CYP2C11/6, CYP2B1/2, CYP1A1/2 and CYP2E1 on the rates of styrene metabolism was studied in male Wistar rat lung and liver microsomalpreparations. All four antibodies decreased styrene metabolism in microsomes from ratliver, with anti-CYP2C11/6 having the strongest effect, but only anti-CYP2B1/2 affectedthe metabolism in lung microsomes. This indicates that the major CYP isoform respon-sible for metabolism of styrene is different in these two tissues (Nakajima et al., 1994b). Studies with human cytochromes P450 ectopically in cultured hepatoma G2cells indicate that CYP2B6 and CYP2F1 may also be involved in styrene metabolism(Nakajima et al., 1994a). The potential contributions of various cytochromes P450 to styrene metabolism have also been examined by use of chemical inhibitors of specificisozymes in hepatic and pulmonary microsomal preparations of male CD-1 mice.Diethyldithiocarbamate inhibited the formation of both enantiomers of styrene 7,8-oxidein lung and liver, supporting the importance of CYP2E1. 5-Phenyl-1-pentyne showed aSTYRENE 489high degree of inhibition in pulmonary microsomes, but caused only a small decrease in hepatic microsomes, indicating the importance in mouse lung of CYP2F2 (Carlson,1997a). -Naphthoflavone, an inhibitor of CYP1A, had little meta- bolism. -Methylbenzylaminobenzotriazole caused only a 16-19% inhibition of styrene 7,8-oxide formation at a concentration (1 M) that caused substantial (87%) inhibition of benzyloxyresorufin metabolism, indicating that CYP2B plays a minor role in styrenemetabolism (Carlson et al., 1998). Green et al. (2001a) examined the effects of 5-phenyl-1-pentyne (100 mg/kg bw) \u2014 an inhibitor of CYP2E1 and CYP2F2 \u2014 on the metabolism of styrene in vitro by pulmo- nary microsomes from male CD-1 mice isolated at various times up to 48 h after dosing.After six hours, styrene metabolism was reduced to 8% of control activity for theformation of the R-enantiomer of styrene 7,8-oxide and to 25% for the S-enantiomer. A single dose of 1 g/kg diethyldithiocarbamate inhibited the pulmonary microsomal meta-bolism of styrene to 16% of control activity for R- and 23% for S-styrene 7,8-oxide at 24 h after dosing. These studies further indicate the importance of the enzymes CYP2E1and CYP2F2 in the pulmonary metabolism of styrene. Green et al. (2001b) carried out additional studies on the metabolism of styrene by nasal epithelium of CD-1 mice andSprague-Dawley rats. The rates of formation of styrene 7,8-oxide were similar in micro-somal preparations of the olfactory epithelium of mice and rats, with values of 6.59 and7.46 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively, for the R-isomer and 2.24 and 2.51 nmol/min/ mg protein for the S-isomer. Activity was approximately 50% lower in the respiratory epithelium than in the olfactory epithelium. No styrene metabolism was detected in ninesamples of human nasal tissue (limit of detection: 0.04 nmol/min/mg protein). Bothchlorzoxazone and 5-phenyl-1-pentyne inhibited styrene metabolism, again indicatingthe importance of the enzymes CYP2E1 and CYP2F2. Recent studies have addressed the question of which pulmonary cell types are responsible for styrene metabolism and which cytochromes P450 are associated with thebioactivation of styrene. In enriched fractions of Clara cells and type II cells from maleCD-1 mice and male Sprague-Dawley rats, styrene metabolism was determined with andwithout chemical inhibitors. Mouse Clara cells readily metabolized styrene to styrene7,8-oxide, but type II pneumocytes had little or no activity. Styrene metabolism wasseveral-fold higher in mouse Clara cells than in rat Clara cells. R-Styrene 7,8-oxide was preferentially formed in mouse lung and Clara cells, and S-styrene 7,8-oxide was prefe- rentially formed in rat lung and Clara cells (Table 11) (Hynes et al., 1999). Studies with both microsomes and isolated cells indicated that CYP2E1 and CYP2F2 are the maincytochromes P450 involved in pulmonary styrene metabolism. Green et al. (2001b) similarly found that hepatic microsomal fractions R:S, 2.70). In and respiratory nasal cells, the rates of this bioactivation step were similar inboth species and were higher in the respiratory epithelium than in the olfactory 490CYP2E1 Subsequent metabolism of styrene 7,8-oxide by epoxide hydrolase and GST was much higher in rat nasal tissue than inmouse nasal tissue. (d)Excretion Sumner et al. (1997) compared the metabolism of [7-14C]styrene administered by inhalation (250 ppm [1060 mg/m3], 6 h per day for 1-5 days) to B6C3F1mice, CD-1 mice and Fischer 344 rats. Rats and CD-1 mice excreted the radioactivity faster than didB6C3F 1mice following a single exposure, but the rates were similar for the three groups after repeated exposures on 3 or 5 days. Boogaard et al. (2000a) studied the disposition of [ring-U-14C]styrene in Sprague-Dawley rats and CD-1 mice exposed by recirculating ppm [682 mg/m3] for 6 h). Urinary excretion was the primary route of elimination (amounting to 75% of the retained styrene for rats and 63% formice), and there was little quantitative difference between rats and mice except that miceexhaled 14CO2which amounted to 6.4-8.0% of the retained styrene, while for rats this was only 2%. Whole-body autoradiography showed significantly higher non-specificbinding of radioactivity in mouse lung and nasal passages compared with rat lung. 4.1.3 Pharmacokinetic modelling Ramsey and Young (1978) and Ramsey et al. (1980) analysed the pharmacokinetic profile of inhaled styrene in male rats [strain unspecified] and humans. In humanvolunteers exposed to 80 ppm [341 mg/m 3] for 6 h, styrene was cleared from the bloodSTYRENE 491 Table 11. Metabolism of styrene to styrene 7,8-oxide enan- tiomers by mouse and rat lung microsomes cell-enriched fraction R-enantiomer S-enantiomer R/S Lung microsomes Mouse n = 4) Rat ( n = 3)83.3 0.09 Data from Hynes et al. (1999) Values for R- and S-enantiomers are in nmol/mg protein/min for lung micro- somes and in pmol/106 cells/min (not corrected for cell type) for Clara cell fractions. The percentages of Clara cells in these fractions were 56% for mouse and 37% for rat. a Mean \u00b1 standard erroraccording to a two-compartment linear pharmacokinetic model that was similar to that for rats. The model predicted that there would be no accumulation of styrene at this expo-sure concentration and upon repeated administration. Ramsey and Andersen (1984)developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model, which indicated that therewas saturation of styrene metabolism at inhaled doses above 200 ppm [852 mg/m 3] in mice, rats and humans. At lower levels of exposure, the ratio of styrene concentration inblood to that in inhaled air is controlled by perfusion-limited metabolism. Another physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was based on data collected by Mandrala et al. (1993) to predict concentration-time curves for styrene and styrene 7,8-oxide in blood and tissues (Csan\u00e1dy et al., 1994). At low concentrations, styrene is rapidly removed from blood and the rate of metabolism is limited by the blood flowthrough the liver. Cohen et al. (2002) developed a pharmacokinetic model viewing the lung as two compartments, the alveolar tract and the capillary bed. This model included both pulmo-nary and hepatic metabolism and predicted tissue or organ concentrations of styrene andstyrene 7,8-oxide (both the S- and R-enantiomers, separately), under specified condi- tions. It was based on the Csan\u00e1dy et al. (1994) model, which only accounted for styrene metabolism by the liver. The authors indicated that the model has a substantial degree ofuncertainty, however, because of inconsistencies between studies in reporting styrene7,8-oxide levels in blood, which complicated the validation of the model. Filser et al. (2002) compared the modelled concentrations of styrene 7,8-oxide in the lungs of the mouse, rat and human over a range of styrene concentrations assuming 6- or8-h exposures. The highest concentrations of styrene 7,8-oxide were predicted for themouse followed by the rat, with humans having by far the lowest concentration. Thesedifferences reflected the species differences in the pulmonary metabolism of styrene tostyrene 7,8-oxide and subsequent detoxification of the oxide. The most comprehensive modelling for styrene metabolism and styrene 7,8-oxide dosimetry comparing rodents and humans was undertaken by Sarangapani et al. (2002). It expanded upon the Csan\u00e1dy et al. (1994) model by incorporating information on the metabolic production of styrene 7,8-oxide and its decrease in the respiratory tract andwas used to predict the concentrations of styrene and styrene 7,8-oxide in blood, liver andrespiratory tract. This model predicts a ten-fold lower styrene 7,8-oxide concentration inthe terminal bronchioles of rats than in mice exposed to identical concentrations ofstyrene. The model suggests that styrene 7,8-oxide concentrations in human bronchioleswould be 100-fold lower than for the mouse. Tornero-Velez and Rappaport (2001) modified the physiologically based pharmaco- kinetic model of Csan\u00e1dy et al. (1994) to compare the predicted contribution of styrene 7,8-oxide resulting from metabolism with that from direct exposure in the workplace.They tested their model against air and blood concentrations of styrene and styrene7,8-oxide in 252 workers in the reinforced plastics industry. Due to efficient detoxi-fication of the oxide formed in the liver, direct exposure via inhalation appeared to be amore important source of styrene 7,8-oxide than the bioactivation of inhaled styrene. TheIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 492model indicated that absorbed styrene 7,8-oxide contributed 3640 times more of this compound to the blood than an equivalent amount of inhaled and metabolized styrene. 4.2 Toxic effects 4.2.1 Humans Exposure to styrene has been reported to cause irritation of the eyes, throat and respi- ratory tract (Lorimer et al. , 1976, 1978). Subjective health complaints were not reported in the glass fibre-reinforced plastics industry with concentrations of styrene below105 mg/m 3(Geuskens et al. , 1992). There are a number of reports of central and peripheral nervous system effects in exposed workers. Some studies have reported decreased nerve conduction velocities inworkers exposed to styrene al. al. , 1991; tetk\u00e1rov\u00e1 et al ., 1993), whereas others have shown no changes at styrene concentrations below 100 ppm [430 1994; Bergamaschi et al., 1996, 1997), functional (Lindstr\u00f6m et al., 1976; Cherry et al. , 1980) and psychiatric anomalies (Flodin et al. , 1989; Edling et al., 1993) were observed in styrene-exposed workers compared with controls. Most of these effects were observed at concentrations of styrene of about 100 ppm [430 mg/m3], although memory and neurobehavioural disturbances were noted at styrene concen-trations ranging from 10 to 30 ppm [43-130 al., & Chen, 1996; Viaene et al., 2001). Thresholds for hearing were unchanged in workers exposed to styrene concen- trations less than 150 mg/m3. However, a comparison within the group of styrene- exposed workers (least exposed versus most exposed) showed a significant difference inhearing thresholds at high frequencies (Muijser et al., 1988). In a group of 18 workers exposed for 6-15 years to styrene at levels below 110 mg/m 3, seven workers showed disturbances in the central auditory pathways (M\u00f6ller et al. , 1990). Morioka et al. (1999) found a reduction in the upper limit of hearing in workers occupationally exposed toorganic solvents. This effect was dose-dependent and correlated with the concentrationof styrene in the breathing zone of the workers and with the amount of mandelic acid inurine. In a group of 299 workers in the glass fibre-reinforced plastics industry, there wasno evidence for an effect of exposure to styrene on hearing acuity when both noise andlifetime exposures to styrene were accounted for (Sass-Kortsak et al., 1995). Colour vision was found to be impaired in styrene-exposed workers in a number of studies (Gobba et al., 1991; Fallas et al., Chia et Gobba, 2000). Solvent-induced loss of colour vision is indicative of changes in neural functioning along optic pathways. ASTYRENE 493positive relationship was observed between styrene exposure and early colour vision dysfunction in several of these studies, with effects detected at exposure concentrationsas low as 20 ppm [85 mg/m 3]. In one study, a dose-response relationship between the concentration of mandelic acid in urine and colour vision loss was noted (Kishi et al., 2001). Triebig et al. (2001) showed that styrene-induced colour vision dysfunction is reversible when the person is in a styrene-free environment for four weeks. In a study of mortality among styrene-exposed workers, an increased number of deaths attributed to 'symptoms, senility and ill-defined conditions' was ascribed to a highlocal registration of these conditions in comparison with national statistics (Bond et al. , 1992). Welp et al . (1996a) followed a cohort of workers in the reinforced-plastics industry and found that mortality from diseases of the central nervous system, especiallyepilepsy, increased with exposure to styrene. Exposure was evaluated as duration(< 1->10 years), average concentration (60-120 ppm 213-> 2130 mg/m3-years]). The effects of styrene on the respiratory tract of workers exposed to concentrations above 100 mg/m3include chronic bronchitis (H\u00e4rk\u00f6nen, 1977). Haematological changes (in blood coagulation andfibrinolysis) have been observed (Chmielewski & Renke, 1976). Cases of styrene-induced asthma (Moscato et al. , 1987; Hayes et al. , 1991) and one case of contact derma- titis (Sj\u00f6borg et al. , 1984) have also been reported. Welp et al. (1996b) reported that mortality from pneumonia among more than 40 000 men and women in 660 Europeanfactories manufacturing reinforced plastics appeared to be associated with exposure tostyrene, but mortality from bronchitis, emphysema and asthma was not. In a more recentstudy, no relationship was observed between exposure to styrene and mortality from non-malignant respiratory diseases among 15 826 workers exposed to styrene (averagestyrene concentrations were below 10 ppm [43 mg/m 3], with of the 60 ppm [256 mg/m3]) in the reinforced-plastics and composites industry in the USA (Wong & Trent, 1999). Several studies have reported signs of liver damage, as measured by liver enzyme activities in serum, but it was concluded in a review that no clear trend towards alteredliver function had been demonstrated (WHO, 1983). Elevated serum bile acid concen-trations were observed in one study (Edling & Tagesson, 1984) but not in another(H\u00e4rk\u00f6nen et al. , 1984). More recently, two independent cross-sectional studies in 47 workers in the glass fibre-reinforced plastics industry and in 21 boat and tank fabricators, both with separatecontrol groups, were carried out by Brodkin et al . (2001). Exposure to styrene was assessed by measurements in blood and air samples. Workers were grouped as controls,low-exposure ( Direct bilirubin levels, a marker of altered hepatic clearance, increased with styreneexposure. Hepatic transaminase activities (alanine and aspartate transaminases)increased with styrene exposure when data from both studies were pooled. Altered kidney function in styrene-exposed workers was measured by increased urinary excretion of albumin (Askergren et al. , al. (1989) studiedIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 494female workers in the glass fibre-reinforced plastics industry who were exposed to styrene at 225 mg/m3for a mean duration of 11 years. No difference was found in the excretion of a number of urinary markers (including albumin) of renal injury comparedwith control female workers. Another study showed no difference in urinary markers forrenal toxicity in workers exposed to styrene at 215 mg/m 3for 1-13 years (mean, six years) compared with an unexposed control group (Viau et al., 1987). In ten workers exposed to styrene (8-h time-weighted average exposure estimated to be 21-405 mg/m3) and 15 non-exposed workers, only a weak correlation was noted between styrene expo-sure concentration and alterations in urinary markers for renal toxicity (Verplanke &Herber, 1998). Early studies on the effects of styrene on the haematopoietic and immune system did not consistently reveal changes (WHO, 1983). Thiess and Friedheim (1978) found nodifference in haemoglobin, erythrocyte and leukocyte concentrations in 84 workers instyrene production, polymerization processing exposed to styrene(50-500 ppm [213-2130 mg/m 3] for 1-36 years) compared with a reference group. In a study of 163 workers in a styrene-butadiene synthetic rubber manufacturing plant, therewas no pronounced evidence of haematological abnormality, as determined frommeasurements taken in peripheral blood, from exposure to styrene (< 15 ppm[64 mg/m 3]) (Checkoway & Williams, 1982). In a group of workers exposed to 56 mg/m3styrene in the reinforced-plastics industry, a 30% increase in the number of peripheral blood monocytes was noted (Hagmar et (1-100 mg/m3] years) workers in the reinforced-plastics industry, an exposure-related decrease was detected in the mean corpuscular haemoglobin andneutrophil concentrations compared with the values in 104 controls (Stengel et al ., 1990). Mean corpuscular volume and monocytes increased with exposure to styrene. Nochanges were found in haemoglobin, red blood cell, white blood cell, lymphocyte orplatelet concentrations in the styrene-exposed workers compared with the unexposedgroup. In another group of 32 workers exposed to styrene, changes in lymphocyte sub-populations were observed mainly at exposure levels above 50 ppm (Mutti et al. , 1992). Bergamaschi et al. (1995) reported a reduction in total T lymphocytes (CD3 +) and T helper lymphocytes (CD4+) and an increase in natural killer workers (10-50 ppm [43-213 mg/m3], 8-h time-weighted average). An association was observed between styrene exposure of hand-lamination workers (mean blood styrenelevels of 946 g/L) and alterations of cell-mediated immune response of T lymphocytes, with an imbalance of leukocyte subsets (increased number of monocytes and decreasednumber of lymphocytes) in the peripheral blood (Tulinska et al., 2000). 4.2.2 Experimental systems Single exposures of rats and guinea-pigs [strain not stated] to 1300 ppm [5630 mg/m3] styrene resulted in central nervous system effects, including weakness and unsteadiness. After exposure to 2500 ppm [10.8 g/m3] styrene for 10 h, both rats consciousness; exposure to 5000-10 000 ppm resulted in unconsciousness and death. The principal pathological findings in these animals weresevere pulmonary irritation, congestion, oedema, haemorrhage and leukocytic infiltration(Spencer et al., 1942). Early studies on the neurotoxicity of styrene gave equivocal results (WHO, 1983), but a decrease in the activity of monoamine oxidase in brain was seen in male rats afterrepeated oral doses of styrene (1.2 g/kg bw per day for seven days) (Zaprianov &Bainova, 1979). In subsequent studies, exposure of male rabbits to styrene vapour (0, 750or 1500 ppm [0, 3200 or 6400 mg/m 3] for 12 h per day during three or seven days) caused a dose-dependent decrease in striatal and tuberoinfundibular dopamine content and anincrease in homovanillic acid content, consistent with disturbance of the dopaminergicfunctions of the brain (Mutti et al. , 1984b). The levels of norepinephrine were unchanged. The styrene metabolites phenylglyoxylic acid and mandelic acid were shownto deplete dopamine through a direct chemical reaction, thereby rendering it inactive asa neurotransmitter (Mutti et al. , 1988). Chakrabarti (2000) administered styrene at 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg bw by gavage to male Sprague-Dawley rats on seven days per week for13 weeks; there was a decrease in dopamine and its metabolites in the corpus striatum,hypothalamus and the lateral olfactory tract regions in the high-dose group. A loss ofmotor function that accompanied these changes lasted for approximately a month afterthe last dose. Styrene (300 ppm [1280 mg/m 3], 6 h per day, five days per week for 12 weeks) also caused cell loss and dopamine depletion in retinas isolated from femaleSprague-Dawley rats (Vettori et al., 2000). An increase in the concentration of glial fibrillary acidic protein was measured in the sensory motor cortex and in the hippocampus of Sprague-Dawley rats that had beencontinuously exposed to 320 ppm [1390 mg/m 3] styrene for three months and then kept free from exposure for another four months. This effect was taken to be an indication ofsolvent-induced brain damage (Rosengren & Haglid, 1989). Mild neurobehaviouraldisturbances were seen in rats exposed to 1400 ppm [6070 mg/m 3] styrene for 16 h per day, five days per week for 18 weeks followed by a six-week exposure-free period(Kulig, 1989) and in mice exposed to 425 ppm [1840 mg/m 3] styrene for 4 h per day, five days per week for two weeks (Teramoto et al. , 1988). In dissociated primary cultures of murine spinal cord-dorsal root ganglia-skeletal muscle, cytotoxic to neuronal and non-neuronal cellsat concentrations in excess of 2 and 0.2 mM, respectively (Kohn et al. , 1995). Styrene is ototoxic in rats (Pryor et al., 1987; Yano et al., 1992; Crofton et al., 1994). Exposure of male Long-Evans rats to 850 ppm and 1000 ppm [3620 and 4260 mg/m 3] styrene for 6 h per day, five days per week for four weeks, caused permanent hearing lossat mid-frequency ranges (16 kHz). At higher exposure concentrations, the increase in theauditory threshold became frequency-independent and was observed in the mid-low,mid- and high-frequency ranges (Loquet et al., 1999). Styrene suppressed the activity of mouse splenic T lymphocyte killer cells in vitro (Grayson & Gill, 1986). When Wistar rats were exposed to styrene (210 mg/m 3)IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 496continuously for seven days, -aminolaevulinate dehydratase activity was inhibited in erythrocytes and bone marrow (Fujita et al. , 1987). Male Swiss mice dosed orally with 20-50 mg/kg bw styrene daily for five days showed impairment of humoral and cell-mediated immunity (Dogra et al. , 1989); a similar dose regimen given for four weeks decreased the resistance of mice to viral, malarial and hookworm infections (Dograet al. , 1992). Male Sprague-Dawley rats given styrene by intraperitoneal injection (400 mg/kg bw per day for three days) or exposed by inhalation (300 ppm [1280 mg/m 3], 6 h per day, five days per week for two weeks) showed an increased number of erythro-poietic cells. The granulocytopoietic series was not affected by injected styrene but wasdepressed following longer-term inhalation exposure (Nano et al., 2000). Ohashi et al. (1985) investigated the respiratory toxicity of styrene in rats. Epithelial changes were observed in the nose and trachea of rats exposed to 800 ppm [3410 mg/m 3] styrene for 4 h per day during eight weeks followed by a three-week period withoutexposure. The changes included vacuolation of epithelial cells, nuclear pyknosis andexfoliation of epithelial cells. Mild changes in the nasal at exposurelevels of 30 ppm [130 mg/m 3]. Morphological damage was more severe in the upper than in the lower respiratory tract. In Swiss-Albino mice, intraperitoneal injections of a high dose of styrene (800 mg/kg bw) or its metabolite bronchoalveolar These enzymes are biomarkers of pulmonary toxicity (Gadberry et al ., 1996). Treatment of male Sprague-Dawley rats with styrene either by intraperitonealinjection (40 or 400 mg/kg bw, daily for three days) or by inhalation exposure (300 ppm[1280 mg/m 3], 6 h per day, five days per week for two weeks) showed the same pattern of cytoplasmic changes involving bronchiolar and alveolar type II cells as observed inmice (Coccini et al ., 1997). Damage in the lung was accompanied by glutathione depletion. Damage was more severe following intraperitoneal injection compared withinhalation exposure. Male CD-1 mice were exposed to styrene at 0, 40 and 160 ppm [170and 682 mg/m 3], and and 500 ppm [2130 mg/m3] for 6 h per day for up to 10 days (Green et al. , 2001a). In mice, styrene exposure caused pulmo- nary toxicity characterized by focal loss of cytoplasm and focal crowding of non-ciliatedClara cells, particularly in the terminal bronchiolar region. The toxicity was accom-panied by an increase in cell replication rates in terminal and large bronchioles of miceexposed for three days or longer. Morphological and cell-proliferative effects were notobserved in the alveolar region of the mouse lung or in the lungs of rats exposed to500 ppm styrene. 5-Phenyl-1-pentyne, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450-mediated meta-bolism, was given to a group of mice before styrene exposure. Cell replication rates inthe lungs of these mice were similar to those in control mice, suggesting that the pulmo-nary effects are due to a styrene metabolite. Khanna et al. (1994) examined pancreatic damage following oral administration of styrene to mice (25 or 50 mg/kg bw) and rats or guinea-pigs (160 or 320 mg/kg bw) onfive days per week for four weeks. In all three species, styrene caused congestion ofSTYRENE 497pancreatic lobules, inflammatory reactions around pancreatic islets (in mice only), and altered serum insulin levels but no change in blood glucose levels. Early studies reported morphological changes in the kidney of Sprague-Dawley rats after intraperitoneal injections of styrene (2.9 and 5.8 mmol/kg bw on five days per weekfor six weeks) (Chakrabarti et al. , 1987) and in the respiratory mucosa of SD rats exposed to styrene by inhalation (150 or 1000 ppm [639-4260 mg/m 3], 4 h per day, five days per week, three weeks) (Ohashi et al. , 1986). Effects in kidney and lung are associated with depletion of glutathione (Chakrabarti & Tuchweber, 1987; Elovaara et al. , 1990) and possibly with direct toxicity of glutathione conjugates to the kidney, as was shown inexperiments with a synthetic glutathione-styrene conjugate (Chakrabarti & Malick,1991). Viau given intraperitoneal injec- tions of styrene (1 g/kg bw, which is one-fifth the oral LD 50) daily for 10 days showed only mild tubular damage. In female Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to styrene (300 ppm[1280 mg/m 3], 6 h per day, five days per week, for 12 weeks), a small increase was observed in the urinary excretion of plasma proteins, with minor changes in kidney of interstitial fibrosis, cystic dilatations and hyaline tubules al., 1999). Early studies reported that styrene caused hepatotoxicity in rats concomitantly with a depletion of glutathione, which may be either a direct effect of styrene or mediated bylipid peroxidation (Srivastava et al. , albino rats [strain not stated] were dosed orally with 200 or 400 mg/kg bw styrene on six days per week for100 days (Srivastava et al., 1982). Liver changes were observed only after the high dose and were characterized by tiny areas of focal necrosis composed of a small number ofdegenerated hepatocytes and inflammatory cells. Exposure of B6C3F 1mice to 0, 125, 250 or 500 ppm [0, 530, 1060 or 2130 mg/m3] styrene for 6 h per day for 14 days caused severe centrilobular hepatic necrosis and deathafter one 6-h exposure to 500 ppm or two 6-h exposures to 250 ppm styrene (Morganet al., 1993a). Mortality was higher in male than in female mice and, after 14 days of exposure, the incidence and severity of liver lesions were also greater in male mice. In asubsequent study, the greater sensitivity of male mice to styrene exposure compared withfemales could not be explained by differences in glutathione depletion or styrene orstyrene 7,8-oxide concentrations in blood (Morgan et al., 1993b). Further investigation of the role of metabolism in the toxicity of styrene in mice revealed that styrene andstyrene 7,8-oxide concentrations in blood did not correlate well with strain differences insensitivity (Morgan et al., 1993c). Mortality and hepatotoxicity induced by exposure to styrene were greater in B6C3F 1and C57BL/6 mice than in Swiss mice, while DBA/2 mice were the least sensitive. Styrene and styrene 7,8-oxide concentrations in blood aswell as glutathione depletion were similar in B6C3F 1and DBA/2 mice but greater than those in Swiss mice. Although strain and gender differences in sensitivity to styrene toxi-city have been suggested to be due to differences in metabolism, styrene 7,8-oxideconcentrations in blood did not correlate with toxicity in these studies. Morgan et al. (1995) further investigated strain and gender differences in styrene toxicity at inhalationIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 498exposure concentrations below the saturation of metabolism (150 and 200 ppm [639 and 852 mg/m3] styrene, 6 h per day, five days per week, for two weeks). Female B6C3F1 mice were more susceptible than male B6C3F1 and male or female Swiss mice to the hepatotoxic effects of styrene. This was suggested to be due to the fact that styrenecaused greater depletion of glutathione in female B6C3F 1mice, which also had a lower capacity to regenerate glutathione. Morgan et al. (1997) showed that hepatotoxicity in male B6C3F1mice that had been treated with phenobarbital before a 6-h exposure to 500 ppm [2130 mg/m3] styrene was more severe than in control mice treated with styrene alone. In male ddY mice pretreated with buthionine sulfoximine, a glutathionedepletor, oral administration styrene 7,8-oxide(3.84 mmol/kg) caused alanine transaminase (Mizutani et al., 1994). Cruzan et al. (1997) carried out several subchronic inhalation studies with styrene in Sprague-Dawley rats and CD-1 1mice. In rats exposed to 200-1500 ppm [852-6390 mg/m3] styrene (6 h per day, five days per week) for 13 weeks, styrene caused treatment-related lesions in the olfactory epithelium doses500 hyper- plasia of basal cells, single-cell necrosis and apparent cell loss. No increase in cell proli-feration was observed in liver or lung following exposure to styrene for 2, 5 or 13 weeks.When CD-1 and B6C3F 1mice were exposed to styrene at concentrations ranging from 15 to 500 ppm [64-2130 mg/m3] (6 h per day, five days per week) for two weeks, expo- sure to 250 or 500 ppm [1060 or 2130 mg/m3] caused mortality in both strains, together with hepatotoxic effects, which could be characterized microscopically as centrilobularhepatocyte necrosis. Mortality and liver changes were more severe in female mice at250 ppm than at 500 ppm styrene. In a 13-week inhalation study, CD-1 mice wereexposed to styrene (6 h per day, five days per week), with concentrations ranging from50 to 200 ppm [213-852 mg/m 3]. Liver toxicity was evident, with females generally more severely affected than males. Atrophy of the olfactory epithelium and olfactorynerve fibres occurred with or without focal respiratory metaplasia. In the lungs of amajority of exposed mice in all dose groups, decreased eosinophilia of the bronchial epi-thelium occurred. Cell proliferation studies revealed a highly variable labelling index indifferent cell types and between animals. There was a statistically significant increase inproliferation of the Clara cells of mice after two weeks of exposure to 150 and 200 ppm[639 and 852 mg/m 3] styrene. These studies showed that mice are more sensitive to the toxic effects of styrene than rats. When Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to styrene(50-1000 ppm [213-4260 mg/m 3], 6 h per day, five days per week for 104 weeks), no changes in haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis or organ weights were observed(Cruzan et al., 1998). However, the incidence of lesions of the olfactory epithelium of the nasal mucosa increased with increasing exposure concentration. Male non-Swiss Albino mice were given single intraperitoneal injections of styrene (250, 500 or 1000 mg/kg bw), racemic styrene 7,8-oxide (100, 200, 300 R- or S-styrene 7,8-oxide (300 mg/kg bw) and killed 24 h later (Gadberry et al., 499Styrene caused a dose-dependent increase sorbitol dehydrogenase activity, an indicator of with pyridine and -naphtho- flavone, inducers of CYP enzymes, increased the toxicity of styrene, but pretreatmentwith phenobarbital had no such effect. Trichloropropene oxide, an inhibitor of epoxidehydrolase, increased the 7,8-oxide, while buthionine sulfoxi-mine, a glutathione depletor, did not. When given at the same dose (300 mg/kg bw), theracemic mixture of styrene 7,8-oxides and R-styrene 7,8-oxide a greater hepato- toxic effect than did S-styrene 7,8-oxide. However, differences in pulmonary toxicity between the enantiomers were not statistically significant. In a subsequent study to assessthe susceptibility of mouse strains to the effects of styrene and styrene 7,8-oxide, malemice (A/J, C57BL/6 or CD-1) were given an intraperitoneal injection of 800 mg/kg bwstyrene and killed 24 h later (Carlson, 1997b). Biomarkers of hepatotoxicity andpneumotoxicity were evaluated as in the study mentioned above (Gadberry et al., 1996). CD-1 mice were not as sensitive as the other strains to the hepatotoxic or pneumotoxiceffects of styrene, but were equally sensitive to the toxic effects of styrene 7,8-oxidegiven by intraperitoneal injection at 300 mg/kg bw. Hepatotoxicity and cell proliferation induced in male B6C3F 1mice by a single 6-h exposure to 500 ppm [2130 mg/m3] styrene was compared with that caused by repeated exposures to 500 ppm styrene for 6 h per day for up to 14 days (Mahler et al., 1999). Single or repeated inhalation exposure of mice to styrene caused severe necrosis ofcentrilobular hepatocytes followed by regeneration of necrotic zones. Re-exposure tostyrene of mice that had received only a single dose of styrene resulted in hepatocellularnecrosis, indicating that regenerated centrilobular cells were again susceptible to thecytolethal effect of styrene following a 14-day recovery. In contrast, continuous styreneexposure induced hepatocellular resistance to the cytolethal effect of styrene. Newhepatocytes were produced with reduced metabolic activity. Centrilobular hepatocyteswere resistant to styrene while they were actively synthesizing DNA and continuedstyrene exposure was required for sustained DNA synthesis. 4.3 Reproductive and developmental effects Reproductive and developmental effects of styrene have been reviewed by IARC (1994a) and very extensively by Brown et al. (2000). The present evaluation is mainly based on these reviews and recent studies not included therein. 4.3.1 Humans Early human studies suggested an association between occupational exposure to styrene and congenital central nervous system malformation (Holmberg, 1977, 1979),but subsequent, more extensive studies by the same and other investigators did notconfirm the association (Brown et al., 2000). IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 500The frequency of spontaneous abortions among women with definite or assumed occupational exposure to styrene has been investigated. An early study suggested anassociation between exposure to styrene and spontaneous abortions (Hemminki et al. , 1980), but several later investigations, by the same group and others, of greaterpopulation size failed to confirm the association (see, e.g., Lindbohm et al. , 1985). It is possible to conclude that styrene is not associated with a major increase in the occurrenceof spontaneous abortions, but because of the relatively small study population sizes in allof the investigations, the possibility of a small increase in risk cannot be excluded(Brown et al., 2000). There are only few studies on potential effects of exposure to styrene on birth weight. One study suggested that exposure to multiple solvents, including exposure to styrenelevels above 80 ppm [340 mg/m 3], may be associated with around 4% reduced birth weight; however, the difference was not statistically significant (Lemasters et al. , 1989; Brown et al., 2000). Data regarding the effects of styrene on the menstrual cycle are conflicting. Abnormalities in pituitary secretion in women exposed to styrene have been suggestedand may be connected with putative effects on the menstrual cycle (Brown et al., 2000). In a recent study, exposure to aromatic solvents including styrene was associated with atrend towards increased frequency of oligomenorrhoea (average menstrual cycle length,> 35 days). Individually, exposure to styrene showed the greatest increase in odds ratioamong the solvents (1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.6) and this increase was statistically significant(Cho et al., 2001). One study (Jelnes, 1988) suggested an increase in sperm abnormalities in workers exposed to high levels of styrene in the reinforced-plastics industry, but the data are weakand no firm conclusions can be drawn (Brown et al., 2000). In a later study, semen samples were collected from 23 workers during the first week of employment in thereinforced-plastics industry and after six months of exposure to styrene and from 21 non-exposed farmers. A significant decline in sperm density was seen during exposure tostyrene, whereas no decline was seen in the non-exposed men. No indication of an expo-sure-response relationship was seen when individual changes in semen quality withinthe group of reinforced-plastics workers were related to post-shift urinary mandelic acidconcentrations, controlled for change in potential time-dependent confounders.However, the exposure gradient in the group was modest. The earlier finding of anincrease in sperm abnormalities was not corroborated by this study (Kolstad et al., 1999). Among 1560 male workers in the reinforced-plastics industry in Denmark, Italy and The Netherlands, 220 styrene-exposed workers and 382 unexposed referents who hadfathered a child were identified. The relationship between occupational exposure tostyrene of these men and time-to-pregnancy of their partners was investigated. Noconsistent pattern of reduced male fecundity was found when the time to pregnancy wasrelated to work tasks that involved higher levels of exposure to styrene or for whichsemiquantitative or quantitative measures of exposure to styrene were available. Theworkers with high exposure levels showed a fecundity ratio of 1.1 (95% CI, 0.69-1.7).STYRENE 501On the basis of these results, the authors concluded that it is unlikely that exposure to styrene has a strong effect on male fecundity (Kolstad et al., 2000). 4.3.2 Experimental systems (a)Developmental toxicity studies Styrene has been shown to cross the placenta in rats and mice. In rats, fetal styrene concentrations of around 50% of the levels in maternal blood have been found (Withey& Karpinski, 1985; IARC, 1994a). The potential developmental toxicity of styrene has been tested in several experi- mental animals including rats, mice, rabbits and hamsters. Throughout the studies, therewas no evidence for an increased incidence of malformations. There have been reportsof increases in embryonic, fetal and neonatal death, and possibly skeletal and kidneyabnormalities at inhalation exposure levels of around 250 ppm [1060 mg/m 3] and higher during pregnancy. These dose levels also caused some effects on the dams such asdecreased maternal weight gain (IARC, 1994a; Brown et al. , 2000). Decreased pup weight, postnatal developmental delays as well as neurobehavioural and neurochemical abnormalities have been reported in rats exposed by inhalation tostyrene prenatally and/or postnatally (Brown et al. , 2000). In a recent study, rats (JCL: Wistar) were exposed to 0, 50 or 300 ppm [213 or 1280 mg/m 3] styrene for 6 h per day during gestation days 6-20 and the offspring were investigated postnatally for neuro-chemical changes, growth and physical landmarks of development. In order to adjust fornutrient conditions, pair-fed and ad-libitum controls were included. No significant diffe-rence in maternal weight gain was observed compared with either control group, but foodconsumption was decreased at the 300-ppm exposure level. An increased neonatal deathrate was found at 300 ppm styrene compared with the pair-fed control group. Litter sizeand birth weight were not affected, while postnatal development (incisor eruption, eyeopening) was delayed at 300 ppm compared with both control groups. In addition, neuro-chemical alterations indicated by decreased 5-hydroxytryptamine turnover were detectedat postnatal day 21 in offspring exposed in utero to 300 ppm compared with both control groups (Katakura et al. , 2001). The findings in this study can be attributed to exposure to styrene rather than to insufficient nutrition due to the use of a pair-fed control groupand thus the results support previous findings indicating that postnatal development andthe developing brain can be affected by exposure to styrene. In mice exposed to 100 ppm [426 mg/m 3] styrene continuously for 24 h during days 0-15 of gestation, lower fetal and placental weight as well as reduced maternal bodyweight gain were found (Ninomiya et al. , 2000). (b)Reproductive toxicity studies No effects on fertility were found in male and female rats exposed continuously for three generations to 125 or 250 ppm [532 or 1060 mg/m3] styrene in the drinking-water (Beliles et al. , 1985). Water consumption was significantly reduced in both treatmentIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 502groups. Only minor general toxic effects (slightly reduced body weight in females) were observed. [The Working Group noted that the negative results obtained in this study donot provide adequate assurance of an absence of potential to impair fertility afterexposure to styrene at higher dose levels and by other routes.] No effects on sperm head morphology or sperm development were found in male mice exposed to 300 ppm [1280 mg/m 3] styrene (6 h per day, five days per week, for five weeks) (Salomaa et al. , 1985). General studies of the chronic and subchronic toxicity of styrene in several species have not shown testicular pathology at inhalation concen-trations of up to 160 mice and 1000 ppm [4260 or higher in other species (rat, rabbit, guinea-pig, rhesus monkey) (Brown et al. , 2000). One study in rats found evidence of testicular toxicity (decreased sperm count and some changes intesticular pathology) at oral styrene doses of 400 mg/kg bw per day for 60 days(Srivastava et al. , 1989). Srivastava et al. (1992) showed similar decreases in sperm count and testicular enzymes in postnatally maturing rats after treatment with styrene(200 mg/kg bw but not 100 mg/kg bw per day) by gavage for the first 60 days of life. In peripubertal male C57BL/6 mice, free testosterone concentrations in plasma were strongly reduced after four weeks of exposure to styrene in the drinking-water (50 mg/L;this resulted in a daily intake of styrene of approximately 12 mg/kg bw). There were noeffects on body weight, testis weight plasma corticosterone and luteinizing hormonelevels (Takao et al. , 2000). There are only limited data on potential effects of styrene on estrous cyclicity. One study reported increased estrus cycle length and decreased body weight in rats exposedto 11.6 ppm [49 mg/m 3] styrene (Iziumova, 1972). However, the reporting of this study is confusing, the duration of estrus was poorly defined, and it is not clear if a comparable(sham) control group was used. In addition, it seems unlikely based on other studies ofstyrene that such a low exposure level would cause effects on body weight (seecomments in Brown et al. , 2000). The potential developmental toxicity of styrene and styrene 7,8-oxide was investi- gated in two in-vitro culture systems: micromass cell cultures of rat embryo midbrain orlimb-bud cells and whole-embryo culture. Effects of styrene 7,8-oxide on markers ofdifferentiation of limb-bud cells were evident at concentrations that had minimal effecton cell viability. Styrene alone or in the presence of an exogenous mono-oxygenasesystem had minimal effects even when tested at much higher concentrations than styrene7,8-oxide. In whole-embryo culture, styrene 7,8-oxide caused growth retardation andmalformations at somewhat lower levels than those producing embryo mortality(Gregotti et al. , 1994). In another study using postimplantation rat embryos in vitro, styrene 7,8-oxide was embryotoxic at concentrations more than 20 times lower thanstyrene (Brown-Woodman et al. , 1994).STYRENE 5034.4 Genetic and related effects 4.4.1 Styrene (a)Humans The genetic toxicology of styrene in humans was previously evaluated (IARC, 1994a). In styrene-exposed workers, levels of O6-guanine adducts in lymphocyte DNA are up to five times higher than those in non-exposed controls. Variable results have beenreported with regard to the association between exposure to styrene and chromosomaldamage. Increased frequencies of chromosomal aberrations in vivo were not reported in most studies and only weak evidence was reported for induction of sister chromatidexchange. In-vitro studies consistently reported increased frequencies of chromosomalaberrations and sister chromatid exchange in human lymphocytes. Styrene did not inducemutations in bacteria, except in some studies that used exogenous metabolic activation.Most of the data published since the previous evaluation focus on the occurrence of DNAadducts, other DNA damage and cytogenetic effects associated with occupational expo-sures to styrene, and are summarized below. (i) DNA adducts V odicka et al. (1993) studied a group of lamination workers exposed to styrene at air concentrations of 300-700 mg/m3(mean, 370 mg/m3) and reported a statistically significant increase formation of O6-deoxyguanosine adducts ( O6-(2-hydroxy- 32P-postlabelling. The persistence of these O6-dG-styrene DNA adducts was investigated with a modified 32P-postlabelling method (Hemminki & V odicka, 1995), by comparing adduct levels in workers before vacation, after two weeks of vacation and after an additional onemonth of work. Air sampling showed styrene concentrations of 40-225 mg/m 3(mean 122 mg/m3). There was no significant difference in adduct levels in granulocytes between the control and exposed groups in any individual samplings. In lymphocytes of thelaminators, the adduct levels were significantly higher (5.4 adducts/10 8 nucleotides) than those in the controls (1.0 adduct/108 nucleotides). A two-week interruption of exposure did not influence the total adduct level (4.9 versus 5.1 adducts/108 nucleotides in the first and second samplings, respectively), which indicates a very slow removal from the DNAof the specific O 6-dG-styrene adducts (V odicka et al. , 1994). Personal dosimeters were used to monitor exposure to styrene of nine workers at a hand-lamination plant in Bohemia, and the concentrations of styrene in blood andmandelic acid in urine were measured. Blood samples taken at four occasions during aseven-month period were analysed for styrene-specific O 6-dG mutant frequency in T lymphocytes were also measured (see next section). Seven administrative employees in the same factory (factory controls) and eightpersons in a research laboratory (laboratory controls) were used as referents. The meanIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 504concentrations of styrene in air were 122 and 91 mg/m3, for the first and fourth samplings, respectively. DNA adduct levels were determined by the 32P-postlabelling method in lymphocytes of laminators, and appeared to be remarkably constant (5-6adducts/10 8nucleotides) and significantly higher ( p< 0.0001) than those in factory controls (0.3-1 adduct/108 nucleotides) at all four sampling times (V odicka et al., 1995). Results of a three-year follow-up study continued to show significant increases in O6-dG-styrene adducts in lymphocytes of lamination workers exposed to styrene adducts/108nucleotides versus 0.7 \u00b10.8 adducts/108nucleotides in controls) (V odicka et al. , 1999). In this series of studies, the numbers of exposed workers and corresponding control subjects ranged from nine to 17 individuals. The results indicatethat DNA adduct levels in lamination workers correlate with styrene exposure concen-tration. Evidence from long-term studies, however, indicates that adducts do not continueto accumulate with exposure time, suggesting that a balance is reached between adductformation and removal during long-term exposures. Smoking habits did not significantlyaffect adduct formation in the exposed workers compared to controls. In workers with reinforced plastics in the boat-manufacturing industry, styrene expo- sure (1-235 mg/m 3; mean 65.6 mg/m3) increased of an unidentified DNA adduct (14.2 \u00b12.3 adducts/108nucleotides), as well al., Styrene exposure concentration correlated with N2-guanine adduct levels. increased versus 1.52 \u00b10.45 8-OHdG/105dG in controls) provides evidence that styrene exposure also causes oxidative DNA damage (Marczynski et al. , 1997a). It was suggested that such damage could alter the balance of oxidants and antioxidants in the cell. This has led to anew hypothesis for genotoxicity of styrene based on oxidative stress (Marczynski et al., 2000). (ii) DNA single-strand breaks In 17 workers with low occupational exposure to styrene (time-weighted average exposure, 29.4 mg/m3), an exposure-dependent increase was seen in single-strand breaks (IARC, 1994a). An earlier investigation of the same group of workers reported that DNAsingle-strand breaks \u2014 measured by the DNA unwinding method \u2014 were also inducedin workers estimated to have higher exposure to styrene (average, 300 mg/m 3) calculated from post-shift urinary mandelic acid and blood concentrations of styrene glycol (M\u00e4ki-Paakkanen et al., 1991). Lack of persistence of the DNA damage indicated that the strand breaks were repaired in the exposed workers. Three studies reported on DNA breakage,measured by use of the single-cell gel electrophoresis assay, in lymphocytes of lami-nation workers exposed to styrene in the reinforced-plastics industry (exposure range,68-101 mg/m 3) (V , 1999; V odicka et al. , 1999). Smoking habits had no effect on the level of styrene-induced DNA damage. One studySTYRENE 505reported a significant correlation between DNA single-strand breaks and O6-dG-styrene adduct levels (V odicka et al., 1995). (iii) Gene mutations and cytogenetic damage Since the previous evaluation of styrene, results from three studies of styrene- induced gene mutations in lymphocytes from reinforced-plastics workers have beenpublished. One study assessed glycophorin A (GPA) variant frequency in erythrocytes of47 workers exposed for 8 h per day to a time-weighted average concentration of 37 ppm[158 mg/m 3] styrene in the breathing zone. Overall there was no significant increase in variant frequency for GPA allele duplication or allele loss, but a significant increase wasfound for 28 workers with exposure 85 mg/m 3styrene (Bigbee et al., 1996). Studies that investigated mutation induction at the HPRT locus in lymphocytes of styrene- exposed lamination workers in two different plants reported inconclusive to weakpositive results (V odicka et al. , 1995, 1999). Both studies reported a higher mutation frequency in exposed workers than in controls, but the increase was significant in onlyone of the studies (21.5 \u00b19.96 versus al. , 1999). The previous review of cytogenetic damage in workers occupationally exposed to styrene (IARC, 1994a) showed mainly negative results for the induction of chromosomalaberrations, micronuclei or sister chromatid exchange. Occupational exposure to styreneinduced chromosomal aberrations in nine of 22 studies, micronuclei in three of 11 studiesand sister chromatid exchange in three of 12 studies. The mean styrene concentration inthese studies ranged from 11 to 138 ppm [47-588 mg/m 3]. Workers having no significant increase in chromosomal aberrations were exposed to styrene at concentrations 70 ppm [8.5-298 mg/m 3] (IARC, 1994a). results from six recent cyto- genetic studies of styrene-exposed workers in the plastics and boat-manufacturingindustries are summarized in Table 12; chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatidexchange were increased in three of three and three of four studies, respectively, whileall three studies on micronuclei were negative. The ranges of styrene concentrations towhich workers were exposed are also given in Table 12. Artuso et al . (1995) reported that chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchange were induced in lymphocytes workers in group. The response in the low-exposure group, however, was weak. Workers in a glassfibre-reinforced plastics facility who were also exposed to low concentrations of styrene(0.5-26 ppm [2.1-111 mg/m 3]) did not show increased exchange nor increased induction of micronuclei (Van Hummelen et al ., 1994). One further study reported that sister chromatid exchange frequencies were significantly increased inlymphocytes of furniture manufacturers who were exposed to styrene from polyesterresins at concentrations (20-300 ppm [85-1280 mg/m 3]), similar al., 1997).IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 506STYRENE 507Table 12.

(1993) compared 17 styrene-exposed reinforced-plastics workers (years of exposure: 0.2-15; mean, 6.7) with 11 non-exposed controls and foundlinear correlations between concentrations of haemoglobin adducts free styrene7,8-oxide ( r= in in urine ( r= 0.92). [The Working Group noted that no information was available on styrene exposure concentrations for these workers.] Severi et al. (1994) looked for haemoglobin adducts of styrene 7,8-oxide in 52 workers having an average styrene exposure of31 mg/m 3and found none (detection limit of 10 pmol/g). Yeowell-O'Connell et al. (1996) measured adducts in 48 workers exposed to both styrene (0.9-235 mg/m3; mean, 64.3 mg/m3) and styrene 7,8-oxide 159 g/m3for 20 subjects) in a boat-building plant. They found no increase in the amount of haemoglobin adducts, but levels of albumin adducts increased with exposuresto both styrene and styrene 7,8-oxide. Further analysis of these data (Rappaport et al., 1996) indicated that the albumin adducts correlated better with airborne styrene7,8-oxide than with styrene in those individuals for whom exposure to both chemicalswas measured. Fustinoni et al. (1998) compared 22 workers selected on the basis of high levels of exposure to styrene (estimated to be about 100 mg/m 3) with 15 controls. The mean levels of 2-phenylethanol and 1-phenylethanol \u2014 obtained by chemical cleavageof styrene 7,8-oxide-cysteine adducts \u2014 were respectively 2.84 and 0.60 nmol/galbumin and 5.44 and 0.43 nmol/g haemoglobin for the workers and 2.74 and0.50 nmol/g albumin and 5.27 and 0.39 nmol/g haemoglobin for controls. Differencesbetween workers and controls were significant only when the data for the workers werestratified for high exposure. Johanson et al. (2000) exposed four male volunteers to 50 ppm [213 mg/m 3] [13C8]styrene for 2 h. Maximal concentrations of styrene 7,8-oxide in blood (average, 6.7 nM) were seen at 2 h. Hydroxyphenylethylvaline was estimated at0.3 pmol/g globin. The major (> 95%) portion of the [ 13C8]styrene metabolites in urine was derived from hydrolysis of styrene 7,8-oxide, with less than 5% coming from meta-bolism via the phenylacetaldehyde pathway. (b)Experimental systems (see Table 13 for references) Results from studies published since the previous evaluation of styrene are summa- rized in Table 13. (i) DNA adducts Both N7- and O6-deoxyguanosine adducts were formed in NMRI mouse liver, lung and spleen evaluated 3 h after a single intraperitoneal injection of styrene at dosesranging from 0.28 to 4.35 mmol/kg bw (Pauwels et al., 1996). A dose-response relation- ship was reported for both adducts in all three tissues. The N7-alkyldeoxyguanosine was more abundant than the O 6-deoxyguanosine adduct and the levels of both adducts were highest in lung tissue.

The adduct level in rat lung fractions enriched in type II cells was approxi- mately three times higher than that in total lung, whereas the adduct level in mouse lungfractions enriched in Clara cells was similar to that of total lung. In these studies, thecovalent binding indices (CBI) were all below 0.5. Otteneder et al. (2002) did not detect O 6-deoxyguanosine adducts in DNA from lung tissue of CD-1 mice or CD rats exposed to 160 ppm or 500 ppm [682 or 2130 mg/m3] styrene, respectively for two weeks (6 h per day, five days per week). The limit ofdetection in the 32P-postlabelling method used in this study was one adduct per 107 nucleotides. However, both and isomers of O6-dG-styrene 7,8-oxide adducts were detected in DNA from CD rats that were exposed by inhalation to 1000 ppm[4260 mg/m 3] styrene for two years (6 h per day, five days per week). The authors noted that DNA adduct formation in tissue homogenates did not reflect either the species diffe-rence in carcinogenicity nor the target organ specificity of styrene. (ii) Mutation and allied effects Positive and negative results have previously been reported for styrene-induced mutations in Salmonella typhimurium (IARC, 1994a) .Positive results were reported in studies using strains TA1530 or TA1535 with the addition of an exogenous metabolicactivation system. No new data on mutations in S. typhimurium have been reported. Results from one study of somatic mutations in Drosophila melanogaster were nega- tive. This both insecticide-susceptible (IS) and -resistant (IR) strains, whichdiffer in their activities of drug-metabolizing enzymes, to evaluate mutations in the w/w+ mosaic assay. Females were exposed to styrene at a concentration of 1040 g/mL in the feed medium. Although negative results were reported for the IS strain, positive resultswere seen in the IR strain at this dose. Two studies of the induction of sister chromatidexchange in human lymphocytes exposed to styrene in vitro also gave positive results. These observations are consistent with those from earlier studies. DNA strand breaks were induced in liver, kidney, bone marrow and lymphocytes of C57BL/6 mice given a single intraperitoneal injection of styrene. On the other hand,neither chromosomal aberrations nor sister chromatid exchange were seen inlymphocytes of Fischer 344 rats exposed to styrene by inhalation at a concentration of1000 ppm [4260 mg/m 3] for 6 h per day on five days per week for four weeks. 4.4.2 Styrene 7,8-oxide (a)Humans No data on effects of exposure of humans to styrene 7,8-oxide alone were available to the Working Group.IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 510(b)Experimental systems (see Table 14 for references) (i) DNA adducts A detailed description of N7, N2and O6-deoxyguanosine adducts of styrene 7,8-oxide formed in vitro was previously presented (IARC, 1994b). Sub- sequent studies have reported that N7-deoxyguanosine adducts are formed in human whole blood and embryonic lung fibroblasts in vitro , as well as in salmon testis DNA, upon exposure to styrene 7,8-oxide. In addition, O6-deoxyguanosine adducts were induced in human lymphocytes exposed to 24 g/mL styrene 7,8-oxide in vitro and in rat liver DNA following inhalation exposure to 1000 ppm [4.9 mg/m3] styrene 7,8-oxide for 6 h per day on five days per week for 104 weeks. DNA adducts were not clearly inducedin other studies in which rats were exposed to styrene 7,8-oxide by intraperitonealinjection or oral exposure. (ii) Mutation and allied effects Styrene 7,8-oxide, a monofunctional alkylating agent, has given positive results in virtually every short-term genetic assay in vitro and, to a lesser degree, in vivo . Positive results have previously been reported for gene mutations in bacteria and mammaliancells in vitro . DNA strand breaks, alkali-labile sites, and cytogenetic damage also have been reported in mammalian cells in vitro and, to some degree, in vivo . It was noted in the previous evaluation (IARC, 1994b) that the R-enantiomer of styrene 7,8-oxide may be slightly more mutagenic in S. typhimurium TA100 the S-enantiomer (Pagano et al., 1982; Seiler, 1990; Sinsheimer et al., 1993). In contrast, Sinsheimer et al. (1993) reported that the S- but not the R-enantiomer induced chromo- somal aberrations and sister chromatid exchange in mouse bone marrow. [The Working Group noted that, except when the R- or S- enantiomer of styrene 7,8-oxide was specifically tested, exposures to styrene 7,8-oxide were probably mixturesof optical isomers.] Results from studies on genetic and related effects of styrene 7,8-oxide published since the earlier evaluation are essentially all positive. In fact, only one study reportednegative results, the w/w+ mosaic assay active bioactivation system, styrene 7,8-oxide induced somaticmutations. DNA single-strand breaks and alkali-labile sites were induced in Wistar rat and human testicular and Chinese hamster V-79 cells in vitro . Four studies reported that DNA strand breaks and/or fragmentation were induced in human lymphocytes and humanembryonic lung fibroblasts exposed to styrene 7,8-oxide in vitro . Similarly, positive results were reported for the induction of gene mutations at the HPRT locus in human lymphocytes and B-cell lymphoblastoid cells treated in vitro . Six studies reported that exposure to styrene 7,8-oxide in vitro induced a significant increase in sister chromatid exchange frequencies in human lymphocytes. One study also reported a significantSTYRENE 511IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 512 Table 14.

These results are consistent with those previously reviewed. Three recent studies have reported that DNA strand breaks and alkali-labile sites are induced in multiple tissues (lung, liver, kidney, bone marrow and lymphocytes) of miceexposed to styrene 7,8-oxide by a single intraperitoneal injection at doses of 100-400mg/kg bw. Results from previously evaluated studies of induction of cytogenetic damagein rodents exposed to styrene 7,8-oxide in vivo were predominately negative. Two of three studies reported some evidence of exposure-related sister chromatid exchangeinduction and two of four studies reported that styrene 7,8-oxide induced chromosomalaberrations. Neither of the two micronucleus studies previously evaluated reportedincreases in the frequency of micronuclei following exposures to styrene 7,8-oxide viaintraperitoneal injection (IARC, 1994b). 4.5 Mechanistic considerations Following chronic exposure to styrene, a carcinogenic response has been observed only in mouse lung, but not in tissues of rats. Studies in humans and experimental animals and with tissues from both rodents and humans in vitro using a variety of experimental approaches have attempted to determine the mode of action for the styrene toxicity and carcinogenicity observed in experimentalanimals. In general, the objectives of many of these studies have been (1) to explore thebasis for the observed interspecies differences in tumour response between rats and mice,(2) to determine the critical steps in styrene carcinogenicity and (3) to identify the mostlikely chemical species responsible for the initiation of tumour development. At least two plausible modes of action, which are not mutually exclusive, for styrene carcinogenicity are suggested by the existing data. One involves a DNA-reactive modeof action initiated by the metabolic conversion of styrene to styrene 7,8-oxide, agenotoxic metabolite of styrene, and the subsequent induction of DNA damage in targettissues; the other involves cytotoxic effects in lungs of mice exposed to styrene. Foreither mode of action, interspecies differences in the metabolism and toxicokinetics ofstyrene and styrene 7,8-oxide that exist between rats and mice are likely to play a keyrole. 4.5.1 Interspecies differences in toxicokinetics and metabolism A number of studies in human volunteers and in workers occupationally exposed to styrene by inhalation (summarized by Bond, 1989) have shown that styrene toxico-kinetics and metabolic pathways are qualitatively similar in humans and experimentalanimals, although there are quantitative differences. In humans, between 60 and 70% ofinhaled styrene is absorbed and more than 85% of the absorbed styrene is eliminated inthe urine as mandelic and phenylglyoxylic acids. These metabolites are formed followinghydrolysis of styrene 7,8-oxide, which indicates that humans metabolize styrene toIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 514styrene 7,8-oxide. Johanson et al. (2000) have quantified blood levels of styrene 7,8- oxide in human volunteers exposed to styrene. In all experimental animal species studied, styrene is rapidly metabolized to styrene 7,8-oxide following absorption by oral, dermal or inhalation exposure. Styrene 7,8-oxideis sufficiently stable to be readily detected in the blood of both rats and mice exposed tostyrene. Systemic styrene 7,8-oxide concentrations do not, however, explain interspeciesdifferences in the carcinogenic response to styrene. At styrene exposure concentrationsof 1000 ppm [4260 mg/m 3] (the highest concentration tested), styrene 7,8-oxide concen- trations in the blood of rats were two orders of magnitude higher than those in the bloodof mice exposed to 20-40 ppm [85-170 mg/m 3] styrene (the lowest concentrations causing tumours), although mice, but not rats, develop lung tumours (Cruzan et al., 1998, 2001). The enzymatic oxidation of styrene to styrene 7,8-oxide is mediated by several iso- forms of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP2E1, CYP2B6 and CYP2F1in humans. In experimental animals, CYP2E1 appears to be the major isoform respon-sible for styrene oxidation in the liver, and CYP2F2 is the major form in the mouse lung,as determined by in-vitro studies (Carlson, 1997a). Interspecies differences exist in therates of metabolism of styrene by liver and lung tissue. In particular, human lung tissueproduces less styrene 7,8-oxide than that of rats and considerably less than that of mice(Nakajima et al., 1994a; Carlson et al., 2000; Filser et al. , 2002). The metabolism of styrene to styrene 7,8-oxide in mouse lung occurs almost exclu- sively in the Clara cells and the rate of styrene oxidation in these cells is threefold fasterthan in Clara cells of rats (Hynes et al., 1999). The mouse Clara cell may be at greater risk than the rat Clara cell if locally generated, rather than extrapulmonary, styrene7,8-oxide is critical for cytotoxic or genotoxic damage. Metabolism of styrene 7,8-oxide can proceed through hydrolysis of styrene 7,8-oxide by or phenylacetaldehyde and other ring-opened provides for styrene and styrene 7,8-oxide metabolism(Sumner & Fennell, 1994; Johanson et al. , 2000). Stable products representing each of these pathways are eliminated in the urine. Interspecies differences exist in the propor-tion of styrene 7,8-oxide that is eliminated via each of these pathways, and these diffe-rences may play a role in the species sensitivity towards the toxic and carcinogeniceffects of styrene exposure. For example, the capacity of epoxide hydrolase in humantissues to detoxify styrene 7,8-oxide exceeds that of rat or mouse tissues. In contrast, theactivity of glutathione S-transferase in human tissues is much lower than in rodent tissues (summarized in Cohen et al., 2002). Mouse tissues show significantly higher rates of activation of styrene to DNA-reactive epoxides than do rat or human tissues. Whilemouse, rat and human tissues all use epoxide hydrolase to detoxify styrene 7,8-oxide, themouse also uses glutathione S-transferase to a significant extent, with less activity in the rat and very little in humans. STYRENE 515The role of glutathione in the detoxication of styrene 7,8-oxide introduces the possi- bility that high concentrations of styrene 7,8-oxide significantly deplete the cellularconcentrations of glutathione, resulting in substantial cellular damage. Significantreductions in pulmonary glutathione were noted in mice exposed repeatedly to80-300 ppm [341-1280 mg/m 3] of styrene (Filser et al., 2002). Rats were significantly less susceptible to glutathione depletion than mice. However, while glutathione depletionin mouse lung has not been demonstrated at styrene concentrations below 80 ppm[341 mg/m 3], evidence of cancer induction exists at exposure concentrations as low as 20 ppm [85 mg/m3]. In summary, quantitative, but not qualitative, differences exist in the toxicokinetics of styrene and styrene 7,8-oxide in mice, rats and humans. These quantitative differencesalone do not appear to be sufficient to account for the development of lung tumours inmice at low styrene exposures and the resistance of rats to tumour formation at highexposures. Thus, factors of a toxicodynamic nature may play a role in the interspeciesdifferences in response to styrene. 4.5.2 Interspecies differences in toxicodynamics and mode of action In general, mice appear to be more susceptible to lung tumour induction by epoxides and epoxide-forming chemicals 1,3-butadiene, isoprene induced tumours in mice but not rats(Lynch et al., 1984; National Toxicology Program, 1984; Snellings et al., 1984; National Toxicology Program, 1987; Owen et al., 1987; Melnick et al., 1994; National Toxicology Program, 1998, 1999; Melnick & Sills, 2001). The determinants underlying the suscepti-bility of the mouse lung towards tumour formation may rely in part on toxicokineticconsiderations, but toxicodynamic determinants are probably also at play. One potential mode of action for styrene involves the cytotoxicity of styrene 7,8-oxide. Repeated exposure to styrene progressively results in focal crowding ofbronchiolar cells, bronchiolar epithelial hyperplasia and bronchiolo-alveolar hyperplasiain the lungs of mice but not in those of rats (Cruzan et al., 1997, 1998; Cohen et al., 2002; Cruzan et al., 2001). A major factor that may play a role in the onset of hyperplasia in mice after exposure to styrene is pulmonary formation of styrene 7,8-oxide. Styrene7,8-oxide administered to mice by intraperitoneal injection results in pulmonary toxicityas measured by release of enzymes into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, suggesting thatstyrene 7,8-oxide is cytotoxic to mouse lung cells. This cytotoxicity stimulates cell repli-cation and proliferation. The pulmonary toxicity induced by high doses of injectedstyrene 7,8-oxide also clearly demonstrates that systemically available styrene 7,8-oxide(i.e., that produced in extrapulmonary tissues and released into the circulation) can enterlung cells to induce a toxic response. A second mode of action for styrene-induced carcinogenicity invokes DNA-reacti- vity and subsequent genotoxicity. Although is not DNA-reactive, styrene7,8-oxide binds covalently to macromolecules MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 516Styrene 7,8-oxide can bind to DNA with the formation of stable N2and O6adducts of deoxyguanosine in human lymphocytes and cultured mammalian cells (Horvath et al., 1994; Bastlov\u00e1 et al., 1995; V odicka et al., 1999). In particular, the O6adducts are rela- tively persistent. The stability of the O6adducts is supported by studies of styrene 7,8-oxide adducts in the lymphocytes of workers exposed to styrene (V odicka et al., 1994, 1995, 1999). The genotoxicity of styrene and styrene 7,8-oxide has been studied extensively in both experimental systems and humans. Styrene 7,8-oxide has been shown to causemutations (with and without metabolic activation) in the Ames Salmonella assay. In contrast, styrene generally gives negative results for mutagenic activity in the AmesSalmonella assay; however, it was noted previously (IARC, 1994a) that positive results in Salmonella typhimurium were seen in some studies in the presence of exogenous metabolic activation. The evidence for mutations in humans occupationally exposed tostyrene is equivocal. Exposure to styrene results in an increase in sister chromatid exchange frequency and, to a limited extent, the frequency of chromosomal aberrations and micronucleatedcells in experimental animals. Cytogenetic studies in exposed workers are difficult tointerpret due to potential confounders and co-exposures to other genotoxic agents (Scott& Preston, 1994). Assessing quantitative relationships across human studies has shownassociations between styrene exposure and the frequency of chromosomal abnormalitiesbut not sister chromatid exchange or micronuclei (Bonassi et al., 1996; Cohen et al., 2002). Rappaport et al. (1996) reported a positive correlation between airborne styrene 7,8-oxide concentrations, but not styrene concentrations, and sister chromatid exchangefrequency in styrene workers. An association has been reported between styrene exposure and DNA strand breaks in workers employed in various styrene-related industries (M\u00e4ki-Paakkanen et al., 1991; Somorovsk\u00e1 et al., 1999). However, the role of these strand breaks in disease etiology has been questioned since this type of damage is quickly and efficiently repaired in bothanimals and humans (Walles et al., 1993; Bastlov\u00e1 et al., 1995). As an example, studies by Walles et al. (1993) indicate that end-of-shift DNA damage in subjects occupationally exposed to styrene is repaired by the next morning. The DNA strand breaks are probablycaused by the much less persistent N7 adducts (V odicka et al., 1996). 4.5.3 Conclusion In summary, data from both laboratory ( in vitro and in vivo ) and human studies indicate that styrene exposure can result in low levels of DNA adducts and DNA damagein individuals who possess the capacity to activate styrene metabolically to its epoxidemetabolite, styrene 7,8-oxide. However, as noted above, mice, but not rats, develop lungtumours following styrene exposure, even though both species form DNA adducts. DNAadducts are also found in organs other than the lung.STYRENE 517Circulating styrene 7,8-oxide may also play a role. However, the concentration of this metabolite in rat blood is two orders of magnitude higher than in the mouse. The lungtumours in mice probably develop as a result of in-situ formation of styrene 7,8-oxidewhich leads to cytotoxicity and increased cell proliferation, but a role of circulatingstyrene 7,8-oxide and of DNA adducts cannot be discounted. Based on metabolic considerations, it is likely that the proposed mechanism involving metabolism of styrene to styrene 7,8-oxide in mouse Clara cells is not opera-tive in human lungs to a biologically significant extent. However, based on the obser-vations in human workers regarding blood styrene 7,8-oxide, DNA adducts and chromo-somal damage, it cannot be excluded that this and other mechanisms are important forother organs. 5. Summary of Data Reported and Evaluation 5.1 Exposure data Styrene is a commercially important monomer which is used extensively in the manufacture of polystyrene resins (plastic packaging, disposable cups and containers,insulation) and in copolymers with acrylonitrile and/or 1,3-butadiene (synthetic rubberand latex, reinforced plastics). Human exposure occurs at levels of milligrams per dayduring its production and industrial use and at much higher levels in the glass fibre-reinforced plastics industry. Exposure to the general population occurs at levels of micro-grams per day due mainly to inhalation of ambient air and cigarette smoke and intake offood that has been in contact with styrene-containing polymers. 5.2 Human carcinogenicity data Retrospective cohort studies of styrene have been conducted in three types of industry: production of styrene monomer and styrene polymers, production of glassfibre-reinforced plastic products, and production of styrene-butadiene rubber. In a European multinational cohort study of workers in the glass fibre-reinforced plastics industry (the largest component of which was Danish), there was no excessmortality from lymphatic and haematopoietic neoplasms in the entire cohort in compa-rison with the general population, but the results may have been biased by problems withmortality ascertainment in some of the sub-cohorts. In internal analyses, using unexposedcohort members as the comparison group, the risk of lymphatic and haematopoietic neo-plasms was significantly increased among exposed workers after more than 20 yearssince their first exposure to styrene, and increased with increasing intensity of exposurebut not with increasing cumulative exposure to styrene. Another study of cancer incidence in the reinforced-plastics industry conducted in Denmark involved many workers who had been included in the European study. Overall,IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 518a small and non-significant excess of leukaemia was observed. A significant excess of leukaemia was observed among workers employed before 1971 (the period with thehighest styrene exposures). There was also a significant increase in the incidence ofleukaemia when attention was restricted to the follow-up period after 10 years since firstexposure to styrene, but only among workers with very short employment (less than 1year). There was evidence that the available data on duration underestimated the trueduration of exposure for many of the workers. (This also applies to the European cohortsince the Danish cohort constituted a large fraction of this cohort). A large study of workers exposed to styrene in the reinforced-plastics industry in the USA found no overall excess of lymphatic and haematopoietic neoplasms. Two studies of chemical workers in the USA and the United Kingdom involved in the production of styrene and styrene derivatives found a weak association betweenexposure to styrene and lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers. Styrene exposures werepoorly documented in these studies, and exposures to several other chemicals may haveoccurred. A follow-up study of cancer incidence in Finnish workers biologically monitored for occupational exposures to styrene during the 1970s and early 1980s did not show anyincrease in risk for lymphatic and haematopoietic neoplasms. The relatively small sizeof this study and the low exposures of workers detracted from its power to detect aneffect of the magnitude found in some of the other studies. A small excess of leukaemia mortality has been reported in studies of styrene-buta- diene workers in the USA. This excess increased with cumulative exposure to styrene inanalyses that only considered this exposure; however, in analyses that included 1,3-butadiene, the exposure-response relationship became non-monotonic. Interpretation ofthe findings from this study is hampered by the high correlation between styrene and 1,3-butadiene exposures, which makes it difficult to disentangle the effects of these twoexposures. There have also been reports of increased risks of rectal, pancreatic and nervous system cancers in some of the cohort and case-control studies. The numbers of caseswere quite small in these studies, and most of the larger cohort studies have not yieldedsimilar findings. Many of the cohort studies did not examine these sites in detail. The studies of glass fibre-reinforced plastics workers are the most informative with regard to the hypothesis that styrene exposure is associated with an increased risk ofcancer in humans. This is because these workers had higher styrene exposures and lesspotential for exposure to other substances than the other cohorts studied. On the otherhand, they are hampered by the high mobility of this workforce. In the overlappingEuropean and Danish studies, a small excess of lymphatic and haematopoietic neoplasmswas found, particularly in subgroup analyses of workers with relatively high exposuresand a sufficiently long time (e.g., > 10 years) since first exposure. There was no relation-ship between lymphatic and haematopoietic neoplasms and cumulative styrene expo-sure, but these studies had problems in accurately estimating duration of employmentand hence cumulative exposures.STYRENE 519The increased risks for lymphatic and haematopoietic neoplasms observed in some of the studies are generally small, statistically unstable and often based on subgroupanalyses. These findings are not very robust and the possibility that the observations arethe results of chance, bias or confounding by other occupational exposures cannot beruled out. 5.3 Animal carcinogenicity data Styrene was tested for carcinogenicity in mice in one inhalation study and four oral gavage studies. In the inhalation study, in male mice there was an increase in theincidence of pulmonary adenomas and in female mice, there was an increase in theincidence of pulmonary adenomas, and only an increase in that of carcinomas in thehigh-dose group. Two of the gavage studies were negative. The other two were consi-dered inadequate for an evaluation of the carcinogenicity of styrene. A screening studyby intraperitoneal administration also did not find an increase in tumour incidence ormultiplicity in mice. Styrene was tested for carcinogenicity in rats in four gavage studies, one drinking- water study and two inhalation studies. Overall, there was no reliable evidence for anincrease in tumour incidence in rats. Styrene 7,8-oxide is a major metabolite of styrene and has been evaluated previously (IARC, 1994b). The evaluation at that time was that there was sufficient evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of styrene 7,8-oxide. 5.4 Other relevant data Styrene is absorbed following exposure via inhalation, dermal contact and orally in humans and laboratory animals. In humans, approximately 70% of the inhaled dose isabsorbed. Styrene is distributed throughout the body, with the highest concentrationgenerally found in adipose tissue. There are both quantitative and qualitative interspeciesdifferences in styrene metabolism. In humans, styrene is metabolized primarily via thestyrene 7,8-oxide pathway to be excreted in the urine as mandelic and phenylglyoxylicacids. In rodents, but not in humans, glutathione conjugation of styrene 7,8-oxide to formmercapturic acids is an important metabolic pathway. Metabolism of styrene to 1- and2-phenylethanol and then to phenylacetaldehyde and finally to phenylacetic, phenyl-aceturic and hippuric acids is more important in animals than in humans. CYP2E1 and CYP2F are the most important cytochrome P450 enzymes in rodents and humans responsible for the metabolism of styrene to styrene 7,8-oxide. In addition,CYP2B6 may be important in humans. In vitro , the rates of metabolism of styrene to styrene 7,8-oxide are much higher in mouse lung than in rat or human lung. Occupational styrene exposure causes central and peripheral nervous system effects in humans. It causes a reversible decrease in colour discrimination and in some studieseffects on hearing have been reported. Studies of effects of styrene on the haematopoieticIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 520and immune systems, liver and kidney in exposed workers did not reveal consistent changes. Central nervous system effects of styrene were reported in rats, guinea-pigs and rabbits. Styrene exposure causes liver and lung toxicity in mice and nasal toxicity in ratsand mice. In humans, there is no evidence for an association between workplace exposure to styrene and spontaneous abortions, malformations or decreased male fecundity. In rats, there is some evidence for reduced sperm count and peripubertal animals may be more sensitive than adult animals. Styrene crosses the placenta in rats and mice. Itincreases prenatal death at dose levels causing decreased maternal weight gain.Decreased pup weight, postnatal developmental delays as well as neurobehavioural andneurochemical abnormalities have been reported in rats exposed to styrene during pre-or postnatal development. In-vitro studies indicate that the potential for developmentaltoxicity is much higher for styrene 7,8-oxide than for styrene. Occupational exposure to styrene leads to formation of O Low levels of these two adducts were also detected in liver of miceand rats exposed to styrene. Inconsistent results have been reported for chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei and sister chromatid exchange in approximately 30 studies of workers exposed to styrenein various industries. These studies were predominantly from the reinforced-plasticsindustry where styrene exposure is high, but there was no indication of a dose-responserelationship in any of the studies reporting positive results. Induction of chromosomalaberrations was reported in 12 of 25 studies, sister chromatid exchange in six of 16studies and micronuclei in three of 14 studies. Sister chromatid exchange and to a lesser degree chromosomal aberrations were induced in rodents in vivo and consistently in human lymphocytes in vitro . Styrene was predominantly inactive in assays for gene mutations in bacteria, although some studies reported mutations in the presence of a metabolic activationsystem. Data from both laboratory ( in vitro and in vivo ) and human studies indicate that styrene exposure can result in low levels of DNA adducts and DNA damage in indivi-duals who possess the capacity to activate styrene metabolically to styrene 7,8-oxide.However, as noted above, mice, but not rats, develop lung tumours following styreneexposure, even though both species form DNA adducts. DNA adducts are also found inorgans other than the lung. Circulating styrene 7,8-oxide may also play a role. However,the concentration in rat blood is two orders of magnitude higher than in the mouse. The lung tumours in mice probably develop as a result of in-situ formation of styrene 7,8-oxide which causes cytotoxicity and increased cell proliferation, but the roles ofcirculating styrene 7,8-oxide and of DNA adducts cannot be discounted. Based on meta-bolic considerations, it is likely that the proposed mechanism involving metabolism ofstyrene to styrene 7,8-oxide in mouse Clara cells is not operative in human lungs to aSTYRENE 521biologically significant extent. However, based on the observations in human workers regarding blood styrene 7,8-oxide, DNA adducts and chromosomal damage, it cannot beexcluded that this and other mechanisms are important for other organs. 5.5 Evaluation1 There is limited evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of styrene.
