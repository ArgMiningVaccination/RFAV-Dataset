Unfortunately, there are very limited approved therapeutics available with established efficacy and safety profiles against SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 vaccines aim to actively induce systemic immunization; however, the possibility or fear of side effects decreases or discourages their use. Alternative therapy via natural products, especially essential oils, could be considered safe and effective to improve health, cure ailments, and soothe your body and mind. Essential oils, which have been known for their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, bronchodilatory, and antiviral properties, could possibly be useful for the symptomatic management of COVID-19. This book is vital in respect of designing approaches to protect humanity from further losses and harm due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Role of Essential Oils in the Management of COVID-19 offers a complete outline of the recent novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection, its biology, and associated challenges for the prevention and treatment of novel COVID-19, with a prime focus on the possible role of essential oils in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. This book is written for everyone who needs to be thoroughly familiar with the appropriate and safe use of essential oils in COVID-19 therapy. As per the objectives of the book: - The first seven chapters cover various aspects of COVID-19 infection, including epidemiology, origin, morphology, genome organization, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnostic approaches, preventive measures, and treatment strategies. - The remaining chapters elaborate on the various aspects related to essential oils, such as chemistry, extraction methods, dispensing methods, stability, quality control, mechanism of action, therapeutic effects, pharmacokinetics, aromatherapy, and safety profiles.
