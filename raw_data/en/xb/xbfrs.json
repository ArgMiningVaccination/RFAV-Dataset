Pfizer -BioNTech , Oxford Johnson Note: mAB = monoclonal antibody; sterilizing immunity is an immune status which prevents virus infection into the host; antigenic drift is a genetic variation in viruses, occurs through accumulation of mutations within the antibody -binding sitesAlthough first generation vaccines1 give cause for cautious optimism, COVID -19 will likely shift from a pandemic disease to an endemic oneSustained sterilizing immunity may be difficult to achieve , necessitating periodic vaccine boosters to reduce risk over time, especially for the vulnerable population Vaccine protection levels , including duration of protection still unclearAntigenic Drift has caused the emergence of several variants of concern with varying ability to escape first generation vaccines1 and mAbs (esp. B.1.351 variant first detected in South Africa) Global vaccine rollout will be prolonged due to availability, distribution challenges, and hesitancy, enabling continued transmission and opening the door to emergence of more variants esp. when uncontrolled (i.e., India) If COVID -19 establishes itself in a wild -animal population, eradication becomes unlikely due to persistent animal reservoirs (e.g., minks)3 Herd immunity increasingly unattainable Unless a vaccine offers sterilizing immunity, herd immunity thresholds will remain increasingly unattainable Several factors already at play to prevent broader immunization, in turn moving the threshold to even higher levelsKey takeaway:Base calculation No variants With variants Natural rate of transmission1R0 2.5 -3.0 4.0 -5.0 Herd immunity threshold (% ) at true immunity2HT=1-(1/R0) 60 transmission3VI ~70 ~67 -96% ~83 -100+% 1.
