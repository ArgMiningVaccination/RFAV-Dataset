Today, the original mission continues, \"to guide those who are interested in a sane, well-balanced program of living.\" The spa offers holistic therapies (like acupuncture, Reiki, and WATSU), massages, facials, wraps, and more. Many of the treatments use herbs and plants grown onsite. The facilities include a hot tub, sauna, steam room, relaxation lounge, and cold water immersion. Physical exertion is a pillar of the Rancho La Puerta experience, with a daily line-up of optional activities like hiking, running, kickboxing, cycling, salsa, yoga, and more. Guests stay among 86 casitas, cozy sanctuaries with vibrant Mexican textiles and terra cotta tile floors. "}
