Morsa Images/DigitalVison via Getty Images With COVID-19 shots finally available for infants and preschoolers, knowing how to combat misinformation on social media and elsewhere could be more important than ever. Thought Catalogue/Unsplash Contrary to the popular belief that social media creates rumours about COVID vaccine harms, new research suggests social media generally only aids the spread of these rumours. With the holiday season approaching, people wait to receive a COVID-19 vaccination in Montr\u00e9al as the pandemic continues in Canada and around the world.

Health care providers are just one trusted source of information for parents on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines for children.

Vaccine hesitancy has been a growing challenge for more than a decade. Concerns about vaccine safety and adverse events are the most commonly cited reasons. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis) To help increase trust in vaccines, researchers analyzed data on adverse events to address safety concerns, and then used cognitive science to show how cognitive biases feed vaccine hesitancy. Fiona Goodall/Getty Images A survey found almost a quarter of participants thought they could not receive a vaccine because of medical conditions. But only 28.9% of this group actually meet the criteria set by health agencies.

Richard Wainwright/AAP The TGA has reported a handful of cases of the autoimmune disorder Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome following the AstraZeneca vaccine.

They may not realise they're already eligible for the COVID vaccine. from www.shutterstock.com A serious event such as a blood clot could be caused by an underlying medical condition, a medication the person was taking at the time, or some other factor unrelated to the vaccine. Ciro Fusco/EPA-EFE Both the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are now being investigated for links to rare blood disorders. Capillaries are the body's smallest blood vessels, and allow oxygen, nutrients and waste products to be delivered and removed from tissues. hareluya/Shutterstock European regulators are investigating a possible link between the vaccine and a second rare blood disorder. Dave Hunt/AAP The challenge now is to address the understandable concerns and prevent them from contaminating the broader public dialogue on COVID-19 vaccination.

They include swelling in the affected arm, nausea and chills. New mRNA vaccines use genes from the coronavirus to produce immunity. Andriy Onufriyenko/Moment via Getty Images So far, most vaccines in the US are mRNA vaccines. These represent a new technology and are likely to take over the vaccine world. But how do they work? What are their weaknesses? Five experts explain.
