Until July 2022, the total reported cases were 572 million and reported deaths were 6.38 million around the world. In many countries the infections caused severe damages. It not only took the precious lives but also caused few other national damages like economic crisis. The only solution to stop this pandemic is to increase the vaccination and reducing the spreads. The covid 19 virus is an airborne disease and spread when people breathe virus contaminated air. The WHO and all the nations were insisting to maintain social distance to control the virus spreading. But maintaining the social distance in public places is very hard. In this project we developed a method for detecting social distance. The system uses Raspberry Pi processor to detect the distance between two people from the live video stream. The YOLOv3 technique is used to detect the object from single frame of the video.", "sitename": "ieeexplore.ieee.org", "date": "2023-09-10", "cleaned_text": "A not-for-profit organization, IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity.\u00a9 Copyright 2023 IEEE - All rights reserved.
