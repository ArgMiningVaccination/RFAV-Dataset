The m ajor features and findings of the Repor t include th e following: OMB reviewed 107 m ajor Federal rulem akings finalized over the previous ten years (October 1, 1992 to Septem ber 30, 2002). The es timated total annual quantified benefits of these rules range from $146 billion to $230 billion, while the estim ated total annual quantified costs rang e from $36 billion to $42 billion. The majority of th e quantified benefits are attributable to a handful of clean-air rules issued by EPA pursuant to the 1990 am endm ents to the Clean Air Act. (Chapter I) In order to achieve better regulations, OMB invited public nom inations of specific regulatory refor ms: additions, m odificat ions or rescissions. Over 1,700 public commenters nom inated 316 di stinct rules, guidance docum ents, and paperwork requirem ents for reform . With the a ssistance of the Advocac y Office of the US Sm all Business Adm inistration, OMB worked with agen cies during the las t year to evaluate these reform nom ination s. The agen cies and OM B determ ined that (1) 10 9 of these reform nom inations were recen tly ad dressed by agencies o r were cu rrently under rev iew, (2) 51 of the reform nominations were directed at independent agencies, and (3) 156 of the reform nom inations were ripe for consideration by Cabinet-level agencies and E PA. Of these 156 reform nominations, agencies have decided to pursue 34 rules and 11 guidance docum ents for reform , are undecide d about 26 rules and 4 guidance documents, and have decided not to pursu e reform of 62 rules and 19 guidance docum ents at this time. (Chapter II) In order to m ake continued im provem ents in regulatory analysis, OMB and the Council of Econom ic Advisors have finalized new guida nce for agencies on regulatory analysis. Key features of the revised guidance include : (1) more em phasis on cos t-effectivenes s analys is as well as ben efit-cos t analysis; (2) form al probability analysis of future rulem akings with m ore than a billion-dollar im pact on the econom y; and (3) m ore system atic evaluation of qualitative as well as quantified benefits and costs. Appendix D contains the final regulatory analysis guidelines, which have been form ally issued as \"OMB Circular A-4, Regulatory Analysis\". Appendix E includes a summ ary of the public com ments on the draft revised guidance and OMB' s response to those comm ents. Appendix F presents evidence supporting the discount rate recommende d in Circular A-4. 3 With regard to em erging risks to public health, saf ety and the environm ent, an Interagency Work Group on Risk Managem ent ha s described current U.S. approaches to risk as sessm ent and m anagem ent. The concept o f precaution plays an im portan t role in these approaches, but precaution, coupled with objective scien tific analysis, needs to be applied wisely on a case-by-case basis. The W ork Group was co-chaired by OMB and CEQ and us ed public comments to assist in the developm ent of the risk m anagem ent report in Ch apter III. In light of the significant interest in homeland security regul ation, OMB sought public comment on how to effe ctively evaluate the benefits and costs of hom eland security proposals. The challenges in m easuring anti-te rrorism benefits and the direct and indirect costs of anti-terrorism rules are discussed. Special concerns are raised ab out costs related to tim e, convenience, privacy and civil right s and liberties, and econom ic productivity. An updated listing of proposed and final rules re lated to hom eland security is provided as well as a su mmary of recent legis lative activity. (Chapter IV) OMB surveyed agency consultation with Stat e and local governm ents, a process critical to the developm ent of sound regulatory policy. Federal departm ents such as Education, Health and Hum an Services and Agricult ure are engaged in a wide range of intergovernm ental consultati on activities. For exam ple, Education has undertaken extensive dialogue with State, local and tribal governm ents in support of im plementation of the No Child Left Behind Act (N CLBA). The result was the developm ent of rules implem enting the NCLBA' s provisions on acade mic standards and acco untability. During the last year, Federal agen cies issued five proposed or final rules that were subject to the reporting requirem ents of the Unfunded Mandates R eform Act. Although these rules im posed significant expend itures on the private sector, none of them involved rules where expected cos ts to State, local, or trib al gov ernm ents were expected to exceed $1 00 million. (Part II). This f inal report was is sued in draf t form in February of this year and was revised in response to public com ment, external peer revi ew, and interagency review. OMB ha s already begun to prepare the 2004 Report to Congress on the Costs and Bene fits of Federal Regulations. OMB' s objective is to publish the draft 2004 report as part of the President's FY 2005 budget subm ission to Congress, which will b e released in February 20 04. 4 PART 1: Report to Congress on the Cost s and Benefits of Federal Regulations CHAPTER I: THE COSTS AND BEN EFIT S OF FEDE RAL REG ULATIONS The and associated cluding: (1) an estim ate of the tota l annual costs and benefits (including quantifiable and nonquantifiable effects) of Federal rules and paperwork, to the extent feasible: (A) in the ag gregate; (B) by agen cy and agen cy program ; and (C) by m ajor rule ; (2) an analysis of im pacts of Federal regula tion on State, local, and tribal governm ent, small business, wages, and econom ic growth; and (3) re commendation s for reform .2 This chapter presents the accounting statem ent. Our new estim ates are based on the major regulations review ed by OMB over the last ten years. We revised the benefit-cost estim ates in last year's report by updating the estim ates to the end of fiscal year 2002 (Septem ber 30, 2002) and including new estim ates from October 1, 1992 to March 31, 1995. All of the es timates pres ented in this chapter are based on ag ency information o r transparen t modification s of agency infor mation perform ed by OMB. We have not provided new infor mation on the impacts of Federal regula tion on State, local, and tribal governm ent, small businesses, wages, and economic growth in this report, b ecause little new infor mation has becom e available since last yea r's report. The 2002 report incl udes discussions of these issues (see pages 41 to 46). This chapter also in cludes a discussio n of m ajor rules issued by independent regulatory agencies, although OMB does not review th ese rules under E xecutive Order 12866. This discussion is based on data provided by these ag encies to the General Accounting Office (GAO) under the C ongressional Review Act. 1 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105 note, Pub. L. 106-554, ' 1(a) (3) [Title VI, ' 62 4], Dec. 21, 2000, 114 Stat. 2763, 2763 A-161 . The tex t of the Regulatory Righ t-to-Know Act is in Appendix J of this rep ort. 2 Recom mendat ions for reform are discussed in Chapter II and Appendix C. 5 A. Estimates o f the Total Benefits an d Costs of Regulations Review ed by OMB3 Table 1 presents estim ates by agency of the benefits and costs4 of m ajor rules5 reviewed by OMB over the past year (October 1, 2001 to Septem ber 30, 2002). OMB reviewed 31 final major rules over that period. These 31 rules repres ent less than ten percent of the 330 final rules reviewed by OMB and less than one percent of the 4,153 final rules published in the Federal Register during this 12-month period. However, OMB believes that the costs and benefits of major rules are quan titatively m ore impor tant th an all o ther rules com bined. Of the 31 rules, 25 im plem ented Federal budgetary programs, which caused incom e transfers from one group to another. The rem aining six regulations were \"social regulations\", providing l benef its.6 Four of these six \"social regulations \" imposed m andates on State a nd local entities o r the p rivate sector. The other two \"socia l regulations\" were enabling re gulations that did not im pose mandates. Of the six \"social regulati ons,\" we are able to presen t estim ates of both monetized costs and benefits for three rules. 7 We did not include the three other rules that did not have monetized estim ates for either costs or bene fits or both. Three agencies\u2014DOE, DOT, and EPA\u2014issued three m ajor regulations adding a co mbined $2.4 billion to $6.5 billion in annual benefits and $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion in annual costs. Table 1: Estimates of the Annual Benefi ts and Costs of Major Federal Rules, October 1, 2001 to September 30, 2002 (millions of 2001 dollars ) Agency Benefits Costs Energy 710 636 Transportation 409 to 944 749 to 1,206 Environm ental Protection Agency 1,250 to 4,818 192 Total 2,369 to 6,472 1,577 to 2,034 Table 2 presents an estim ate of the total co sts and benefits of all 107 regulations reviewed by OMB over the ten-year pe riod from October 1, 1992 to Septem ber 30, 2002 that m et two 3 In previous reports, OMB present ed detailed discussi ons about the difficulty of estimating and aggregating the costs and benefits of different regulations over long time peri ods and across many agenci es. Those discussions are not repeated here. Previous reports are on the OM B websi te (http://www.wh itehou se.gov /omb/inforeg /regpo l.html). 4 any age ncies were unable to quantify all b enefits an d costs. We attem pted to cap ture the essen ce of these effects on a rule-by-rule basis in the columns titled \"Other Inform ation\" in the various tables reporting agency estim Howeve r, the m onetized necessarily excl ude effects. 5 The Fed eral R egister citatio ns fo r these m ajor rules are foun d in Table 4. 6 Rules that tran sfer Fed eral do llars am ong parties are not included in t he bene fit-cost totals beca use tra nsfers are not social costs or bene fits. If included, they would add equal amounts to benefits and costs. 7 OMB used a gency estim ates whe re availabl e. If an agency qu antified estimates b ut did not monetize, standa rd assumptions were used to monetize as ex plained in Appendix A. 6 conditions. Each rule g enerated costs or benefits of at leas t $100 m illion annually, an d a substantial portion of its costs and benefits were quantified and monetized by the agency or, in some cases, monetized by OMB. The estim ates are therefore not a com plete accounting of all the costs and benefits of all re gulations issued by the Federal governm ent during this period. We calculated T able 2 estim ates by ad ding the estimates in Table 1 above and the estim ates from Table 18 (in Appendix A of this report) and T able 8 (in the 2002 OMB report). We have expanded the num ber of years cove red by our estimates to ten from the six and one-half years presented in last year's report. We provide estim ates of th e cost and benefits of social regulation (healt h, safety and environm ental regulati on) for each rule for the periods covering October 1, 1992 to March 31, 1995 and October 1, 2001 to Septem ber 30, 2002 in Appendix A.8 The estim ates of the costs and ben efits of Federal regulations over the period October 1, 1992 to September 30, 2002 are based on ag ency analyses subject to public notice and comments and OMB review under E.O. 12866. OMB has chosen a 10-year period for aggregation because p re-regulation estim ates prepar ed for ru les adopted more than ten years ago are of questionable relevance today. Table 2: Estimates of the Total Annual Benefits and Costs of Major Federal Rules, October 1, 1992 to September 30, 2002 (millions of 2001 dollars ) Agency Benefits Costs Agriculture 3,094 to 6,176 1,643 to 1,672 Education 655 to 813 361 to 610 Energy 4,700 to 4,768 2,472 Health &Hum an Services 9,129 to 11,710 3,165 to 3,334 Housing & Urban Developm ent 551 to 625 348 Labor 1,804 to to 230,896 36,625 to 42,813 In last year's report, the aggregate costs of regulations fell within the range of the estim ated be nefits - alb eit at the lower end of the range. The aggregate benefits reported in Table 2, however, are roughly three to five tim es the aggregate costs and are substantially larger than the aggregate benefits reported in our 2002 repor t. There are two reasons for this. First, the additional rules cover a 10-year pe riod sulf ur dioxide limits of the acid rain provisions in the 1990 Am endments to the Clean Air Act. This rule adds nearly $80 billion per year to the aggregate benef it estim ate. Second, in reviewing our estim ates, we inadver tently sub tracted in correct cost estimates f or EPA's rules es tablishing Na tional 8 Agency estimates of the cost and bene fits of major regulations for October 1, 1992 to March 31, 1995 are provided in Appendix B. Appendix A contains est imates revi sed by OMB. 7 Ambient Air Quality Sta ndards f or ozone and par ticulate m atter (PM). This cor rection reduces the aggregate cost of the rule s covered over the 10-year period by roughly $20 billion per year. It is im portant to note that of the 107 rules reviewed by OMB over the last ten years, four EPA rules - two rules lim iting particulate m atter and NO x emissions from heavy duty highway engines, the Tier 2 rule lim iting the em issions from light duty vehicles, and the Acid R ain rule cited above -- account for a substa ntial fraction of the aggregate benefits reported in Table 2. These four EPA rules have estim ated benefits of $101 to $119 billion per year and costs of $8 to $8.8 billion per year.9 The aggregate benefits and costs for the other 103 rules are $41 to $107 billion and $29 to $34 inf ormation on costs f or sele ct ag ency program s. The reader should not assum e that the low (high) end of the benefits estim ate corresponds to the low (high) end of the cost estim ate. Thus, for exam ple, it is possible that the net benefits of EPA's wa ter rule s taken together could range from negative $2 billion to positive $5.7 billion per year. Based on the inform ation released in previous reports, th e total cos ts and benefits of all Federal rules now in effect (m ajor and non-m ajor, including those adopted m ore than 10 years ago) could easily be a factor of ten or m ore larg er than the su m of the co sts and benefits reported in Table 2. More research is necessary to provide a stronger analytic foundation for comprehensive estim ates of total costs and benefits by agency and program . 9 These fou r EPA ru les will red uce am bient levels of fine particulate m atter b y reducing direct PM em issions and/or the em issions of precurso r pollu tants like SO 2 and NO x that co ntribute to th e form ation of second ary fine PM. Studies show an association between both short-and long-term expos ure to fine PM and a variety of adverse heal th effects ranging fro m increases in the frequ ency o f hospital admissions to premature mortality. There are, however, important uncertain ties associated with tran slatin g this scien tific ev idence in to benefit es timates. There are five key assumptions underlyin g the benefit estim ates. These in clude the following : 1. The anal ysis assum es that inhalation of fine particles asso ciated with premature death at conce ntrations near those e xperienced by most Americans on a daily basis. Although studies have yet to establish the s pecific biol ogical mechanism s responsible for s uch effects, t he weight of t he available epidemiological ev idence sup ports an assum ption of causality. 2. The analysis assu mes that all fin e particles, reg ardless of their ch emical composition, are eq ually po tent in causing premature m ortality. This is an important assumption because fine particles from powe r plant emissions are chemically different from those directly emitted from both mobile sources and other industrial facilities. Howev er, no clear scien tific grounds exist at th is time for su pporting differen tial toxicity esti mates by particle typ e. The analysis assum es that the conce ntration-re sponse function for fine particles is ap proximately linear within the range of outdoor concent rations under policy consideration . Thus, th e analysis estim ates health bene fits from reducing fine particles in both attainment and non-attainment regions. 4. The analysis assum es that we have the a bility to accurately foreca st future emissions and associated air quality m odeling. 5. The analysis assu mes that the valuation of the estim ated reduction in mortality risk is ap propriately represen ted by studies of the trad eoff asso ciated with wag e premiums for workers facing fatality risk s in the labo r market. Further information on these benefits estim ates can com parisons or aggregation to be m eaningful, benefit and cost estim ates should correctly account for all substantial effects of regulatory act ions, not all of which m ay be reflected in the available estim ates. OMB ha s not m ade any changes to agency m onetized estim ates other than converting them to annual equivalents. Any com parison or aggregation across rules should also consider a number of fac tors that our pres entation does not address. To the extent that agencies ha ve adopted different m ethodologi es \u2014for example, different monetized values for effects, different baselines in term s of t he regulations and controls already in place, different treatments of uncertainty\u2014these differences rem ain embedded in Table 2. While we have relied in m any instances on agen cy practices in m onetiz ing costs and benefits, our citation of, or reliance on, agency data in this report should not be taken as an OMB endorsem ent of all the varied m ethodologies used to derive benefits and cost estim ates. Many of these m ajor rules have im portant non-quantified benefits and costs. These qualitative issues are dis cussed in th e agency ru lemaking docum ents, in previous versions of this report, and in Table 4 of this report.

Estimates of Benefits and Co sts of This Year's \"Major\" Rules In this sec tion, we exam ine in detail the be nefits and costs of each \"m ajor\" rule, as required by section 624(a) (1) (C). Our review covers those final re gulations on which OMB concluded review during the 12-m onth period October 1, 2001 through Septem ber 30, 2002. 9 The statutory language that cate gorizes the rules we consider for this report differs from the definition of \"econom ically si gnificant\" in E xecutiv e Order 12866 (section 3(f)(1)). It also differs from similar statutory definitions in th e Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and subtitle E of the Sm all Business Regulatory Enforcem ent Fairness Act of 1996\u2014Congressional R eview of Agency Rulem aking. Given defi nitions, we in terpreted section 624(a)(1)(C) broadly to include all final rule s promulgated by an Executive bran ch agency that m eet any one of the following three m easures: rules design ated as \"eco Order 12866; rules designated as \"m ajor\" under 5 U.S. C. ' 804(2) (Congressional Review Act); and rules design ated as m eeting the thres hold under Title II of th e Unfunded Mandates Refor m Act (2 U.S.C. ' 1531 - 1538) Of the 31 rules received by OMB, USDA subm itted f our; th e Veterans A dministration, DOE, EPA, OMB, the Social Security Ad ministration, and S BA each subm the 31 econom ically significant rules revi ewed by OMB, six are regulations requiring substantia l addition al private expend itures an d/or providing n ew social ben efits. Table 4 summarizes the cos ts and benefits of these ru les and provides other inform ation taken from rule pream bles and agency RIAs. Of the six re gulations received by OMB, EPA and DOE each subm itted one, and DOI and DOT each subm itted two. Agency estim ates and discus sion are presented in a variety of ways, ranging from a mostly qualitative discussion (e.g., the NHTSA light truck corporate average fuel econom y (CAFE) standard) to a m ore com plete benefit-cost analys is (e.g ., DOE's centra l air con dition er rule). 1. Benefits Analysis. Agencies monetized at least som e benefit estim ates for five of the six rules. In the case of EPA's recreational engines ru le, the agency provides som e monetized benefit estim ates, but discusses other benefits qualitatively. In one case\u2014NHTSA' s tire pressure m onitoring system s (TPMS) rule\u2014the agency did not m onetize all of the quantified benefits . In another case\u2014 NHTSA's CAFE rule\u2014the agency did not report any quantified or m onetized benefit estim ates. 2. Cost Analysis. For three of the six rule s, agencies provided m onetized cost estim ates. These include DOE's air rule, and EPA's recr eationa l vehic le rule. For the remaining three rules (both DOI m igratory bi rd hunting rules and NHTSA's CAFE rule), agencies did not estim ate costs. 10 3. Net Monetized Benefits. Three of the six rules provided at least som e monetized estimates of both benefits and costs.10 Of these, the estim ated m onetized b enefits of both the DOE air condition er rule and the EPA recreational eng ine rule ex ceed the es timated monetized costs. The m agnitude of the net benefits varies from $75 m illion per year for the air cond itioner rule to as much as $4.6 billion per year for the recreational engine rule. One rule, NHTSA's TPMS rule, has negative net monetized b enefits approxim ately $ 706 to $862 m illion per year. 4. Rules W ithout Quantified Effects. One rule, NHTSA's CAF\u00c9 rule, is classified as econom icially significant even though the agency did not provide any quantif ied estim ates of its effects . 10 See Ta ble 4 for the discussion of benefits and costs that the age ncy did not monetize. 11 Table 4.

We reviewed the inf ormation on the costs and benefits of m ajor rules contained in GAO reports for the period of October 1, 2001 to Septem ber 30, 2002. GAO reported that three independe nt agencies issued eight majo r rules during th is period. Two agencies did not conduct benefi t-cost analyses. One agency considered benefits and costs of its rules. OMB lists the agencies and the type of infor mation provided by them (as summarized by GAO) in Table 6. The Securities and Exchange Co mmission consistently consider ed benefits and c osts in their rulem aking processes while the prep are ben efit-cos t analyses. In com parison to the agencies subject to E.O. 12866, the independent agencies provided relatively little quan titative inf ormation on the co sts and benefits of the ma jor rules. As Table 6 indicates, three of the eight rules included som e discussion of benefits and costs. Three of the eight regulations had m onetized cost inform ation; one regulation m onetized benefits. OMB does not know whether the rigor and the extent of th e analyses conducted by the independent agencies 15 are sim ilar to those of th e analys es perform ed by agencies su bject to the Executive O rder because OM B does not review rule s from independent agencies.

Response to Public Comments Many comments on the draft report pertained to Chapter I, w hich presented estim ates of costs and benefits of m ajor rules. In gene ral, thes e comm ents addressed either (1 ) the scope/cov erage of the ru les cons idered in the report, or (2) the quality of agency or O MB analysis. 16 Comments on Scope/Coverage One comm enter (12) stated that the repor t should provide m ore inform ation\u2014even if only gross estim ates\u2014on the effects of Federal re gulation on States and municipalities. OMB notes that this report includes the annual report to Congr ess on Unfunded Mandates on State, local, and tribal entities. Inform ation on rule s reviewed by OMB that im pose such m andates is included. One comm enter (284) urged OMB to provide inform ation on the benefits and costs of regulations issued by independent agencies. OMB agrees th at it is im portant to a ssess the benefits and costs of independent agency re gulatory actions. Current ly, OMB relies on GAO reports as the prim ary data source to do so. A simple analysis of the GAO reports, however, m ay not be adequate in all cases. OMB encourages independent agencies to conduct benefit-cost analyses that conform to the OMB' s guidelines for regulatory analysis and to subm it those analyses of m ajor rules to OMB. Two comm enters (307, 327) r ecommended that the report should include estim ates of the benefits and costs of regulations issued prior to 1992. OMB does not believe that the estim ates of the costs and benefits of regulat ions issued over ten years ago are very reliable or very useful for infor ming curren t policy decision s. In futu re annual reports, OMB will report a rolling to tal of the benefits and costs of rule s for the previous 10 years. One comm enter (327) believed the report should include b enefit and cos t estim ates for non-m sig nificant) rules accoun t for the vast majority of the total costs of Federal regulation, even t hough most Federal rules are not considered m ajor. One comm enter (251 ) asserted that the draft report inappropriately excluded deregulatory actions. OMB notes that the final report includ es all final rules reviewed by OMB over a ten- year period from October 1, 1992 to Septem ber 30, 2002 that m et two conditions : each rule generated co sts or ben efits of at least $100 m illion annually, and a s ubstantial portion of its costs and benefits were quantified and m onetized by the ag ency or OMB. All regulations that fit these conditions are included in the final repor t, even if they are deregulatory. Several comm enters (3, 251, 307, 352) recomm ended that O MB should provide a better accounting of transfer rules. OMB believes there is merit to this request and is considering the feasibility of providing such inform ation in future reports. One comm enter (251 ) stated th at the draft report inappropriately excludes certain ru les with la rge n et benef its. Specif ically , this commenter ission rules, OSHA's ergonom ics rule, FDA's regulation of tobacco, and EPA's revised national ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate m atter. In this report and in previous reports, OMB has provided a reasoned explanation for the exclusion of certain ru les. With respect to the th ree emission rules (the 1995 m unicipal waste com bustors rule, the 1997 em ission standards for new locom otives, and the 1998 em ission standards for non-road diesel engines) included previously 17 (see Tables 5 and 6 of the 2002 report), OMB deci ded not to include their monetized estim ates because of the significant uncertain ties asso ciated w ith benefits transfer d escrib ed in more detail elsewhere in this report. OMB did not in clude OSHA's ergonom ics rule b ecause it was overturned by Congress. OMB di d not include F DA's tobacco rule because it was overturned by the Suprem e Court. As noted in last year's report, OMB removed EPA's NAAQS for ozone and particulate m atter to prevent double counting of benefits and costs. Comments on Quality o f Analysis Two comm enters (307, 331) que stioned estim ates of the benefits and costs of several rules, and recommended that OMB rely on an indepe ndent analysis of the benefits and costs of regulations, rather than rely on agency estim ates. OMB recognizes the importance of objective, expert analysis of regulatory im pacts, and ha s several m echanism s in place to im prove and ensure the quality of agency analysis. For example, through the i ssuance of guidelines, OMB aims to im prove the quality of information and analysis that supports ru lemaking. In conjunction with the Co uncil on Eco nomic Advisors, OMB recently rev ised its gu idelines and sub jected the revised guidelines to interagency review, peer review, and public comm ent. As a result of this process, OMB has issued its guidelines as Ci rcular A-4, Regulatory An alysis. Appendix D contains this Circular, and Appendix E presen ts OMB's response to public comments on the revised guidelines. Through the rule review process, OM B identifies and, where warranted, seeks improve ment of agency analysis of regulatory im pacts. To ensure consis tency in the context of this annual report, OMB adjusts Agency esti mates of costs and benefits. Although such procedural steps do not ensure accuracy, they do improve the quality of the analysis supporting rulem aking, while leveraging the data and expert ise of the agency issuing the rule. Two comm enters raised issues about the accur acy of pre-regu lation estim ates of costs and benefits. Commenter 327 stated that the re port should accoun t for outcomes known to differ from the agency's original estim ates. Commenter 335 recom mended the cos ts of environm ental com pliance and com pare th em with actual costs. OMB agrees that it is useful to com pare actual with p redicted estimates. In situ ations wher e OMB becom es aware of information m ore reliable tha n the agency 's orig inal estimates, OMB will use such information. Think tanks a nd universities m ay be in the best position to undertake this kind of exercise, and OMB encourages s uch efforts. One comm enter (328 ) suggested that the report should acknowledge the uncertainty inherent in benefit and cost estim ates and should quantify uncertainty in future years' summary reports. OMB notes that the repor t contain s substantial d iscussion of key uncertainties and will attem pt to q uantif y thes e uncer tainties in f uture reports in tho se cases where sufficient data are available. In addition, OMB's re vised regulatory analysis guidel ines (C ircular A-4) includes a recomm endation for agencies to undertake form al probability analys is for rules involving threshold annual costs or benef its greater than $1 billion. One comm enter (352) noted that interagency differences i n regul atory analysis m ethods make it diffi cult to com pare results b etween agen cies. This comm enter believes that the revised 18 guidelines should help in this re gard, and suggests that OMB coul d standardize the results across agencies using common m ethods and values. OMB believes the best way to address this issue will be throu gh its r evised guidelines (i.e., Ci rcula r A-4, Regulatory Analy sis), which a re designed to prom ote consistent analy tical appro aches. One comm enter (251 ) asked that OM B clarif y the reasons for the differences between estim ates of annual benefits and costs presented in Tables 7 and 8 and the corresponding original agency estim ates for the sam e rules in Tables 4, 9, 10, and 11. In this final report, w e clarified the nature of the differences be tween the two se ts of estim ates. The estim ates presented in Tables 4, 9, 10, and 11 reflect what agencies reported in their Regulatory Impact Analyses. These estimates are not consistent in several resp ects. For ex ample, som e agencies reported discounted present values over several years, wher eas others reported averag e annual effects. As explained in the text and on a rule-by-rule basis in the tables, in order to improve comparability, OMB m ade three types of adjustm ents. (1) All values were adjusted to year 2001 dollars. (2) Quantified but non-m onetized estim ates were m onetized (consistent with agency past practices). (This explains why, for exam ple, the m onetized be nefits for the acid rain rule in Table 7 are larger than those in Table 9.) (3) Estim ates of net present value were amortized or \"annualized\" (i.e., converted to average annual e ffects) to provide an annualized st ream of benefits and costs. One comm enter (346) suggested that OM B reevaluate the m ethodology underlying, and the application of, the adjustm ent to the value of a statis tical life for the age of the affected population. OMB has revised the estim ates in this chapter to be consis tent with the OIRA Adm inistrator's May 30, 2003 m emorandum to th e President's Managem ent Council. (A copy can be found on the OMB web site: http://www.whiteh ouse.gov/omb/inforeg/pmc_benefit_cost_memo.pdf One comm enter (319) recommended that OMB use a value of $120,000 per barrel as an estim ate of the social cos t of a spilled barrel of oil. OMB has asked the C oast Guard to review this r ecommendation an d will add ress this issue in next ye ar's repor t. One comm enter (3) suggested insertion of language regarding the im portance of the quantification of benefits and costs to help inform the public and decision m akers. OMB has included such language in the final report. One comm enter (12 ) suggested that the repor t should provide a case study of a well-done benefit-co st analys is of a regul ation. OMB will consider includi ng such a case study in its nex t annual report. One comm enter (20 ) stated that the repor t should note the wide range of benefits estim ates for EPA's Offi ce of W ater regulations (Tab le 3). According to this comm enter, it is possible that the actual costs of com pliance are on the high end of the range presented and the corresponding benefits are on th e low end, which would result in negative net benef its. OMB has noted this possibility in the report. One comm enter (284 ) recommended that the final report include summ ary inform ation on OMB's regulatory oversight ac tivities, such as return and prom pt letters. (284) OMB concurs with this comment, and has provided such inform ation in Appendix G to this report. 19 OMB receiv ed a comm ent from the Nuclear Reg ulato ry Comm ission. The comm enter believ ed 6 an d the accom panying dis cussion could lead to the erroneous co nclusion that the Nuclear Regu latory Co mmission (NRC) does not provide benefit and cost inform ation on its rules. OMB does not believe that Tabl e 6, or the accompanying discussion, states or implies that the NRC does not ana lyze its health and saf ety rules. 20 CHAPTE R II: STAT US RE PORT ON SPE CIFIC RE GULATORY REFORMS In last year's report, OMB responded to th e Regulatory Right-to-K now Act's requirem ent that we include recommendations for regulatory reform . We began the process of developing reform recommendations by requesting public nom inations of regulatory refor ms in the March 2002 draft report. OMB encouraged the public to consider problem atic paperwork and guidance docum ent requirem ents, along with regulatory requirem ents. In order to encourage broad public participa tion and to expand on the response received in 2001, OMB conducted outreach activities to a wi de variety of groups. As a result, OMB received approxim ately 1,700 public comments no minating specific regulations and guidance docum ents for reform . OMB conducted a prelim inary review of the public comm ents and identified 267 rules and 49 guidance docum ents nom inated for reform by one or m ore commenters for a grand total of 316 distinct reform nom inations.11 This chapter provides an overview of how OM B worked with agencies to review th e public nom inations and describes the follow-up activit ies that are now underway in th e agencies. A. Process fo r Review ing Reform Nominations In our review of the 316 nominations, OMB found that th e rules and gu idance docu ments fell into three catego ries: (1) issues already subject to recent o r curren t review by Cabinet agencies (an d EPA); (2) issues con cerning ind ependent agencies; and (3) issues that warranted consideration by Cabinet agencies (and EPA) as reform candidates. This review was based on inform ation available to OMB at the tim e the public nom inations were processed (summer 2002). A chief purpose of the refor m process was to focus agency attention on issues that are not already under active review. OMB found that 92 rules and 12 guidance d ocum ents had recen tly been issued or were already under agency re view. This category included som e of the nominations designated by OMB in the 2001 repo rt as \"high priority review\" candidates.12 Decisions about these issues had been m ade, or we re in the process of being m ade. OMB did not believe it w ould be fruitful to ask agencies to consider these rules and guidance docum ents to be new reform candidates. Accordingly, we sim ply asked that agencies provide OMB with status updates on the rules and guidance docum ents in this category. The second category included 49 rules and 2 guidance docum ents that raised issues concerning the following independent agen cies: the Equal E mploym the Federal Regulatory Comm ission, the Federal Reserve Board, the Fede ral T rade C ommission, and the Securities and Exchange Comm ission. In a m emorandum dated January 22, 2003, OMB requested that these 11 The public comments sug gesting ca ndidates for C provides updates on the 23 high-priority regulations t hat OIRA suggested for reform in 2001. 21 agencies consider the public nom inations for w hich they were responsible and, for those they consider to be possible candidates for refo rm, place their ev aluations on their websites. The rem aining 126 rules and 35 guidance documents m ade up a third category of nominations that OMB referred to agencies for th eir ev aluatio n as possib le reform s.13 During the developm ent of this final report, OMB determ ined that four of these rules and one guidance docum ent should not hav e been referred to agencies because they were already under active consideration. In Tables 15 and 16, status updates on these four rules and one guidance docum ent are provided along with th e other rules and guidance docum ents that, at the tim e we issued the 2002 final report, had recently been issued or were alrea dy under agency review.14 OMB's decision to refer public nom inations to agencies for th eir cons ideration m arked a shift in the approach we adopted in 2001. In the 2001 repor t, OMB \"ranked\" the public recomm endations for refor m and identified a number of \"high priority review\" candidates. Last year, we decided to change our approach and us e an agency-initiated p rocess to evaluate the nominations. We did this for two reasons: (1) the large volume of nom inations (316 in 2002 compared to 71 in 2001) strained OMB's ability to develop an inform ed list of priority nominations for consideration by agencies and (2 ) giving agencies the task of evaluating the nominations allowed them to bring to bear th eir extens ive kn owle dge and resources and encouraged them to develop a sense of ownership about reform . OMB worked with agencies to identi fy reform opportunities during our inter- agency consultation pro cess. OMB also as ked S BA's Office of Advocacy (Advocacy) to review all of the public nom inations and identi fy for agencies those that it thought offered the poten tial to reduc e unjustif ied re gulatory burdens on sm all businesses.15 In response to OMB's request, th e Office of Advocacy rev iewed the rules and guidan ce docum ents listed on Tables 13 and 14 of OMB' s FY 2002 re port, as well as the rules and guidance docum ents concerning selected independent agencies. While acknowledging that reform of many, if not all, of the regulations and guidance docum ents would achieve benefits for small business, Advocacy identified a subset of 21 rules, 6 guidance docum ents, and 3 rules and guidance docum ents of independent ag encies as hig h priorities for reform for small busine ss.16 Advocac y made its d etermination the comm ents subm itted to 13The regulations and guidance do cuments that OMB referred to age ncies a re listed in Ta bles 13 a nd 14, respectiv ely, of the 200 2 Fin al Rep ort (pp. 78 and 82) . 14 The four rule nominations are Use of th e OASIS for Home Health Agencies ( #35), Electr onic Stor age I-140 and I -485 (#7 3), and Mo tor Vehicle Emissio n Stan dards for Green house Gases (# 180). The o ne gui dance doc ument nomination is HH S Discrimination against Pers ons with LEP (#7). 15 The Small Business Adm inistration' s Office of Advocacy (Advocacy) funded rese arch to addres s the proportion of the Federal regu latory bu rden fallin g on small business. The resea rch was conducted by Drs. Mark C rain a nd Thomas Hop kins in 2001. The resea rchers concluded that considering all federal regulations and all business sectors, federal regulations cost firms with fewer than 20 employees nearl y $7,000 per employee per y ear. Regulations cost medium-size firms abo ut $4,300 and large firms $4, 500 per year per employee. C osts per employee thus appear to be 55 to 60 percent higher in small firms than in medium-size and large firms. See C rain, MW and Hopkins, TD (2001), The Impact of Regulat ory Costs on Small Firms , Office of Advocac y, U.S. Sm all Business Adm inistration. Advocacy is currently com mitted to upda ting these figures in 2004. 16 Advocacy's February 6 letter to OIRA is available on the Office of Advocacy's we http://www.sb a.gov/advo/laws/co mmen ts/omb03_0206.html. Certain hi gh-pri ority re forms identified by Advocacy 22 OMB, input received fro m small businesses in p reparing Advo cacy's May 28, 2002, comment17 on OMB's Advocacy's direct invo lvement in agency rulem aking affecting small business.18 In consultation with O MB, Advocacy sent letters directly to each agency and followed up to offer its exp ertise and assis tance with th eir review of th e regulation s and guidan ce docum ents identified by Advocacy as high priorities for reform for sm all business. B. Agency Categoriz ation of Reform Nomination s As explained in the 2002 final report, OMB s ought to ensure that the agency review of nominations was objective, consistent, and grounde d in the regulatory principles codified in Executive O rder 12866 and the statutor y authority of the agencies. To help guide agency review of the public nom inations, OMB suggested that agencies rely on three criteria: efficiency, fairness, and practicality. We defined these criteria as follows: Efficiency. Agencies should give consideration to reform s that presen t an opportunity to increase reg ulato ry efficiency by m aximizing net benef its, in cluding po tential quantitative and qualitative im provem ents to the econom y, environm ent, and public health and safety. Fairness. In addition to assessing overall costs and benefits, agencies should take into consideration nom inations w ith the potential to increas e fairness through desirable distributive impacts and process considerations. Practica lity. Agencies should give greater weight to nom inations that (1) they have discretion to im plement unde r existing statutory author ity (although potential reforms should not b e elim inated simply because im plementing th em would require new statutory authority) and (2) are judged to be important relative to other regulations and program s under consideration for review. OMB is sensi tive to the practicali ties (including agency resources) of pursuing certain nom inations at th is time. OMB understood that agency assessm ents of re form nom inations would necessarily take into account budgetary considerations, statutory m andates, and other relevant factors. OMB also does not exp ect agen cies to necess arily agree with the analysis or solutions presented b y commenters, even for those nom inations th ey identified as reform candidates. For the 126 rules and 35 guidance docum ents that OMB viewed as potential reform candidates\u2014and that we explicitl y referred to agencies for th eir consideration\u2014we requested that ag encies place them into one of three categories: are not identified in this final report. Specifically, three guidance documents from indep endent agencies are not identified. 17 Advocacy's letter is available on the Office of Advocacy's website at http://www.sb a.gov/advo/laws/co mmen ts/omb03_0604.html 18The Office of Advocacy of the U.S. Small Business Adm inistration (SBA) was create d in 1976 to re present t he views and interests of sm all business in Fed eral po licy m aking activ ities. Pub. L. as amended at 15 U.S.C . \u00a7\u00a7634a-g, 637). Because the Office of Advoc acy is an i ndepende nt office within SBA, the views of the Chief C ounsel do not necessarily represen t the views of the SBA or the Administration. 23 (1) the nom inated regulation or guidance docum ent is a v iable reform candidate that th e agency is, o r soon will b e, working o n; (2) the nom inated regulation or guidance doc ument warrants further study as a possible reform candidate; or (3) the nom inated regulation or guidance docum ent is either a low priority given other agency activ ities or is co nsidered to be resolved. After review ing the public nom inations and consulting with OMB and with the Office of Advocacy, agencies identified 34 ru les and 11 guidance documents as \"new\" reform candidates. Thes e were rules and guidance docum ents that had not been the focus of recent or curren t agen cy reform efforts. They included 8 rules and 2 g uidance docum ents identified by Advocacy as high prio rities for reform for sm all business. These 8 rules and 2 guidance d ocum ents\u2014as well as th e other Adv ocacy high p riorities\u2014will be noted in the tables that appear throughout this chapter. Agenci es are undecided about pursuing reform s of another 26 regulations and 4 guidance docum ents, but they plan to study them further to determ ine whether or not they should be reform ed. The rem aining 62 rules and 19 guidance docum ents were considered by agen cies to address issues that were unnecessary or were lower priority, given the other competing dem ands on their resources. Table 7 prov ides an ag ency-by-ag ency summary of how agencies catego rized the regulations that OMB referred to them for their review. Collectively, agencies decided to take action on 34 of the rule n ominations that OMB e xplic itly ref erred to them , with DOT identif ying ten and EPA identifying eight rules to reform . Table 7.

New Reforms Planned or Under way When OMB asked agencies to tell us whic h regulations and guidance docum ents they believed were prom ising reform candidates, we re quested that they provide us with inform ation about their plans to pursue nom inations within th e next year. When possible, agencies told us which actions they had planned (e.g., advanced notice of proposed rulem aking, or A NPRM) and when they expected to take them . The inform ation that agencies gave OMB about the expected next steps for new reform s planned or underway is provided in Tables 9 and 10. Summ ary inform ation about these regulations and guidance docum ents, as well as a listing of commenters and the issues they raised, is available in a docum ent that OMB i ssued with the 2002 final report: \"Summ aries of Public Suggestions for R eform of Regulations and Guidance Docum ents.\"19 19This document is av ailab le on th e OMB website at www.wh itehouse.gov /omb/inforeg/summaries_nominations_final.pd f. 25 Table 9.

SBAThis nom ination was i dentified by SBA's Office of Advocacy as a high priority. Since OMB's guidance to agencies did not requi re that they agree with th e analys is or solution s presented by c ommenters, the spec ific reform s that agencies implem ent m ay or m ay not be consistent with the recomm endations m ade by the public. This outcom e is based, in part, on the f act that som e rules and guida nce docum ents were no minated f or ref orm by multip le commenters who advocated opposing views and solutions. It also reflects the em phasis OMB placed on th e ability of agencies to d ecide whic h issues m erited priority and what typ es of reform s wer e most appropriate. With respect to the im plem entation of regulatory ref orms, of course, agencies will continue to involve the public through the for mal notice and com ment rulem aking process. D. Reforms That Agencies Have Not Yet Decided to Pursue As agencies reviewed th e public no minations of rules and guidance docum ents that OMB referred to them , there were m any cases in whic h they could not m ake a final determination about whether or not to pursue a reform . Frequently, agencies were undecided sim ply because they did not have sufficient inform ation to accept or reject a specific nom ination. In these cases, we asked that agencies conduct further research into the issues raised by comm enters so that they could decide if the nom inated regulation or gu idance docum ent merited refor m. To the extent possible, agencies provided OMB w ith th eir spe cific plan s over the n ext year f or inve stiga ting the viab ility of these possible reforms. Tables 11 and 12 list the rules and gu idance docu ments, respectively, that agencies will be exam ining. They also indicate w hat specific next steps are planned. 30 Table 11.

The def ault action in face of uncertainty is not necessarily inaction. On the contrary, decision m akers rely on various science- based precautionary approaches in assessing risks and taking prot ective regulatory actions. There is growing international discussion on the appropriate regulatory responses to emerging risks where the likelihood and m agnitude of harm are highly uncertain, and the costs to prevent o r mitig ate these effects are p otentially very high. The purpose of this ch apter is to describ e the curren t role precautio n in regu latory decis ion m aking in the United States while explain ing why precaution needs to be exerci sed wisely on a case-by -case basis. This chapter has been prepared by an interagency work group co-chaired by the Council on Environ mental Quality (CEQ) a nd the Of fice of Manage ment and Budget (OMB) . The W ork Group includes representatives from the Depa rtment of Agriculture, the D epartm ent of Comm erce, the Department of Energy, the Departm ent of He alth and Hum an Services, the Departm ent of the Interior, the Environm ental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. This chapter dr aws on public comments elicited by the OMB in the draf t report re leased in February of this year. This chapter does not define new policy; it 20describ es existing U.S. p ractices for both dom estic and inte rnational read ers. A. Risk Mana gement in the United States In the United States em erging risks are m anaged through a combined system of social, econom ic, legal, and reg ulato ry mechanism s. When assessin g the overall extent of precaution in U.S. risk m anagem ent, it is im portant to consid er the cum ulative im pact of these m echanism s. All other factors being e qual, the public prefers products, technologies, production facilities, and waste-disposal m ethods that do not pose unr easonable risks to hum an he alth, safety, and the environm ent. This consum er demand for responsible behavior by firm s, though limited by th e availability of infor mation, exerts influence in com petitive m arkets because firm s seek to build a reputation for safety and consum ers/shareholders and courts can penalize firm s that do not take seriously the need f or responsible risk m anagem ent. In order to provide m ore discipline to market approaches to risk m anagem ent, a variet y of private - often non-profit - bodies have established voluntary st andards for risk m anagem ent that are built on principles of balance, openness, consensus, and due process. For exam ple, the National Electrical C ode is a 20 In the draft report published in February of 2003, OMB requested comments on current U.S. approaches to analysis and managem ent of e merging risks. Speci fically we aske d for comme nts on ways in whic h \"precaution\" is embedde in proce dures through \"conservative\" as sumptions i n estimation of risk, or through explicit \"protective\" measures i n managem ent decisions. We al so sought examples of approaches in human and ecol ogical risk assessm ent and managem ent methods at U.S. regulatory agenci es which appea r unbalanced, and how t he U.S. i ntegrates preca utiona ry approach es to health, safety an d env ironmental risk s with other interests su ch as econom ic growt h and technological in novation. We rece ived numerous com ments on t his topic from a variety of consum er advocacy groups , academ ics, a nd the private s ector. Copies of these comments are a vailable on the OMB website at www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg/regpol-reports_congress.html. 51 voluntary standard to reduce fire and other hazards developed by the private, non-profit National Fire Protection Association th at is th e basis for p rocurem ent specification s set by m ajor manufacturers as well as som e State and local building code requirem ents.21 Similarly, social norm s curb individual actions that impose risks to othe rs such as sm oking in public and driving under the influence of alcohol. There are a dvocacy groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving that have launched succe ssful public education cam paigns to change attitudes about risky behaviors.22 Managing risks entails costs and thus there are lim its on the am ount of ri sk prevention that f irms and individu als will voluntarily prac tice. When the action s of one f irm pose risks and costs on other firm s, the public or the natural envir onment that are not reflecte d in a firm' s cost of doing business, m arket dem and alone does not lead to a so cially efficien t level of risk manage ment. Legal strategies m ay be necessary to supplem ent m arket approaches to risk m anagem ent. For exam ple, a distinctiv e feature of the U.S. risk m anage ment system is the com plex and powerf ul system of liability law tha t allows c itizens who have incurr ed da mages or m ay incur damages to seek m onetary com pensation in the c ourts from responsible firm s or individuals. The United States also h as an extensive regul atory system of risk protection with powers shared to various degrees betw een the Federal, State, and lo cal governm ents. The Federal regulatory system is built around a system of de legated rulem aking; Congress passes laws and the Federal regulato ry agencies issue regula tions that im plem ent the m andates en acted by Congress. A variety of checks and balances in the rulem aking process aim s to ensure that decision m akers adequately protect the pub lic from risks in a sensible way. Congress not only writes the laws that govern the decisions of re gulatory agencies; once laws are passed, Congress retains important power s of oversight such as the appropriation of executive agency funding and confirm ation of ke y appointees. The President appoints the heads of regulatory agencies and oversees and coordi nates regulatory activi ties (through the OMB and other executive offices), as well as issues spec ific policy direction to Federal agencies through Executive O rders. Regulatory agencies are required to follow the notice-and-comment rulem aking procedures prescribed in the Adm inistrative Pr ocedures Act (APA) and re lated laws designed to encourage a transparent and incl usive process. The APA requires agencies to publish in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulem aking that re ferences the legal authority under which the rule is proposed and a descri ption of the subjects and issues to be addressed by the proposed rule. The A PA also instructs agencies to pr ovide the public with an opportunity to subm it comments on the proposed rulem aking, and the fina l rulem aking m ust address all significant comments. Finally, if affected par ties believe a F ederal regu latory agency has m ade an unlawful decision due to procedural and/or substantive erro r, they m ay seek a review of the decision in a 21 Nation al Research Cou ncil (1995), Standards, Conformity Assess ment , and Trade: Into the 21st Century, Natio nal Academ y Pres s, Washi ngton, DC. 22 Institute of M edicine (1998), Reducing t he Burden of Injury: Advancing Prevention and Treat ment, Natio nal Academ y Pres s, Washi ngton, DC. 52 disciplined process of judicial review under the APA. Furtherm ore, under the Inform ation Quality Act, agencie s must issu e information quality guide lines \"ensu ring and m aximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information (inc luding sta tistical information) dissem inated by the agency,\" and stakeholders can seek and obtain correction of inform ation maintained or dissem inated by the agency th at does not com ply with the guidelines.23 In addition, Federal regulatory agenci es may voluntarily subject thei r analyses and decisions to various form al and inform al mechanism s of sta keholder dialogue, external pe er review, scientific advisory panels, and reviews from independent bodies such as the Nation al Academ ies of Science. These m echanism s ensure extensiv e inp ut from the scientif ic co mmunity and stakeholders before and afte r the initiation of rulem aking. Thus, the Federal regulatory fram ework of the United States is designed to be a responsive, consultative, scienc e-based system , operating synergis tically within m ultiple layers of checks and balances involving so cial norm s, market forces, liability law, voluntary standards, and Federal, State and local regul ation with execu tive, legis lative, and judicial oversight. The operation of these forces determ ines the overall extent of precaution that is applied to a particular emerging risk. Below, we focus on the Fede ral regulatory system and the variety of precau tiona ry approache s that it us es to preven t, reduce, or m itigate em erging risk s to hum an health, safety, and the en vironm ent in the face of uncertain o utcom es. B. Risk Assessment before Risk Man agement Making a regulatory decision about an em erging risk is com plicated by the dynam ics of science; new discoveries at tim es have shown hazar ds to b e worse than expected, and in othe rs, predictions of doom never m aterialized or hazards were proven to be less onerous than projected (See Box 1 for exam ples). The National Research Council24 report Risk Assessment in the Federal Government , commonly referred to as the \"Red B ook\", described the key com ponents of risk assessm ent and em phasized an important feat ure of the U .S. regulatory process: decisions about how to respond to a potential hazard are inte nded to b e made after - and are in formed and guided by - a scientific risk a ssessm ent that is grounded in th e weight of the scientific evidence.25 Regulators have the resp onsibility of ensuring that an adequate am ount of tim e and resources are devoted to the risk ass essment proce ss. There are risks and costs as sociated with hasty decisions and there are risk s and costs incurred when regulat ors are guilty of \"paralysis by analysis.\" In circum stances where accelerated action in response to im minent threats is warranted, U.S. regulators generally have the authority to expedite th e process of regulatory decision m aking. 23 P.L. 1 06-554 \u00a7515 24 Nation al Research Cou ncil (1983), Risk Assessmen t in th e Fed Government: Ma naging ngton, DC. 25 Nation al Research Cou ncil, a p art of th e Nat ional Academies, is a private, nonprofit institution with a congression al charter to provide scien ce, tech nology and health policy adv ice to the Feder al gov ernment. 53 Box 1: Dynamics of Science Early predicti ons overstated risk: Malthus' Dismal The orem. In 1798, Rev erend Thomas Ro bert Malth us ob served that the population ten ded to increase exp onen tially He hypothesized that liv ards would not rise beyond s ubsist ence leve ls due to the consta nt pressures t he growi ng population would place on the food supply. Due in part to techn ological advancem ents that Malthus did not foresee , on the whole Malthus' dismal predictions did not come to pass with bo th po pulation and standard of liv ing greatly in creasin g over the past two centuries. Saccharin . In 1981, s accha rin was a dded to the list of c hemicals \"reasonably antic ipate d to be a human ca rcinoge n\" by the U.S. National Toxicology Program based on evidence of carci nogenicity in controlled experiments on rats. In 2000, however, it was rem oved from the list after an extensive review determined that the bladder tumors ob served in rats were ca used by a biological m echanism that is no t relev ant to hu mans, and observatio nal evidence in human showe d no carcinogenic effec Early predicti ons was first m arketed in Europ e in the late 1950' s as a se dative, and was considere d safe to be presc ribed for nausea a nd insomnia in pregnant wom en. By 1961, however, evidence bega n to mount that the drug caused severe birth defects in children whose m others had taken the drug in the first trimester of pregnancy. Fortunately, the Food and Drug Administration had not yet approved the drug for distribution in the United States. The drug was a pproved in the United States in 1998 for the treatm ent of complications ca used by leprosy, with stringent controls on the use of the drug to prevent exposure to the drug during pregnancy. Childho od Lea d Poisoning. Ancient R omans were aware that high e xposure to lead could cause ser ious h ealth problem s such as madness a nd death. Howe ver, the potent ial health hazards t o children such as im pairment of cognitive functions from chronic low-lev el exposure to the metal in the env ironment were no t documented until the 1940's. In the 1960's, blood lead level above 60 \u00b5g/dL was con sidered toxic. Over the last three decades, as new information ab out the relationship between the e ffects of lead on childre n's IQ em erged, the Centers for Disease Control progressiv ely lowered the reco mmended action level to the curre nt 10 \u00b5g/ dL. Due to regu latory effo rt since the 1970's, major uses of lead in house paint, gasoline, water-distribution systems, and food cans have been eliminated or greatly reduce d such that e nvironm ental lead contam ination are now dram atically lower. Data from the m ost recent National Healt h and Nutr ition Exam ination Survey sh ow that the percent age of U.S. chi ldren with elevated blood lead levels (> 10 \u00b5g/dL) has dropped from near ly 90 % in th e late 1 970's to less th an 5% in the early 1990's. The United States em ploys precau tionary appro aches throughout the p rocess of risk assessm ent and m anage ment so that the overall level of pr ecaution in a given regulatory decision is appropriate.26 The first phase is the data collection and other research efforts which are inputs in the risk assessm ent process. Next, the risk a ssessm ent phase synthesizes available inform ation on the likelihood of events and the potential co nsequences and should represent an objective characterization of risk. When analysts ass ess risks, they frequently use \"conservative\" or \"default\" ass umptions or explic itly ad d saf ety margins or unce rtainty f actors to cha racterize a \"plausible\" upper bound. In addition, analysts may be requir ed to add saf ety factors to be 26 See the FD A an d US DA document prepared for OECD Ad Hoc Group on Food Safety \"Precaution In U.S. Food Safet y Deci sionmaking: Annex II to the United States' National Food Sa fety Sy stem Paper\" for a s pecific discus sion on how precautio n is em bedded in th e U.S. food syste m.

The Food Quality Pro tection Act o f 1996 (FQPA) requires the EPA to c onsider add ing a ten-f old uncertainty factor, the \"Children' s 10X Safety Factor\", in assessing ch ildren' to es unless sou nd tific evidence in dicates tha t a dif ferent factor would be appropriate. These p ractices are intended to p rovide decision m akers with an indication of how bad things could be or m ight becom e without protective actions (see Box 2 and 3 for exam ples in chem ical risk asses sment). However, when estim ates of risk are derived through th ese bounding exercises, th ey m ay far exceed the m ost lik ely estim ate of risk. If these bounding estim ates sugg est th at the risk m ay be unacceptable under the go verning legal criteria, then a m ore com plete assessm ent of risk - in cluding a full analysis of th e data and uncertainties - may be necessary to help determ ine what decision m akers should do. Box 2: Chemical Risk Assessment: Threshold For the vast majority of chemicals that do not have sufficient data from human studies, margins of safet y are a pplied to animal data to derive a reference value. Suppose that a safe level of exposure needs t o be set for a chemical that has no human data but has been tested for toxicity in laboratory animals from chro nic exposure by an inhalation test using a standard test protocol at four concentrations: 0, 10, 500 and 1,000 parts per million (ppm) of air. If no adve rse health effect s are observed at 0 and 10 ppm, but animals were obs erved to suffer adve rse effects at 500 and 1,000 ppm, how should a safe level of exposure for humans be set? Assuming that humans are like anim als, the expe riment suggests that t he \"safe\" level of exposure may lie somewhere between 10 ppm - the \"no observed adverse effect level\" (NOAEL) - and 500 ppm - the \"lowest observed adve rse effect level\" (LOAEL). Historically, the NOAEL is divided by uncerta inty factors to account for the possibility th at hu mans are m ore sen sitive to the chem ical than the test animals (an imal to human extrapolation ), and the possibility th at some human sub-pop ulation s may be more sen sitive than others (human to sensitive human extrapolation ) to estab lish a reference c oncentration (RfC) or reference dose (RfD), the level o f lifetim e exposure without a n \"apprecia ble\" ris k of adverse effe cts.27 To estim ate the RfC, the NOAEL fr om the chronic study co uld be divided by a factor of up to 100 to account for the unce rtainties which would yield an estimate of 0.1 ppm or 100 parts per billion. Furthermore, if resu lts from multiple species and both genders of an imals are av ailab le, the species and gender wit h the most sen sitive respon se (i.e., th e lowest NOAEL) is used for estab lishin g the RfC , which adds another elem ent of precauti on. Each factor of 10 in t he margin of sa fety re quires risk m anage rs to achieve an additional 90% reduction in exposure to reach the desired le vel of protection ; therefo re a 100-fold safety facto r implies a 9 9% reduction in exp osure co mpared to th e larg est co ncentration th at did not harm the most sen sitive group of test a nimals. More recent as sessments use a Be nchm ark Dose (BMD) or Conc entration (BM C), a statistical lo wer co nfidence limit o n the dose that pro duces a predeterm ined c hange i n response rate of an adverse effect c ompared to bac kground, rathe r than the NOAEL tru \"no effect lev el\" is difficu lt to estab lish in toxicological studies. The BMD or BMC are then divided by safety factors. 27 Barne s DG and Dourson M (1988), \"Refe rence Dose (R fD) -Descriptio n and Use in Health Risk Assess ments,\" Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology, 8 (4 ), 471-486. 55 Box 3: Chemical Risk A ssessment: Non-threshold Consi der a hazard whose a dverse health e ffect declines i n freque ncy and s everity as dose declines yet a non-zero dose that produces \" no harm \" is not observable. A slight degree of toxicity coul d occur even at tiny doses, suggesting t hat only a zero dose woul d not vi olate the \" no har m\" stan dard. Yet zero dose may b e techn ically impossi ble to achieve given factors such as backg round exposure to the hazard, or may not be desirable since zer o dose may only be achieved through banning a particular beneficial activ ity. The size of the add itional risk that is considered negligible varies from one c ontext to another depending upon the number of people exposed to the hazard a nd other fact ors. Agencies s uch as EPA often define acce ptable l ifetim e cancer risk a s a range from one in ten-thousand (10-4) to on e in a millio n (10-6).28 When hu man data are no t availab le, EPA's guidelines for cancer ris k assessm ent produce an upp er bound estim ate of cancer potency through sev eral con servative assu mptions. Fo r exam ple, all tumors - not just malignant tumors - are used towards estimating a carci nogenic response, and rather than the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) - the best unbiased estimate of ca ncer potency - the 95% upper confidence limit o f the MLE is u sed. In addition, it m ay be necessary to move beyond single exposure pathway s or sing le chem ical ass essments and to explo re the accum ulation of risk. Progress is being m ade on aggregate exposure and cum ulative risk assessm ent. Aggregate exposure assessm ent involves the analysis of m ultiple pathways an d routes of exposure such as food, drinking water, am bient and indoor air for a sing le agent o r stressor. Cumulative risk looks at how multiple agents or stressors with a common m ode of action interact to pose risk to health or the environm ent. For exam ple, the FQPA requires the EPA to account for aggregate exposures through food as well as the cum ulative effects of pesticides in establishi ng tolerances for pesticide residue in foods and criteria for registration of pesticides. The last step is the risk m anage ment phase where potential regulatory or other manage ment options m ay be considered to determ ine the responses to the potential risk. The application of precautio n at th is stag e must be infor med by the best av ailable scientific and econom ic infor mation, organized and presented in clear, concise, and unbiased fashion. The analytic too ls such as ris k assessm ent, cost-effectiveness an alysis, and be nefit-cos t analysis are widely used in the United States to infor m decision m akers. Specific tools from the field of decision science, devised precisely f or the pur pose of aiding decision m akers faced with dilemm as involving uncertain consequences and difficult value tradeoffs, are of particular importance to the application of precaution to decision m aking.29 These tools help shed light on the com plex dilemm as that are posed by tec hnological and natural hazards of uncertain 28 Breyer SG (1993), Breaking t he Vicious Cir cle: Towar d Effective Risk Regul ation , Harvard Un iversity Press, Cam bridge , MA. 29 See Clem en, RT (1996), Making H ard Decisions, Dux bury Pr ess, Pacif ic Grove, CA ; Howard, RA (1968), \"Th e Foundations of Deci sion Analysis,\" IEEE Transactions Science and Cybernetics SSC-4 (3), 211-219; and Raif fa H (1 968), Analysis: Introductory Lect ures on Choices under Unce rtainty, Random House, New York, NY . 56 magnitude and can be used in conjunction with a variety of policy obj ectives from minimizing maximum dam age to m aximizing net benefits. However, although for mal analytic tools can be helpful, they cannot subs titute for res ponsible po licy judgm ents by decisio n makers who m ake decisions under specific statutor y fram eworks and are accountable to the public f or their actions. An important and difficult question f or deci sion m akers dealing with em erging risks is how to build an appropriate deg ree of precaution in to policies, recognizin g that the science is uncertain and m ay be changing rapidly. Here, th e ability to modif y policies as scien tific understanding grows is critical to the appropriate a pplication of precaution. The inform ation collection, risk assessm ent, and risk m anage ment phases are not static; the three components are an iterative process where m anage ment response s are a ltered to ref lect new inf ormation that becom es available. The m anagem ent approach ca n be adapted in response to im proved scientific inform ation that reduces uncertainty in risk as sessm ent (such as the m agnitude and likelihood of consequences) as well as uncertain ty in risk m anagem ent (such as effectiveness of interventions and pace of technolog ical advancem ents). C. Precaution ary Approaches for Objectiv es Estim ates from risk assessm ents are used to make regulatory decisions within several broad fram eworks that reflect the overall goal of the underlying statute. These fram eworks, in part, reflect the different charac teristics of risks that are im portant in developing appropriate manage ment strategies such as imm ediacy, unc ertainty, severity, poten 1989). The objectiv e of the \"ris k only\" framework is to ensure th at the risk from a hazard is kept within a \"safe\" level. In contrast, the obj ective of the \"f easibility \" fram ework explicitly recognizes the utility of the activ ity that generates the hazard, and requires the redu ction of risk to the extent that is technologi cally or econom ically feasible. The objective of th e \"benefit-cost balancing\" fram ework goes a step further in cons idering over all societal welf are and attem pts to weigh all of the positive conseque nces against all of the negative consequences of a regulatory measure. Decision m akers use one of these decision fr ameworks, or som e hybrid, as authorized by the legislative m andate to choose the appropriate regulatory action such as notification of the potential hazard, licens ing, standard setting, or permitting. In addition, a key issue fo r decis ion makers is to determ ine when ther e is insuf ficient infor mation for an informed decision such that further inform ation is necessary b efore proceedin g. Not unexpected ly, precaution has a sligh tly different role to play in each of thes e fram eworks. Risk Only Approach In som e cases, statutory requirem ents instruct U.S. regulatory agencies to look only at the possible risk in determ ining the course of action. For exam ple, in the Endangered Species Act (ESA) the d ecision to lis t threat ened or endangered species for special p rotection to p revent their 57 irrev ersible loss ed \"sol ely\" on a scien tific assessm ent of the danger of extinction.30 In the regulation of che micals, agencies m ay use cons ervative assu mptions to develop a worst case scenario or plausible upper bound of risk and reduce exposures until it is within a \"safe\" level (e.g., reasonable certainty of no harm from pesticide residue on foods).31 Feasibility Approach Even without establishing a \"safe\" leve l of exposure, decision m akers can take precau tionary m easures by requiring technology -based stand ards to reduce exposures to poten tial hazards to th e exten t feasible through the best available techno logy and pro mote the ad option and developm ent of cleaner technologies. For exam ple, the Clean Air Act Am endm ents of 1990 require the implem entation of m aximum achieva ble control technology (MACT) standards to reduce em issions of hazardous air pollutants.32 These stand ards are set for m ajor sources of emissions based on currently available contro l technology, that is, f easibility of reducing emissions guides decisions rather than a quantif ication of risks. Similarly, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is directed by statute to regulat e occupational exposure to toxic substances \"to the extent feasible\".33 Benefit-Cost Balancing Approach Presidential Executive O rder 12866, which govern s OMB review of agency rulem aking, refers exp licitly to the n et-benef it test and OMB' s analytic guidance prov ides som e direction on how analyses and decisions should be conducted unde r scientific uncertainty about benefits and costs.34 Unless required to do otherwise by law, U.S. regulatory agencies are directed by the executive order to perform bene fit-cost analysis of regulatory actions and \"select those approaches that m aximize net benefits (incl uding potential econom ic, environm ental, public health and safety, and other advantages ; distributive im pacts, and equity)\".35 Though outcom es are never known with certaint y, decision m akers can com pare the net benefits of regulatory options ba sed on best available estim ates of benefits, costs and potential cost savings, and choose the option that yields the highest societal gain. Net-benefit tests have been applied by U.S. regulatory agencies under \"unreasonable risk\" laws such as the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide , Rodenticide Act,36 Toxic Substances Control Act,37 and the Consum er Product Safety Act.38 Under these statutes, the level of precautio n is reflected in the forgone econom ic benefit from the chem ical or product and/or high cost of control from decisions to ban or lim it its use relativ e to the health benefits gained. 30 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1533(b)(1) Manag ement and Bu dget (1996), Economic Analysis of Federal Regulations under Exec 66 - Regu latory Plann ing Federal Register 38 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056 58 When estimates of risk are high ly uncertain, the net benefits of a rule m ay be positive in some cases and not in others. The expected ne t benefit test can be applied, following a for mal probabilis tic assessm ent of the hazard and potential efficacy of regulato ry interventio ns (see Box 4 for a num erical exam ple). When decisions are bas ed on the exp ected va lue of net benefits, the decision m aker is taking a so-called \"risk-neutral\" stance. When decisions are based on hedging against the possibility of an adverse outcom e even though a di fferent decision would lead to higher expected net benefits, the decision m aker is taking a pr ecautionary \"risk-avers e\" posture. A policy judgm ent is necessary when determ ining the m agnitude of a downside loss that justifies a departure from the \"risk- neutral\" posture. The expected net-benefit test and its varian ts are rela tively analytically in tensive because they require for mal probabilistic treatm ent of bot h benefits and costs. For regulations with econom ic effects that ex ceed m ore than $1 billio n per year, the new OMB guidelines for regulatory analysis require agenci es to support rulem akings with fo rmal probabilistic analysis of the key scientific and econom ic uncerta inties regarding costs and benefits.39 Box 4: Expected Net B enefits Test Suppose t hat the net be nefits of a propose d rule to protect public health through administe ring a vaccine (with unknown efficacy an d potentially sev ere side-effects) is m easured in fatalities p revented. (If b enefits and costs are expressed in different units, they need to be converted into the sam e units in order for this approach to be applied.) Now sup pose that, without vaccination, the disease will l ead to 3,000 fatalities for certain , whereas im plemen ting the vacci nation program will lead to either (a ) no fatalities (3,000 fatalitie s preve nted com pared to doing not hing) if the vacci ne is e fficacious a nd side-e ffects a re mini mal, or (b) 4,000 fatalitie s (1,000 additional fatalities com pared t o doing nothi ng) if the vacci ne is not ef fective and si de-effects are se vere. Does the rule pass the e xpecte d net-bene fit test? The answer d epends on the probability o f each outcome, and the risk posture of the decisio n maker. Under risk neutrality, as long a s the probability that the vaccine has m inimal side-effe cts (p) is greater th an one-fou rth, the expected net benefits of implementing the rule (incremental to doing nothing), in th is specific case, will b e positive: 3,000p -1,000(1-p) > 0 Under risk aversion, for a certain range of p greater th an one-fo urth, th e decisio n maker will p refer to no t implement the rule to avoi d the possi bility of doin g more ha rm than good (i.e ., administerin g a vacci ne that is not e ffective and has high side-effects), even if the expecte d net bene fit is greater. Hybrid Approaches 39 Office of Manag ement and Bu dget (2003), OMB Cir cular A-4, Regu latory Analysis. 59 There are also hybrid approaches that com bine, for exam ple, both a risk-only setting of regulatory goals, and technology- based enforceable standards. When \"safe\" tific and inclusion of m argins of s afety, but are not achievable given engineering limitations, tec hnology-based standards are som etimes set to estab lish enf orceab le protective m easures. In national dr inking water regulations, a m aximum contam inant level go al (MCLG) is set to a llow for an \"adequate m argin of safety,\" but the maximum perm issible level of a contam inant in water is based on best available technology to get as close to the MCL G as possible.40 There are also hybrid approaches that com bine both a risk-only setting of policy goals and benefit-cost balancing for sp ecific protective actions. In the protection of endangered species, the decision to list a species as endangered under E SA must be based sole ly on scien tific evidenc e related to th reats to the s urviva l of a species such as population dynam ics and habitat loss. In developing plans to protect list ed species, econom ic factors can be, or m ust be in som e cases, considered.41 Value of Information A pproach When faced with uncertainty, th e most cau tious approach m ay be to wait for m ore inform ation before takin g action, y et a \"wat chful waiting\" app roach is a decision with consequences in term s of delay in possible h ealth protection as well as savings from postponing regulatory costs. Value of infor mation (VOI) an alysis is an extension of the benefit-cost approach that evaluates the bene fit of collecting additional in formation to reduce o r elim inate uncertainty in a specific deci sion m aking context and represents the willingness to pay for additional infor mation.42 A recent Presidential/Congression al Comm ission ent and Risk Managem ent43 noted, \"when stakes in a decisi on are large and the uncertainties complex, risk m anagers or their technical staffs m ay find it useful to experim ent with for mal value-of-inform ation tools\". Unlike other analytic tools such as benefit- cost analysis and cost-effectiv eness analy sis, formal VOI has not yet been widely used in making risk m anagem ent decisions (see Box 5 for exam ples of VOI analyses from the peer reviewed literature). The lack of VOI applications in actual m anagement decisions can be partially attr ibuted to the potential ly resource intensive nature of the m ethod, complexities in m odeling the underlying probabilistic risk assessm ent, and the difficulties in developing probabilities for differe nt outcom es as well as the results of further research. While VOI analyses can be com plex, progress in com puter software to support 40 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 200g-1 41 \"The Secreta ry may exclude any area from critical h abitat if he determines that the benefits o f such exclusion outweigh the benefits of speci fying such area as part of the critical habi tat, unless he determines, base d on the best scien tific and commercial d ata av ailab le, that the failure to designate su ch area as critical h abitat will resu lt in the extinction of the U.S.C. \u00a7 1533(b)(2).

Given the analytical effort required to conduct VOI analyses, a full VOI analysis is not appropriate for all risk managem ent decisions. However, even w ithout formal analy sis, the VOI fram ework can provide helpful insights for dete rmining th e appropria te balance between taking action and waiting for more inform ation. Box 5: Examples of Value of Information Analyses for Environmental Regulation North and Merk hofer44 compared four altern ative strateg ies fo r con trolling pollution emissions from elect ric power plants with the objectiv e of m inimizin g total social co sts. They evaluated the value of simultaneously reso lving two uncertain ties in th e model: how a unit of em ission translates to ambient con centration and the total health cost p er unit increase in suspended sulfate concentration. Reichard and Evans45 considered the value of monitoring in making a remediation decision for groundwater that may be contaminated by arse nic. There were two unce rtainties in their m odel: the potency of arsen ic in causing cancer and t he expos ure to arsenic in t he water. They c ompared the value of improvi ng exposure information from three d ifferen t monitoring strateg ies. Taylor et al.46 assessed t he value of animal experi ments in determining the magnitude of cancer causi ng potential and improvi ng environmental cont rol decisions. The only source of uncertainty in the analysis was t he carcinogenic potency of a chemical. Hypothetical exam ples we re given based on plausible val ues from empirical evidence t o illustrate th e framework. Daki ns et al.47 evaluated the remediation of PCB-contaminated se diments in New Bedford Harbor, Massachusetts. The objectiv e was t o choose an optimal lev el of dredg ing that will m eet a health-b ased standard fo r PCB conce ntration in fish and minimize the rem ediation cost. The analysis included six sources of unce rtainty in determining the con centration in fish such as PCB con centratio n in th e sedi ment, average water tem peratu re, an d growth rate of flounder and estimates th e value of resolving all un certain ties. Dakins et al.48 expanded on the stud y by evaluating the value of various sampling strateg ies to measu re total PC B bo dy burden in flounder to inform the remediation de cision. Thompson a nd Evans49 eval uated the value of national exposure information about perchloroethylene (perc) used in dry cleaning. The analysis compared regul ating perc exposure at t hree differe nt levels of decisio n making: individual dry clean ing facilities, by particular dry clean ing m achine catego ry (defined by typ e and size), and by particular machine typ e. The objective was to choo se the pollution con trol option that max imizes n et social b enefits. The a nalysis c onsidered fourteen s ources of unce rtainty and evaluated the value of resolving these uncertain ties. 44 North DW and Merkh ofer MW (1976), \"A methodology f Taylor AC, Evans JS, and McKone TE (1993), \"The Value of Animal Test Information in Environmental-Control Decisions,\" Risk Analysis , 13(4), 403-412.

Preventing Excessive Precaution When applied appropriately, precautionary approaches can prom ote the protection of public health, safety and the enviro nment by reducing potential threats.50 However, if precaution is taken to an extrem e and rigidly applied, adverse im pacts can occur. For exam ple, an im portant consideratio n when taking precau tionary m easures is th at decreas ing one risk m ay increas e a countervailing risk.51 For exam ple, regulations that redu ce the level of disinfection byproducts in the water supply m ay reduce potential adverse health eff ects from by-products of the disinfection process. However, it m ay also redu ce the effectiveness of disinfection and thereby increase th e health risk from microorganism s. Likewise, restricting la tex use to prev ent allerg ic reaction in health care w orkers m ay increase the risk of infections that latex products are used to prevent. Therefore, precaution m ay be necess ary on both sid es of the equ ation and a form al consideration of risk-risk trade- off m ay be necessary when both ri sks cannot be eas ily reduced in tandem .52 Resource co nstraints m ust also b e considered. By being too precau tious on som e risks, decis ion m akers m ay not have th e resources to ta ke precau tions agains t other risks and , in the long run, fewer risks m ay be prevented. E. Conclusion The U.S. m anages em erging risks through an extensive system of local, State, and Federal regulation working in com bination wi th social norm s, market forces, voluntary standard s, and tort liab ility law. When dealing with em erging risks, form al risk asses sments are often used to inform Federal regulatory decisi ons and, when science is highly incom plete or uncertain, these assessments m ay be based on protective assumptions or m argins of s afety. When Federal decision m akers decide the appropri ate level of precaution in a specific decision, they need to consider the extent of precaution that is em bedded in the m ethods and assum ptions used in the risk assessm ent. They may also ne ed to consider other fact ors such as technological and economic feasibility, or m ore holistic benefi t-cost balancing, includ ing considerations of countervailing risks, depending on the overall objectiv e of statutory requirem ents to protect the public and the environm ent, and im prove societal welf are. Critica l to the a pplica tion of precau tion is decid ing when addition al inform ation is needed before m aking a final regulato ry decision or revising a previous re gulatory decision. Since the U. S. regulatory fram ework relies on an open and transparent system of delegate d rulem aking with revisable regulations, the system is able to incorporate the best scientif ic advice at m any steps in the process and respond to changes in inform ation accord ingly. This al lows for an iterative process of infor mation collection, risk assessm ent, and risk m anage ment when regulating em erging risks.

The analysis of hom eland security and recovery activities raises unique and difficult issues. In OMB's draft 2003 Report to Congress, we solicited public comm ent on how agencies and OMB should analyze hom eland security regulatory actions, including how agencies m ight be tter forecast the anti-terrorism benefits and the direct and indirect costs of such rules, such as lo ss of tim e, convenience, privacy, and econom ic productivity. This chapter consists of two parts: The first part describes the governm ent's response to recover from the September 11 attacks and stre ngthen homeland securit y, including a list of proposed and final rules. The second part de scribes the public comments on the analysis of homeland security regulation, and presents a pre liminary discussion of the issues agencies will confront when considering the costs and benef its of counter-terrorism and hom eland security regulatory activity. Throughout this chapter, OMB includes exam ples of statutes and regul ations that address both recovery from the Septem ber 11 attacks and hom eland security as def ined in the National Strategy for Homeland Security and the OMB Report to Congress on Combating Terrorism . The public com ments address m any regulatory issues across this range. For instance, OMB has catego rized assistance p ut in place for victim s and other parties im pacted by the Septem ber 11, 2001 attacks as recovery rather than hom eland secur ity, as these deal with a specific event rather than the n ation's endurin g capability to prepare for, respond to , or recov er from a terrorist ev ent. In a broad benefit-cost context, it is useful to exam ine recovery and hom eland security together. This chapter is not m eant to in troduce a new definition of the term \"hom eland secu rity;\" however, OMB acknowledges here and in the 2 002 report that the boundaries of what is considered h omeland security are no t always clear, and that we m ay need to occasion ally refine the definition used to estab lish those boundaries. A. Summary of Federal Homeland Se curity and Recovery Activ ity After the attacks of Septem ber 11, 2001, Am ericans for the first tim e in decades beg an to ask the question: How do we ensure that we ar e protected at hom e? Both the Legis lative and Executive B ranches responded by reorganizing F ederal agencies and thro ugh a series of new laws and regulations designed to deter terrorism , minimize the potential eff ects of terrorist acts, provide assistance, and a ddress potential post-attack liability concerns. Governmental Reorganization At the President's request, Congress passe d The Hom eland Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-296), which established the Departm ent of Ho meland Security, a cabinet-level departm ent consolidating 22 different agencies into four major directo rates: inform ation analy sis and infrastructure protection, sc ience and technology, border and transportation security, and 64 emergency preparednes s and respon se. Agenci es placed und er the Departm ent's authority include the Immigration and Naturalization Service, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Custom s Service, Federal Em ergency Managem ent Agency, U.S. Secret Service, Transportation Security Adm inistration, and the border in spection section of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The consolidation of these related agencies under the leadership of one Cabinet secretary is designed to strength en the government's ability to re duce Am erica's vulnerability to terrorism and m inimize the da mage from potential attacks. Statutory A ctions Following the Septem ber 11 attacks, Congress and the Adm inistration sought to answ er three b asic questions : What are the v ulnerab ilities in our homeland security fra mework? Who should address these concerns, and how should these concerns be a ddressed appropriately? Concerned with air, sea, and la nd en try and trave l, the ab ility of the law e nforcem ent system to catch terrorists, and the Federal Governm ent's current authority over these areas, Congress passed and the President signed into law a series of counter-terrorism and hom eland security Acts. 1. Assistance The Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (P.L. 107-42) and the Victim s of Terrorism Relief Act of 2001 (P.L. 107- 134) provided assistance to individuals and companies affected by the attacks of Septem ber 11, 2001. The laws afforded financial relief to victim s, their f amilies, a nd air c arriers. 2. Law Enforcem ent: USA PAT RIOT The Uniting and Strengthening Am erica by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct T errorism (USA PATRIOT) (P.L. 107-56) pr ovided Federal officials with enhanced powers to intercept wire, oral and electronic comm unication re lating to ter rorism. Further, it re quired m ore string ent imm igration procedures at the bor ders, established new Federal crim es related to terro rism, and incre ased penalties for already de fined terrorist acts. Transportation Security While USA PATRIOT enhanced the law enf orcement aspects of deterring terrorism , the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATS A) (P.L. 107-71) m andated airline security checks, baggage screenings, and enhanced cockp it doors and secure flight decks, in direct reaction to the terrorists' use of that mode of transportati on. It also established the Transportation Security Adm inistration (TSA) under the Departm ent of Transportation, to oversee s ecurity issues fo r all tr ansportation m odes. The TSA was later transferred to the new Departm ent of Hom eland Security (discussed previously). In addition, the Maritime Transportation Secu rity Act (P.L. 107-295) required facility and vessel vu lnerability asse ssments, m aritim e security plans, and enhanced id entification requirem ents and procedures. The Act also m andated that the Departm ent of Transportation 65 3 develop and im plement a long-range autom ated vesse l tracking system to provide inform ation on vessel positions. 4 Imm igration The Enhanced Border S ecurity and Vi sa Entry Refor m Act of 2002 (P.L.107-173) incre ased th e ability of the Fe deral governm ent to m onitor al iens in the U nited States, and established more stringent standa rds to ente r and exit the cou ntry. Spec ifically, the A ct gran ted access to an d coordination of law enforcem ent and other inform ation between the Departm ent of State, the form er Immigration and Naturalizat ion Service (IN S, now part of the Hom eland Security Departm ent), and other law enfor cement personnel. The Act also directed the developm ent of an integrated entry and exit data system . Further, it streng thened th e requirem ents for m onitoring foreign students and exchange visitors, and their sponsoring institutions, by requiring collection of additional infor mation on these institutions and the individuals prior to and during th eir stay in the U nited States. 5 Bio-terrorism The Public Health Security and Bio-terrorism Prepare dness and Response Act (P.L. 107- 188) focused specifically on national, State, a nd local preparedness and response planning and security by r equiring ne w controls o n biological agents and toxins; puttin g in plac e addition al safety and security m easures on the U.S. food, drug, and water supplies; establishing m easures which af fect easures to bio-terrorism . 6 Risk Insuran ce To ensure that businesses have acces s to terroris m risk insurance, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (Novem ber 26, 2002) (P.L. 107-297) established a tem porary Federal program that provides shared public and private com pensa tion for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism . The Act's purpose is to \"protect consum ers by addressing m arket disruptions and ensure th e continued widespread av ailab ility an d affordability of property and casualty insurance for terro rism risk and a llow f or a tra nsition al period for the p rivate markets to s tabiliz e, resum e pricing of such insurance, and build capacity to absorb any future loss es, while preserving State insurance regulation and consum er protection.\" Regulatory and other Executive Branch Actions The Adm inistration has also re sponded to the events of Se ptember 11 through changes to its regulations. By addressing gaps in the Gove rnment's regulatory schem e, the Adm inistration has addressed the nation's imm igration, transporta tion, and border security concerns, in addition to providing assistance to those aff ected by the S eptem ber 11 attacks. As of May 31, 2003, OMB had reviewed a total of 69 draft proposed and final regulations designed to address terrorism , provide post-attack assistance, a nd prom ote hom eland security. In general, these regulations were designed to reduce the risk of a future te rrorist attack, m inimize 66 the dam age if such an attack occurred, provide p ost-attack as sistan ce, or provide post-attack liability pro tection s. Table 17 summarizes the Federal regulatory activity since Septem ber 11, 2001. The table lists the significant regulations that w ere reviewed by OMB through May 2003. The table contains 69 regulatory actions, with 21 finalized rules, 29 interim final rules, 15 proposed rules, and 4 \"other\" docum ents.53 53 Rules that may have been published first as proposed or interim final rules, but were then subsequently finalized, we considered one rulemaking. The 15 rules listed as proposed rules were those which were proposed but neither finalized nor mad e effectiv e through an interim final rule as of th is writin g. \"Ot her\" documen ts include notices, internal gu idelines, or procedures that OMB rev iewed under E.O. 1 2866, but were not regulato ry actio ns. 67 Table 17.

Of the 69 regulations, a m ajority (49 out of 69) were intended to reduce the risk of a future te rrorist attack. For exam ple, the leg acy Immigration and Natu ralization Se rvice (INS) issued an interim final regulation on the use of biom etric bo rder cros sing cards. The regulation provides imm igration officials at the border with a better m eans of verifying the identity of individuals f rom Canada or Mexico w ho use bor der cross ing cards to en ter the U.S. The USDA prom ulgated an interim final regulation that en forces standards and procedures governing the possession, use, and transfer of lis ted biological agents and toxins , to protect anim al and plant health and products, and to m inimize the ri sk of attack using these substances. Regulations intended to provide or facilitate the provision of assistance to the public were the second largest category (10 out of 69). The Departm ent of Justice final rule on the Septem ber 11th Victim s Com pensation Fund provided an a lternative to the risk, expense, and potential delays inherent in ci vil litigation. The F und provided Federal financial assistance for surviving v ictims and the fam ilies of deceased v ictims. The Departm ent of o prom individu becam e unem ployed as an ind irect effect of the Septem ber 11 attacks . Individuals who tem porarily lost their jobs due to the closure of Reagan National Airport outside of W ashington, DC, for exam ple, we re able to receive disaster unem ploym ent assistance as a result of this regulatory am endment. Since September 11, six regulations also m itigat e the im pact of a futu re terrorist attack, should such an attack occur. FDA proposed a series of regulations designed to reduce the im pact of a terrorist act. One FDA proposed rule, for exam ple, providing for the adm inistrative detention of food, given infor mation or intelligen ce that such foodstuff ha s been tam pered with or altered. F EMA also proposed the \"National Urban Search and Rescue Response System \", designed to m inimize the loss of life in the wake of a national disaster. The fourth type of regulation issued rela ting to h omeland sec urity wer e those intended to address post-event liability issues. The Depart ment of Treasury prom ulgated regulations regarding terrorism risk insurance, as author ized by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002. 55 In total, there were two regu lations that were issu ed in respo nse to th e Septe mber 11th attack s that did not fall in to any of t hese ca tegories: a De partm ent of Commerce rule which rem oved econ omic sanct ions o n certain countries, and a Depa rtment of Transportation/FAA rule on foreign carriers. Commerce l ifted sanc tions t hat had been i mposed on certain n ations. The INS was required to lower its i mmigration fees as mandated by the Homeland Sec urity Act. The FAA revision addressed an administrative error that required airline changes for only certain types of domestic air carriers for all forei gn carriers. T his regul ation clari were the same for dom estic and internation al carriers. 79 Summary In response to the terrorist attacks of Septem ber 11, 2001, Congress and the Executive Branch have acted to m inimize the risk of future terrorist acts and the potential im pact of an attack. The regulatory am endments m ade since th en seek to address vu lnerabilities at our borders, security threats through transporta tion, f ood, and chem icals, and provide law enforcem ent with the tools needed to interdict and apprehend potential terrorists. Through the new Departm ent of Hom eland Security and future refinem ents to the governm ent's regulatory schem e, the Executive B ranch is enhancing domesti c security through a coordination of efforts, a reduction of duplicative efforts, a nd a consolidation of resources. B. Response to Public Comments on the Analysis of Homeland Security OMB receiv ed 22 public comments that directly addressed terrorism and homeland security. This section summari zes comments regarding how agencies m ay tackle some of the difficult is sues in th is regulato ry aren a. For econom ically significant rules, O MB guide lines require that agencies specify the need for the regulation, explain the market fa ilure, or why private markets or other non- governm ental activities cannot prov ide or would provide inadequate ly what the regulation would provide. Agencies m ust also specify and analyz e a realistic se t of regulatory and non-regulatory alternatives, and analyze the cos ts and benefits of each altern ative relativ e to a baseline. In the context of hom eland security re gulations, benefit issues includ e estim ating the im pact of the terro rist activity th at the regula tion w ould prevent, and cost issues include a wide range of costs, including potential convenien ce and tim e loss and the im pact on personal privacy. Throughout this discuss ion, we will draw on exampl es from the regulatio ns in Table 17. Applicability of Benefit-Cost and Cost-Effectiveness Tools Most of the commenters (for exam ple: 15, 16, 234, 252, 255, 256, 258, 270, 284, 292, 328) supported the use of benefit-cost (BCA) and cost-effectiveness analys is (CEA) to inform homeland security regulatory decisions. Two comments (251,333) did not support using these tools for hom eland security and terrorism regulation. OMB believ es that it is c ritical that agencies consider and weigh the effectiveness of th eir regulatory actions against any cost s, risks or burdens on the pub lic. BCA and CEA represent the best regulatory analysis tools available to governm ent, and their application to hom eland security issues raises several challenging issues. Market Failure and the Need for Regulation Since the p rivate sector conti nues to m ake very significant in vestments in areas that are also im pacted by hom eland security regulations, comm ent 307 recomm ends that agencies discuss the need for the regulation and why the private se ctor fails to provide wh at the regulation would 80 provide. There m ay be a classic m arket failure or other social purpose the regulation addresses (these other social purposes could include im proving the functioning of governm ent, rem oving distributional unfairness, and prom oting privacy and personal freedom ). Market failures generally take three for ms: externalities, m arket power concerns, and inadequate or asymm etric inform ation. Appe ndix D contains a fuller discussion of m arket failure. All of these form s of m arket failure c ould be im portant in hom eland security regulation, and m any comments discussed the externalitie s inherent in secur ity investm ent. As an example where th e private m arket does no t have th e incentiv e to co rrect an inform ation problem , FDA recently issued a seri es of proposed rules (T able 17) designed to gather and centralize inform ation on the food suppl y. FDA theorized that any one food supplier, although having a strong incentive to gather su fficient inform ation to protect its own food products, did not have sufficient incentive in the private m arket to provide its inform ation to a coordinating body that could track ri sks to the overall food supply. Also, the uncertainty about low-probability, high-consequen ce events su ch as te rrorism may lead m arket pa rticip ants to predictably under react or overreact. Comm ents 12 and 14 stated that people m ay in practice fundam entally undere stimate the im pact from terrorism , since they may treat low probability events as if the true probability were zero. Many different governm ent programs are in pl ace in part because a single private provider would yield considerab le market power or because private m arkets would undersupply the desired output due to the f act that the outputs provide a si gnificant \"public good\" that extends beyond the benefits that a purchas er would receive. National defense, police protection, and border security are exam ples of activities with a considerable public good com ponent. Many comments discussed the externalities inhe rent in private inve stments in security , general relationship betw een private secu rity inves tment s and different types of public security inv estment. Comments 12 and 258 point out that secu rity inves tments will properly b e public-private partnerships, and that com panies have already m ade large investm ents in security. For exam ple, comment 328 states that the petr oleum industry has alr eady taken significant security precautions, and doubtless m any other facilities and instituti ons that consider them selves a risk have invested in security as w ell. Comm ent 270 suggested two potential external effects of this type of investm ent: the investm ent in security in one facility or s ystem may motivate terrorists to choose \"softer\" or less protected targets; or convers ely, an investm ent in security may protect other related facilities or system s. Many comments expand on these argum ents. For exam ple, comment 12 argues that private actors m ay have a funda mental disincenti ve to m ake security investm ents when their security vulnerabilities depend on th e actions of others. If securi ty is this type of public good, firms would still be vulnerable to attacks due to a lack of se curity over which they have no control. Comm ents 14, 15, 16, 270, 356 and others point out the \"deflection of ri sk,\" or the ability of terrorists to observe security precautions and to sim ply choos e the target that has m ade a 81 relatively smaller secur ity inv estment. This sug gests that \"h ardening \" a pa rticular target m ay not always lead to an overall risk reduc tion from society's perspective. Comm ent 16 suggested that the governm ent may want to discourage private and public security inv estments in a partic ular target that w ould sim ply cause terro rists to attack a less secure but equally valuable target. They r ecommended governm ent interv ention in the allev iate the risk defl ection problem . Theoretically, if insurers spread the risk of loss due to terrorism over m any differen t targets, they have an incentive to encourage security investm ents that would not sim ply sh ift the risk of attack. Under the suggested approach, selective governm ent intervention m ight be necessary to align society's risk to the insurer's risk pool. Comm ent 15 suggested that regul ations that create a barrier of entry to any potential terrorist (for exam ple, visa and passport controls ) may be especially effective since they do not suffer from the problem of risk defl ection within the United S tates. Comm ent 270 and others recomm end gam e-theoretic m odels to study the incentives that exist for different parties to provide security. For exam ple, agencies should study where risk and centr alized c ontrol do no t coinc tion m ay be dif ficult to in a c ompetitiv e business env ironm ent. For exam ple, com puter network users seldom have the choice of how much security they em ploy on their own term inal; in this case, the person in charge of the overall network seem s to have both the proper incentiv es and the power to m aximize security on that network. Airport security m ay be more problematic to coordina te, since an efficient response may require airlines to coordina te certain activities, such as security in baggage transfer. With regard to risk deflection, the structur e of the m arket m ay be very im portant in determ ining the to tal security inves tment by each potential target. For exam ple, Sandler56 identifies a possible \"arm s race\" scenario invol ving countries or firm s making decisions on the level of their security inv estment. Every ac tor in a market has an incen tive to be jus t slightly more secure than othe r targets, and that incentive does not change regardless of the overall level of security investm ent. Thus, every possible target m ay ratchet up their security response. If companies, however, do not have inf ormation on th e secu rity precau tions other targets are taking (for exam ple, ports can look at other ports and judge their security, but literally thousands of buildings m ay be potential targets) , they would not have a benchm ark of security that they could go just beyond in order to deflect their risk. They presum ably would fall back to dam age limitation m easures and som e absolute asse ssment of their v ulnerab ility. Finally, as the num ber of \"com petitors\" decreas es to a certain level, they may be better able to coordinate a security response through a credible incentive struct ure without centrali zed intervention. This suggests m any poss ible effects, depending on the structure of the m arket. In a highly disbursed m arket or in a market where inf ormation on security inv estment is n ot read ily observable, the incentive to over-i nvest in security seem s blunted. As the num ber of potential targe ts dec reases and th e visibility inc reases of a potential targ et set, the de flection s trategy will look attractive to all m arket pa rticipants sim ultaneously, leading to a level of investm ent that may or m ay not be socially optim al. In other wo rds, the risk reduction m ay still have external 56 Sand ler T (2003), \"Co llective A ction and Economy, 26:6, 779 -802. 82 effects not taken into account in the security \"arm s race.\" As the num ber drops furth er, the possibility of \"coordinating\" a security response increases, but that coordinated response m ay not be socia lly optimal. Estima ting Benefits A valid prediction of the tim ing and intensity of a future terrorist attack would be as useful as it is elusive. Professional counter-t errorism experts have always found it difficult to predict with any degree of certa inty the probability of a terrorist attack. Comment 284 and several others m ention that the probability of an attack on an y one target is very low and uncertain, w hich m akes prediction and risk differe ntiation especially difficult. Comm ents 15 and 260 m ention, however, that probabi listic risk assessm ent models ex ist for general terrorism risk and for the risk of attack and da mages to specific indus trial sectors, and that agencies could avail them selves of these tools. A significant com plica ting factor here is that terrorists are not \"fixed targets\", but they can react and respond to the se curity and other counterte rrorism measures that the governm ent and private sector adopt. This increases the di fficulty in estim ating the likely benefits from a particular regulatory action. Two comm ents (255, 256) discussed what they considered w as a fundamental misunderstanding of potentially vulnerable targets: ecosystem s. They characterize ecosystem s as less sym bolic than m ore traditiona l terrorist targets, but attacks agains t them could be just as devastating\u2014through psychological, econom ic and ot her types of harm\u2014and they are also m uch harder to protect. Since Decem ber 2002, USDA has proposed one rule and FDA has proposed four rules designed to m itigate th e impact of a terror ist attack on the food supply (Tab le 17). One of the possible im pacts of terroris m is an econom ic shock or slowdown, and researchers have explored these potential \"th ird-party \" cos ts of terrorism. For exam ple, Abadie and Gardeazabal57 use a natural-experim ent approach to dem onstrate that the Basque region suffers in econom ic perform ance relative to ot her areas of Spain due to ongoing separatist terro rist activity. These are legitim ate costs to be considered in any m easurem ent of the im pact of terrorism and the benefits of counterterrorism program s. Estima ting Costs Hom eland Security regulations will impose costs, like o ther ty pes of regulatory activity. Some of these costs will be rela tively straightforward to estim ate, such as the need fo r busines s to invest in new infor mation syst ems or hire additional security guards. Yet other m ajor costs of interventions to com bat terrorism may be fundam entally m ore difficult to identify and estim ate. These costs broadly fall under the following categories: loss of convenience and tim e, diminished privacy, and curtailm ent of civ il rights and liberties. Many comments (14, 234, 251, 252, 259, 261, 270, 333, 356 and others) discuss these issues in detail. 1. Time and Convenience 57 Abadie A and Gardeaza bal J (2003), \" The Econom ic Costs of Conflict: A Case Study of the Basque C ountry.\" American Economic Review, 93(1), 113-132. 83 Of these possible costs, tim e and conveni ence costs have been estim ated in other regulatory activity. For exam ple, DOT58 issued g uidance to assist analysts in developing consistent evaluations of actions that save or cos t travel tim e, in which they recomm end valuing travel and w aiting tim e using spec ific percen tages of represen tative wage r ates. Losse s in tim e and convenience, however, are difficu lt to aggregate if a regulatory intervention results in a sm all time or convenience loss to a larg e number of people. Commen t 292 suggests that standard stated-preference m ethods should be able to measure convenience valuations. 2. Privacy and Civil Rights and Liberties As a num ber of public commenters pointed ou t, a cost th at ne eds to be ide ntified and considered in developing and evaluating hom eland security regulations is the poten tial impact that the regulation (or regulatory alternative) would have on the pr ivacy, rights and liberties that persons enjoy in this country. As the public comm ents also ind icated, one aspect of this con sideration w ill involve a legal review. Federal ag encies m ust operate with in the legal author ities a nd legal res trictions that govern their activ and this g overni ng leg al k is provid ed by the Constitu tion and the statutes that Congress ha s enacted. Thus, in course of its prom ulgation of any regulation, a Federal agency m ust conduct a legal review to de termine that the agency has the legal authority to issue the r egulation in question and that th e age ncy is com plying with ap plicab le lega l restrictions (both substantiv e and procedural). A num ber of commenters offered their vi ews concerning the nature of the privacy interests, rig hts and liberties to which pers ons are legally entitled under th e Constitu tion and Federal statutes. In this regar d, a number of comm enters expre ssed their concerns regarding the impact that hom eland se curity regulations have (or could have) on these legal rights and protections. It is not within th e scope of this chapter to evalu ate the m erits of these various perspectives, or to offer OMB's legal analysis or position on the points that the comm enters have raised, o r to attem pt to d efine or describe the contours of pers onal privacy interests, rights and liberties. However, we f ully agree with the ge neral thrust of these comments, which is the importance of Federal agencies ensuring that homeland security regulat ions have sound legal author ity, co mply with tional rests, r ights and liberties of persons. A legal ana lysis tha t determines that the agen cy is acting with in its lega l authority and is respec ting le gal pro tectio ns, however, does not conclude the id entification and consideration of the costs associated with a hom eland security regulation. The fact th at a regulation under consideration would be lawful does not m ean that the regulation would impose no costs. It is the identificatio n and consid eration of th e costs that would be imposed by legally-authorized regulations that cons titutes the lion's share of reg ulato ry analyses that agencies condu ct.59 58 Department of Transportation Memorandum from Fran k Kruesi to Secret arial Officers and Modal Administrators, 1997. \"Departmental Gui dance for t he Valuation of Tr avel Tim e in Economic An alysis.\" Availab le at http://ostpxweb.dot.gov. 59 Agencies under Executive Order 12866 are also directed to ev aluate the benefits an d costs o f regulatory options that are precluded by t he governi ng regulatory statute. Although age ncies in s uch situations may not rely on such 84 Thus, in the context of hom eland security regulations, the legal conclusion that a regulatory alternative under cons ideration would not violate a constitutional or statutory protection does not m ean that the regulatory alte rnative would im pose no costs with respect to persons' privacy interests, rights, or liberties. For exam ple, as the courts have held, requiring individuals in airports and Fede ral buildings to go through m etal detectors, and to have their packages go through x-ray m achines, does not vi olate their F ourth Am endm ent right against unreasonab le searches and seizures. The fact that these metal detec tor an d x-ray in spection s are lawful, however, does n ot mean that these inspec tions im pose no cost in term s of di minished personal privacy. These inspections do dim inish pers onal privacy, and this is indeed a cost of the inspection requirem ent. The question for the regu latory agen cy is whether the ben efits from these inspec tions ju stify their costs, in term s of dim inished privacy as well as lost tim e and convenience. Metal detector and x-ray inspections are but on e exam ple of t he types of lawful costs that can be im posed by hom eland security regulations, a nd therefore that regulato ry agenc ies need to identify and consider alo ng with the anticipated benefits fro m the regulation. Adm ittedly, it m ay be difficult for a regu latory agency to evaluate in specific instances th e extent of the costs tha t a regulatory alternative would likely im pose. In emergency s ituations, for exam ple, an agency may not have m uch ti me to consider the various alternatives, much less th e tim e to per form a full evaluation of their respective benefits and costs, before the agency m ust decide on a course of action. In such cases, agencies should conduct as much analysis as the situation perm its. In addition, as commenters pointed ou t, it m ay be difficult for an agency to express the cost in quantifiable, as opposed to qualita tive, term s. However, to the extent that an agency can quantify the regulatory impact, the agency s hould attem pt to do so (e.g., by indicating the number of persons that would lik ely be affected by the regulation) . This additional analysis is helpful in providing as com plete a picture as possible of the impli cations and justif ication f or the proposed regulatory approach. Summary Developing Federal regulations involves a se ries of steps: identifying the nature and extent of the problem ; determ ining whether Fede ral action is needed or desirable; if it is determ ined that Federal action is needed or desi rable, id entifying the rele vant leg al authoritie s and the policy options; then evaluating those options based on their \"pros\" and \"cons,\" which includes an identification and consideration of the antic ipated benef its and costs as sociated with each option; and, finally, concluding with a de cision on which course of action to pu rsue. Hom eland security regulations raise new issues and pose new challenges for Federal agencies. However, the sam e general fram ewor k should apply to the developm ent of hom eland security regulations as agencies have applied ov er the y ears in their developm ent of other types of regulations. Federal agencies that address hom eland security m atters need to go through the same general steps in deciding whether Federal action is needed and desirable and, if so, in determ ining what course of action to pursue. In this regard, thes e agencies can and should, to the analysis in m aking thei r regulatory deci sions, this information ca n be useful to Legislative and Executive Branch decision makers in their ev aluatio n of legislativ e options. 85 extent possible, use the standard tools of regulatory analysis th at have been developed over the years to inform decision m akers about the anticip ated benefits and costs of the various policy options that they are considering. In this chapter, we have discussed severa l of the issues and ch alleng es tha t Federal agencies confront in their development and analys is of hom eland security regulations. These and other issues are dis cussed in the m any public comments that we receiv ed on this m atter; we appreciate the thought and care th at the comm enters devoted in responding to our request for public com ments. We expect that the issues that have been raised in the comments and in this Chapter will be the subject of continuing inqui ry and discussion as Federal agencies, the Congress, and the public gain further experience with the promulgation of hom eland security regulations. 86 APPE NDIX A: CAL CUL 10/92 - 3/95, 10/01 - 9/02) Chapter I presents estimates of the annual co sts and benefits of selected f inal m ajor regulations reviewed by OMB between October 1, 1992 and Septem ber 30, 2002. OMB presents more detailed explanation of these regulations in several docum ents. The explanation of the calculations for the m ajor rules reviewed by OMB between April 1, 1995 and March 31, 1999 can be found in Chapter IV of our 2000 report (OMB 2000). Table 19, Appendix E, of the 2002 Report presents OMB =s estim ates of the benefits and cost s of the 20 individual rules reviewed between April 1, 1999 and Septem ber 30, 2001. Tables 18 and 19 in this appendix present the results for the rem aining intervals of the 10-year time period used in this report: October 1, 1992 to March 31, 1995 (Table 18), and October 1, 2001 to September 30, 2002 (Table 19). All benefit and cost estim ates were adjusted to 2001 dollars. In assem bling estim ates of be nefits and costs, O MB has: (1) applied a uniform format for the presentation of benefit and cost estim ates in order to m ake agency estim ates m ore cl osely comparable with each other (for exam ple, annualizing benefit and cost estim ates); and (2) monetized q uantitative estim ates where the agency has not done so (for exam ple, converting Agency projections of quantifie d benefits, such as, estim ated injuries avoided per year or tons of pollutant reductions per year to dollars using the valuation estim ates discussed below). The adoption of a uniform for mat for annuali zing agency estim ates allows, at least for purposes of illus tration, the aggregation of benef it and cost es timates acros s rules. While OMB has attem pted to be faithful to the respective ag ency approaches, the reader should be cautioned that agencies have used diffe rent m ethodologies and valuations in quantifying and m onetizing effects. Thus, this aggregation involves the assemb lage of benefit and cost estim ates that are not strictly comparable. Table 18.

Valuation Estimates for Regulatory Consequences61 Agencies continue to take different approaches to monetizing benef its for rules that af fect small risks of pre mature death. As a general m atter, we continue to defer to the individual agencies' judgm ent in this area. Except wher e noted, in cases where the agency both quantified and m onetized fatality risks we have m ade no ad justm ents to the agency's estim ate. In cases where the ag ency provid ed a quantif ied estim ate of fatality r isk, but did n ot monetize it, we have monetized these estim ates in order to conve rt these effects into a common unit. The following is a brief discussion of OMB' s valuation estim ates for other types of effects that agencies iden tified and qu antified, bu t did not m onetize. As a practica l matter, the aggregate benefit and cos t estim ates are relatively insensitiv e to the valu es we have assigned for these ru les because the aggreg ate benefit estim ates are dom inated by tho se rules where EPA provided quantified and monetized benefit and cost estim ates. For NHTSA's nonf atal injuries to \"equiva lent f atalities. \" These ra tios are bas ed on NHTSA's estim ates of the value individuals place on red ucing the ris k of injury o f varying seve rity relative to that of reducing ris k of death.62 For the OSHA rules, we monetized only lost workday injuries using a value of $50,000 per injury aver ted. 1. Change in Gasoline F uel Consumption. We valued reduced gasoline consum ption at $0.80 per gallon pre-tax. This equates to retail (at-the-pum p) prices in the $1.10 - $1.30 per gallon range. 60 Viscusi WK (1992), Fatal Tra deoffs: Pub lic & Priva te Resp onsibilities f or Risk , Oxford University Press, New York, p. 65. 61 The following discussion updates the monetization ap proach used in previous reports and draws on examples from this and previ ous years. 62 Nation al High way Traffic Safety Ad ministration (1994), The Economic Cost of Mot or Vehicle Cras hes, Table A- 1. http ://www. nhtsa.dot.gov/people/ econ omic/ecom vc199 4.html 91 2. Reductio n in Barre ls of Crude Oil Spilled. OMB valued each barrel prevented from being spilled at $2,000. This is double th e sum of the m ost likely estim ates of environm ental dam ages plus cleanup costs contained in a publis hed journ al article (Brown and Savage, \"The Econom ics of Double-Hulled Tankers,\" Maritime Policy and Management , Volum e 23(2), 1996, pages 167-175.) 3. Change in Em issions of Air Pollutants. We used estim ates of the benefits per ton for reductions in hydrocarb on and nitro gen oxi de em issions derived from recent EPA regulatory analyses, as follows (2001$): Hydrocarbon: $600 and $2,700 per ton Nitrogen Oxide $2,800 per ton Nitrogen Oxide (mobile): $1,100 and $5,500 per ton Sulfur Dioxide: $7,800 per ton The estim ates for reductions in hydrocarbon emissions were obtai ned from EPA's RI A for the 1997 rule revising the prim ary NAAQS fo r ozone and fine PM. OMB has revised the estim ates for reductions in NO x emissions to reflect a range o f estim ates from recent EPA analyses for several rules and for proposed legislation. In particular, OMB has adopted different benefit trans fer estim ates for NO x reductions from stationary sour ces (e.g., electric utilities) and from mobile sources. EPA believes that there ar e a num ber of reasons to expect that reductions in NO x emissions from utility sources achieve diffe rent air quality im provem ents relative to reductions from ground-level m obile sources. For exam ple, mobile source tailpipe em issions are located in urban areas at ground level (with lim ited dispersal) while electric utilities em it NO x from \"tall s tacks\" lo cated in rura l with sub stantial g eographic d ispersal (Letter to D on Arbuckle, Deputy Adm inistra tor, O IRA from Tom Gibson, Associate Adm inistrator, Office of Policy, Econom ics and Innovation, EPA, May 16, 2002.) There rem ain considerable uncertainties with the developm ent of these estimates. The discussion below outlin es the various EPA analyses ser ving as th e basis for the NO x benef it transf er values presented ab ove and discusses the un certainties that attend th ese estim ates. Analysis of recen t EPA rules y ield several estimates for th e NO x benefits per ton from electric utility sources. (See the Reg ulatory Im pact Analys es for the \"NO x SIP Call\" and the Section 126 rules, available on the w eb at http://www.epa.gov/ttn/ecas/econguid.htm l. In addition, see Mem o to NSR Docket from Bryan Hubbell, Senior Econom ist, Innovative Strategies and Econom ics Group, EPA.) Based on th ese studies, the upper end of the range for the benefits of NO x reductions from stationary sources (electric utiliti es) is $2,800 per ton. These studies also developed estim ates for the be nefits associated w ith reductions in SO 2 from electric utilities. Based on an analys is outlined in a June 20, 2001 EP A memo to the file, \"Benefits Associated with Electricity Generating Em issions Reductions Realized Under the NSR Program ,\" we used $7,800 per ton SO 2 emissions for the 1992 EPA Acid Rain rule. For m obile sources, EPA recen tly pu blished th e final Tier 2/Gasoline Su lfur rule RIA (EPA, 1999) and Heavy Duty Engine/Diesel Fuel RIA (EPA, 2000). For the Tier 2 rule, which affects light-duty vehicles, NO x reductions accou nt for aroun d 90 percen t of PM precursor emissions and 86 percent of ozone precursor em issions. Based on the f inal Tier 2/Gasoline Sulfur RIA, EPA estim ates tha t NO x reductions will yield benef its of $5,500/ton (20 01$). EPA 92 believ es this analys is pro vides a more appropriate source for the NO x benefit transfer value for mobile sources. (Letter from Tom Gibson, pp. B2 and B3, May 16, 2002.) Addition al details on the Tier 2 benefits analysis are available in the Tier 2/Sulfur Final Rulem aking RIA, available on the web at http://www.epa.gov/om s/fuels.htm . The Heavy Duty Engine/Diesel Fuel benefits analysis exam ined the im pacts in 2030 of reducing SO 2 emissions by 141,000 tons and NO x emissions by 2,750 thousand tons, as well as a 109,000 ton reduction in direct PM em issions. Based on this analysis, EPA estim ates a value for NO x reductions of $10,200/ton in 2030. (Letter from Tom Gi bson, p.B3, May 16, 2002.) Com plete details of the em issions, air qualit y, and benefits m odeling conducted for the HD Engine/Diesel Fuel Rule can be found at http://www.epa.gov/otaq/diesel.htm and http://www.epa.gov/ttn/ecas/regdata/tsdhddv8.pdf . Because the Heavy Duty Engine/Diesel Fuel estim ate includes an adjustm ent for incom e growth out to 2030 and involves reductions in several PM-related pollutants, OMB has adopted a value of $5,500 per ton from EPA's analysis of the Tier 2 rule as a benefits transfer value for reductions in NO x emissions from mobile sources. Reductions in the r isk of prem ature morta lity dom inate the ben efits es timates in a ll of these analyses. The size of the m ortality risk estim ates from the underlying epidem iological studies, the serious nature of th e effect itself, and the high m onetary value ascribed to prolonging life m ake mortality risk reduction th e most importan t health endpoint qu antified in th ese analyses.63 Because of th e importance of this end point and th e considerab le uncertainty am ong econom ists and policym akers as to the appropriate way to value reductions in m ortality risks, EPA has developed a lternative es timates for its \"C lear Skie s\" leg islation that show the poten tial importance of som e of the underlying assum ptions. (See \"Hum an Health and Environm ental Benefit Achieved by the Clear Skies Initiativ e\" at http://www.epa.gov/clearskies.) OMB has used this an alysis to id entify an alter native estimate of the benefits from NO x reductions. In its Clear Skies analysis, EPA presente d alternative benefits estim ates of $24 billion and $113 billion per year in 2020, or a difference in the estim ates of roughly a factor of five.64 Using this ratio, an alternative e stimate of the benef its of NO x reductions from stationary sources would be $550 per ton from stationary sources and $1,100 per ton from m obile sources. 63 There are several k ey assu mptions underlyin g the benefit estimates fo r reductions in NO x emissions, i ncluding: 1. Inhalation of fine particles is causal ly associated wi th premature deat h at conce ntrations nea r those experienced by most Am erica ns on a daily basis. While no definitive studies have yet est ablished any of several potential biological mechan isms for such effects, t he weight of the availab le epidemiological evidence supports an assum ption of causal ity. 2. All fine particles, rega rdless of their chemical com position, a re equally potent in causing premature mortality. This is an im portant ass umption, becau se fine particles from powe r plant em issions are chem ically different from directly emitted fine particles from both mobile sources and other industrial facilities, b ut no clear scien tific g rounds exist for sup porting differen tial effects estim ates by particle typ e. 3. The conce ntration-response function for fine pa rticles is approximately linear within the ran ge of outdoor conce ntrations under policy consideration. Thus, the estim ates in clude health b enefits from reducing fine particles in both attain ment and non-attain ment regions. 4. The forecast s for future emissions and associated air qua lity modeling a re valid. 5. The valuation of the estim ated redu ction in mortality risk is larg ely taken from studies of wage premiu ms for hazardous jobs. 64 The differe nce betwee n the estimates reflects seve ral as sumptions, including differen ces in the esti mation and valuation of mortality risk and the valuation of a reduction in the incidence of ch ronic bronchitis. 93 OMB recognizes that there ar e potential problem s and signifi cant uncertainties that are inherent in any benefits analysis based on $/ton be nefit transfer techniques. The extent of these problem s and the degree of uncertainty depends on the diverg ence betwee n the policy situation being studied and the basic scenar io providing the benefits transfer estimate. Exam ples of other factors include sources of e missions, m eteorology, transport of e missions, initial pollutant concentrations, population density, a nd baseline incidence rates for health effects. Because of the unce rtainties assoc iated with ben efits tran sfer, OMB decided not to in clude th ree mobile source ru les that are pro jected to achieve substantial reductions in SO 2 and PM em issions that OMB included in previous years in the m onetized estim ates presented in Tables 5 and 6 of the 2002 Report.65 B. Adjustment for Differe nces in Time Frame across These Analyses Agency estim ates of benefits and costs cover widely varying tim e periods. The differences in the tim e frames used for the vari ous rules evalu ated gene rally ref lect the specif ic characteristics of individual rules, such as expe cted capital depreciation periods or time to full realization of benefits. In order to allow us to provide an aggregate estimate of benefits and costs, we developed ben efit and cos t time streams for each of the ru les. Where agen cy analys es provide annual or annualized es timates of benefits and costs, we used these estim ates in developing stream s of benefits and costs over tim e. Where the agency estim ate provided only annual benefits and costs for specific years, we us ed a linear interpolatio n to represent benefits 66and costs in the in terven ing years. C. Further Caveats In order for com parisons or aggregation to be m eaningful, benefit and cost estim ates should correctly account for all substantial eff ects of regulatory actions, including potentially offsetting effects, which m ay or m ay not be reflected in the ava ilable data. OMB has not m ade any changes to agency monetized estim ates. To th e extent that agencies have adopted different monetized v alues for effects\u2014for ex ample, differe nt values f or a statistical life or different discounting m ethods\u2014these differences rem ain embedded in the tables. Any com parison or aggregation across rules should also consider a number of fac tors which our presentation does not addres s. For exam ple, these analyses m ay adopt different baselines in term s of the regulations and contro ls already in p lace. In ad dition, the an alyses for th ese rules m ay well treat uncertainty in different ways. In som e cases, ag encies m ay have developed alternative estim ates reflecting upper- and lower-bound estim ates. In other cases, the agencies m ay offer a m idpoint estim ate of benefits and costs. In still other cases the agency estim ates may reflect only upper- bound estim ates of the likely benefits and costs. While OMB has relied in m any instances on agency practices in m onetizing costs and benefits, c itation of, or reliance o n, agency da ta in this 65 These are: M unicipal Waste Com bustors (1995), Em ission Standards for New Locomotives (1997), and Em ission Standa rds for Non-Road Diesel Engines (1998). 66 In other words, if costs were $200 million in 2000 and $400 million in 2020, OMB would assum e costs would be $250 million in 2005, $300 mil lion in 2010, and so forth. For exam ple, for the Regi onal Haze rule, EPA provided only an estimate o f bene fits and costs in 2015. To develop benefit and cost stream s, OM B used a linear extrapolation of bene fits and costs begi nning in 2009 and scaling up to the rep orted 2015 estimates 94 report should not be taken as an OMB endorseme nt of all the varied m ethodologies used to derive benefits and cost estim ates. 95 APPE NDIX B: AGE BENEFI TS AND COSTS (10/92 - 3/95) Chapter 1 in this report now includes qua ntified benefits and costs of m ajor rule s issued from October 1, 1992 to March 31, 1995.

We received suggestions regarding 71 regulations from 33 commenters involving 17 agencies. In an initial review of the co mments, OMB placed the suggestions in to three categories: high priority, m edium priority, and low priority. Twenty-three agency actions were rated Cate gory 1, \"high priority review\" candidates. Since the publication of the 2001 report, OMB has discussed these regulations with the agencies to better understand where they fit with agency priorities. Commenter s responding to the March 2002 draft report also nom inated som e of these rule s again in 2002. As detailed below, agencies have already taken action on a num ber of these sugge stions. On others, agen cies h ave agreed to consider the need f or ref orm and will be evalua ting specif ic actions. Finally, f or som e, agencie s believe that reform is unnecessa ry or not appropriate at this time. A status report on the high priority reviews is provided below. USDA: Forest Service Planning Rules and Roadless Area Conservation R egulations (Two Rul es)\u2014On May 10, 2001, a Federal judge issued an injunction blocking im plem entation of the roadless rule and a portion of the forest planning rule. In July 2001, the Forest Service issued an advanced notice soliciting comm ents on possible ch anges to the roadles s rule in ligh t of the court action. The Forest Service has issued two rulem akings in July 2003: an advanced notice of proposed rulem aking seeking to perm anently exem pt both the Tongass and the Chugash National Forests from the Roadless Ar eas Conservation Rule, and a proposed rule seeking to temporarily exem pt the Tongass Nationa l Forest from the Roa dless Rule. Both of these ru lemakings were issued pursu ant to a June 2003 settlem ent agreem ent reach between USDA and the State of Alaska. Further action awaits th e Forest Se rvice' s consideration of comments. The Forest S ervice has issued a pr oposed planning rule in Decem ber 2002, am ending the 2000 planning rule.

Department of Health and Human Se rvices : Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiab le Health In formation \u2014On August 14, 2002, HHS published final revisions to this rule 114 clarifying som e aspects and m odifying others. The rule as amended goes into effect on April 12, 2003. This rule was nominated for refor m by the public again in 2002. Department of Health and Human Se rvices : Food Labeling: T rans Fatty A cids in Nutrition Labeling, Nutrient Content and Health Claims \u2014OIRA Adm inistrator John D. Graha m sent a prom pt letter to F DA on Septem ber 18, 2001 urging the agency to finalize this rulem aking.

Environmental Protection Agency: P roposed Changes to the Total Maximum Daily Load Program \u2014EPA published a notice in October 2001 dela ying the effective date of the July 2000 TMDL rule for 18 m onths, in order to allow tim e to consider possible revi sions to the rule. The agency then conducted extensive \"listening sessions \" with stakeholders and has now prepared a draft propos ed rule that addresses many of the concerns rais ed. In order to allow addition al time for stakeholder input, EPA withdrew the July 2000 rule in April 2003. EPA expects to publish the proposed rule for public comm ent. This rule was nom inated for reform by the public again in 2002.

The Circular also pro vides guid ance to agen cies on the regulatory accounting statem ents that are re quired under the Regulator y Right-to-Know Act. This Circular refines O MB =s Abest practices @ docum ent of 1996 (http://www.whitehouse.gov/om b/inforeg/riaguide.htm l), which was issued as a guidance ( http://www. whitehouse.gov/omb/ 01-23.htm l). It replaces both the 1996 Abest practices @ and the 2000 guidance. In developing this Circular, OMB first de veloped a draft that was subject to public comment, interagency review, and peer review . Peer reviewers in cluded Cass Sunstein, University of Chicago; Lester L ave, Carnegie M ellon Unive rsity; Milton C. W einstein and Jam es K. Ha mmitt of the Harvard School of Public Health; Kerry S mith, North Carolina S tate University; Jonathan Weiner, Duke Universi ty Law School; Douglas K. Owens, Stanford University; and W . Kip Viscusi, Harvard La w School. Altho ugh these in dividuals su bmitted comments, OMB is solely responsible fo r the final content of this Circular. A. Introductio n This Circular is designed to assist analysts in the re gulatory agencies by defining good regulatory analysis B called either Aregulatory analysis @ or Aanalysis@ for brevity B and standardizing the way bene fits and costs of Federa l regulatory actions are m easured and reported. Executive O rder 12866 requires agencies to cond uct a regulatory analysis for econom ically significant regulatory actions as defined by Sect ion 3(f)(1). This requirem ent applies to rulem akings that rescind or m odify existing rules as well as to rulem akings that estab lish new requirem ents. The Need for Analysis of Proposed Regulatory Actions67 Regulatory analysis is a tool regulato ry agencies use to an ticipate and ev aluate the lik ely consequences of rules. It provides a f ormal way of organizing the evid ence on the key effects B good and bad B of the various alternatives that should be considered in developing regulations. The m otivation is to (1) learn if the b enefits of an action are likely to justif y the cos ts or (2) discover which of various possible alterna tives would be the most cost-effective. 67 We use the te rm \"prop osed\" to refer to any regulato ry action s under consideration regardless of th e stage of th e regulatory pro cess. 118 A good regulatory analysis is designed to inform the public and other parts of the Governm ent (as well as the agency conducting the analysis ) of the effects of alternative actions. Regulatory analys is sometimes will show that a proposed action is m isguided, but it can also demonstrate that well-conceived ac tions are reasonable and justified. Benef it-cos t analys is is a prim ary tool used for regulatory analysis.68 Where all b enefits and costs can be quantified and expressed in m onetary units, benefit-co st analysis provides decision m akers with a clear indica tion of the m ost efficient altern ative, th at is, the a lternative that generates the largest net benefits to society (ignoring distributional eff ects). This is useful inform ation for decision m akers and the public to receive, even when econom ic efficiency is not the only or the overriding pub lic policy objective. It will not always be possible to express in m onetary units all of the im portant ben efits and costs. When it is n ot, the m ost efficient al ternative will not necess arily be the on e with the largest quantified and m onetized net-benefit estim ate. In such cases, you should exercise professional judgm ent in determ ining how i mportant the non-quantified bene fits or costs m ay be in the context of the overall analysis. If the non-quantified benefits and costs are likely to be important, you should carry out a A threshold @ analysis to ev aluate their significance. Threshold or Abreak-ev en@ analysis answers the question, AHow small could the valu e of the non-quantified benefits be (or how large would the value of the non-quantified costs need to be) before the rule would yield zero net benefits? @ In addition to threshold anal ysis you should indicate, where possible, which non-quantified effects are m ost important and why. Key Elemen ts of a Regu latory Analysis A good regulatory analysis should include th e following three basic elem ents: (1) a statem ent of the need for the proposed action, (2) an exam ination of alte rnative approaches, and (3) an evaluation of the benef its and costs\u2014quantitative and qua litative\u2014of the proposed action and the m ain alte rnative s identif ied by the ana lysis. To evaluate properly the benefits and costs of regulations and their alternatives, you will need to do the following: Explain how the actions required by the rule are linked to the expected benefits. For exam ple, indicate how addition al safety equi pment will reduc e safety risks. A sim ilar analysis sho uld be done fo r each of the alternativ es. Identify a baselin e. Benefits and cos ts are defined in comparison with a clearly s tated alternative. This norm ally will b e a Ano action @ baseline: what the wor ld will be like if the proposed rule is not a dopted. Comparisons to a Anext best @ alterna tive are also especially u seful. Identify the expected undesirable side-eff ects and ancillary benefits of the proposed regulatory action and the alternatives. These should be added to the direct benefits and costs as appropriate. 68 See Misha n EJ (1994), Cost-Ben efit Ana lysis, f ourth edition, R outledge, New York. 119 With this inform ation, you should be able to assess quantitatively the benefits and costs of the proposed rule and its alte rnatives. A com plete regulatory analysis includes a discussion of non-quantified as well as quantified benefits and costs. A non-quantified outcom e is a benefit or cost that has not been quantifie d or monetized in the analysis. When there are im portant non- monetary values at stake, you should also identif y them in your analysis so policym akers can compare them with the monetary benefits and costs. When your analysis is com plete, you should present a summ ary of the benefit and cost estim ates for each altern ative, includ ing the qualitative and non-m onetized fact ors affected by the rule, so th at readers can evaluate them . As you design, execute, and write your regul atory analysis, you should seek out the opinions of those who will be af fected by the reg ulation as w ell as the v iews of those individua ls and organizations who m ay not be affected but have special knowledge or insight into the regulatory issues. Consultation can be useful in ensuring that your analysis addresses all of the relevant issues and that you have access to all pertinen t data. Early consultation can be especially helpful. You should not lim it consultati on to the final stages of your analytical efforts. You will find that you cannot condu ct a good regul atory analysis accord ing to a formula. Conducting high-quality analys is req uires com petent p rofessional judgm ent. Different regulations m ay call for different emphases in the analysis, dependi ng on the nature and complexity of the regulatory issues and the sensitivity of the benef it and cost es timates to th e key assum ptions. A good analysis is transparent. It should be possible for a qualified third party reading the report to see clear ly how you arrived at your estim ates and conclusions. For transparency =s sake, you should state in your report what assumpti ons were used, such as the tim e horizon for the analysis and the discount rates ap plied to future benefits and cost s. It is usually necessary to provide a s ensitiv ity ana lysis to rev eal whethe r, and to what extent, the r esults of the analys is are sensitive to plausib le changes in the main assumptions and num eric inputs. A good analysis provides specific references to all sources of data, appendices with docum entation of models (where nec essary ), and the resu lts of formal sensitiv ity and other uncertainty analyses. Your analysis should also have an executive summ ary, including a standardized account ing statem ent. B. The Need for Federal Regulatory Action Before recommending Federal regulatory action, an agency must dem onstra te that the proposed action is necessary. If the regulatory in tervention results from a statutory or judicial directive, you should describe the specific au thority for your action, th e extent of discretion available to you, and the regulat ory instrum ents you m ight use. Executive Order 12866 states that AFederal agencies should prom ulgate only such regulations as are required by law, are necessa ry to interpret the law, or ar e made necessary by com pelling need, such as m aterial failures of private markets to pro tect or im prove the health and safe ty of the public, the environm ent, or the well bei ng of the Am erican people ... . @ 120 Executive O rder AEach agen cy shall iden tify the prob lem that it intends to address (including, where applicable, the failures of private m arkets or public institutions that warrant new agency action ) as well as assess the significance of that problem .@ Thus, you should try to explain wh ether the action is intended to address a significant market failure or to m eet som e other com pelling public need such as improving governm ental processes or prom oting intangible values such as distribu tional fairness or privacy. If the regulation is designed to correct a significant market failure, you should describe the failure both qualitatively and (where feasible) quan titatively. You should show that a governm ent intervention is likely to do m ore good than harm . For other interventions , you should also provide a dem onstration of compelling social purpose and the likelihood of e ffective action. Although intangible rationales do not need to be quantified, the analysis s hould present and evalua te the strengths and limitations o f the relev ant argum ents f or these in tangible v alues. Market Failure or Other Social Purpose The m ajor types of m arket fa ilure include: inform ation. Correcting m arket failu res is a reason for regul ation, but it is not the only reason. Other possible justifications include im proving the functioning of governm ent, removing distributional unfairness, or prom oting privacy and personal freedom . 1. Externality, common property resource and public good An externality occurs when one party' s actions im pose uncompensated benefits or costs on another party. Environm ental problem s are a cl assic case of external ity. For example, the smoke from a factory m ay adversel y affect the health of loca l residen ts while soiling the property in nearby neighborhoods. If bargaining were costle ss and all property rights were well defined, people would elim inate externalities through bargaining without the need for governm ent regulation.69 From this perspective, ex ternalities arise from high tran sactions costs and/or poorly defined prop erty rights th at prev ent p eople from reaching efficient ou tcomes through m arket transactions. Resources that m ay becom e congested or ove rused, such as fisheries or the broadcast spectrum , represent common property resources. APublic goods,@ such as defense or basic scientific research, are goods where provision of the good to some individuals cannot occur without providing the sam e level of benef its free of charge to other individuals. 2. Market Power Firm s exercise m arket power when they redu ce output below what would be offered in a competitive industry in o rder to ob tain higher prices. They m ay exercise market power collectively or unilaterally. Gove rnment action can be a source of m arket power, such as when regulatory actions exclude low-co st im ports. Generally, regulati ons that increas e market power for selected entities should be avoided. Howe ver, there are so me circum stances in which governm ent may choose to validate a monopoly. If a m arket can be served at lowest cost only when production is lim ited to a single producer B local g as and electricit y distribution services, 69 See C oase R H (1960), Journal of Law and Econ omics, 3, 1-44. 121 for exam ple B a natural monopoly is said to exist. In such cases, the governm ent m ay choose to approve the monopoly and to regula te its prices and/or producti on decisions. Nevertheless, you should keep in m ind that technological advances often affect econom ies of scale. This can, in turn, transform what was once consid ered a na tural m onopoly into a m arket where co mpetition can flourish. 3. Inadequate or Asymmetric Inform ation Market failu res m ay also result from inad equate o r asymm etric inform ation. Because inform ation, like o ther is cos tly to produ ce and dissem inate, your evaluation will need to do m ore than dem onstrate the possible existence of incom plete or asymm etric inform ation. Even though the m arket m ay supply less than the full am ount of infor mation, the am ount it does supply m ay be reasonably adequate and therefor e not require governm ent regulation. Sellers have an incentive to provide inform ation th rough advertising that can increase sales by highlighting distinctive characte ristics of their products. Buye rs may also obtain reasonably adequate inform ation about product characteris tics through other channels, such as a seller offering a warranty or a thir d party providing inform ation. Even when adequate inform ation is available, people can m ake m istakes by processing it poorly. Poor inform ation-processing often occurs in cases of low probability, high-consequence events, bu t it is not lim ited to such s ituations. For instance, people som etimes rely on m ental rules-of-thumb that produce errors. If they ha ve a clear m ental im age of an incident which makes it cognitiv ely Aavailab le,@ they m ight overstate th e prob ability th at it will occu r. Individuals som etimes process inform ation in a biased m anner, by being too optim istic or pessim istic, without taking sufficien t account of the fact that the outcom e is exceeding ly unlik ely to occur. When m istakes in inform ation processing occur, markets m ay overreact. When it is time-consum ing or costly for consum ers to evaluate com plex inform ation about products or services (e.g ., medical th erapies), they m ay expect governm ent to ensu re that m inimum quality standards are m et. However, the m ere possibi lity of poor inform ation processing is not enough to justify regulation. If you think there is a prob lem of infor mation processing that needs to be addressed, it should be carefully docum ented. 4. Other Social Purposes There ar e justifications f or regulatio ns in addition to correcting m arket failures. A regulation m ay be appropriate when you have a clearly identified m easure that can make governm ent operate m ore efficiently. In addition, Congress establ ishes som e regulatory program s to redistribute resources to select groups. Such regulations should be exam ined to ensure that they are both effective and cost-effective. Congre ss also authorizes som e regulations to prohibit discrim ination that conflicts with generally accepted norm s within our society. Rulem aking m ay also be appropr iate to protect privacy, perm it more personal freedom or prom ote other dem ocratic aspirations. 122 Showing That Regulatio n at the Fed eral Leve l Is the Best W ay to Solve the Problem Even where a m arket failure clearly exists , you should consider other m eans of dealing with the failure before turning to Federal regulat ion. Alternatives to Fe deral regulation include antitrus t enforcem ent, consum er-initiated li tigation in the product liability system , or administrative com pensation sys tems. In assessing whether Federal regulation is th e best solution, you should also consider the possibility of regulation at the S tate or local level. In som e cases, the nature of the market failure may itself suggest the m ost appropriate govern mental level of regulation. For exam ple, problem s that spill acros s State lines (such as acid rain whose precursors are transported widely in the atm osphere) are probably be st addressed by Federal regulat ion. More localized problem s, including those that are common to m any areas, may be more efficiently addressed locally. The advantages of leaving regulatory issues to State and lo cal authorities can be substantial. If public values and pref erences differ by region, t hose differences can b e reflected in vary ing State and loca l regu latory polic ies. Moreover, States and localities can serv e as a testing ground for experim entation with alterna tive regu latory polic ies. n learn f rom another =s experien ce while local jurisdictions m ay com pete with each other to establish the best regulatory policies. You should exam ine the prope r extent of State and local discretion in your rulem aking context. A diversity of rules m ay generate gains fo r the public as governm ental units com pete with each o ther to serve the public , but duplicativ e regulation s can also b e costly. Where Federal regulation is clearly appropriate to address interstate comm erce issues, you should try to exam ine whether it would be m ore efficient to retain or reduce State and local regulation. The local benefits of State regulation m ay not justif y the na tiona l costs of a fragm ented regulatory system . For exam ple, the increas ed com pliance costs fo r firm s to m eet different State and local regulations m ay exceed any advantages associat ed with the divers ity of State and lo cal regulation. Your analysis should consider the possibility of re ducing as well as expanding State and local rulem aking. The role of Federal regulation in facilitating U.S. particip ation in global markets should also be considered. Harmonization of U.S. and i nternational rules m ay require a strong Federal regulatory role. Concerns that new U.S. rules could act as non-tariff ba rriers to im ported goods should be evaluated carefully. The Presumption Against Economic Regulation Governm ent actions can be unintentionally ha rmful, and even useful regulations can impede m arket efficiency. For this reason, ther e is a presum ption agai nst certain types of regulatory action. In light of both econom ic theory and actual experience, a particularly demanding burden of proof is required to dem onstr ate the need for any of the following types of regulations: price contro ls in com petitive m arkets ; 123 production o r sales quotas in com petitive m arkets ; mandatory uniform quality stand ards for goods or services if the potential problem can be adequately dealt with thr ough voluntary standards or by di sclosing inform ation of the hazard to bu yers or us ers; or controls on entry into employm ent or pr oduction, except (a) where indispensable to protect health and safety (e.g., FAA tests for co mmercial pilots) or (b) to m anage the use of comm on property resources (e.g., fisheries, airwaves, Federal lands, and offshore areas ). C. Alternativ e Regulatory Approaches Once you have determ ined that Fed eral regulatory action is appropria te, you will need to consider alternative regulatory approaches. Ordinarily, you wi ll be able to elim inate som e alternatives through a prelim inary analysis, leaving a m anage able number of alternatives to be evaluated according to th e formal principles of the Executive Orde r. The num ber and choice of alternatives selected for detailed analysis is a matter of judgment. There must be some balance between thoroughness and the practical lim its on your analytical capacity. W ith this qualification in mind, you should nevertheless explore m odifi cations of some or all of a regulation =s attributes or provisions to identify appropriate alternatives. The f ollowing is a list o f alterna tive regula tory actions that you should consider. Differen t Choices Defined by Statu te When a statute es tablish es a specific re gulatory requirem ent and the agency is considering a m ore stringent standard, you should exam ine the benefits and costs of reasonable alternatives that reflect the range of the agency =s statutory discretion, including the specific statu tory req uirem ent. Differen t Complianc e Dates The tim ing of a regulation m ay also have an im portant effect on its ne t benefits. Benefits may vary significantly with different com plian ce dates where a delay in im plementation m ay result in a substantial loss in future benefits (e.g., a delay in implem entation could result in a significant reduction in spawning stock and jeopard ize a fishery). Similarly, the cost of a regulation m ay vary substantially with different compliance dates for an industry that requires a year or m ore to plan its production runs. In this instance, a regulation that provides sufficient lead tim e is likely to achieve its goals at a m uch lower overall cost th an a regulation that is effective imm ediately. Differen t Enforcemen t Methods Com pliance alte rnatives f or Federal, Stat e, or local enforcem ent include on-site inspections, periodic reporting, and noncom pliance penalties stru ctured to provide the most appropriate incentives. When alte rnative m onitoring and reporting m ethods vary in their benefits and costs, you should identify th e most appropriate enforcem ent fra mework. For exam ple, in 124 some circum stances random monitoring or param etric m onitoring will be less expensive and nearly as effective as continuous m onitoring. Differen t Degrees of S tringency In general, both the benefits and costs associ ated with a regu lation will in creas e with the level of stringency (although marginal costs generally incr ease with stringency, whereas marginal benefits m ay decrease). You should study alternative levels of stringency to understand more fully the relationship between stringency and the size and distribution of benefits and costs among diffe rent groups. Differen t Requirements for Different Sized Firms You should consider setting di fferent requirem ents for large and sm all firm s, basing the requirem ents on estim ated differences in the exp ected co sts of com pliance or in the expected benefits. The balance of benef its and costs can shift depending on the size of the firm s being regulated. Small fir ms may find it more costly to comply with r egulation, especially if there a re large fixed costs required for regulatory com plian ce. On the other hand, it is not efficient to place a h eavier burd en on one segm ent of a regulated indu stry solely b ecause it can b etter afford the higher cost. This has the poten tial to load costs on the m ost productive firm s, costs that are disproportionate to the dam ages they create. You should also rem ember that a rule with a signif icant impact on a s ubstantial n umber of small entities w ill trigger th e requirem ents set f orth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act. (5 U.S.C. 603( c), 604). Differen t Requirements for Different Geographic Regions Rarely do all regions of the country benefit uni form ly from governm ent regulation. It is also unlikely that co sts will be un iform ly distributed across the country. Where there are significant regional variations in benefits and/or costs, you shoul d consider the possibility of setting different requirem ents for the different regions. Performance Standards Rather than Design Standards Perform ance standards express requirem ents in term s of outc omes rather than specifying the m eans to those ends. They are generally supe rior to engin eering o r design stand ards because perform ance standards give the regulated parties the flexibility to achieve regulatory objectives in the m ost cost-effectiv e way. In general, you should take into accoun t both the co st savings to the regu lated parties of the greater flexibi lity and the cos ts of assuring co mpliance th rough monitoring or som e other m eans. Market-Oriented Approaches Rather than Direct Controls Market-oriented approaches that use econom ic incentives should be explored. These alternatives include f ees, penalties, s ubsidies, m arketable perm its or offse ts, changes in liab ility or property rights (including policie s that a lter the incentives o f insurers and insured parties), and required bonds, insurance or warranties. One example of a market-oriented approach is a 125 program that allows for averaging, banking, a nd/or trading (ABT) of credits for achieving additional em ission reductions beyond the required air em ission standards. ABT program s can be extrem ely valuable in reducing costs or achiev ing earlier or greater bene fits, par ticularly when the costs of achieving compliance vary across production lin es, facilities, or firm s. ABT can be allowed on a plant-wide, firm -wide, or region-wide basis ra ther than vent by vent, provided this does not pro duce unacceptable local air quality o utcom es (such as A hot spots @ from local pollution co ncentr ation ). Information al Measures Rather than Regulatio n If intervention is contemplated to ad dress a m arket failu re that arises from inadequate or asymm etric inform ation, inform ational rem edies will often be preferred. Measures to im prove the availability of information include governm ent establishm ent of a st andardized testing and rating system (the use of which could be m andatory or voluntary), m andatory disclosure requirem ents (e.g., by advertising, labeling, or enclosures), and governm ent provision of inform ation (e.g., by governm ent publications, tele phone hotlines, or public interest broadcast announcem ents). A regulatory m easure to im prove the availability of in form ation, particularly about the co ncealed characteristics of products , provides consum ers a greater cho ice th an a mandatory product standard or ban. Specific inf ormational m easures should be evalua ted in term s of their benefits and costs. Some effects of infor mational m easures ar e easily overlooked. The costs of a m andatory disclosu re requirem ent for a consumer product w ill includ e not only th e cost of gathering and communicating the required inform ation, but also the loss of net benefits of any infor mation displaced by the m andated inform ation. The other costs also m ay include the effect of providing inform ation that is ignored or m isinterpreted, an d inefficiencies arising from the ince ntive that mandatory disclosure m ay give to overinvest in a particular characteristic of a product or service. Where inform ation on the benefits and costs of alternative info rmational measures is insufficient to provide a clear choice between them, you should consider the least intrusive inform ational altern ative sufficient to accom plish To correct an inform ational m arket failure it m ay be sufficien t for governm ent to esta blish a standardized testing and rating system without m andating its use, because com peting firm s that sco re well accord ing to the system should thereby ha ve an incentiv e to publicize th e fact. D. Analytical Approaches Both benefit-cost analysis (BCA) and co st-effectiveness analysis (CEA) provide a ework tifyin alterna tive regulatory choices. A major rulem aking should be supported by both types of analysis wherever possible. Specifically, you should prepare a CEA for all m ajor rulem akings for which the prim ary benefits are im proved public health and sa fety to the extent that a valid effectiveness measure can be developed to represent expected health and safety outcom es. You should also perform a BCA for m ajor health and safety rulemaki ngs to the extent that valid m onetary values can be assigned to the prim ary expected hea lth and safety outcom es. In undertaking these analyses, it is im portant to keep in m ind the larger objective of anal ytical consistency in 126 estim ating benefits and costs across regulations a nd agencies, subject to statutory lim itations. Failure to maintain such consistency m ay preven t achievem ent of the m ost risk reduction for a given level of resource expenditure. For all other m ajor rulem akings, you should carry out a BCA. If som e of the prim ary benefit categorie s cannot be expressed in monetary units, you should also conduct a C EA. In unusual cases wh ere no quantified information on benefits, costs and effectiveness can be produced, the regulatory analysis should present a qualitative discussion of the issues and evidence. Benefit-Cost Analysis A distinc tive feature of BCA is that both benefits and cost s are expressed in m onetary units, which allows you to evaluate different regula tory options with a vari ety of attributes using a common m easure.70 By m easuring increm ental benefits and costs of successively more stringent regulatory alternatives , you can identify the al ternative that m aximizes net benefits. The size of net benefits, the absolute differe nce b etween the p rojected ben efits and cos ts, indicates whether one policy is more efficient than another. The ratio of benefits to co sts is no t a meaningful indicator of net benefits and should not be used for that purpose. It is well known that considering such ratios alon e can yield m isleading results. Even when a benefit or cost cannot be expr essed in m onetary units, you should still try to measure it in term s of its physical units. If it is not possible to m easure the physical units, you should still describe the benef it or cost qualitatively. For more inform ation on describing qualitative infor mation, see the section \" Develop ing Benefit a nd Cost Estimates. \" When i mportant benefits and costs cannot be expressed in m onetary units, BCA is less useful, and it can even b e misleading , because th e calcu lation of net benefits in such cases does not provide a full evaluation of all relevant benefits and costs. You should exercise professional judgm ent in identifying the im portance of non- quantified factors and assess as best you can how they m ight change the ranking of alternatives based on estim ated net benefits. If the non-qua ntified benefits and costs are likely to be important, you should recommend which of the n on-quantified factors are of sufficient importance to justify considera tion in the regulatory decision. This discussion should also include a clear explanation that support designating these non-quantif ied factors as im portant. In this case, you should also consider conducting a th reshold analysis to help decision makers and other users of the analysis to understand the poten tial significance of thes e factors to the overall analys is. 70 Mish an EJ (1994), Cost-Ben efit sis can p rovide a rigo rous way to identify options that achieve the m ost effective use of the reso urces available without requiring monetization of all of relevant benefits or costs. Generall y, co st-effectiv eness analysis is designed to compare a set of regulatory actions with the sam e prim ary outcom e (e.g., an increase in the acres of wetlands protected) o r multiple o utcom es that can be in tegrated into a single num erical index (e.g., units of health im provem ent). Cost-effectiveness results based on averages ne ed to be treated with great care. They suffer from the sam e drawbacks as b enefit-co st ratio s. The a lternative th at exhib its the sm allest cost-effectiv eness ratio m ay not be the best option, just as th e alternative with the h ighest benefit-cost ratio is not alwa ys the net benefits. cost- effectivenes s analys is (discussed b elow) can help to avoid m istakes that can occur w hen policy choices are based on av erage co st-effectiveness. CEA can also be m isleading when th e Aeffectiven ess@ measure does not appropriately weight the consequences of the altern atives. For exam ple, when effectiveness is m easured in tons of reduced pollutant em issions, cost-effectiv eness es timates will be m isleading unless the reduced em issions of diverse pol lutants resu lt in the sam e health and env ironm ental b enefits. When you have identified a range of alternatives (e.g., different levels of stringency), you should determ ine the cost-effectiven ess of each opti on com pared with the baseline as well as its increm ental cost-effectiv eness com pared with suc cessively more stringent requirem ents. Ideally, your CEA would present an array of cost-effect iveness estim ates that would allow comparison across different alternatives. However, analyzing all possible com binations is not practical when there are m any options (including possible interaction effects). In these cases, you should use your judgm ent to choose reasonable altern atives for careful consideration. When constructing and com paring increm ental cost-effectiveness ratios, you should be careful to d etermine whether the various alternativ es are m utually ex clusive or whether they can be com bined. If they can be com bined, you should consider which might be favored under different regulatory budget constraints (im plicit or explicit). You should also m ake sure that inferior alternatives identified by the principles of strong and weak dom inance are elim inated from consideration.72 The value of CEA is enhanced when there is consisten cy in th e analys is across a div erse set of possible regulatory actions. To achieve consistency, you need to carefully construct the two key components of any CEA: the cost and the Aeffectiveness@ or perf ormance m easures for the alternative policy options. 71 For a full disc ussion of CE A, see Gold, ML , Siegel, JE, R ussell, LB, a nd Weinstein, MC (1996), Cost Effectiven ess in Health and Medicine: The Repo rt of the Panel on Cost-Effectiven ess in Health and Medicine, Oxford University Press, Ne w Yo rk. 72 Gold ML , Siegel JE, Russell LB, a nd Weinstein MC ( 1996), Cost Effectiveness in Healt h and Medicine: The Report of the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Me dicine , Oxford University Press, New York, pp. 284- 285. 128 With regard to m easuring costs, you should be sure to include all the relevant costs to society B whether public or private. Rulem akings may also yield cost savings (e.g., energy savings associated with new tec hnologies). The num erator in the cost-ef fectiveness ratio should reflect n et costs, defined as the gro ss cost in curred to com ply with the req uirem ents (s ometimes called Atotal@ costs) m inus any cost savings. You should be careful to avoid double-counting effects in both the num erator and the denom inator of the cost-effectivenes s ratios. For exam ple, it would be incorrect to reduce gross costs by an estim ated monetary v alue on life extension if life-years are already us ed as the eff ectiv eness m easure in the denom inator. easures of Aeffectiv eness @, final outcom es, such as lives saved or life- years sav ed, are preferred to m easures of interm ediate outputs, such as tons of pollution reduced, crashes avoided, or cas es of dis ease avoided. Where th e quality of the m easured un it varies (e.g., acres of wetlands vary substantially in term s of their e cologic al benef its), it is im portant tha t the measure capture the variability in the value of the selec ted Aoutcom e@ measure. You should provide an explanation of your c hoice of effectiveness m easure. Where regulation m ay yield several different beneficial ou tcomes, a cost-effectivenes s comparison becom es more difficult to interpret because there is m ore than one m easure of effectivenes s to inco rporate in the an alysis. To arrive at a sin gle m easure you will need to weight the v alue of disparate b enefit catego ries, but this com putation ra ises som e of the sam e difficulties y ou will enco unter in BCA. If you can assign a reasonable m onetary v alue to all of the regu lation=s different benefits, th en you should do s o. But in this case, you will be doing BCA, not CEA. When you can estim ate the m onetary value of some but not all of the ancillary benefits of a regulation, but cannot assign a m onetary value to the prim ary m easure of effectiveness, you should subtract the m onetary estim ate of the ancillary benefits from the gross cost estim ate to yield an estim ated net cost. (This n et cost es timate for the rule m ay turn out to be negative B that is, the m onetized b enefits exceed the cost of the rule.) If you are unab le to estim ate th e value of some of the ancillary benefits, the cost-effectiveness ratio will be overstated, and this should be acknowledged in your analysis. CEA does not yield an unambiguous choice when there are benefits or costs that have not been incorporated in the net-co st estim ates. You also may use CEA to compare regulatory alternat ives in cas es where the s tatute specifies the level of benefits to be achieved. The Effectiveness Metric for Public Health and Safety Rulemakings When CEA is applied to public health and sa fety rulem akings, one or m ore measures of effectivenes s must be selected that p ermits com parison of reg ulato ry alternative s. Agencies curren tly us e a variety o f effectiveness m easures. There are relatively sim ple m easures such as the num ber of lives saved, cases of cancer reduced, and cases of paraplegia prevented. Sometim es these m easures account only f or mortality inf ormation, such as the number of lives saved and the num ber of years of life saved. 129 There are also m ore comprehensive, integ rated m easures of effectivenes s such as th e num ber of \"equivalent lives\" (ELs) saved and the num ber of \"quality-adjus ted life years\" (QALYs) saved. The m ain advantage of the integrated m easures of effectiveness is th at they account f or a rule's impact on m orbidity (nonfat al illness, injury, im pairment and quality of life) as well as prem ature death. The in clusion of morbidity eff ects is im portant becau se (a) som e illnesses (e.g., asthm a) cause m ore instances of pain and su ffering than they do prem ature death, (b) som e population groups are known to experience elevated rates of morbidity (e.g, the elderly and the poor) and thus have a strong inte rest in m orbidity measurem ent73, and (c) som e regulatory alternatives m ay be more effective at preven ting morbidity th an prem ature death (e.g., som e advanced airbag designs m ay diminish the nonfatal injuries caused by airbag inflation without changing the frequency of fatal in jury prevented by airbags). However, the m ain drawback of thes e integ rated m easures is that they m ust meet some restric tive as sumptions to repres ent a valid m of individ ual preferen ces.74 For example, a QALY measure im plicitly assum es that the f raction of re maining lifespan an individual would give up for an im prove ment in health-related qu ality of life does not depend on the rem aining lifespan. Thus, if an individual is willing to give up 10 years of life am ong 50 rem aining years for a given health im provem ent, he or she would al so be willing to give up 1 year of lif e am ong 5 remaining years. To the extent that indivi dual preferences deviate from these assum ptions, analytic results from CEA using QALYs could di ffer from analytic results based on willingness- to-pay-m easures.75 Though willingn ess to pay is g enerally th e preferred econom ic method for evaluating preferences, the CEA m ethod, as applie d in m edicine and health, does not evaluate health chang es using ind ividual willin gness to pay . When perform ing CEA, you should consid er using at least one integrated m easure of effectiven ess when a rule creates a significan t impact on both m ortality and m orbidity. When CEA is perform ed in specific rulem aking contexts, you should be prepared to make appropriate adjustm ents to ensure fair treatm ent of all segm ents of t he population. Fairness is important in the choice and execution of effectiv eness m easures. For example, if QALYs are used to evaluate a lifesaving rule ai med at a population that happens to experience a high rate of disability (i.e., where the rule is not designed to affect the disa bility), the n umber of life years saved should n ot necessarily be dim inished sim ply because the rule sav es the lives of people with life-shortening disabili ties. Both analytic sim plicity and fairness suggest that the estim ated number of life years saved for the di sabled population should be based on average life expectan cy infor mation for the relev ant age coho rts. More generally, when num eric adjustm ents are m ade for life expectancy or quality of life, analysts should prefer use of population averages rather than infor mation derived from subgroups dom inated by a particular dem ographic or incom e group. 73 Russell LB and Sisk JE (2000), \"Modeling Age Differences in C ost Effectiveness Analysis\", Interna tional Journal of Technology Assess ment in Heal th Care, 16(4), 1158-1167. 74 Plisk in JS, Shep stein MC (1980), \"U tility Fun ctions Re h, WTP,\" Risk Analysis, 22(5), pp. 985 -1002. 130 OMB does not require agencies to use any speci fic m easure of effectivenes s. In fact, OMB encourages ag encies to repo rt results with multiple m easures of effectiv eness that of fer different insights and perspectives . The regulatory analysis shoul d explain which m easures were selected and why, and how they were im plemented. The analytic discretion provide d in choice of effectivene ss measure will create som e inconsis tency in how agencies evalu ate the sam e injuries and diseases, an d it will be d ifficult for OMB and the public to draw m eaningful co mparisons between rulem akings that em ploy different effectiv eness m easures. As a result, ag encies sho uld use th eir web site to provide OMB and the public with the underlying data, incl uding m ortality and m orbidity data, the age distribution of the affected populatio ns, and the severity and duration of disease cond itions and traum a, so that OMB and the public can cons truct apples-to-apples com parisons between rulem akings that em ploy different measures. There are sensitiv e techn ical and ethical issues as sociated with choosing o ne or m ore of these integrated m easures for use throughout the Fe deral governm ent. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) m ay assem ble a panel of specialists in cost-ef fectivene ss analys is and bioeth ics to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of these different m easures and other m easures that have been s uggested in the academ ic literatur e. OMB believ es that the IOM guidance will provide Federal agencies and OMB useful insi ght into how to im prove the m easure ment of effectivenes s of public h ealth and safety regulations. Distribution al Effects Those who bear the costs of a regulation and those who enjoy its be nefits often are not the sam e people. The term Adistributional effect @ refers to the im pact of a regulatory action across the p opulation an d econom y, divided up in various ways (e.g., incom e groups, race, sex, industrial sector, geography). Benefits and costs of a regula tion m ay also be distributed unevenly over tim e, perhaps spanning several generations. Distributional effects m ay arise through @ transfer paym ents@ that stem from a regulatory action as well. For exam ple, the revenue co llected throug h a fee, su rcharge in excess of the cost of services provided, or tax is a transfer p ayment. Your regulatory analysis shoul d provide a separate descript ion of distributional effects (i.e., how both benefits and cost s are distributed among sub-populations of particular concern) so that decision makers can properly consider them along with the effects on econom ic efficiency. Executive O rder 12866 authorizes this approach. Where distributive effects are thought to be important, the effects of various regulatory altern atives should be descri bed quantitatively to the extent possible, including the m agnitude, like lihood, and severity of im pacts on particular groups. You should be alert for situ ations in which regulatory alte rnatives result in significant changes in treatm ent or outcom es for different groups. Effects on the distribution of incom e that are transm itted through changes in m arket prices can be im portant, albeit som etimes difficult to assess. Your analysis should also present info rmation on the stream s of benefits and costs over time in order to provide a ba sis for assessing intertem poral distributional consequences, particularly where interg enera tional effects are concerned. 131 E. Identifying and Measuring Benefits and Costs This Section provides guidelines for your prep aration of the benefit and cost estim ates required by Executive O rder 12866 and the ARegulatory Right-to-Know Act. @ The discussions in previous sections will help you identify a workab le num ber of alternatives for consideration in your analysis and an appropriate analytical approach to use. General Issues 1. Scope of Analysis Your analysis should focus on benefits and cost s that accrue to citi zens and residents of the United S tates. Where you choose to evaluate a regulation that is likely to have effects beyond the borders of the United States, these eff ects should be reported separately. The tim e frame for your analysis should cover a period long enough to encom pass all the im portant benefits and costs likely to result from the rule. 2. Developing a Baseline You need to m easure the benefits and costs of a rule against a baseline. This baseline should be the best assessm ent of the way the world would look absent the proposed action. The choice of an appropriate baseline may require consideration of a wide range of potential factors, including: evolution of the m arket, changes in external facto rs affecti ng expected benefits and costs, changes in regulations prom ulgated by the ag ency or other governm ent entities, and the degree o f com pliance by regulated entitie s with oth er regulations. It may be reasonable to forecas t that the wo rld abs ent the regulation will resem ble the present. If this is the case, however, your base line should reflect the future effect of current governm ent program s and policies. For review of an existing regulation, a baseline assum ing Ano change @ in the regulatory program generally provi des an appropriate basis for evaluating regulatory alternatives. When m ore than one ba seline is reasonable and the choice of baseline will sign ificantly affect estim ated benefits and co sts, you sho uld consid er measuring benefits and costs against alternative baselines. In doing so you can analy ze the effects on benefits and costs of making different assumptions about other agencies = regulations, or the degree of compliance with your own existing rules. In all cases, you must evaluate bene fits and costs against the sam e baseline. You should also discuss th e reason ableness of the b aselines used in the s ensitivity analyses. For each baseline you use, you should id entify the key uncertainties in your forecast. EPA =s 1998 final PCB disposal rule provides a good exam ple of using different baselines. EPA used several alternative baselines, each reflecting a d ifferent interpretation of existing regulatory requirem ents. In part icular, one baseline reflected a litera l interpretation of EPA =s 1979 rule and another the actual im plem entation of that rule in the year immediately preceding the 1998 rev ision. The u se of m ultiple baselines i llustrated th e substan tial effect changes in 132 EPA =s implementation policy could have on the cost of a regulatory program . In the years after EPA adopted the 1979 PCB disposal rule, change s in EPA policy -- especially allowing the disposal of autom obile Ashredder fluff @ in m unicipal landfills -- re duced the cost of the program by m ore than $500 m illion per year. In som e cases, substantial portions of a rule may simply restate statutory requirem ents that would be self-im plem enting, even in the ab sence of the regulatory action. In these cases, you should use a pre-statute baseline. If you are able to separate out those areas where the agency has discretion, you m ay also use a post-st atute baseline to evaluate the discretionary elem ents of the action. 3. Evaluation of Alternatives You should describe the alternatives availa ble to you and the reasons for choosing one alternative over another. As noted previously, alternatives tha t rely on inc entive s and of fer increased flexibility are o ften m ore cost-effectiv e than m ore prescrip tive approaches. For instance, user fees and infor mation dissem ination m ay be good alternativ and- and-control ontrol regulatory progr perfor mance-based standards generally offer advantages over stan dards specifying design, behavior, or m anner of compliance. You should carefully consider all appropriate alternatives for the key attributes or provision s of the rule. The previous discuss ion outlines exam ples of appr opria te alter native s. Where there is a Acontinuum @ of alternatives for a standard (s uch as the level of stringency), you generally should analyze at least three options: the preferred option; a more stringent option that achieves ad dition al ben efits (and p resum ably co sts m ore) beyond those realized by th e preferred option; and a less stringent option that costs less (and presum ably generates fewer benefits) than the preferred option. You should choose reasonable alternatives de serving careful consideration. In som e cases, a regu latory progr am will f ocus on an option that is ne ar or a t the lim it of technical feasibility. In this case, the analysis would not need to exam ine a m ore stringent option. For each of the options an alyzed, you sh ould com pare the an ticipated benefits to the co rresponding costs. It is not adequate sim ply to report a com parison of the agency =s preferred option to the chosen baseline. Whene ver you report the benefi ts and costs of alternative options, you should present both total and in crem ental benefits and costs. You should present increm ental benefits and costs as differences from the corresponding estim ates associated with th e next less-stringent alternative.76 It is im portant to em phasize that in crem ental effects are sim ply differences between successively more st ringen t alternatives. Results inv olving a co mparison to a Anext best @ altern ative m ay be especially u seful. 76 For t he least st ringent altern ative, you shou ld esti mate the benefits and costs relativ e to the baselin e. Thus, for this alternative, t he increm ental effects woul d be the sam e as the corres ponding totals. For each altern ative that is m ore strin gent than the least string ent altern ative, you should estimate th e increm ental benefits and costs relativ e to the closest less-st ringent altern ative. 133 In som e cases, you m ay decide to analyze a wide array of options. In 1998, DOE analyzed a large num ber of options in setting ne w energy efficien cy stan dards for ref rigerato rs and freezers and produced a rich am ount of inform ation on their relativ e effects. This analysis -- exam ining more than 20 alternative perform ance standards for one class of refrigerators with top-m ounted freezers -- enabled DOE to select an option th at produced $20 0 more in estim ated net benefits per refrigerator than the least attractive option. You should analyze the benefits and costs of different regulatory provisions separately when a rule includes a n umber of distinct provisions. If the existe nce of one provision affects the benefits or costs arising f rom another provision, the analysis becom es more com plicated, but the need to exam ine provisions separately rem ains. In this case, you should evaluate each specific provision by determ ining the net benefits of the proposed regulation with and without it. Analyzing all possible com binati ons of provisions is im practi cal if the nu mber is la rge and interaction effects are widespread. You need to use judgm ent to select the m ost significant or relevant provisions for such analysis. You are e xpected to d ocum ent all of the alte rnative s that were consid ered in a list or tab le and which we re selected for em phasis in the m ain analysis. You should also discuss the stat utory requirem ents that affect the selection of regulatory approaches. If legal constraints prevent the sele ction of a reg ulato ry actio n that be st satisfies the philosophy and principles of Executive Order 12866, you should identify these constraints and estim ate their opportunity cost. Such inform ation m ay be useful to Congress under the Regulatory Right-to-Know Act. 4. Transparency and Reproducibility of Results Because of its influen tial nature and its special role in the rule making process, it is appropriate to set m inimum quality s tandards for regulatory analysis. You should pro vide docum entation that the analysis is based on the best reasonably obtainabl e scien tific, technical, and economic inform ation available. To ach ieve this, you should rely on peer-reviewed literature, w here available, and provide the source for all original inform ation. A good analysis should be transparent and your results m ust be reproducible. You should clearly set out the basic assum ptions, m ethods, a nd data underlying the anal ysis and discuss the uncertainties associated with the estim ates. A qu alified third party readin g the analysis should be able to understand the basic elem ents of your analysis and the way in which you developed your estim ates. To provide greater access to your analysis, you should gene rally post it, with all the supporting docum ents, on the internet so the publi c can review the findings. You should also disclose the use of outside consultants, thei r qualifications, and hist ory of contracts and employm ent with the ag ency (e.g., in a preface to the RIA). Where other com pelling interests (such as privacy, intellectual prope rty, trade s ecrets, etc.) p reven t the public release of data or key elem ents of the analysis, you should apply esp ecially rigorous robustn ess checks to analytic results and docum ent the analytical checks used. 134 Finally, you should assure com pliance with th e Infor mation Quality Guidelines for your agency and OMB =s AGuideline s for Ensuring and Maxim izing the Quality, Objectiv ity, Utility, and Integrity of Infor mation Dissem inated by Federal Agencies @ (Adata quality guidelines @) http://www.whitehouse.gov/om b/fed reg/reproducible.htm l. Developing Benefit and Cost Estima tes 1. Some General Considerations The analysis docum ent should discuss the expe cted benefits and costs of the selected regulatory option and any reasonable alternatives. How is the proposed action expected to provide the anticipated benefits and costs? What are th e monetiz ed value s of the pote ntial real increm ental benefits and costs to societ y? To present your results, you should: include separate schedules of the m onetized benefits and costs that show the type and timing of be nefits and costs, and express the estimates in this table in constant, undiscounted dollars (for m ore on discounting see \" Discount Rates \" below); list the benefits and costs you can quantify, but cannot m onetize, including their tim ing; describe benefits and costs you cannot quantify; and identify or cross-reference the data or st udies on which you base the benefit and cost estim ates. When benefit and cost estim ates are uncertain (f or more on this see \" Treatment of Uncertain ty\" below), you should report benefit and cost estim ates (including benefits of risk reductions) that reflect the full probability di stribution of potential consequences. Where possible, p resent probab ility d istribu tions of be nefits and cos ts and includ e the upper and lower bound estim ates as com plements to cent ral tendency and other estim ates. If funda mental scientific disagreem ent or lack of knowledge preven ts construction of a scien tifically defensible probability distribut ion, you should describ e benefits or cos ts under plausib le scenarios and characterize the evid ence and assum ptions underlying each alternative scenario. 2. The Key Concepts Needed to Estim ate Benefits and Costs \"Opportunity cost @ is the appropriate concept for valu ing both benefits and costs. The principle of Awillingness -to-pay @ (WTP) captures the notion of opportunity cost by m easuring what individuals are willing to for go to enjoy a particular benefit. In general, econom ists tend to view W TP as the m ost appropriate m easur e of opportunity cost , but an individual =s Awillingn ess\u00ad to-accept@ (WTA) com pensation for not receiving th e improvem ent can also provide a valid measure of opportunity cost. WTP and WTA are comparable m easures unde r special circum stances. WTP and WTA measures may be com parable in the f ollowing s ituations: if a regulation affects a price change rathe r than a quantity ch ange; th e change being e valuated is s mall; there a re reasonably close 135 substitute s availab le; an d the incom e effect is s mall.77 Howe ver, em pirical evidence from experim ental econom ics and psychology shows that even when incom e/wealth effects are \"small\", the m easured differences between W TP and W TA can be large.78 WTP is generally considered to be m ore readily m easurable. Adoption of WTP as the m easure of value im plies that individual preferences of the affected population should be a guiding factor in the regulatory analys is. Market p rices provide rich data f or estimating be nefits and co sts based on willingn ess-to- pay if the goods and services affected by the regulation are traded in well-functioning competitive m arkets. The opportun ity cost of an alternative includes the value of the benefits forgone as a result of choosing that alternative. The opportunity cost of banning a product -- a drug, food additiv e, or h azardous ch emical -- is th e forgone net benefit (i. e., lost cons umer and producer surplus79 ) of that product, taking into account the m itigating effects of potential substitute s. The use of any resource has an opportunity co st regardless of whether the resource is already owned or has to be purchased. That opp ortunity cost is equal to the net benef it the resource would have provided in the absence of the requirement. For example, if regulation of an industrial plant affects the use of additiona l land or buildings with in the existing plant boundary, the cost analysis should include the opportunity cost of using the additional land or facilities. To the extent possible, you should monetize a ny such forgone benefits and add them to the other costs of that alternative. You should al so try to m onetize any cost savings as a result of an alternativ e and either add it to the benefits or subtract it from the costs of that altern ative. However, you should not assum e that the Aavoided@ costs of not doing another regulatory alternative represen t the benef its of a regulatory action where there is no direct, necessary relationship between the two. You should also be careful when the costs a voided are attributable to an existing regulation. Even when there is a d irect relatio nship between the two regulatory action s, the use of avoided costs is p roblem atic b ecause the existing regu lation m ay not maximize net benefits and thus m ay itself be questionable policy. (See the section, ADirect Use of Market Data, @ for more deta il.) Estim ating benefits and costs when market pr ices are hard to m easure or m arkets do not exist is m ore difficult. In these cases, you need to develop appropriate proxies that simulate market exchange. Estim ates of willingness-to-p ay based on revealed preference m ethods can be quite useful. As one example, analysts som etimes use Ahedonic price equations @ based on multiple reg ression analysis of market behav ior to simulate m arket price s for the co mmodity of interest. The hedonic technique allo ws analysts to develop an estim ate of the price for specific 77 See Hanem ann WM (1991), American Economic Review , 81(3), 635-647. 78 See Kahnem an D, and Thale r RH (1991) , \"Anomalies: The Endowment Effect, L oss Aversion, a nd Status Qu o Bias,\" Journal of Economic Pers pectives 3( 1), 192-206. 79 Consum er su rplus is the difference between what a consumer pay s for a unit of a good and the maximum amount the con sumer wou ld be willin g to pay for that un it. It is measu red by the area between th e price and the demand curve for that unit. Producer surplus is the difference between the amount a producer is paid for a unit of a good and the minimum amount the producer would acc ept to supply that unit. It is measured by the area between the price and the supply curv e for that unit. 136 attributes associated with a product. For inst ance, a house is a product ch aracterized by a variety of attributes including the num ber of room s, total floor area, and t ype of heating and cooling. If there are enough data on transactio ns in the housing m arket, it is possible to develop an estim ate of the im plicit pr ice for specif ic attributes, such a s the im plicit price of an a ddition al bathroom or for central air conditioning. This technique can be extended, as well, to develop an estim ate for the im plicit price of public goods th at are not directly traded in m arkets. An analyst can develop implicit price estim ates for public go ods like air quality and access to pu blic parks b y assessing the effects of these goods on the housing m arket. Going through the analytical process of deriving benefit estim ates by sim ulating m arkets may also suggest alternative regulatory strategies th at create such m arkets. You need to guard against double-counting, sinc e som e attributes are em bedded in other broader m easures. To illustrate, when a regula tion im proves the quality of the environm ent in a community, the valu e of real estate in the co mmunity generally rises to ref lect the greater attractivenes s of living in a better env ironm ent. Simply adding the increase in property values to the estim ated value of improved public health would be double counting if the increase in property values reflects the im provem ent in pub lic health. To avoid this problem you should separate the em bedded e ffects on the value of prop erty arising from improved public health. At the sam e time, an analy sis that fails to incorporate the cons equence of lan d use chang es when accounting for costs will not capture the full effects of regulation. 3. Revealed Preference Methods Revealed preference m ethods develop estim ates of the value of goods and services -- or attributes of those goods and services -- based on actual m arket decisions by consum ers, workers and other m arket participants. If the m arket part icipant is well inform ed and confronted with a real choice, it m ay be feasible to determ ine accu rately and precisely the monetary value needed for a rulem aking. There is a large and well-deve loped literature on reveal ed preference in the peer-reviewed, applied econom ics literature. Although these m ethods are well grounded in econom ic theory, they are som etimes difficult to implem ent given the com plexity of ma rket transactions and th e paucity of relevant data. When designing or evaluating a revealed preference study, the following principles should be considered: the m arket s hould be co mpetitiv e. If the m isn =t com petitiv e (e.g., m you should consider m aking adju stments such that the price reflects the true value to society (often called the A shadow price @); the m arket should not exhibit a significant information gap or asymm etric inform ation problem . If the m arket suffers from information problem s, then you should discuss the divergence of the price from the underlyi ng shadow price and consider possible adjustm ents to reflect th e underlying shadow price; the m arket should not exhibit an externality. In this case, you should discuss the divergence of the price from the underlyi ng shadow price and consider possible adjustm ents to reflect th e underlying shadow price; the specific m arket participants being studi ed should be representative of the target 137 populations to be affected by the rulem aking under consideration; a valid research design and fra mework for anal ysis should be adopted. Exam ples include using data and/or m odel specifications that includ e the m arkets for substitute and complementary goods and services and using reasonably unrestricted functional forms. When specifying substitute and com plem entary goods, the analysis should preferably be based on data about the range of alternatives perceived by m arket part icipants. If such data are not available, you should adopt plausible assum ptions and describe the limitations o f the analys is. the statistical and econom etric m odels em ploye d should be appropriate for the application and the resulting estim ates should be robust in response to plausi ble changes in m odel specification and estim ation technique; and the results should be consis tent with econom ic theory. You should also determ ine whether there are multiple revealed-preferen ce studies of the same good or service and whether anything can be learned by com paring the m ethods, data and findings from different studies . Professional judgm ent is re quired to determ ine whether a particular study is of sufficient quality to justif y use in regulatory anal ysis. When studies are used in regulatory analysis despite their technical weaknesses (e.g., due to the absence of other evidence), the regulatory analysis should discuss a ny biases or uncertainties that are likely to arise due to those weaknesses. If a study has m ajor weaknesses, the study should not be used in regulatory analysis. a. Direct Uses of Market Data Econom ists ordinarily consider m arket pr ices as the m ost accurate m easure of the marginal value of goods and services to society. In som e instances, however, m arket prices m ay not reflect the true value of goods and services due to m arket im perfections or governm ent intervention. If a regulation involves changes to goods or services where the m arket price is not a good m easure of the value to society, you should use an estim ate that reflects the shadow price. Suppose a particular air pollutant dam ages crops . One of the benefits of contro lling that pollutant is the value of the crop yield increase as a result of the controls. That value is typically measured by the price of the crop. However, if the price is held above the m arket price by a governm ent program that affects supply, a value estim ate based on this price m ay not reflect the true benefits of controlling the pollutant. In this case, you should calcula te the value to society of the increase in crop yields by estim ating the sha dow price, which reflects the value to society of the m arginal use of the crop. If the m arginal use is for exports, you should use the world price. If the m arginal use is to add to very large surplus stoc kpiles, you should use the value of the last units released from storage minus storag e cost. If stockpiles are large and growing, the shadow price m ay be low or even negative. Other goods whose m arket prices m ay not refl ect their true value include those whose production or consum ption results in substantial (1) positive or negative external effects or (2) transfer p ayments. For exam ple, the observed market price of gasoline may not reflect m arginal social value due to the inclus ion of taxes, other governm ent interventions, and negative externalities (e.g., pollution). This shadow pric e may also be needed for goods whose m arket price is substantially affected by existing regulations that do not m aximize net benefits. 138 b. Indirect Uses of Market Data Many goods or attributes of goods that are affected by regulation--such as preserving environm ental or cu ltural am not trad ed direc tly in m arkets. The value f or these goods or attributes arise both fr om use and non-use. Estim ation of these values is difficult because of the absence o f an organized m arket. However, overlook ing o r ignoring th ese valu es in your regulatory analysis m ay significantly under state the benefits and/ or costs of regulatory action. AUse values @ arise where an individual derives satisf action from using the resource, either now or in the future. Use values are associ ated w ith activities such as swimming, hunting, and hiking where the individual m akes use of the natural environm ent. \"Non-use values @ arise w here an individual p laces va lue on a resource, good or service even though the individual will not use the re source, now or in the future. Non-use value includes bequest and existence values. General altruism for the health and welfare of others is a closely related concept but m ay not be strictly considered a Anon-use@ value.80 A general concern for the welfare of others should supplem ent benefits and costs equa lly; hence, it is not necessary to m easure the size o f general altruism in regulatory analysis. If there is eviden ce of selective altruism , it need s to b e considered s pecifically in both benefits and costs. Some goods and services are indirectly traded in markets, which m eans that their value is reflected in the prices of related goods and services that are directly traded in m arkets. Their use values are typically estim ated through revealed preference m ethods. Exam ples include ates of the values ental menities derive d from travel-cost stud ies, and hedonic price models that m easure differences or changes in the value of real es tate. It is im portant that you utilize revealed preference m odels that adhere to econom ic criteria th at are consistent with utility maximizing behavior. Also, you should take partic ular care in designing protocols for reliably estim ating the values of these attribu tes. 4. Stated Preference M ethods Stated Preference M ethods (SPM) have been developed and used in the peer-reviewed literature to estim ate both Ause@ and A non-use@ values of goods and services. They have also been widely used in regulatory analyses by Fede ral agencies, in part, because these m ethods can be creatively em ployed to address a wide variety of goods and servic es that are not easy to study through revealed preference m ethods. The distinguishing feature of these methods is that hypothetical ques tions about use or non- use values a re posed to s urvey respo in order to ob tain relevant to Some examples of SPM includ e contingent valuation, conjoin t analysis and ris k-trad eoff analysis. The surveys use d to obta in the health-utility v alues 80 See McConn ell K E (19 97), Journal of Environmental Econ omics and Ma nagement, 32, 22-37. 139 used in CEA are sim ilar to stated-preference su rveys but do not entail m onetary m easurem ent of value. Nevertheless, the princi ples governing quality stated-preference research, with som e obvious exceptions involving m oneti zation, are also relevant in de signing quality health-utility research. When you are designing or evaluating a stated -preference study, the following principles should be considered: the good or service being eval uated should be explained to the respondent in a clear, complete and objective fashion, and the su rvey instrum ent should be pre-tested; willingn ess-to-pay ques tions should be designe d to focus the respondent on the reality of budgetary lim itations and alerted to the availability of substitute goods and alternative expenditure options; the survey instrum ent should be designe d to probe beyond general attitudes (e.g., a \"warm glow\" effect for a particular use or non-use value) and focus on the m agnitude of the respondent' s econom ic valuation; the analytic results should be consistent w ith econom ic theory using both \"internal\" (within respondent) and \"external\" (betw een respondent) scope tests such as the willingn ess to pay is larg er (sm aller) when m ore (less) of a go od is provid ed; the subjects being interviewed should be selected/sam pled in a statistically appropriate manner. The sam ple fram e should adequately cover the target population. The sample should be drawn using probability m ethods in o rder to gen eralize the re sults to the target population; response rates should be as high as reasonably possible. Best survey practices should be followed to achieve high response rates. Low response rates increase the potential for bias and raise concerns about the generalizabil ity of the results. If response rates are not adequate, you should conduct an analysis of non-response bias or further study. Caution should be used in assessing the representa tiveness of the sample based solely on demographic profiles. Statistical adjust ments to reduce non-response bias should be undertaken whenever feas ible and appropriate; the m ode of adm inistration of surveys (in- person, phone, m ail, com puter, internet or multiple m odes ) should be appropriate in light o f the nature of the questions being po sed to respondents and the length and co mplexity of the instrum ent; docum entation should be provided about the ta rget population, the sam pling fra me used and its coverage of the target population, the design of the sample including any stratification or clus tering, the cum ulative res ponse rate (including re sponse rate at each stage of selection if appli cable); the item non-response rate for critical questions; the exact wording and sequence of questions and other inform ation provided to respondents; and the training of interviewers and t echniques they em ployed (as appropriate); the statistical and econom etric m ethods used to analyze the collected data should be transparen t, well suited for the an alysis, and applied with rigor and care. Professional judgm ent is necessary to apply thes e criteria to one or m ore studies, and thus there is no m echanical for mula that can be used to determ ine whether a particular study is of sufficient qu ality to ju stify use in reg ulato ry analysis. When studies are used despite having weaknesses on one or more of these criteria, those weaknesses should be acknowledged in the 140 regulatory analysis, including any re sulting b iases or uncer tainties that are likely to r esult. If a study has too m any weaknesses with unknown consequences for the quality of the data, the study should not be used. The challenge in designing quality stated-pre ference studies is arguably greater for non- use values and unfa miliar use valu es than for familiar goods o r serv ices th at are traded (directly or indirectly ) in m arket transactions. The good being valu ed m ay have little m eaning to respondents, and respondents m ay be for ming their va luations for the first tim e in response to the questions posed. Since these values are eff ectively constructed by the respondent during the elicitation, the instrum ent and m ode of adm inistra tion should be rigorousl y pre-tested to m ake sure that responses are not sim ply an artifact of specific features of instrum ent design and/or mode of adm inistration. Since SPM generate data from respondents in a hypothetical sett ing, often on com plex and unfa miliar goods, special care is dem anded in th e design and execution of surveys, analysis of the results, and characterization of the uncer tainties. A stated-preference study m ay be the only way to obtain quantitative inform ation a bout non-use values, though a num ber based on a poor quality study is no t necessarily superior to n o num ber at all. Non-use values that are not quantified should be presented as an \"intangible\" be nefit or cost. If both revea led-preferen ce and state d-preferen ce studies tha t are direc tly applic able to regulatory analysis are availabl e, you should consider both ki nds of evidence and compare the findings. If the results diverg e significantly, you should com pare the overall size and quality of the two bodies of evidence. Othe r things equal, you s hould prefer revealed preference data over stated preference data because revealed preference data are based on actual decisions, where market participants enjoy or suffer the consequences of their decisions. This is no t generally th e case for respondents in stated preference survey s, where respondents m ay not have sufficient incentives to offer thoughtful respon ses that are more consistent w ith their preferences or m ay be inclined to b ias their resp onses for one reason or another. 5. Benefit-Transfer Methods It is often preferable to collect origin al data on revealed p reference o r stated preference to support regulatory analysis. Yet conducting an orig inal study m ay not be fe asible due to the tim e and expense involved. One alternative to conduc ting an original study is the use of \"benefit transfer\" m ethods. (The transfer m ay involve co st determ ination as well). The practice of Abenef it transfer@ began with transferring ex isting estim ates o btained from indirect market and stated preference stud ies to new contexts (i .e., the context posed by the rulem aking). The principles that guide transferri ng es timates from indirect m arket and s tated preference s tudies should apply to direct m arket studies as well. Although benefit-transfer can provide a quick, low-cost a pproach for obtaining desired monetary values, the m ethods are often associat ed with uncertainties a nd potential biases of unknown magnitude. It should theref ore be treated as a last-resort option and not used without explicit justification. 141 In conducting benefit transfer, the first step is to specify the value to be estim ated for the rulem aking. You should identify the relevant m easur e of the policy change at this initia l stage. For instance, you can derive the relevant willingness-to-pay m easure by specifying an indirect utility function. This identification allows you to Azero in @ on key aspects of the benefit transfer. The next step is to identify appropriate stud ies to conduct benefit tr ansfer. In selecting transfer studies for either point transf ers or function transfers, you s hould base your choices on the followin g criter ia: The selected studies should be based on ad equate data, sound and defensible em pirical methods and techniques. The selected studies should docum ent param eter estim ates of the valuation function. The study context and policy context should have similar populations (e.g., demographic characteristics). The m arket size (e.g., target population) between th e study site and the policy site should be sim ilar. For exam ple, a study valuing water quality im prove ment in Rhode Islan d should not be used to v alue pol icy that will affect water quality through out the United S tates. The good, and the m agnitude of change in th at good, should be sim ilar in the study and policy contexts. The relevant characteristics of the study and the policy contexts should be sim ilar. For exam ple, the effects exam ined in the original study should be Arevers ible @ or \"irreversible\" to a degree that is sim ilar to the regulatory actions under consideration. The distribution of property ri ghts should be sim ilar so that the analysis uses the sam e welfare m easure. If the property rights in the study context support the use of W TA measures while the rights in the rulem aking context support the use of WTP m easures, benefit transfer is not appropriate. The availability of subs titutes across study and po licy con texts should be sim ilar. If you can choose between transf erring a function or a point es timate, you should transfer the entire dem and function (referred to as benefit function transfer) rather than adopting a single point es timate (referred to as benefit point transfer).81 Finally, you should not use benefit tr ansfer in estim ating benefits if: resources are unique or have uni que attributes. For exam ple, if a policy change affects snowm obile use in Yellowstone National Park, then a study valuing snow mobile use in the state of Michig an sh ould not be used to value change s in snowm obile use in the Yellowstone National Park. If the study exam ines a resource that is uni que or has unique attr ibutes, you should not transfer benefit estim ates or benefit f unctions to value a different resource and vice versa. For exam ple, if a study values visibility improvem ents at the Grand Canyon, these results should not be used to value visibi lity im prove ments in urban areas. There are significant p roblem s with applying an Aex ante @valuation estim ate to an Aex 81 See Loo mis JB (1992), Wate r Res ource s d Ma nagement, 33, 75-93. 142 post @policy context. If a policy yields a significant change in the attributes of the good, you should not use the study estim ates to valu e the change using a benefit transfer approach. You also should not use a value developed from a study involving, sm all m arginal changes in a policy context involving la rge changes in the quantity of the good. Clearly, all of these criteria are difficult to m eet. However, you should attem pt to satisfy as many as possible wh en choosing studies from the existing econom ic literature. Professional judgm ent is required in determ ining whether a part icular transfer is too speculative to use in regulatory analysis. 6. Ancillary Benefits and Countervailing Risks Your analysis should look be yond the direct benefits and di rect costs of your rulem aking and consider any im portant ancillary benefits and countervailing risks. An ancillary benefit is a favorable im pact of the rule that is typically unr elated or secondary to the statutory purpose of the rulem aking (e.g., reduced refinery em issions due to m ore stringent fuel econom y standards for light trucks) while a counter vailing risk is an adverse econom ic, health, safety, or environm ental consequence that occurs due to a rule and is not already accounted for in the direct cost of the rule (e.g., adverse safety im pacts from more stringen t fuel-econom y standards for light trucks). You should begin by considering and perhaps listing the possible an cillary benefits and countervailing risks. However, highly specula tive or m inor consequences m ay not be worth further formal analysis. Analytic priority s hould be given to those ancillary benefits and countervailing risks that are im portant enough to potentially cha nge the rank ordering of the main alterna tives in the a nalysis. In some cases th e mere consideration of these second ary effects m ay help in the generation of a superior regulatory alternativ e with strong ancillary benefits and fewer countervailing risks. For inst ance, a recent study suggested that weight-based, fuel-economy standards could ach ieve energy savings with fewer safety risks and em ploym ent losses than would occur under the current regulatory structure. Like other benefits and costs, an effort s hould be m ade to quantify and m onetize ancillary benefits and countervailing risk s. If monetization is not f easible, quantification should be attem pted through use of inform ative physical units . If both monetization and quantification are not feasible, then these issues should be presented as non-quantified benef its and costs. The same standards of inform ation and analys is quality that apply to direct b enefits and costs should be applied to ancillary benefits and countervailing risks. One way to com bine ancillary benefits and countervailing risks is to ev aluate th ese effects separately and then put both of these eff ects on the benefits side, not on the cost side. Although it is theoretically appr opriate to include disbenefit s on the cost side, legal and programm atic considerations gene rally support subtracting the disb enefits from direct benefits. 7. Methods for Treating Non-Monetized Benefits and Costs 143 Sound quantitative estim ates of benefits and costs , where feasible, are pref erable to qualitative descriptions of benefits and costs because they help decision makers understand the magnitudes of the effects of alternative actions. However, som e important benefits and costs (e.g., privacy protection) m ay be inherently too difficult to quantify or m onetize given current data and m ethods. You should carry out a care ful evaluation of non-quantified benefits and costs. Some authorities82 refer to these non-m onetized and non-quantified effects as \"intangible\". a. Benefits and Costs that are Difficult to Monetize You should monetize quantitative estim ates whenever possible. Use sound and defensible values or procedures to monetize bene fits and cos ts, and ensure that k ey analytical assum ptions are defensible. If monetization is impossible, explain why a nd present all available quantitative inform ation. For exam ple, if you can quantify but cannot m onetize increases in water quality and fish populations resulting fro m water quality regulation, you can describ e benefits in term s of stream miles of im proved water quality for boaters and increases in gam e fish populations for anglers. You should describe the tim ing and likelihood of such effects and avoid double-counting of benefits when estim ates of monetized and physical effects are m ixed in the sam e analysis. b. Benef its and Costs tha t are Dif ficult to Quantif y If you are not able to quan tify the ef fects, you should pres ent any relevant quantitative inform ation along with a description of the unqua ntified effects, such as ecological gains, improve ments in quality of life, and aesthetic beauty. You should provide a discussion of the strengths and lim itations of the qualitative information. This should include inform ation on the key reason(s) why they cannot be quantified. In one instance, you m ay know with certainty the magnitude of a risk to w hich a substantial, but unknown, number of indivi duals are exposed. In another instance, the existence of a risk m ay be based on highly speculative assum ptions, and the magnitude of the risk m ay be unknown. For cases in which the unqua ntified benefits or costs a ffect a policy choice, you should provide a clear explanation of th e rationale behind the choice. Such an explanation could include detailed inform ation on the nature, tim ing, likelihood, location, and distribution of the unquantified benefits and costs. Also, please include a summary tabl e that lists all the unquantified benefits and costs, and use your pr ofessional judgm ent to highlight (e.g., with categories or rank ordering) t hose that you believe are m ost important (e.g., by considering factors such as the degree of certainty, exp ected m agnitude, and reve rsibility of effects). While the focus is often placed on d ifficult to quantify benefits of regulatory action, som e costs are dif ficult to qu antify as well. Certain p ermitting req uirem ents (e.g., EPA =s New Source Review program ) restrict the decisions of producti on facilities to shift to new products and adopt innovative m ethods of production. While these program s may im pose substantial costs on the econom y, it is very difficult to quantify and m onetize these effects. Similarly, regulations that estab lish em ission s tandards for recreation al veh icles, lik e motor bik es, may adversely affect the 82 Mish an EJ (1994), Cost-Ben efit An alysis, fourth edition, Routledge, New York. 144 perform ance of the vehicles in term s of driveab ility and 0 to 60 m iles per hour acceleration. Again, the c ost assoc iated with the lo ss of these attributes m ay be difficult to quantify and monetize. They need to be analyzed qualitatively. 8. Monetizing Health and Safety Benefits and Costs We expect you to provide a be nefit-cost analysis of m ajor health and safety rulem akings in addition to a CEA. The BCA provides ad ditional ins ight because (a) it provid es some indication of what the public is willing to pay for im prove ments in health and safety and (b) it offers additional information on preferences for h ealth using a different research design than is used in CEA. Since the health-preference m ethods used to support CEA and BCA ha ve som e different strengths and drawbacks, it is im portant that you prov ide decision m akers with both perspectives. In monetizin g health b enefits, a W TP measure is the conceptu ally app ropriate m easure as compared to other alternatives (e.g., cost of illness or lifetim e earnings), in part because it attem pts to capture pain and suffering and other quality-of-life effects. Using the WTP m easure for health and safety allows you to directly com pare your results to the other benefits and costs in your analysis, which will typi cally be based on WTP. If well-conducted revealed-preference studies of relevant health and safety risks are available, you should consider using them in developing your monetary estim ates. If appropriate revealed-preference data are not available, you should use valid and relevant data from stated- preference s tudies. You will need to use your pro fessional jud gment when you are faced with limited inform ation on revealed p reference s tudies and substa ntial information based on stated preference s tudies. A key advantage of stated-preference and h ealth-utility m ethods com pared to revealed preference m ethods is that they can be tailored to address the ra nges of probabilities, types of health risks and specific populations affected by your rule. In many rulem akings there will be no relevant inform ation from reveal ed-preference studies. In this situation you should consider comm issioning a stated-preference study or usin g values from published stated-preference studies. For the reasons discu ssed previously, you should be cau tious about using values from stated-preference studies and describe in th e analysis the d rawbacks of this approach. a. Nonfatal Health and Saf ety Risks With regard to nonfatal health and safety risk s, there is enorm ous di versity in the nature and severity of i mpaired health states. A traum atic inju ry tha t can be treate d effectively in the emergency room without hospitaliz ation or long-term care is diffe rent from a traum atic injury resulting in paraplegia. Severity differences are also im portant in evaluation of chronic diseases. A severe bo ut of bronchitis, t hough perhaps less frequent, is f ar more painful and debilitating than the m ore frequent bouts of m ild bronchitis. The duration of an im paired health state, which can range from a day or two to several years or even a lifetime (e.g., birth defects inducing mental retardation), need to be considered carefully. Inform ation on both the severity and 145 duration of an im paired health state is nece ssary before the task of m onetization can be perform ed. When m onetizing nonfatal health effects, it is important to consider two com ponents: (1) the private dem and for prevention of the nonfatal health effect, to be represented by the preferences of the target population at risk, and (2) the net financia l externalities a ssociated with poor health such as net changes in public medical costs and any net changes in econom ic production that are not experien ced by the target population. Revealed-preference or stated- preference s tudies are necessary to estimate the private d emand; health eco nomics data from published sources can typically be used to es timate the financial externalities caused by changes in health status. If you use lite rature values to m onetize nonfatal health and safety risks, it is important to m ake sure that the values you have selected are appropriate f or the severity and duration of health effects to be addressed by your rule. If data are not available to support m onetization, you might consid er an alternative approach that m akes use of h ealth-utility studies. Although the econom ics literature on the monetary valuation of impaired hea lth states is growing, there is a much larger clin ical literature on how patients, providers and com munity residents value diverse health st ates. This literature typically m easures health utilities based on the standard gam ble, the tim e tradeoff or the rating scale m ethods. This health utility inform ation may be com bined with known m onetary values for well-defined health states to estimate m onetary values for a wide range of health states of different severity and duration. If you use this approach, you should be careful to acknowledge your assum ptions and the lim itations of your estim ates. b. Fatality Ris ks Since agencies often design health and safety regulation to reduce risks to life, evaluation of these benefits can be the key part of the anal ysis. A good analysis m ust present these benefits clearly and show their importa nce. Agencies m ay choose to m onetize these benefits. T he willingn ess-to-pay app roach is the best m ethodol ogy to use if reductions in fatality ris k are monetized. Some describe the m onetized value of s mall chan ges in f atality risk as the \"value of statistical life\" (VSL) or, less preci sely, the \"value of a life.\" The latter phrase can be m isleading because it su ggests erron eously th at the monetization exercise tries to p lace a Avalue @ on individu al lives. You should m ake clear that thes e term s refer to the m easurem ent of willingn ess to pay for reductions in only sm all risks of prem ature death. They have no application to an identifiable individual or to very large reductions in i ndividual risks. They do not suggest that any individual= s life can be expressed in m onetary term s. Their sole purpose is to help describe better the likely benefits of a regulatory action. Confusion about the term \"statist ical life\" is also widespread. This term refers to the sum of risk reductions expected in a population. For ex ample, if the annual risk of death is reduced by one in a m illion for each of two m illion people, tha t is said to represe nt two \"statistic al lives \" extended per year (2 m illion peop le x 1/1,000,000 = 2). If the annual risk of death is reduced by one in 10 m illion f or each of 20 m illion people, that also rep resents two statis tical live s extended. 146 The adoptio n of a value f or the proje cted reduction in the ris k of prem ature m ortality is the subject of continuing discus sion within the econom ic and public policy analysis comm unity. A considerable body of academ ic literatu re is av ailable on th is subject. This literatu re involves either explicit or im plicit valuati on of fatality risks, and generally involves the use of estim ates of VSL from studies on wage com pensation for occ upational hazards (which genera lly are in the range of 10-4 annually), on consum er product purchase and use decisions, or from an e merging literature us ing stated preference approaches. A substantial m ajority of the resulting e stimates of VSL vary from roughly $1 m illion to $10 m illion per statistical life.83 There is a continuing debate within the econom ic and public policy analysis comm unity on the m erits of using a single VSL for all situ ations versus adjusting the VSL estim ates to reflect the s pecific ru le context. A variety of factors have been iden tified, includ ing whether th e mortality risk involves sudden death, the fear of cancer, and the extent to which the risk is voluntarily incurred.84 The consensus of EPA =s recent Scien ce Advisory Board (SAB) review of this issue was that the availabl e literature does not support adjust ments of VSL for most of these factors. The panel did conclude that it was appr opria te to ad just VSL to ref lect chan ges in incom e and any tim e lag in the occu rrence of adv erse health effects. The age of the affected population has also been identified as an im portant factor in the theore tical litera ture. However, the e mpirica l evidence on age and VSL is m ixed. In light of the continuing questions over the effect of ag e on VSL estim ates, you should not use an age- adjustm ent factor in an analysis u sing VSL estimates.85 Another way that has been used to express reduc tions in f atality r isks is to use the lif e expectancy m ethod, the Avalue of statistical life-y ears (VSLY) extend ed.@ If a regulation protects individu als whose average rem aining life expectancy is 40 years, a risk re duction of one fatality is expressed as A40 life-years extended. @ Those who favor this a lternative approach emphasize that the valu e of a statistical life is no t a sing le number relevant for all si tuations. In particular, when there are significant diffe rences between the effect on lif e expectancy for the population affected by a particular health ri sk and the populations studied in the labor m arket studies, they prefer to adopt a VSLY approach to reflect those differences. You should consider providing estim ates of both VSL and VSLY, while recognizing the developing state of knowledge in this area. Longevity m ay be only one of a number of rele vant considerations pertaining to the rule. You should keep in m ind that regulations with greater num bers of life-years extended are not necessarily better than regulations with fewer numbers of life-y ears exten ded. In any event, when you present estim ates based on the VS LY m ethod, you should adopt a larger VS LY 83 See Viscusi WK and Aldy JE , Journal of Risk and Uncertainty (forthcoming) and Mro zek JR and Taylor LO (2002), Journal of Policy Analysis a nd Manag ement, 21(2), 253-270. 84 Distinctions between \" \"involuntary\" should be treate d with care . Risks are best consi dered to fall within a continuum from \"vol untary\" to \"involuntary\" with very few ris ks at either e nd of this ra nge. These term s are also related to diffe rences in the cost of avoiding risks. 85 Graham JD (2003), Mem orandum to the Presid Ben efit-Cost Meth ods and Lifesav ing Rules. This memorandum at http://www. whiteho use.gov/omb/inforeg/pm c_be nefit_cost _memo.pdf 147 estim ate citizens because s enior citizen s face larg er overall health risk s from all c auses and they m ay have accu mulated sav ings to spend on their hea lth and s afety.86 The valuatio n of fatality risk r eductio n is an evo lving are a in both resu lts and methodology. Hence, you should utilize valuation m ethods that you consider appropriate for the regulatory circum stances. Since the lite rature-ba sed VSL estim ates m ay not be entire ly appropriate for the risk being evaluated (e.g., the use of occupa tional risk prem ia to value reductions in risks from environm ental hazards) , you should explain your se lection ates and any adjustm ents of the estim ates to reflect th e nature of the risk be ing evaluated. You should present estim ates based on alternativ e approach es, and if you m onetize mortality risk reduction, you should do so on a consistent ba sis to the extent feasible. You should clearly indicate the methodology used and docum ent your choice of a particular m ethodology. You should explain any significant deviations from the prevai ling state of knowledge. If you use different methodologies in different rules, you should clearly disclose the fact a nd explain your choices. c. Valuation of Reductions in Health and Saf ety Risks to Child ren The valuation of health outcom es for children and infants poses special challenges. It is rarely feasible to m easure a ch ild's willingness to pay for heal th im prove ment and an adult' s concern for his or her o wn health is not necess arily relevan t to valuation of child health. For exam ple, the wage prem iums demanded by work ers to accept hazardous jobs are not readily transferred to rules that accom plish health g ains for children. There are a few studies that exam ine parental willingness to pay to invest in health and safety for their ch ildren. Some of these studies suggest that parents m ay value children's health more strongly than their own hea lth. Although this parental pers pective is a prom ising research strategy, it m ay need to be expanded to include a so cietal interest in chil d health and safety. Where the p rimary objec tive of a rule is to r educe the r isk of injury, dis ease or m ortality among children, you should conduct a cost-effectiven ess analysis of the rule. You may also develop a benefit-cost analysis to th e extent that v alid m onetar y values can be assigned to the prim ary expected health outcom es. For rule s where health gains are expected am ong both children and adults and you decide to perform a benef it-cost analysis, the monetary values for child ren sho uld be at least as large as the va lues for adults (for th e sam e probabilities and outcom es) unless there is specific and co mpelling evidence to suggest otherwise.87 Discount Rates Benefits and costs do not always tak e place in the sam e time period. When they do no t, it is inco rrect s imply to add all of the ex pected ne t benefits or co sts withou t taking accou nt of when the actually occur. If benef its or cos ts are d elayed or otherwise separated in tim e from each other, the difference in tim ing should be reflected in your analysis. 86 Office of Information an d Regulatory Affairs, OM B, Memorandum to the Presi dent's Managem ent Council, ibid. 87 For more information, see Dockins C., Jenkins RR, Owens N, Simon NB , and Wiggins LB (2002), Risk Analysis , 22(2), 335-346. 148 As a first step, you should present the annual ti me stream of benefits and costs expected to resu lt from the rule, c learly iden tifying when th e benefits and costs are e xpected to occur. The beginning p oint for your stream of estim ates shou ld be the y ear in which th e final ru le will beg in to have effects, even if that is expected to be som e time in the future. The ending point should be far enough in the future to encom pass all the sign ificant benefits and costs likely to result from the ru le. In presenting the stream of be nefits and costs, it is im portant to m easure them in constant dollars to avoid the m isleading eff ects of inflation in your estim ates. If the benefits and costs are initially m easured in prices reflecting expected future inflation, you can c onvert them to constant dollars by dividing through by an appropriate inflation index, one that corresponds to the inflation rate underlying the initial estim ates of benefits or costs. 1. The Rationale for Discounting Once these prelim inaries are out of the wa y, you can begin to adju st your estim ates for differences in tim ing. (This is a separate calcula tion from the adjustm ent needed to remove the effects of fut ure inflation.) Benefits or costs that occur sooner are generally m ore valuable. The main rationales for the discounting of future im pacts are: (a) Resources that ar e inves ted will nor mally earn a positiv e return, so cur rent consum ption is more expensive than future consumption, since you are giving up th at expected return on investm ent when you consum e today. (b) Postponed b enefits also have a cost because people generally prefer present to future consum ption. They are said to h ave positiv e time preference. (c) Also, if consum ption continues to increase ov er tim e, as it ha s for m ost of U.S. history, an increm ent of consumption will be less valu able in the future than it would be today, because the princ iple of dim inishing m arginal utility im plies that as tota l consum ption increases, th e value of a m arginal unit of consumption tends to decline. There is wide agreem ent with point (a). Capital investm ent is pr oductive, but that point is not suf ficient by itself to expla in positiv e interest rates and observed sa ving behavior. To understand these phenom ena, points (b) and (c) ar e also necessary. If people are really indifferent between consum ption now and later, then they should be willing to forgo current consum ption in order to consum e an equal or sli ghtly greater am ount in the future. That would cause saving rates and investm ent to rise un til interest ra tes w ere driven to zero and c apital was no longer productive. As long as we observe pos itive interes t rates and saving rates below 100 percent, people m ust be placing a higher va lue on current consum ption than on future consum ption. To reflect this preference, a discount factor should be used to adjust the estim ated benefits and costs for differences in tim ing. The further in the future the benefits and costs are expected to occur, the more they should be di scounted. The discount fa ctor can be calculated given a discount rate. The for mula is 1/ (1+ the discount rate)t where At@ measures the num ber of years in the future that the benefits o r costs are expected to o ccur. Bene fits or costs that have been adjus ted in this way are called Adiscounted present values @ or sim ply Apresent v alues @. 149 When, and only when, the estim ated benefits and costs have been discounted, they can be added to dete rmine the over all value of net benefits. 2. Real Discount Rates of 3 Percent and 7 Percent OMB =s basic guidance on the discount rate is provided in OMB Circular A-94 (http://www.whitehouse.gov/om b/circ ulars/index.htm l). This Ci rcular points out that the analytically preferred m ethod of handling tem poral differences between benefits and costs is to adjust all the benef its and costs to ref lect th eir value in equivalent units of consum ption and to discount them at the rate consum ers and save rs would normally use in discounting future consum ption benefits. This is som etimes called the Ashadow price@ approach to discounting because do ing such calculations req uires you to value benefits and costs using shado w prices, especially fo r capital goo ds, to correct for m arket distortions. These shad ow prices are not well established f or the United States. Furtherm ore, the distribution of i mpacts from regulations on capital and consum ption are not always well known. Consequentl y, any agency that wishes to tackle this challeng ing analytical task should check with OMB before proceeding. As a default position, O MB Circ ular A-94 states that a real discount rate of 7 percent should be used as a base-case for regulatory anal ysis. The 7 percent rate is an estim ate of the average before-tax rate of return to private cap ital in the U.S. econom y. It is a broad m easure that reflects the returns to real es tate and sm all business c apital as well as c orporate cap ital. It approxim ates the opportunity cost of capital, and it is the appropriate disc ount rate whenever the main effect of a regulation is to disp lace o r alter the use of capital in the private sector. OMB revised C ircular A-94 in 1992 after extensiv e inte rnal review and public comm ent. In a recen t analysis, OMB found that the average rate of retu rn to capital rem ains ne ar the 7 percent rate estim ated in 1992. Circular A-94 also recomm ends using other discount rates to show the sensitivity of the estim ates to the discount rate assum ption. Econom ic distortions, including taxes on capital, create a dive rgence between the rate of return that savers earn and the private rate of retu rn to cap ital. This dive rgence per sists despite the tend ency for capital to flow to where it can earn the highest rate of return. Although m arket forces will p ush after-tax rates of retu rn in diffe rent sectors of the econom y toward eq uality, that process will not equate pre-tax rate s of return when there are differences in the tax tre atment of investm ent. Corporate capital, in particular, pays an additional layer of taxation, the corporate incom e tax, which requir es it to ea rn a higher pre-tax rate of return in order to provide investors with sim ilar after-tax ra tes of return com pared with non-corpor ate investm ents. The pre-tax rates of return better m easure society =s gains from investm ent. Since th e rate s of return on capital are higher in som e sectors of the economy than ot hers, the governm ent needs to be sensitive to possible im pacts of regulatory policy on capital allocation. The effects of regulation do not alw ays fall exclusively or prim arily on the allocation of capital. W hen regulation prim arily and directly af fects privat e consum ption (e.g., through higher consum er prices for goods and services), a lower discount rate is appropriate. The alternative most often used is som etimes called the Asocial rate of tim e preference. @ This sim ply m eans the rate at whic h Asociety @ discounts future consumption flows to th eir present value. If we take the rate that the average saver uses to discount future consum ption as our measure of the social rate 150 of tim e preference, then the real rate of return on long-term gove rnment debt m ay provide a fair approxim ation. Over the last thirty years, this ra te has averaged around 3 percent in real term s on a pre-tax basis. For example, the yield on 10-ye ar Treasury notes has averaged 8.1 percent since 1973 while the average annual rate of change in the CPI over this period has been 5.0 percent, implying a real 10-year rate of 3.1 percent. For regulatory analysis, you s hould provide estim ates of net benefits using both 3 percent and 7 percent. An example of this approach is E PA=s analysis of its 1998 rule setting both effluent lim its for waste water dis charges and a ir toxic em ission lim its for pulp and pa per m ills. In this analysis, EPA developed its present-value estim ates using real discount rates of 3 and 7 percent applied to benefit and cost stream s that extended forward for 30 years. You should present a sim ilar analysis in your own work. In som e instances, if there is reason to expect that the regu lation will cau se resour ces to be reallocated away from privat e investm ent in the corporate s ector, then the opportunity cost may lie outside the range of 3 to 7 percent. For exam ple, the average re al rate of return on corporate capital in the United St ates was approxim ately 10 percen t in the 1990s, returning to the same level observed in the 1950s and 1960s. If you are uncertain about the nature of the opportunity cost, then you should present benefit and cost estim ates using a higher discount rate as a further sensitivity analysis as we ll as using the 3 and 7 percent rates. 3. Time Prefer ence for Health-Related Benefits and Costs When future benefits or costs are hea lth-related, som e have questioned whether discounting is appropriate, since the rationale for discounting mone y may not appear to apply to health. It is true that lives saved today cannot be invested in a bank to save m ore lives in the future. But the resources that would have been used to save those lives can be invested to earn a higher payof f in future lives save d. People have been observed to prefer health gains that occur immediately to iden tical health g ains that oc cur in the future. Also, if future health gains are not discounted while future costs are, then the fo llowing perverse result occurs: an attractive investm ent today in future health im provem ent can always be m ade m ore attractive by delaying the investm ent. For such reasons, there is a prof essional consensus that future he alth e ffects, including both benefits and costs, should be disc ounted at the sam e rate. This consensus applies to both BCA and CEA. A comm on challenge in health-re lated analysis is to quantify the tim e lag between when a rule takes ef fect and when the resulting physical improvem ents in health st atus will be observed in the target population. In such situations, you m ust carefully consider the tim ing of health benefits bef ore perform ing present-value calculations . It is not reasonable to assum e that all of the benefits of reducing chronic diseases such as cancer and card iovascular disease will occur immediately when the ru le tak es effect. For ru les addressing traum atic injury, this lag period may be shor t. For chron ic diseases it m ay take years or ev en decades for a rule to ind uce its full beneficial effects in the target population. When a delay period between exposure to a t oxin and increased probability of disease is likely (a so-called latency peri od), a lag between exposure reducti on and reduced probability of 151 disease is also likely. This latter period has some times been referred to as a \"cessation lag,\" and it may or m ay not be of the sam e duration as th e latency period. As a general m atter, cessation lags will only apply to populati ons with at least som e high-leve l exposure (e.g., before the rule takes effect). For populations with no such prior exposure, such as those born after the rule takes effect, only the latency period will be relevant. Ideally, your exposure-risk m odel would allow calculation of reduced risk for each year following exposure cessation, accoun ting for total cum ulative exposure and age at the tim e of exposure reduction. The present-value benefits estim ate could then reflect an appropriate discount factor for each year' s risk reduction. Recent analyses of the cancer benefits stemm ing from reduction in public exposure to radon in dri nking water have adopted this approach. They were supported by form al risk-assessm ent m odels that allowed estim ates of the tim ing of lung cancer incid ence and m ortality to vary in respons e to differen t radon expo sure lev els.88 In many cases, you will not have th e benefit of such detailed risk as sessm ent m odeling. You will need to use yo ur professio nal judgm ent as to the av erage cessation lag for th e chronic diseases affected by your rule. In situations where inform ation exists on latency but not on cessation lags, it m ay be reasonable to use latenc y as a proxy for the cessation lag, unless there is reason to b elieve th at the two are different. When the ave rage lag tim e between expo sures and disease is unknown, a range of pl ausible alternative values for the tim e lag should be used in your analysis. 4. Intergenerational Discounting Special ethical cons iderations arise when com paring benefits and costs across generations. Although most people dem onstrate tim e preference in their own consum ption behavior, it m ay not be appropriate for societ y to dem onstrate a s imilar preference when deciding between the well-being of current and future generations . Future citizens w ho are affected by such choices cannot take part in m aking them , and today =s society m ust act with some consideration of their inte rest. One way to do this would be to follow the sam e discounting techni ques described above and supplem ent the analysis with an explicit discussion of the intergenerati onal concerns (how future generations will be affected by the regula tory decision). Policym akers would be provided with this ad dition al info rmation without changing the general appro ach to discoun ting. Using the sam e discount rate across genera tions has the advantage of preventing tim e- inconsistency problem s. For exam ple, if one us es a lower discount rate for future generations, then the evaluation of a rule that has short-term costs and long-term benefits would becom e more favorable merely by waiting a year to do the anal ysis. Further, using the sam e discount rate across generations is attractive fr om an ethical standpoint. If one expects future generations to be better off, then giving them the advantage of a lower discount rate would in effect transfer resources from poorer people today to richer people tom orrow. 88 Committee on R isk Assessm ent of Exposure to Radon in Drinking Water, Board on Radiation Effects Research , Commissio n on Life Sciences (1 996), Risk Assessme nt of Radon in Drinking Wat er, Natio nal Research Council, Natio nal Acade my Press, Wash ington, DC. 152 Some believe, however, that it is ethically im perm issible to discount the utility of future generations. That is, governm ent should treat all generations equa lly. Even under this approach, it would still be correct to discount f uture costs and consum ption benefits generally (perhaps at a lower ra te than for intr agenera tiona l analys is), du e to the expectation that future generations will be wealthier and thus will value a marginal dolla r of benefits or costs by less than those alive today. Therefore, it is appropria te to discount f uture benefits and costs relative to current benefits and costs, even if the welfare of future generations is not being discounted. Estimates of the appropriate discount rate appr opriate in this case, from the 1990s, ranged from 1 to 3 percent 89per annum . A second reason for discounting th e benefits and costs accruing to future generations at a lower rate is increased uncertainty about the appr opriate value of the disc ount rate, the longer the horizon for the analys is. Private m arket rates p rovide a r eliable ref erence f or determ ining how society values tim e within a generation, but fo r extrem ely long tim e periods no com parable private rates exist. As explained by Martin W eitzman90, in the limit for the deep f uture, the properly averaged certainty-equivale nt discount factor (i.e., 1/[1+r]t) corresponds to the minimum discount rate h aving any su bstantial po sitive probab ility. From persp ectiv e, the only relevant lim iting scenario is the one with the lo west discount rate B all of the other states at the far-dis tant tim e are relatively much less im portan t becau se their expected present value is so severely reduced by the power of com pounding at a higher rate. If your rule will have importan t intergenera tional benefits or costs you m ight consid er a further sensitivity analysis usi ng a lower but positive discoun t rate in add ition to calcu lating net benefits using discount ra tes of 3 and 7 percent. 5. Time Prefer ence for Non-Monetized Benefits and Costs Differences in tim ing should be considered even for benefits a nd costs that are not expressed in m onetary units, incl uding health benefits. The tim ing differ ences can be handled through discounting. EPA estim ated cost-effectiveness in its 1998 rule, AControl of Em issions from Nonroad Diesel Engines, @ by discounting both the m oneta ry costs and the non-monetized emission reduction benefits over the expected useful life of the engines at the 7 pe rcent rea l rate recomm ended in OMB Circular A-94. Alternatively, it m ay be possible in som e cases to avoid discounting non-monetized benefits. If the expected flow of bene fits begins as soon as the cost is incurred and is expected to be constant over tim e, then annua lizing the cost stream is suffic ient, and further discounting of benefits is unnecessary. Such an analysis m ight produce an estim ate of the annualized cost per ton of reduced em issions of a pollutant. 6. The Internal Rate of Return 89 Portney PR and Weyant JP, ed s. (1999), Disco unting and Intergenerational Equity, Res ources for the Future, Washington, D C. 90 Weitzman ML In Portney PR and Wey ant JP, eds. (1999), Discoun ting and I ntergenerational Equ ity, Resources for the Future, Washington, DC. 153 The internal rate of return is the discount rate that sets the net present value of the discounted benefits and costs equal to zero. The internal rate of return does not generally provide an acceptab le decision crit erion, and regu lations with the hi ghest internal rate of return are not necessarily the most bene ficial. Nevertheless, it does pr ovide useful inform ation and for many it will of fer a m eaningf ul indic ation of regulation =s impact. You should consider including the internal rate of return im plied by your regulatory analysis al ong with other inform ation about discounted net present values. Other Key Considerations 1. Other Benefit and Cost Considerations You should include these effects in your analys is and provide estim ates of their m onetary values when they nificant: Private-sector com pliance and savings; Governm ent costs and Gains or losses in consum ers' or producers' surpluses; Discomfort or inconvenience costs and benefits; and Gains or los ses of time in work, leis ure and/or comm uting/travel settings. Estim ates of benefits and costs should be based on credible changes in technology over time. For exam ple, retro spective stu dies m ay provide evid ence that Alearning @ will likely reduce the cost of regulation in future years. The weight you give to a study of past rates of cost savings resulting from innovation (including Alearn ing cu rve@ effects) should depend on both its timeliness and direct relevance to the processes affected by the regulatory alternative under consideration. In addition, you shoul d take into account cost-saving innovations that result from a shift to regulatory perf ormance standards a nd incentive-based policies. On the other hand, significant costs m ay result from a slowing in th e rate of innovation or of adoption of new technology due to delays in the re gulatory approval process or the setting of m ore stringent standards for new facilities than existing ones. In som e cases agencies are lim ited under statute to consider only technologi es that have been demonstrated to be feasible. In these situ ations, it may be useful to estim ate costs and cost savings assum ing a wider range of technical possibilities. When characterizing technology changes over tim e, you should assess the likely technology changes that would have occurred in the absence of the regulatory action (technology baseline). Technologies change over tim e in both reasonably functioning m arkets and im perfect markets. If you assum e that technology will re main unchang ed in the abs ence of regu lation when technology changes are likel y, then your analysis will over-sta te both the benefits and costs attributable to the regulation. Occasionally, cost sav ings or other form s of benefits accrue to parties affected by a rule who also bear its cos ts. For exam ple, a require ment that engine m anufacturers reduce em issions from engines m ay lead to technolog ies that im prove fuel eco nomy. These fuel saving s will 154 norm ally accrue to the engine purch asers, who also bear the costs of the technologies. There is no apparent m arket failure with regard to the m arket value of fuel saved because one would expect that consum ers would be willing to pay for increased f uel econom y that exceeded the cost of providing it. When these cost savings are substantial, and particularly when you estim ate them to be greater than the cost associated with achieving them, you should exam ine and discuss why m arket forces would not accom plish th ese g ains in the absence of regulation. As a general matter, any direct costs that are averted as a result of a regulatory action should be m onetized wherever po ssible and either add ed to the benefits or subtracted from the costs of that alternative. 2. The Difference b etween Costs (o r Benefits) and Transfer Paym ents Distinguishing between real co sts and transfer paym ents is an im portant, but som etimes difficult, problem in cost estim ation. Benefit and cost estim ates should refl ect resource use. Transfer paym ents are monetary paym ents from one group to another that do not affect total resources available to society. A regulation that restricts the supply of a good, causing its price to rise, produces a transf er from buyers to se llers. The net re duction in th e tota l surp lus (consum er plus producer) is a real co st to society, but the transfer from buyers to sellers resulting from a higher price is not a real cost sin ce the net reduction autom atically accounts for the transfer from buyers to sellers. However, tr ansfers from the United States to other nations should be included as costs, and tran sfers from other nations to the United States as benefits, as long as the analysis is conducted from the United States perspective. You should not include transfers in the estim ates of the benefits and costs of a regulation. Instead, add ress th em in a separa te discussion of the regulation =s distributional effects. Exam ples of transfer paym ents include the following: Scarcity rents and m onopoly profits Insurance paym ents Indirect taxes and subsidies Treatmen t of Uncertainty The precise consequences (benefits and co sts) of regulatory op tions are not always known for certain, but the probabili ty of their occurrence can ofte n be developed. The im portant uncertainties connected with your regulatory decisions need to be analyzed and presented as part of the overall regulatory analys is. You should begin your analysis of uncertainty at the earliest possible stage in developing your an alysis. You should consider both the statistical variability of key elem ents underlying the estim ates of benefits and costs (for exam ple, the expected change in the distribution of automobile accidents that m ight result from a change in autom obile safety standard s) and the inco mplete knowledge about the relevant re lationships (for example, the uncertain knowledge of how som e econom ic activ ities m ight affect future clim ate change).91 By assessing the sources of uncerta inty and the way in which benefit and cost estim ates m ay be 91 In some contexts, t he word Avariability @ is used as a synon ym for statistical v ariation that can be describ ed by a theoretically v alid distribu tion function, whereas Auncertain ty@ refers to a more fundamental lack of knowledge. Throughout this discussion , we u se the term \"uncertain ty\" to refer to bo th concepts. 155 affected under plausible assum ptions, you can shape your analysis to inform decision m akers and the public about the effects and the uncerta inties of alternativ e regulatory actions. The treatm ent of uncertainty m ust be guided by the sam e principles of full disclosure and transparency that apply to other elements of your regulatory analysis. Your analysis should be credib le, objectiv e, rea listic, and scie ntifically ba lanced.92 Any data and m odels that you use to analyze uncertainty should be fully identified. You should also discuss the quality of the available data used. Inferences and assum ptions used in your analysis should be identified, and your analy tical cho ices s jus tified. In yo ur presentation, you should delineate the strengths of your analysis along with any uncertainties about its conclusions. Your presentation should also explain how your analytical choices have affected your results. In som e cases, the level of scientific un certainty m ay be so large that you can only present discrete alternative scenarios without as sessing the relative likelihood of each scenario quantitatively. For instance, in assessing the potential outcom es of an environm ental effect, there m ay be a lim ited num ber of scientific studies with stron gly dive rgent results. In such cases, you m ight present results from a range of plausi ble scenarios, together with any available inform ation that m ight help in qualitatively determ ining which scenar io is most like ly to occur. When uncertainty has significant effects on th e final conclusion about net benefits, your agency shou ld consid er addition al research p rior to rulem aking. The costs of being wrong m ay outweigh the benefits of a faster decision. This is true especially for cases with irreversible or large upfront investm ents. If your agency decides to proceed with rulem aking, you should explain why the costs of developing additional infor mation\u2014inclu ding any harm from delay in public protection\u2014exceed the va lue of that inform ation. For exam ple, when the uncertainty is due to a lack of data, you m ight consider deferring the decision, as an explicit regulatory altern ative, pending further st udy to obtain sufficient data.93 Delaying a decis ion will a lso have costs, as will f urthe r efforts at data gathe ring and analys is. You will need to weigh th e benefits of delay again st thes e cos ts in m aking your decision. Form al tools for assessing the value of additional infor mation are now well developed in the applied decision sciences and can be used to help resolve this type of com plex regulatory question. AReal option s@ methods have also fo rmalized the valuation of the added flexibility inheren t in delaying a decision. As long as tak ing time will lower uncertaint y, either passively or actively through an investm ent in inform ation gath ering, and som e costs are irreversible, such as the potential costs of a sunk investm ent, a benefit can be assigned to the option to delay a decision. That benefit should be considered a cost of taking imm ediate action versus the alternative of delaying that action pending m ore infor mation. However, the burdens of delay\u2014 including any harm to public health, safety, and the environm ent\u2014need to be analyzed carefully. 92 When dissem inating inform ation, agencies sh ould follow t heir own in formatio n quality g uidelines, issu ed in conformance with the OMB government-wide gui delines (67 FR 8452, February 22, 2002). 93 Clem en RT ( 1996), Making Har d Decisions: An Introduct ion to Decision Analysis , secon d edition, Duxbury Press, Pacific Grove. 156 1. Quantita tive Analysis of Uncerta inty Exam ples of quantitative analysis, broadly defined, would include form al estim ates of the probabilities of environm ental da mage to soil or water, the possible loss of habitat, o r risks to endangered species as well as proba bilities of harm to hum an health and safety. There are also uncertainties associated with estim ates of econom ic benefits and costs, such as the cost savings associated w ith increased energy efficiency. Thus, your analysis should include two funda mental com ponents: a quantitative analysis ch aracterizing the probab ilities of the relevant outcom es and an assignm ent of econom ic value to the p rojected outcomes. It is ess ential that both parts be conceptually consistent. In pa rticular, the quantitativ e analysis should be conducted in a way that perm its it to be applie d within a m ore general analytical fram ework, such as benefit-cost analysis. Similarly, the general fram ework needs to be flexible enough to incorporate the quantitative anal ysis without oversim plifying th e results. For exam ple, you should address explicitly the im plications for bene fits and costs of any pr obability distributions developed in your analysis. As with other elem ents o f regulato ry analysis, yo u will need to balance th oroughness with the practical lim its on your analytical capab ilities. Your analysis does not have to be exhaustive, nor is it necessary to ev aluate each alternative at every ste p. Attention should be devoted to first resolving or studying the uncerta inties that have the la rgest potential effect on decis ion m aking. Many tim es these will be the larges t sources of uncertainti es. In the absence of adequate data, you will need to make assum ptions. These should be clearly identified and consistent w ith the relevant sc ience. Your analysis should pr ovide sufficient inform ation for decision m akers to grasp the degree of scientif ic uncertainty and the robustness of estim ated probabilities, benefits, and costs to changes in key assum ptions. For m ajor rules invo lving annual eco nomic effects of $1 billio n or m ore, you should present a form al quantitative an alysis of the relev ant uncertainties about b enefits and costs. In other words, you should try to p rovide som e estim ate of the probability di stribution of regulato ry benefits and costs. In summarizing the proba bility distributions, you should provide som e estim ates of the central tendency (e.g., m ean and m edian) along with any other information you think will be useful such as ranges, varian ces, specified low-end and high-end percentile estim ates, and other character istics of the distribution. Your estim ates cannot be m ore precise than their m ost uncertain com ponent. Thus, your analys is sho uld report es timates in a way that re flects the degree of uncertainty and not create a false sense o f precision. Worst-case or conserv ative analyses are not usu ally adequate because they do not convey the com plete probability distribution of outcom es, and they do not perm it calcu lation of an expected value of net benefits. In many he alth and safety rules, econom ists conducting benefit-cost analyses m ust rely on form al risk assessm ents that address a variety of risk m anagem ent questions such as the baseline risk for the af fected popul ation, the safe level of exposure or, the am ount of risk to be reduced by various interventions. Because the answers to some of these questions are dire ctly used in benefits analys es, the risk assessm ent m ethodology must allow for the determ ination of expected bene fits in order to be comparable to expected costs. This m eans that conservative assum ptions and defaults (whether m otivated by science 157 policy o r by precau tiona ry instin cts), will be inco mpatible with benefit an alyses a s they will result in ben efit estim ates that exceed the expected value. Whenever it is possible to characterize quantitatively the probability di stributions, som e estim ates of expected value (e.g., m ean and median) m ust be provided in addition to ranges, variances, specified low -end and high-end percentile estim ates, a nd other characteristic s of the distribution. Whenever possible, you should use appropria te statistical techniques to determ ine a probability distribution of the relev ant outcom es. For rules th at exceed th e $1 billion annual threshold, a for mal quantitative analysis of un certainty is req uired. For r ules with an nual benefits and /or cos ts in the range fro m 100 m illion to $1 billion, you sho uld seek to u se more rigorous approaches with higher consequence rules. This is especially th e case where net benefits are close to zero. More rigorous uncertainty analysis m ay not be necessary for rules in this c ategory if simpler techniqu es are suf ficient to show robustness. You m ay consider the following an alytical approaches th at en tail inc reasing lev els of com plexity : Disclose qualitatively the m ain uncertainties in each im portant input to the calculation of benefits and costs. These di sclosures should address the uncer tainties in the data as well as in the analytical results. However, m ajor rules above the $1 b illion annual threshold require a form al treatm ent. Use a num erical sensitivity analysis to exam ine how the results of your analysis vary with plausible changes in assum ptions, choices of input data, and alte rnative analytical approache s. Sensitiv ity analys is is e specia lly valuable when the inf ormation is la cking to carry ou t a form al probabilis tic sim ulation. Sens itivity an alysis can be u sed to find Aswitch points@ -- critical param eter values at which estim ated net benefits change sign or the low cos t alternative s witches. Sensitiv ity ana lysis usu ally proceeds by changing o ne variable or assum ption at a tim e, but it can also be done by varying a com bination of variables simultaneously to learn more about the robustness of your results to widespread changes. Again, however, m ajor rules above the $1 billion annual threshold require a formal treatm ent. Apply a form al probabilistic analys is of the relevant uncertainties B possibly using simulation models and/or expert judgm ent as revealed, for exam ple, through Delphi methods.94 Such a form al analytical approach is appropria te for com plex rules where there are lar ge, m ultiple uncertainties whose analysis ra ises te chnica l challenges, or where the ef fects cascade; it is required fo r rules that exceed the $1 billion annual threshold. For exam ple, in the analysis of regulations addressing air pollution, there is uncertainty about the effects of the rule on future em issions, uncertainty about how the change in em issions will affect air q uality, uncertain ty about how changes in air quality will affect h ealth, and finally uncertainty abou t the econom ic and social v alue of the change in health outcomes. In form al probabilistic assessm ents, expert solicitation is a useful way to fill key gaps in your ability to assess uncertain ty.95 In general, experts can 94 The purpose of Delphi m ethods is t o gene rate suita ble inform ation for decision m aking by eliciting expect judgment. The elicitatio n is co nducted through a su rvey process which eli minates the int eractions between e xperts. See Mor gan MG and Henrion M (1 990), Uncerta inty: A Gu ide to Dea ling with Uncertain ty in Quan titative Riskand Policy A nalysi s, Cam bridge University P ress. 95 Cooke RM ( 1991), Experts in Uncerta inty: Opinion and Subjective Proba bility in Science , Oxford University Press. 158 be used to q uantif y the p robability d istribu tions of key parameters and re lationsh ips. These solicitations, com bined with o ther s ources of data, can be com bined in Monte Carlo sim ulations to derive a probability distribution of bene fits and costs. You should pay attention to correlated inputs. Often tim es, the standard defau lts in Monte Carlo and other sim ilar sim ulation packages assum e independence across distri butions. Failing to correctly account for correlated distributions of inputs can cause the resultant output uncertainty intervals to be too large, although in m any cases the overall ef fect is ambiguous. You should m ake a special effort to portray the proba bilistic results\u2014in graphs and/or tables\u2014clearly and meaningfully. New m ethods m ay becom e available in the future. This docum ent is not intended to discourage or inhibit their use, but rather to en courage and stimulate the ir developm ent. 2. Econom ic Values of Uncertain Outcom es In developing benefit and cost estim ates, you m ay find that there are probability distributions of values as well fo r each of the outcom es. Where th is is the case, you will need to combine these probability distributions to provide estim ated benefits and costs. Where there is a dis tribution of outco mes, you will often find it us eful to emphasize summary statistics or figures that can be r eadily understood and com pared to achieve the broadest public understanding of your findings. It is a common practice to com pare the Abest estim ates @ of both benefits and costs with thos e of com peting alternatives. These Abest estim ates @ are usually the average o r the expected valu e of benefits and costs. Emphasis on these expected v alues is app ropriate as lon g as society is Arisk neutral @ with respect to the regulatory alternatives. While this m ay not always be the case, you should in general assum e Arisk neutrality @ in your analysis. If you adopt a different assum ption on risk preference, you should explain your reasons for doing so. 3. Alterna tive Assum ptions If benefit or h eavily on certain assum ptions, you should m ake those assum ptions explicit and carry out ible altern ative assum ptions. If the value of net benefits changes from positive to negative (or vice versa) or if the relative ranking of regulatory options cha nges with alternative plausible assum ptions, you should conduct further analysis to determ ine which of the alternative assum ptions is more appropriate. Because dif ferent estimation m ethods m ay have hidden assu mptions, yo u should analyze estim ation m ethods carefully to make any hidden assum ptions explicit. F. Specializ ed Analytical Requirements In preparing analytical support for your ru lemaking, you should be aware that there are a number of analytic requirem ents im posed by la w and Executive Order. In addition to the regulatory analysis requirem ents of Executiv e Order 12866, you should also consider whether your rule will need specialized analys is of any of the following issues. 159 Impact on S mall Busine sses and Other Small E ntities Under the Regulato ry Flexibility Ac t (5 U.S.C. chapter 6 ), agencies m ust prepar e a proposed and final \"regulatory flexibility anal ysis\" (RFA) if the rulem aking could \"have a significant impact on a substantial num ber of s mall entities.\" You should consider posting your RFA on the internet so the pub lic can review your findings. Your agency should have guidelines on how to prepare an RF A and you are encouraged to consult with th e Chief Counsel for Advo cacy of the Sm all Business Adm inistration on expectations concerning what is an ade quate RF A. Executive Order 13272 (67 FR 53461, August 16, 2002) requires you to no tify the Chief C ounsel for Advocacy of any draft rules that might have a significant econom ic impact on a s ubstantial num ber of s mall entities. Executive Order 13272 also directs agencies to give every appropriate consideration to any comm ents provided by the Advocacy Office. Under SBREFA, EPA and OSHA are required to consult with small business prior to developing a proposed rule that would have a significant effect on sm all businesses. OMB encourages oth er agencies to d o so as well. Analysis of Unfunded Mandates Under the Unfunded Mandates Act (2 U.S.C. 1532), you m ust prepare a written statem ent about benefits and costs prior to issuing a pr oposed or final rule (for which your agency published a proposed rule) that m ay result in aggr egate expenditure by State, local, and tribal governm ents, or by the private sector, of $100,000,000 or more in any one year (adjusted annually for inflation). Your analytical re quirements under E xecutive Order 12866 are sim ilar to the analytical requirem ents under this Act, and thus the sam e analysis m ay perm it you to com ply with both analytical requirem ents. Information Collection, Paperw ork, and Recordkeeping Burdens Under the P aperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S. C. chapter 35), you will need to consid er whether you r rulem aking (or other actions ) will create any addition al information collection, paperwork or recordkeeping burde ns. These burdens are permissi ble only if you can justify the practical utility of the inf ormation for the im plementation of your rule. OMB approval will b e required of any new requirem ents for a collection of infor mation im posed on 10 or m ore persons and a valid OMB control num ber m ust be obtaine d for any covered paperwork. Your agency' s CIO should be able to assi st you in com plying with the Paperwork Reduction Act. Information Quality Guidelines Under the In formation Quality Law, agency guidelines, in confor mance with the OMB governm ent-wide guidelines (67 FR 8452, February 22, 2002), have estab lished basic quality perform ance goals for all inform disse minated by agencies, including inform ation dissem inated in support of proposed and final rules. The data and analysis that you use to support your rule m ust meet th ese agency and OMB quality s tandards. Your agency' s CIO should be able to assist you in assessing inform ation quality. The Statis tical and Science Policy 160 Branch of OMB' s Office of Infor mation and Regul atory Affairs can provide you assistance. This circu lar defines OMB =s minimum quality standards for regulatory analysis. Environmental Impa ct Statements The National Environm ental Policy Act ( 42 U.S.C. 4321-4347) and related statutes and executive orders requ ire agencies to consider the environm ental im pacts of agency decisions, including rulem akings. An environm ental im pact statem ent must be prepared for \"major Federal action s sign ificantly af fecting the quality of the hum an enviro nment.\" You m ust complete NEPA docum entation before issuing a final rule . The W hite House Council on Environm ental Quality has issued ilable through CEQ' s website (http://www.whitehouse/gov/ceq/ ). Impacts on Children Under Executive Order 13045, AProtection of Children from Environm ental Hea lth Risks and Safety Risks,@ each agency m ust, with respect to its rules, A to the ex tent perm itted by law and appropriate, and consistent with the agency =s mission,@ Aaddress disproportionate risks to children that result from environm ental hea lth risks or saf ety risks.@ For any substantive rulem aking action that Ais like ly to re sult in @ an econom ically significan t rule that concerns Aan environm ental health risk or safety risk that an ag ency has reason to believ e may disproportionately affect children, @ the agency must provide OMB/OIRA Aan evaluation of the environm ental health or safety effect s of the planned regulation on children, @ as well as Aan explanation of why the planned regulation is pref erable to ot her potentially and reasonably feasible a lternatives co nsidered by the agency. @ Energy Imp acts Under Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001), agencies are required to prepare and subm it to OMB a Statem ent of Ener gy Effects for significant energy actions, to the extent p ermitted by law. This Statement is to inc lude a deta iled statem ent of Aany adverse effects on energy supply, distribution, or use (including a shortfall in supply, price increases, and increased use of foreign supplies) @ for the action and reasonable al ternatives and their effects. You need to publish the Statem ent or a summ ary in the related NPRM and final rule. For further guidance, see OMB Memorandum 01-27 (\"Gu idance on Im plem enting Executive Order 13211\", July 13, 2001), available on OMB= s website. G. Accounting Statemen t You need to provide an accounting statem ent with tables reporting benefit and cost estim ates for each m ajor final rule for your agen cy. You should use th e guidance ou tlined above to report these estim ates. We have include d a suggested format for your consideration. Categories of Benefits and Costs 161 To the extent feasible, you should quantify al l potential increm ental benefits and costs. You should report benefit and cost estim ates within the following three categories: monetized quantified, but not m onetized; and qualitat ive, but not quantified or m onetized. These categories are m utually exclusive and exhaustive. Throughout the process of listing prelim inary estim ates of benefits and co sts, agencies should avoid double-counting. This problem may arise if m ore than one way exists to express the sa me change in social welfare. Quantifying and Monetizing Benefits and Costs You should develop quantitative estim ates and convert them to dollar am ounts if possible. In many cases, quantified estim ates are readily conv ertible, with a little effort, into dollar equivalents. Qualitative Benefits an d Costs You should categorize or rank the qualitative effects in term s of their im portance (e.g., certainty, likely m agnitude, and reversibility). You should distinguish the effects that are likely to be significant enough to warrant serious consid eration by decision m akers from those that are likely to be m inor. Treatmen t of Benefits a nd Costs over Time You should present undiscounted stream s of benefit and cost estim ates (monetized and net) for each year of the analyt ic time horizon. You should presen t annualized benefits and costs using real discount rates of 3 and 7 percent. The stream of annualized estim ates should begin in the yea r in which the f inal ru le wi ll begin to have effects, even if the rule does not take effect immediately. Please report all m onetized eff ects in 2001 dollars. You should convert dollars expressed in different years to 2001 dollars using the GDP deflator. Treatmen t of Risk and Uncertainty You should provide expected-value estim ates as well as distributions about the estim ates, where such infor mation exists. When you provi de only upper and lower b ounds (in ad dition to best estim ates), you should, if possible, use the 95 and 5 percent confidence bounds. Although we encourage you to develop estim ates that capture the distribution of plausible outcom es for a particular alternative, detailed reporting of such distributions is not required, but should be available upon request. The principles of full disclosure and transpar ency apply to the trea tment of uncertainty. Where there is sign ificant uncer tainty and the resulting inferences and/or assum ptions have a critical effect on the benefit and cost estim ates, you should describe the benefits and costs under plausib le alternative as sumptions . You m ay add footnotes to th e table as needed to provide docum entation and references, or to express im portant warnings. 162 In a previous section, we identified som e of the issues associated with developing estim ates of the value of reductions in prem ature mortality risk. Based on this discussion, you should present alternative prim ary estim ates where you use different estim ates for valuing reductions in prem ature mortality risk. Precis ion of Estima tes Reported estim ates should reflect, to the extent feasible, the precision in the analysis. For exam ple, an estim ate of $220 m illion implies ro unding to th e nearest $1 0 million an d thus a precis ion of +/-$5 m illion; sim ilarly, an estim ate of $222 m illion im plies rounding to the nearest $1 m illion and thus, a precis ion of +/-$0.5 m illion. Separate Reporting of T ransfers You should report transfers se parately and avoid the m isclassification of transfer paym ents as benefits or costs. Transfers occur when wealth or incom e is redistributed without any direct change in agg regate social welfare. To the extent that regulatory outputs reflect transfers rather than net welfar e gains to society, you should iden tify them as transfers rather than benefits or costs. You should also dis tinguish transfers caused by Federal budget actions -- such as thos e stemm ing from a rule affecting Soci al Security paym ents -- from those that involve transfers between non-governm ental parties -- su ch as m onopoly rents a rule m ay confer on a private party . You should use as m any catego ries as necessary to describe the m ajor redistributive effects of a regulat ory action. If transf ers have significant efficiency effects in addition to distributional eff ects, you should report them . Effects on S tate, Local, and Tribal Gover nments, Small Bu siness, Wages and Economic Growth You need to identity th e porti ons of benefits, costs, and tran sfers receiv ed by State, local, and tribal governm ents. To the extent feasible, y ou also should identify the effects of the rule or program on sm all businesses, wages, and economic growth.96 Note that rules with annual costs that are less than one billion dollars are likely to have a m inimal effect on econom ic growth. 96 The Regu latory Flex ibility Estim ate Maxi mum Estim ate Source Citation (RIA, pr eamble, etc.) BENEF ITS Annualized monetized benefits ative but unmo to whom transfers: \"off- budget\" From whom to whom?

Effective Date The effective date of this Circular is January 1, 2004 for regulatory analyses received by OMB in support of proposed ru les, and January 1, 2005 for regulato ry analyses received by OMB in support of final rules. In other words, this Circ ular applies to the regulatory an alyses for draft proposed ru les that are f ormally subm itted to OIRA after Decem ber 31, 2003, and for draft final rules that are for mally s ubmitted to OIRA after Decem ber 3 1, 2004. (However, if th e draft proposed rule is subject to the Circular, then th e draft final rule will also be subject to the Circular, ev en if it is su bmitted prio r to Janua ry 1, 2005.) To the extent p racticab le, agencies should comply earlier than these effective dates. Agencies ma y, on a case-by-case basis, seek a waiver from OMB if these effective dates are im practical. 165 APPE NDIX E. RESP ONSE TO COMM ENTS ON TH E DRAFT REGULATORY ANALYSIS GUIDELI NES The Circular published today provides OMB =s guidance to Federal agencies on the developm ent of regulatory analysis as required under Section 6(a)(3 )(c) of Executive Order No. 12866, A Regulatory Planning and Review, @ and a variety of related authorities. (E.O.12866 was issued by President Clinton in 1993.) The Circul ar also provides guidanc e to agencies on the regulatory accounting statem ents that are requi red under the Regulatory Right-to-Know Act. This Circular refines O MB=s Abest practices @ docum ent of 1996 (http://www.wh itehouse.gov /omb/inforeg/riaguide.html), which was issued as a guidance in 2000 (http://www.wh itehouse.gov /omb/memoranda/m00-08.pdf ), and reaffirm ed in 2001 /omb/memoranda/m01-23.html). It replaces both the 1996 Abest practices@ and the 2000 guidance. The final guidelines have been issu ed as OMB Circular A-4, Regulatory Analysis Gu idelines, and this Cir cular is available on OMB's web site at http://www.whiteh ouse.gov/omb/circulars/ind ex.html. This Circular is designed to assist analysts in the re gulatory agencies by defining good regulatory analysis\u2014called either Aregulatory analysis @ or Aanalysis@ for brevity\u2014and standardizing the way bene fits and costs of Federa l regulatory actions are m easured and reported. Executive O rder 12866 requires agencies to cond uct a regulatory analysis for econom ically significant regulatory actions as defined by Section 3(f) (1). This requ irement applies to rulem akings that rescind or m odify existing rules as well as to rulem akings that estab lish new requirem ents. Regulatory analysis a wide ly-accepted too l regulato ry ag encies use to anticipate an d evaluate the likely consequences of rules. It provides a form al way of organizing the evidence on the key effects\u2014good and bad\u2014of the various alte rnatives that should be considered in developing regulations. The m otivati on is to (1) learn if the b enefits of an action are likely to justify the costs or (2) discover which of various possible alternat ives would be the m ost cost- effective. A good regulatory analysis is designed to inform the public and other parts of the Governm ent (as well as the agency conducting the analysis ) of the effects of alternative actions. Regulatory analysis will som etimes show that a proposed action is m isguided, but it can also demonstrate that well-conceived ac tions are reasonable and justified. OMB subjected the draft guidelines to ex ternal peer review and public comment. Together, 360 comments were received. A large nu mber of public comm ents were less than one- page in length and focused on one specific issue in benefit-cost analysis. By and large, the peer reviewers strongly supported the use of regulatory analysis in rulem aking and OMB's efforts to revise the regulatory analysis guidelines. OMB has m ade num erous changes to the draft guidelines in response to the peer review and public comm ents. This chapter prim arily summarizes and res ponds to the areas of regulatory analysis guidelines and the role of regulat ory analysis in rulem aking that received most of the attention from commenters. 166 A. Benefit-Cos t Analysis Most commenters supported the need for OMB guidance on benefit-cost analysis (B CA), but there were a range of views on how OMB' s current guidance should be m odified. One key area of comm ent centered on the appropriate way to conduct and use BCA and cost-effectiveness analysis (CE A) in the developm ent of healt h, saf ety, and environm ental regulations. Three commenters (236, 334, 335) expressed concer n that the \"net-ben efit\" test in BCA leads to an effort to reduce al l benefits and costs to quantific ation and m onetization. One (335) commented that any factor that \"does not lend itself to quantification, and then m onetization, tends to fall out of the equati on entirely.\" Others (250, 333) expressed concern that O MB had placed BCA \"at th e heart of regulato ry decis ion making\" to th e exclus ion of other statutory criteria. OMB recognizes that some benefits and costs, including im portant ones such as protecting landscapes, preventing species extinction, protecting privacy, nurturing families, advancing f airness objectives, and encouragi ng innovation, cannot be fu lly quantified and/or expressed in m onetary units. The final guidance urges analysts to charac terize the non-quantifiable benefits and costs and, where feasible, identify the m ost im portant of these factors. EO 12866 requires consideration of non-quantified factors per justif y costs\" test in EO 12866. Moreover, OMB recognizes that the role of BCA in regulatory deci sion m aking will vary widely depending upon the statutory standards governing an agency' s decision making (251, 350). One comm enter (236 ) question ed whether it is even appropriate to assign a dollar value to a variety of attributes asso ciated w ith health, safety, a nd environm ental regulation. OMB recognizes that m onetizing som e of the effects of regulation is difficu lt, and quantifying som e effects m ay not even be feasible . In such cases, cost-effectiv eness analysis provides a rigorous way to identify options that achieve the m ost ef fective u se of resources availab le in te rms of achieving the intended regulatory benefits. One comm enter (360 ) observed th at monetary values for prevention of m orbidity are often unavailable and that health-utility values, num eric ratings of health conditions, are m ore available than m onetary values. OMB concurs with this observation, which is why the final guidance en courages ag encies to co nsider an alytic approach es for trans lating he alth-utility va lues into m onetary values. One comm enter (360 ) expressed co ncern th at the draft Guid ance m ight perm it agencies to com pute benefits in B CA through a procedure th at would translate qualit y-adjusted life years (QALYs) into dollars through a procedure based on current health care investm ents (e.g., using the cos t-effectiven ess ratios for heart disease o r cancer treatm ent as a norm ative b enchmark). The comme nter described such a \"p roblem atic\" since health care investm ents m ay not reflect individual preferences . If agencies translate QALYs into dollars for use in BCA, agencies should consider a procedure base d on personal preference and willingness to pay. 167 One comm enter (360), in discussing BCA, expressed concern about the theoretical relev ance an d valid ity of the tradition al \"cos t-of-illness\" (COI) values us ed by som e agencies. COI values typically include onl y health care expenses and lo st wages, ignoring pain and subjective concerns. BCA should be based on WT P rather than COI values. However, OMB notes th at WTP values so metimes ignore the exte rnal cos ts of prem ature death and illn ess (e.g., public health care expenditures) and thus COI values, if properly com puted, m ay have an appropriate role in supplem enting WTP values. They also have a cl early defined role in CEA, as defined in the public health and m edical literature. One comm enter (360) expressed the view th at \"models are reasonably w ell established for estim ating W TP for health benefits of ai r quality im provem ents\". Although EPA has m ade progress in this field, m ost of this m odeling is based on application of \"benefit-transfer\" m ethods that are as sociated with s ubstantial u ncertainty. While the commenter (360) is correct that some transfer v alues used by agencies h ave been ba sed on elaborate m eta-analyses, the technique of meta-analysis is not designed to address the pr oblem of irrelevant information. The f inal guidance en courages ag encies to employ econo mic tool s and data that are directly relevant to the specif ic reg ulato ry context. On a re lated m atter, the sam e commenter (360) stated that \"it is widely acc epted tha t the mortalit y effects dom inate th ese (E PA particu late) an alyses (based on WTP studies over the la st decad e).\" The rela tive size of m orbidity v ersus mortality b enefits in BCA cannot be known with confidence until complete and relevant inform ation are available for both m orbidity and m ortality effects.97 One comm enter (299) urged OMB to insist that agencies p resent benefit a nd cost estim ates on a region al and State basis as well as a national basis. Such infor mation can be useful in certain situations. However, the burden on agencies of producing highly disaggregated benefit and cost inform ation can be significant. The final OMB guidanc e provides discretion to agencie s to determ ine, with OMB oversigh t, what le vel of disaggregation is appropriate. Three commenters (236, 334, 335) asserted that BCA has an \"ingrained tendency\" to overestim ate costs and underestim ate benefits, particularly in e nvironm ental policy. The revised guidelines seek to ensure that analysts account for all im portant effects of regulations, regardless of the analysts' ability to quantify them. Analysts should st rive to do their best to prepare complete and unbiased estim ates of both expect ed benefits and costs during the rulem aking process. One comm enter (299) suggested that the guidance should inst ruct agencies to perform and take account of retrospective analysis of their benefit and cost estim ates. Retrospective analysis of rules is valuable and is often m ost objectively perform ed by independent think tanks and universities. When agencies conduct su ch evaluations, the final OMB guidance is applicable; indeed, som e of the specific provisi ons in the final guideli nes are based on insights learned from previous retrospective evaluati ons (e.g., studies showi ng how learning curves reduce the m arginal variable cost of production). 97 Committee on Estimating the Heal th Risk-Reduct ion Benefits of Proposed Air Pollution Regulations, B oard on Environmental Studies and Toxicology, National Research Council (2002), Estima ting the Pub lic Hea lth Benefits o f Proposed Air Pollution Regulations, Natio nal Acad emy Press, Wash ington, DC. 168 One comm enter (326) urged OMB to prohibit th e use of benefit assessm ents that treat \"avoided costs\" of regula tory a lternatives as a be nefit. Agencies should not use \"avoided-cost\" methods unless the agency can present a viable case that, in the absence of the preferred regulation, the costly alternatives will be adopted or can assess how likely it is that the costly alternatives will be adop ted. In cases where th e rulem aking agency itself has the d iscretion not to adopt the costly alternatives, the avoided cost should not be incl uded as a benefit. The final guidelines include a specific warning on the use of \"avoided costs\" as a m easure of benefits. In contrast to the above comments, one comm enter (348) emphasized that agency practices typ ically understate the co sts of regul ation because they focus on com pliance cost to business rather than full social costs. The full costs include, f or exam ple, not just the tangible costs to producers of building m ore fuel-efficien t vehicles but also any decrem ents in vehicle quality (e.g., perform ance or size) or safety that m ay result. Full social costs are often larger than strict com pliance costs, and the final guide lines instruct agencies to identify and quantify whenever p ossible all p otential incr emental costs. One comm enter (335 ) requests th at greater consideration be given to the role of technology in lowering the costs of regulation over tim e. This is a valid point that was acknowledged in OMB' s draft guidelines and has b een retained in the final guidelines. This point is already built into the standard cost-est imation m ethods used by Federal agencies such as the U.S. Environm ental Protection A gency. More research is needed to refine and better quantify patterns in technological cost reduction th at occu r over tim e. At the sam e time, the prom ises of technology are som etimes overestim ated, with actual effectiveness som etimes lower and operating costs som etimes higher than orig inally expected. Two commenters (340, 342) cautioned against excessive optim ism about \"technology-forcing\" regulations due to concerns for practicality and affordability. In addition to this concern, there m ay be opportunity costs associated w ith technolo gy-forcing regulations because the regulations m ay divert resources from one avenue of research to another. Agency analysts should carefully evaluate the claim s made in favor of and against regulati ons that would prom ote new technologies. For lifesaving rules, com menters differed on whether agencies should use the econom ic \"value of statistical lif e\" (VSL) and/or the econom ic \"value of a statistical life year\" (VSLY). In the BCA literature, the V SL method is m ore wide ly used. A comm on objection to VSL is that it does not take into account life expectancy ( 260, 332, 348). For the sam e individual, saving 40 years of life is m ore valuable than extending life by less than a year. VSLY is the only practical approach that has been develope d and used to address this obj ection to the VSL approach. Yet several comm enters (e.g., 344) argued that a simple VSLY method -- im plying that V SL declines linearly with age and that each year o f life is valu ed the sam e -- is no t well grounded in econom ic theory or em pirical resear ch on personal preferences. In the final guidelines, we c ontinue to encourage use of both m ethods but have m ade two key changes: (1) an instruction to analysts to use the sam e VSL for people of all ages, and (2) an instru ction to analys ts to present resu lts with larger valu es for VSLY when rules are a imed prim arily or significantly prot ection of senior zens (b ecause senio rs face larger o verall health risk s from all cau ses and because they have accum ulated savings and liquid ass ets to 169 expend on protection of their health and safety). The result is a prem ium on each life year saved among senior citizens, though there is uncertainty about how large this prem ium should be. OMB receiv ed num erous comm ents (e.g., 346) o bjecting to u se of an age-adjustm ent factor that reduces VSL for those over age 65. In a recen t memorandum to the Presid ent's Managem ent Council, O MB directed all agencies not to use such an age-adjusted factor in VSL analys is. The Circular in corporates this direction to the ag encies. OMB receiv ed a num ber of often conflicting pub lic comm ents on the prop er role of contingent valuation (C V) m ethods in regulato ry analysis. CV m ethods quantify benefits through surveys of personal willingness to pa y for goods and services. Some commenters (307, 314, 328, 341, 342, 350) argued that the OMB guidan ce is too perm issive regarding C V methods, while others (227, 246, 291) argued that the quality sta ndards for CV studies im posed by OMB we re overly stringent or m isdirected. CV has an appropriate role in regulatory analysis, but the hypothetical nature of the questions require that the analyst m ake sure such surveys are designed, conducted, analyze d, and reported in a rigorous way. B. Cost-Effec tiveness Analysis In the draft guidelines, OMB proposed to expa nd the role of cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) in regulatory analysis, in addition to m aintaining the strong trad itional role for BCA. Major health and safety rulem akings are to be supported by a CEA as well as a BCA. The vast majority of commenters favored the expande d role for CEA in regulatory analysis. In discussing agency preparedness to conduct BCA and CEA, one comm enter (360) caution ed that som e \"agency cultures are en trenched\": \"At E PA, for instance, stand ard procedures are for using BCA and there is lik ely to be a cos tly learning curve for using CEA. At some of the public health agencies the learni ng curve for monetization techniques is likewise high. . .\" Although there m ay be some m erit in th is historical observati on, OMB is encouraged that analysts at EPA and other pub lic health agencies are alrea dy engaged in active discussions about how to im prove the practice of regulatory anal ysis. The costs to agencies of using analytic tools and d ata that are a lready widely used in the peer-reviewed litera ture will be rela tively small. One comm enter (360), while suggesting that O MB's guidance should be m ore prescriptive, also argued that \"agencies should have the optio n of perfor ming BCA and CEA in their preferred way as a supplem ent to m eeting the OMB guidelines and to do so without the need of justification. \" OMB encourages agencies to present a variety of an alytic perspectives in regula tory a nalysis ; app roaches th at are in consis tent with OM B guidance will r equire justif ication. This comm enter (360), responding to the CEA and BCA requirem ents in the draft guidance, urged OMB to phase in the BCA/CEA requirem ents over several years. OMB is prepared to waive analy tic requ irements in th e near term if agencies d emonstrate th at they are not equipped to com ply but have a concrete plan for developing appropriate capabilities. 170 One comm enter (347) argued that B CA should be em ployed when the agency has som e choice over whether regulations should be issued at all, whereas CEA is only appropriate when the agency is lim ited to a choice over which regu latory m ethod to adopt in order to achieve a mandated objective. In addition to this distinction, OMB believes that some decision m akers may gain insight from both CEA and BCA when the agency h as som e choice abou t whether to regulate. In the health field, for example, CEA is much more widely conducted and used than BCA, even when a decision m aker has broad discretion on how to proceed. One comm enter (284) supported the requirem ent for CEA but argued that BCA should generally be preferred, even for health and safety rulem akings. BCA does provide m ore inform ation about econom ic efficiency than CEA but CEA offers a complem entary perspective, particularly for health and safety rules. One comm enter (270) stated that O MB shoul d not assum e that a single m etric of effectivenes s can be selected for all rulem akings. Instead, this commenter advocated that agencies perfor m CEAs with several m easures of effectivenes s because th e different m easures may illum inate different aspects of regulation. OMB agrees with this co mment. For exam ple, OMB is not aware of any single m easure that can com bine both public health and ecological outcom es (unless they can both be quantified and expressed in dolla r units, in a BCA). Thus, the final OMB guidance does not require a univers al effectivenes s metric for use in CEA . In the draft guidance, O MB noted that health and safety agen cies are us ing a variety o f effectivenes s measures in CEA: lives saved, \"eq es saved, life-years saved, and quality-ad justed life years saved. Addition al measures hav e been sugges ted in the academ ic literature. A range of views were expressed a bout which m easures of effectiveness should be employed by health and safety agencies. Specialists in public he alth and m edicine (4, 291 ) have argued that the qua lity-adju sted life year (QALY) is currently the p referred m easure of effectiveness in the peer-rev iewed literature, and thus OMB should treat QALYs as the preferred m easure. They pointed out that a key advantage of \"QALYs saved\" over \"lives saved\" and \"life-years saved\" is that Q ALYs account for the im pact of nonfatal diseases and injuries on a person' s quality of life. Another commenter (360) expressed concer n that if lives saved or life -years saved are used as the measure of e ffectiveness, other health endpoints may be ignored. OMB will ask the Institute of Medicine to assem ble a panel of specialists in CEA and bioethics to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of different m easures of effectiven ess. One comm enter (292 ) raised a con cern that th e health fram ework is not based on personal willingn ess to pay, which is the foun dation of BCA . Yet other comm enters (4, 246, 336) raised concerns ab out priv ate willingn ess to pay as a so le hea lth-po licy standard, based on ethical reasons (sin ce it is tied to a person' s ability to pay) and technical c oncerns (i.e., developing accurate, precise and rob ust m easur ements of willingness to p ay for health gains has p roven to be challenging). The CEA- QALY fra mework does de part from personal willingness to pay, but CEA is intended to supp lement, not replace, BCA. Even proponents of CEA (4) in th e health field believe it should be presente d in conjunction with BCA. 171 CEA allows policym akers to consider how m uch investm ent in QALY gai ns is appropriate in different rulem aking contexts, without im posing an analytic determ ination of how much investm ent in safety is enough. A som ewhat different view (246) is that \"CEA using QALYs or s imilar m etrics is best interpreted as an evaluation method that individuals m ight agree to, based on notions of fairness, even more so before knowing their own particular circum stances (i.e., behind a Rawlsian veil of ig norance).\" Thus, CEA m ay be cons idered m ore sensitive to certain fairness concer ns than BCA. It should be noted that in practice, som e issues of \"fairness\" are also addressed in BCA (e .g., use of the sam e VSL for all lives saved). Technical concerns were also raised a bout som e of the sim plifying, restrictive assum ptions about individual preferences th at underpin the QALY fra mework, but these commenters did not suggest a superior m etric for us e in CEA (359). As one specialist (4) noted, \"In orde r acilitate denom inators should be encouraged, and QALYs re present the best availa ble health preference measure for that purpose\". Another specia list (350) noted th at the sim plifying assumptions with QALYs are of m ost concern when the QAL Y measure is applied to widely dif ferent program s and populations. Comm enters raised concerns about the technical quality of som e published QALY surveys (292). One commenter (360) notes that QALY surveys are often derived from small, specialized s amples and that the survey techniqu es used to de termine health -utility valu es need to exam ined rigorously for robus tness and unbiasedness. These c oncerns have m erit and thus agencies sho uld rev iew QALY surveys carefully before selecting num erical values for use in regulatory analysis. Just as contingent valuation surveys need to be scrutinized with care, surveys des igned to assess health preferences and QALYs nee d to be scrutinized with care. QALYs are the m ost commonly used m easure in CEA, are based on sim plifying assum ptions, and m ore research is needed to im prove the QALY m easure and/or develop alternative o r supplem entary m easures. It is not necessary to select a sin gle effectiveness measure at this tim e, and the QALY m easure needs further developm ent to justify such exclusive status (259). Agencies should, when possible, develop and present cost-effectiveness ratios with one or m ore effectivenes s measures that provide insight to regulators. Some commenters (251, 253, 335, 336) expressed concern with som e of the im plications of the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) m ethod in term s of t he treatm ent of the elderly and those who have disabilities. Another comm enter (341), while favoring use of the life-year metric, argued that it will be difficult to pe rsuade the public that it should accept \"quality adjustm ents\". Circular A-4 directs that CEA m ethods based on QALYs sh ould be m odified to address such concerns, especially when lifesaving ru les are aim ed at protecting the disabled. For the sake of both analytic simplicity and f airness, lifesaving gains ach ieved among groups with disabilities should be com puted without penalizing these groups for their pre-existing conditions; this can be done by using life-expectancy inform ation on the longevity of the non-disabled in the same age cohort, as m easured in s tandard life tables. For rules that p reven t or m itigate 172 disabilities, the QALY method is well designed to reflect the va lues of those who are at an increased risk of becom ing disabled. One comm enter sought more clarity from OMB about the reasons for imposing a CEA requirem ent in addition to existing requirem ents (251). First, as expl ained above, CEA provides a different perspective f or regulators by res ponding to som e\u2014though not all\u2014of the technical and ethical lim itations of BCA. Second, CEA\u2014by its very nature\u2014provides guidance on how to maximize public health gains across a specified set of regulatory options with available public health resources. By contrast, the focus of BCA is on whether a particular investm ent in health protection is efficient from a societal perspective given the m any dem ands in our econom y, including housing, transporta tion, and education. C. Probabilis tic Uncertain ty Analysis The draft gu idelines in cluded a requ irement that agencies present a form al quantitativ e analysis of the relevant uncertainties within regulatory analyses for m ajor rules involving econom ic effects of $1 billion or m ore. This anal ysis should present probability distributions for the estim ated benefits and costs to provide de cision m akers with info rmation on the degree of scientific uncertainty an d the robustness of estim ated probab ilities, benefits, and costs. The majority of comments were favorable to this expanded requirem ent for form al probability analysis in regulatory analysis . Here we summ arize and resp ond to som e of the critical comments. One comm enter (3 ) ackn owledged th at form al probability analysis, based on expert judgm ent, has value in personal decision m aking (e.g., m edical decision analysis) but is not appropriate for use in public decision m aking. The comm enter's rationale was that, when subject to political pressures from various interests, experts m ay find it difficult to provide candid probability assessm ents for public policy. OMB acknowledges that this is a potential p roblem but it applies to all forms of expe rt judgem ent, not just those used to inform a for mal probability analys is. By using m ultiple exp erts and peer view, agencie s ce the inf luenc e pressur es on probability assessm ents. One comm enter (335) urged that the requirem ent for probability analysis be dropped and replaced with a m ore limited approach to unc ertainty analysis sugge sted in current EPA guidelines. However, it was EPA' s lim ited appro ach that was recen tly evaluated by a panel of the National Research C ouncil in its report, Estimating the P ublic Heal th Benefits of Proposed Air Pollu tion Regulatio ns (Septem ber 2002). The panel concluded that \"EPA should begin to move the as sessm ent of uncertainties from its an cillary analyses into its prim ary analyses by conducting probabilis tic, multiple-so urce uncertain ty analyses. This shift will require specification of probability distri butions for m ajor sources of un certainty. These distributions should be based on available data and expert judgem ent.\" The final OMB guidance is consistent with this recomm endation. One comm enter (360) recommended that OMB guidance address \"appropriate developm ent of scenarios to fair ly represent statistical and m odel unce rtainties, given that Mon te Carlo sim ulation will be used. . .\" OMB consider s scenario analysis a nd Monte Carlo sim ulation 173 to be only two of the available tool s of for mal probability analysis. Rather than present detailed guidance at this early stage, OMB intends to conv ene agency analys ts to d iscuss their experiences in perform ing probabilit y analys is. Over tim e, as agency ex perien ce is accum ulated, it may be appropriate for OMB to issue supplem ental guidance on this topic. Another commenter (347) regards the use of \"Delphi m ethods\" -- panels of experts providing probability judgm ents -- as troubling and provides the following suggestions to safeguard against m isuse of expert judgm ents: \"Any resort to expert judgm ent should include full identification of the experts, their qualifications, their public ations and testim ony histories, and any contractual relationships with the agency or interested parties. Agency em ployees should not be used for this sort of validation, a nd the agency should avoid using the sam e experts repeatedly. \" OMB agrees that relevant expertise, public tran sparency, and independence from the agency are im portant facets of a m ajor expert -judgm ent project. Agencies and O MB need to develop m ore experience with the expert-judgm ent approach to probability assessm ent before issuing detailed guidance. The sam e commenter (347) urged O MB to inclu de greater sp ecificity in the guidance about the need for transparency in both data and modeling: \". . . the agency should disclose the models used to m ake the determ ination, the way data were gathered a nd handled, and the data them selves should be released to the public unless exem pted in the sam e manner that inform ation can be withheld under the Freedom of Infor mation Act (FOIA). Only in that way can the analysis m eet the data quality guidelines goa l of reproducibility.\" OMB agrees that transparency about data and m odeling are critical to achieve, as described in OMB' s inform ation- quality guidelines and cross-referenced in the fi nal OMB Circular on regulatory analysis. A num ber of commenters ( 257, 328, 347, 348, 350) believe that the $1 billion threshold for probability analy sis should be lo were d, and possibly be replaced by the $100 m illion thresho ld contained in E O 12866. Another com (339) argued that the $1 billio thresho ld should be accom panied by a \"tiered\" approach to uncertainty analysis for rules costing less than $1 billion bu t more than $100 m illion per year. But, as one commenter (347) also no ted, the $1 billion th reshold will f ocus this p robability ana lysis on the sm all num ber of rules tha t have the larges t impact on the eco nomy. As agencies g ain experience with f ormal probability a nalysis, it may be appropriate to apply this t ype of analysis to a la rger number of rules in the f uture. OMB believ es that the final gu idance prov ides agencies and OMB the appropria te degree of discretion to define the am ount of uncertainty analysis th at is appropriate for specific rules. One comm enter (292 ) expressed co ncern abou t the em phasis on probability d istribu tions instead of best estim ates of risk, cost, and bene fit. This commenter wa s concerned that risks should not b e dism issed sim ply because they cou ld not be p roven based o n tests of statistical significance. Another commenter (250) expressed concer n that probability an alysis might m ean delay of regulation until there is certainty. However, OMB gui delines do not im pose statistical significance or certainty as a requirem ent for regulatory intervention. OMB agrees with a statem ent by one comm enter (292) that agencies s hould focus on \"best\" estim ates of risk (i.e., the expected estim ates of risk specified in the OMB infor mation quality guidelines). OMB also agrees with this comm enter that best estim ates may require use of both \"hard\" and \"soft\" data, including judgm ental probabilities. A probability distribution m ay be necessary or useful in 174 constructing \"best estim ates\" of risk, cost, and bene fit. Without such a pr obability distribution, it is not clear how an expected estim ate would be derived. Another commenter (227) objected to the prac tice of com bining two or more assumptions to produce a low \"alternative estim ate\" of several recent EPA rulem akings A different commenter (254) objected to the practice of combining two or m ore assum ptions to produce an im plausibly large estim ate of risk or benefit, citing the ris k assessm ent practices in EPA' s pest icides program. Yet both of these commenters appear to support OMB's step toward m ore for mal probability analysis in prim ary estim ates of risks, benefits, and costs. One comm enter (236) argued that complex probability analyses would m ake the rulem aking process less transparent for the ordina ry citizen s and the average reade r. OMB' s response is that tools have been developed to co nvey probability inform ation to decision m akers and the public. Federal agencies have a responsib ility to develop and convey these probabilities of benefit and cost. D. Time Preference and the Disco unting of Future Benefits and Costs Benefits and costs do not always occur in the same time period. If benefits and costs are separated in tim e, the difference in tim ing shoul d be accounted for in the analysis. The main rationales for doing so include: (a) Resources that ar e inves ted will nor mally earn a positiv e return, so cur rent consum ption is more expensive than future consumption, since you are giving up th at expected return on investm ent when you consum e today. (b) Postponed b enefits also have a cost because people generally prefer present to future consum ption. They are said to h ave positiv e time preference. To m ake this adjustm ent, analysts use a disc ount factor to reflect th e differences in tim ing of benefit and cost estim ates. The m agnitude of this discount factor depends on the discount rate and the differences in tim ing of benefits and cost s. The f urther in the f uture the ben efits and costs are ex pected to occur, th e greater the discount factor. OMB proposed that BCA and CEA be conducted using two discount rate s: 3 percent and 7 percent. The draft guidelines would also perm it sensitivity analyses with rates higher than 7 percen t and lower than 3 percen t whenever a s trong case could be m ade for rates outside the 3 to 7 percent range. A lower rate m ight be appropria te when a rule has very long run effects and significan t intergen erational conseq uences, a higher rate when a rule is likely to hav e a large displacem ent effect on high return p rivate cap ital. The comme nters presented a wide range of views on how tim e preference and th e analy tic practice of discounting should be handled in regulatory analysis, although there was substantia l support f or the proposal to use tw o discounts rates: 3 percent and 7 percent. At least two commenters ( 235, 246) urged OMB to be m ore specific about the tim e horizons to be em ployed in regu latory analys is. If the selecte d tim e horiz on is too sho rt, 175 important benefits and co sts could b e omitted. OMB has left this judgm ent to th e agencies that conduct analysis becau se it believes that general guidance on this poin t is not possib le. The tim e horizons relevant to various rulem akings vary en ormously. A useful guidepost is that the tim e horizon should be long enough to encom pass all im portant benefits and costs so that extending the horizon would not change the re sults of the analysis signifi cantly, bu t this insight does not provide a num erical tim e frame. One comm enter (348 ) raised a con cern that a range of 3 percent to 7 percent rate m ight not encom pass all the appropriate discount rates. If the target population realizing benefits and costs is relatively poor, they m ay exhibit di scount rates above 7 per cent in their personal consum ption decisions, while bett er-off households m ay exhibit lowe r rates of discount in their personal decision m aking. The final Guidance is designed with sufficient flexibility to perm it agencies to present results with multiple rates, including rates a bove 7 percent, if a strong case for a higher rate has been m ade by the agency. The sam e commenter (348) argued f urther th at there should be at m ost a single \"weak default\" rate of 7 percent rather than a range of rates. OMB agrees that the discount rate should not be seen as a universal constant but also beli eves that agency analysts need som e guidance on the rang e of rates tha t is appropriate to use in the absen ce of com pelling evidence for one specific rate or another. Also, specification of discount rates assures com parability of analysis across ag encies. One comm enter (4) stated that a 7 percent discount rate seem s high, even as an upper bound. He argued that 7 percent m ay be high, both as an estim ate of the long-term , historical pre-tax rate of return on private- sector inves tment or as a forecast of futu re rates of return on private investm ent. The reviewer's comments a ppear to b e strongly influ enced by the recen t disappointing results in U.S. financial m arkets. As shown in Appendix F, OMB has developed evidence using data from the National Incom e and Product Accounts and other sources that on a long-term basis, the real rate of return to capital in the Unite d States has been around 7 percent and even higher for the corporate sector. The commenter's recomm ende d rate for regulatory analysis (2.5 percent - 3. 0 percen t) is close to the lower ra te contained in OMB Circular A-4, but this low rate would not be appropriate for regulations that had a st rong displacing effect on capital investm ent. Another co mmenter (9) claim ed that 7 percen t was too high because it d oes not acco unt for the negative externalities (e.g., pollution) that are associated with som e forms of private investm ent. However, the comm enter did not demonstrate th at thes e externalities would significantly reduce the 7 percent rate. Another commenter ( 227) argued that the 7 percent rate was based on the outm oded opportunity-cost-of-p rivate-capital appro ach and discounting for regulatory analysis instead should be based on the preferred \"shadow-p rice of capital\" approach. However, another (246) argued that the shadow -price approach is not yet sufficiently well developed to be applied in routin e regulato ry analysis. OMB agrees that, while in pr incip le, the shadow-price approach is a m ore accurate appr oach, it is not yet sufficien tly developed to specify as a general a pproach to discounting. 176 Several comm enters (251, 259, 334, 335, 336, 346, and 350) acknowledged the need for discounting future stream s of dollars, but argued that loss of life is a qualit ative change for which discounting m ay not be appropriate . They argued further that lif e cannot be invested in a bank account, like m oney, to yield a higher value over tim e. Particular concern was expressed about how discounting reduces the com puted value of pr eventing d iseases and im pairm ents that occur after a long latency period. Upon close exam ination, however, the argum ent of som e commenters that agency analysts should assign a zero disc ount rate to future he alth gains is not convincing. The discount rate is an an alytic too l that enab les policy m akers to com pare regulatory alternatives that yield benefits at different tim es and with different cost s. Without discounting of future health gains, some very pervers e resu lts will o ccur. First, con sider the s imple case in which th e agen cy faces two regul atory alternatives: Option A will sav e 10,00 0 lives within 15 years and Option B will sav e 10,000 lives in 50 years. If a zero discount rate is applied to these hea lth gains, the tw o opti ons will be viewed as equivalent, which is counter to th e comm on sense and techn ical view that it is p referable to s ave the 10,000 lives sooner rather than later. Although there m ay be exceptional cases where future health gains are preferred over ne ar-term health gains, these s hould be treated as exceptions rather than the common practice. Second, consider a slightly m ore comple x case where Option A, which saves 10,000 lives at a low cost (e.g., $10 million or $1,000 per life saved) is being analyzed as to the proper effective date. If a lower discount rate is applied to future health gains than future costs, then it can be shown that Optio n A will loo k even bette r analy tically if the ef fective da te is d elayed a year (b ecause the future costs will be discounted more than th e future lifesaving). This reflects the Keeler-Cretin paradox, nam ed for analysts at the Rand C orpor ation, which states that any attem pt to as sign a lower rate of dis count to fu ture health gain s than cos ts will produ ce the pervers e result th at an a ttractive lif esaving inve stment will always be m ade m ore attr activ e with delay of its effective date. In order to avoid this perversity, th ere is professional consensus that the sam e discount rate should be applied to future health gains and costs. Finally, the discounting of future health ga ins (compared to near-term costs) does not even depend on the argum ent the saving lives is intrins ically more valuab le today tha n in the future. As long as lifesaving is costly in th e near term , the analyst needs to consider the opportunity costs of those invest ments, since there is a forego ne investm ent opportunity from near term costs (e.g., the opportunity cost is that the sam e funds could be invested at a positiv e rate of return and expended later to save m ore lives or accomplish other valuable purposes). Analysts can account for this opportunity cost ei ther (a) by increasing th e costs to ref lect the expected rate of return on investm ent or (b ) discounting the future he alth gains a t a rate equivalent to the expected rate of return on th e required investm ent. Either procedure leads to the sam e analytic result. A num ber of commenters (9, 334, and 335) sugg ested that a zero discount rate should be considered when evaluating rules with long-term , intergenerationa l impacts. They advanced a variety of practical and philosophical argum ents for that position. However, another commenter 177 (336) pointed out that rules with indeterm inate or indefinite long- term effects m ust be evaluated with a non-zero discoun t rate in order to avo id a pe rvers e result: rules with benefits expected to continue over an open-ended or infinite tim e horizon would always be considered m ore worthwhile, and thus preferred, to rules with specified benefits for a finite tim e period. Without discounting, the infinite stream of benefits would have an infi nite value. For rules with intergenerational im pacts, the review er (336) fa vored presentation of re sults with a 1 percent discount rate. The draft guidelines allowed agencies to use such a low rate in this context. The commenter (336) noted that any di scount rate for intergenerationa l benefits lasting beyond a few decades sho uld not exceed 1 percen t, since o therw ise the time fram es involved will autom atically trivialize the future benef its out of recognition. Some commenters (284, 292, 307, 340, 341, 348), however, raised concerns with OMB' s proposed new approach to intergenerational disc ounting, which would perm it agencies to use a rate of discount as low as 1 percent for analysis of regulations with long-term effects on future generations. One comm enter (340) stated th e view that m arket ra tes of return on investm ent are generally larger for longer tim e periods, but did not explain why the sim ple passage of time would be expected to increase rates of return. This comm enter argued that the opportunity costs of investing now to protect future generations sh ould be evaluated using a discount rate larger than the 3 p ercent and 7 percen t rates used for more near-term horizons. Others (341), after quoting several prom inent econom ists who believ e that ethics and econom ics should inform policy toward social tim e preferen ce, reject a role for ethics an d instead urges OMB to base the intergenerational discount rate on market determ inations. Another comm enter (348) objected to intergenerational ra tes less than 3 percent because it would amount to a \"transfer of wealth\" from the current generation to future generations w ho are likely to be even better off. These comm ents reveal that intergenerat ional tim e preference is a m atter of both econom ics and fairness. The final guidelines pe rmit agency analysts to present results for intergener ational ru les using discount rates that are outside the 3 percent and 7 percent range required for all regulatory analysis. One comm enter (303) praised OMB for the ne w instruction for presentation of the annual time stream s of benefits and costs in regulator y analysis. The reviewer went further and requested that these stream s be summ ed and a s ensitivity an alysis b e reported with a 0 percen t discount rate. OMB believes th at presenting the annual tim e stream s is important for transparency , but that the discounting of future benefits and co sts is n ecessary for m eaningful intertem poral com parisons. One comm enter (340) asked if discount rates for longer peri ods of tim e should be larger than for shorter periods b ecause interest earned in the m arket has an upwardly slop ing supply curve for longer tim e periods. OMB believes this is a fair point, but there are reasons for not making this adjustm ent. First, it would add to the com plicatio n of the guid elines by req uiring a different rate for different tim e periods. The gui delines do make an allowance for this when the time period is very long, as it is for intergen erational discounting, but within generations a simple process of discounting using only two ra tes is recomm ended for most analysis. More importantly, over the relevant tim e periods, say, 5 to 30 years, the yield curve has not been especially steep on average. The average differe nce between the five-year interest rate and the 178 thirty-year rate has only been about 1/2 percentage point over the last 25 year s. This is not large enough to justify a separate di scount rate for short versus long-term regulatory im pacts. E. Data: Collection, Acces s, and Quality Several comm enters m ade specific p oints a bout the need for quali ty, transparency, and public access to data used in regu latory anal ysis. Others expressed concern about whether OMB' s regulatory analysis and da ta quality guidelines are too one rous for agencies. The m ajor comments are summ arized here. One comm enter (347 ) suggests th at the draf t OMB guidance gives insufficient direction about when data are insu fficient to su pport a deci sion, either b ecause they are so few in num ber, or they are gathered im properly. In cases wher e the data are inadequate, the comm enter argu es, the agencies should be required to gather additional data. Similarly, another comm enter (326) argued th at agencie s sometimes initiate rulem akings without investing the effort to collect the valid data needed to inform the rulem aking proces s. OMB notes tha t data colle ction is costly and no data are of perfect quality. The costs and value of m ore data collection and quality control should be analyzed w ith the \"value-of-inform ation\" fram ework prom oted in the OMB guidelines. One comm enter (259 ) raised a con cern that the com bination of OMB' s new regulatory analysis guidelines and OMB' s new inform ation quality guidelines m ight cause rejection of prom ising regulations. OMB belie ves that the requirem ents in th e two sets of guidelines are compatible and, in both cases, agencies are provid ed discretion to tailor the investm ent in data quality and regulatory analysis to the importance of the rulem aking. 179 APPE NDIX F: COMPUTING AVERAG E RAT ES OF RET URN TO PRIVATE CAPITAL IN THE UNI TED STATES: 1947-2001 Between 1947 and 2001, the real rate of return to total private capital in the United States averaged around 7 percent. The corresponding estim ate for the dom estic corporate sector alone was around 9 percent over the sam e span of tim e. These estim ates were derived from National Incom e and Product Accounts (NIPA) data, relate d data on stocks of physical capital from the Bureau of Econom ic Analysis (BEA ), and other sources. The rates of return were calculated by dividing an estim ate of capital incom e by the cu rrent valu e of the cap ital stock. Property and incom e taxes attribu table to cap ital were inc luded in the num erator along with investors' after- tax incom es. The capital stocks were valued at replacem ent cost or m arket value and com puted as mid-year averages. The last com plete year of available data was 2001. A. Sources for the Nationa l Capital Stock Estimate The tota l capital stock c onsisted of the su m of the value of st ructures, equipm ent, inventories, and land. U.S. citizens' holdings of foreign capital were added to the total, and foreign holdings of U.S. capital we re subtracted. This definition of the capita l stock aligns with the NIPA definition of national incom e, which in cludes U.S. citizen's earnings wherever earned and excludes foreign earnings m ade in the United States. The estim ated value of private structures and equipm ent cam e from \"Current-Cost Net Stock of Fixed Assets and Consum er Durable G oods,\" Table 1.1 in BEA's set of standard fixed asset tables, last revised Sept ember 25, 2002. It can be found at http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea , BEA's web site. End-of-year values were c onverted to m idyear values by averaging. The estim ate included both residentia l and nonresidential assets. The estim ated value of private inventories was drawn from NIPA Table 5.12B \"Private Inventories and Dom estic Final Sales by Industry (Q),\" also ava ilable on the BEA web site. The quarterly lev els for the second and third quarters of each year were averag ed to obtain the m id- year values. Land values through 1994 were draw n from the estim ated m arket value of private land reported in the Federal Reserve System 's flow-o f-funds balance sheet estim ates. This series, however, has been discontinued. Since 1994, th e estim ated land values w ere a com posite estim ate. Data from the Federal Reserve's F low-of-Funds data base were used to estim ate landholdings of private households a nd corporations. The estim ated land values for these sectors were calculated as the difference between total real estate values as reported in the flow-of-funds balance sheets and the estim ated va lues of structures in each s ector. The data can be found in Tables B-100 and B-102 of the Flow of Funds Ac counts of the United States: Balance Sheets, and they can be accessed through th e Federal Reserve website, http://www.federalreserve.gov . Agricultural land values were de rived from Depa of Agricu lture es timates of the m arket value of farm real es tate. The estim ates wer e obtained f rom the f ollowin g web site : http://www.ers.usda.gov/Briefi ng/Farm Income/Data/Bs_t6.htm . BEA estim ates for the net value of far m structures were subtracted from the tota l value of farm real es tate to obta in an estim ate of 180 the value of land. The landholdings of the economy's rem aining sectors were not directly observable. Estim ates of the m issing values we re com puted based on the assum ption that the share of this land in total la ndholdings approaches the average ratio for these sectors that prevailed from 1946 through 1994 -- about 32 percent. Net holdings of foreign capital were added to the estim ated to tal capital s tock to align the estim ate with the m easure of capital incom e draw n from NIPA. The NIPA national incom e data include earnings of U.S. citizens on holdings of foreign capital while excluding foreigners' earnings fro m dom estic capital. For recen t years BEA's estim ates of the U.S.-owned and foreign owned private assets with direct investm ent at market value w ere used for this adjustm ent, see Table 1 from U.S. Net International Investm ent Position at Yearend 2002, a BEA News Release. The historical data can be found at the BEA webs ite. B. Sources for the Estima te of Capital Income Capital inco me was derived entirely f rom NIPA data. It includes corporate profits with inventory valuation and capital consum ption adjustm ents net of the earnings of the Federal Reserve System , net interest, and rent, plus som e further additions which are detailed below. The m ost important of these further additions was an adjus tment to reflect the cap ital share of proprietors' incom e. Proprietors' incom e consists of the incom e earned by unincorporated businesses and the self-e mployed. Much of this incom e is properly thought of as labor income, but the self e mployed and noncorpora te business use physical capital, and thus part of proprietors' incom e consists of a return on th at capital. To cal culate the portion of proprietors' incom e due to capit al, th e share of capital incom e in national incom e excluding proprietors' incom e was com puted and that sam e share was assum ed to hold for proprietors' incom e. An alternative appro ach to the calculation produced a sim ilar an swer. On this approach, the labor component of proprietors' incom e was com puted by im puting a wage to the workers in this sector and subt racting those im puted labor earn ings from total proprietors' incom e with the rem aining incom e attributed to noncorporate capital. The total rate of return was not significantly affected by whichever m ethod was used. For exam ple, the rate of return averaged 6.7 percent sinc e 1947 on either approach. Two further adjustm ents were m ade to arrive at total capital in come. Property taxes w ere attributed en tirely to capital in come, while other indirect busine ss taxes were distributed between labor and capital using the shares of labor and capita l in national incom e excluding proprietors' incom e. A similar adjustm ent was made to busin ess subsidies net of the surpluses of governm ent enterp rises. These subsidies were su btracted fro m capital in come since they do not represen t market deter mined incom e. Finally, business tra nsfers were also added to tota l capital incom e. C. The Corporate Secto r The corporate cap ital sto ck was m easured as the sum of corporate equipment and structures, drawn from the BEA fixe d capital data base, plus corporate la nd estim ated using data from the Federal Reserv e's accoun ts, and an estim ate of corporate inven tories. Corporate inventories were com puted using the ra tio of corpor ate fixed cap ital to to tal capital. It 181 was assum ed that the ratio of inventory to fixed capital was the sam e for c orporate and noncorporate business. Corporate capital incom e was m easured as th e sum of corporate profits with inventory valuation and capital consum ption adjustm ents net of the earnings of the Federal Reserve System plus the n et interest p aid by the corp orate s ector with a m inor adjustm ent to ref lect indirect taxes, transfers and subsidies. The source for the estimates was NIPA Table 1.15, which can be located through the BEA web site. Capital incom e define d in this way is a broader concept than after- tax corporate profits. Corporations borrow to pay for som e of their cap ital and the return on that borrowing is part of the total retu rn on corporate capital, but it is not part of corporate profits. Also, indirect taxes on corporate output are partly borne by corporate capital stocks, and therefore are part of the total so cial return to corp orate capital. No adjustm ent was m ade for intern ational hol dings of capital because the capital in come measure used for the corporate s ector was dom estic c apital in come which include s all earnings from U.S. ca pital stocks and excl udes earnings on foreign capital. The rate of return to corp orate capital averaged 9.1 percent from 1947 through 2001, and 9.9 percent over the m ost recent 10 -year period, 1992-2001. See Table 23. Table 23.

The tool that OMB has develope d to play this role con structive ly is the A prom pt letter,\" which is intended to bring a policy matter to the attention of an agency. Prom pt letters do not have the m andatory im plication of a Presiden tial directive. Unlike a \"return letter,\" which is authorized by E.O. 1286 6, the prom pt letter sim ply constitutes an OMB request that an agency elevate a m atter in pr iority, recognizing that agencies have lim ited resources an d many conflicting dem ands for prior ity atten tion. The ultim ate decision about prior ity-setting rem ains in the ha nds of the regulatory agency. 185 An important feature of the prom pt letter can be its public nature, aim ed at stim ulating agency, public and congressional in terest in a potential regulatory or inform ational priority. Although prom pt letters could be treated as confidential pre-decisi onal communications, OMB believes that it was wiser to m ake these prom pt letters publicly available in order to focus congressional and public scrutiny on the im portant underlying issues. Table 25 provides a brief summary of agency responses to the ten prom pt letters OMB has sent to agencies and related OMB and agency follow-up activities. Table 25.

It details agency actions to involve State, local, and tribal governm ents in regulator y decisions that affect them , including expanded efforts to involve them in agency decis ion-making processes. As has been done in recent years, this report is being included along with our annual report to Co ngress on th e benefits an d costs of Federal regulations. This was done because th e two reports together address m any of the sam e issues and both highlight the need for regulating in a responsible m anner that acc ounts for the costs and benefits of rules and takes into consideration the intere sts of our intergovernm ental partne rs. As OMB stated in previous reports, we intend to continue to publish these two reports together. This report on agency compliance with the Act covers the period of October of 2001 through Septem ber of 2002 (rules published before October of 2001 were described in last year's report.) The period covered by this year's report will correspond with the period covered by the cost-benefit report. State and local governments have a vital constitutional responsibility to provide governm ent services. They have the m ajor role in providing dom estic public services, such as public education, law enforcem ent, road buildi ng and m aintenance, water supply, and sewage treatm ent. The Federal governm ent contributes to that role by prom oting a healthy econom y and by providing grants, loans, and tax subsidies to State and local governm ents. However, over the past two decades, State, local, and tribal gove rnments increasingly have expressed concerns about the difficulty of complying with Federal m andates without additional Federal resources. In response, C ongress passed the Unfunded Ma ndates Reform Act of 1995 (the Act). Title I of the Act focuses on the Legislat ive Bran ch, address ing the processes Congress should follow before enactm ent of any statut ory unfunded mandates. Title II addresses the Executive B ranch. It begins with a general dire ctive for ag encies to assess, unless o therwise prohibited by law, the ef fects of their rules on the other levels of govern ment and on the private sector (Section 201). Title II also describes specific analyses a nd consultations that agencies must undertake for rules that m ay result in e xpen ditures of over $100 m illion (ad justed annually for inflation) in any year by State, local, and tribal governm ents in the aggregate, or by the private secto r. Specifically, Sect ion 2 02 requires an agency to prepare a written s tatem ent for intergovernm ental m andates that describes in detail the require d analyses and consultations on the unfunded m andate. Section 205 requires that for all rules s ubject to Section 202, agencies must identify and consider a reasonable num ber of regulatory alternatives, and then generally select from among the m the least costly, m ost cost-effective, or least burdensom e option that achieves the objectives o f the rule. Exception s require the ag ency head to explain in the final rule why such a selection was not m ade or why su ch a selection would be inconsistent with law. 196 Title II requires agen cies to \"deve lop an e ffective process\" f or obtain ing \"meaningf ul and timely input\" from State, local a nd tribal governm ents in developing rules that contain significant intergovernm ental m andates (Section 204). Title II also singles out sm all governm ents for particular attention (Section 203). OMB's guidelines assist F ederal agencies in com plying with the Act and are based upon the following general principles: intergovernm ental consultations should take place as early as possi ble, beginning before issuance of a proposed rule and continuing throu gh the final rule stage, and be integrated explic itly in to the ru lemaking proces s; agencies should consult with a wide variet y of State, lo cal, an d trib al officials ; agencies sho uld estim ate direct cos ts and be nefits to assist with these cons ultations ; the scope of consultation should reflect the cost and significance of the mandate being considered; effective co nsulta tion re quires tr ust and significant and sustaine d attention so that all who participate can enjoy frank discussion and focus on key priorities; and agencies sho uld seek ou t State, local, and tribal views on costs, benefits, risks, and alternative m ethods of com pliance, and whethe r the Federal rule wi ll harmonize with and not duplicate sim ilar laws in other levels of governm ent. The scope of consultation activities unde rtaken by Federal departm ents such as Education, Health and Hum an Services, and Ag riculture demonstrate this Adm inistration's comm itment to building strong relationships with our intergovernm ental partners based upon the constitutional principles of fede ralism e mbodied in Title II of the Act. Federal agencies have been actively consulting with States, localities, and tribal governm ents in order to ensure that regulatory activities were conducted consistent w ith the requirem ents of the Act. This year's report shows an increased leve l of engagem ent, as several agencies have begun m ajor consultation initiatives. For exam ple, Educa tion has undertaken m ajor consultation initiatives with State, local and tribal governm ents intende d to im plement the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLBA). The NCLBA, which reauthorized th e Elem entary and Secondary Education Act and incorporated the m ajor education reform s propos ed by President Bush in his No Child Left Behind initiative, focused on accountability and school im provem ent. To im plement NCLBA, Education established a negotiated rulem aking process that included the participa tion of individuals representing parents, students and educators. In addition, Education held focus group sessions in Tam pa, Flor ida; Ne w Orleans, Louisiana; W ashington, DC; and Denver, Colorado to consult with interested State, local and tribal governm ents and th e public to obtain input in the developm ent of its regulations. At these se ssions and throughout th e negotiated rulem aking process, Education raised ques tions regarding regulatory polic y and asked for suggestions on how it could best im plem ent the changes m ade by the NCLBA of 2001 to Title I of th e Elem entary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as am ended, with the least am ount of burden to the entities affected by the ch anges. (May 6, 2002, 67 FR 30452) Education believes that the regulations were eas ier to im plem ent because consensus was reached on is sues in th e draft regulations. (July 5, 2002, 67 FR 45038) The result was the developm ent of regulations implementing NCLBA's provision s on academ standard s and accountab Nego tiated rulem efforts have r portions of NCLBA are im plemented. 197 Sections 206 and 208 of the Act direct OMB to send copies of required agency analyses to Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and to su bmit an annual report to Congress on agency compliance with Title II. Section 20 7 calls for the estab lishm ent of pilot program s for providing greater flexibility to sm all governm ents. The rem ainder of this report discusses the resu lts of agency actions in respo nse to th e Act between October 1, 2001 and September 30, 2002. Since not all agencies take m any significant actions that affect other levels of governm ent, this report focuses on the agencies that have regular and substantive interactions on regulatory matters that involve States, localities, and tribes, as well as the priv ate sect or. This report also lists and briefly discusses the regulations meeting the Title II thres hold and the specific req uirements of Sections 20 2 and 205 of the Act. Seven rules have m et this threshold - none were intergovernmental m andates. The appendix to this report discusses agency cons ultation efforts. These include both those efforts required under the Act and the m any actions conducted by agen cies above and beyond these requirem ents, consistent w ith th e spirit of the Act. 198 CHAPTE R I: IMPACTS ON ST ATE, LOCAL, AND T RIBAL GO VERNME NTS Over the pas t seven years, seven ru les have imposed costs of more than $ 100 m illion per year (adjusted for inflation) on St ate, local, and tribal governm ents (and thus have been classified as public sector m andates under the Unfunded Mandates A ct of 1995).100 EPA's Rule on Standards of Perform ance for Municipal Waste Combustors and Emissions Guidelines (1995): This rule set standards of perform ance for new m unicipal waste com bustor (MWC) units and em ission guidelines for existing MWCs under sections 111 and 129 of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7411, 42 U.S.C. 7429]. The standards and guidelines apply to MWC units at plants with com bustion capacities greater than 35 m ega gram s per day (Mg/da y) (approxim ately 40 tons per day) of municipal solid waste (MSW ). The EPA st andards requ ire sources to achieve th e maximum degree of reduction in emissions of air pollutants that the Administrator determ ined is achievable, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such em issions reduction, and any non-air quality health and environm ental im pacts and energy requirem ents. EPA estim ated the annualized costs of the em issions standards and guidelines to be $320 million per year (in con stant 1990 d ollars ) over existing reg ulations. While EPA estim ated th e cost of such standard s for new sour ces to be $4 3 million pe r year, the c ost to exis ting s ources was estim ated to be $277 m illion per year. The annual em issions reductions achieved through this regulatory action include, for exam ple, 21,000 Mg. of sulfur dioxide; 2,800 Mg. of particulate m atter (PM); 19,200 Mg of nitrogen oxides; 54 Mg. of m ercury; and 41 Kg. of dioxins/furans. EPA's Standards of Performance for New Sta tionary Sources and Guidelines for Control of Existing Sources: Municipa l Solid Waste Landfills (1996) : This rule set perform ance standard s for new m unicipal so lid wa ste la ndfills and em ission guidelines f or existing municipal s olid waste landfills under section 111 of the Clean Air Act. The rule addressed non-m ethane organic compounds (NMOC) and m ethane em issions. NMOC include vo latile ic air pollutan ts (HAPs), and odorous co mpounds. Of the landfills required to install con trols, about 30 percen t of the existing lan dfills and 20 percen t of the new land fills a re privately owned. The rem aining landfills are publicly owned. The total annualized costs for co llection and control of air emissions from new and existing MS W landfills are es timated to be $100 million. EPA's National Primary Drinking Water Re gulations: Disinfect ants and Disinfection Byproducts (1998) : This rule prom ulgates health-based m aximum contam inant level 100 We note that EPA's p roposed rules settin g air quality stand ards for ozone and particulate matter may ultimately lead to expenditures by State, local, or tri bal governments of $100 million or more. Howev er, Title II of the Unfunde d Mandates Reform Act provi des that age ncy statements of com pliance with Section 202 must be conducted \" unless ot herwise prohibited by law\". The conference report to this leg islatio n indicates th at this language means that the sectio n \"do es not require the prep aratio n of an y esti mate or analysis if the a gency is prohibited by law from consi dering the estimate or analysis in adopting the rule.\" EPA has stated, an d the courts have affirm ed, that un der the Clean Air Act, the prim ary air qu ality stan dards are h ealth-b ased and EPA is no t to consider costs. EPA issued all five of these rules, which are desc ribed here. 199 goals (MCL Gs) and enforceab le maximum contam inant levels about a d ozen disinfectants and byproduc ts that result from the interact ion of these disinfectants with organic compounds in drinking water. The rule will require ad dition al treatm ent at about 14,000 of the estim ated 75,000 covered water system s nationwide. The costs of the rule are es timated at $700 m illion annually. The quantified benefits estim ates range from zero to 9,300 avoided bladder cancer cases annually, with an estim ated m onetized value of $0 to $4 billion per year. Possible reductions in rectal and colo n cancer and adverse reproductive and developm ental effec ts were not quantified. EPA's National Primary Drinking Water Regulations: Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment (1998): This rule estab lishes new treatm ent and monitoring requirem ents (prim arily related to filtratio n) for drinking water system s that use surface water as their source and serve m ore than 10,000 people. The purpose of the rule is to enhance health protec tion a gainst po tentially harmful m icrobial contam inants. EPA estim ated that the rule will im pose total an nual cos ts of $300 m illion per year. The rule is expected to require treatm ent changes at abou t half of the 1,400 large su rface water sy stem s, at an annual cos t of $190 m illion. Monito ring re quirements add $96 m illion p er year in additional c osts. All sy stems will als o have to pe rform enhanced m onitoring of filter perform ance. The estim ated benefits include average reductions of 110,000 to 338,000 cases of cryptosporidiosis annually, with an estim ated m onetized value of $0.5 to $1.5 billion, and possible reductions in the in cidence of other waterborne diseases. EPA's National Pollutant Discharge Eliminati on: System B Regulations for Revision of the Water P ollution Control Program Addressing Storm Water Discharges (1999): This rule exp ands the existing National Po llutant Discharge Elim ination System program for storm water control. It covers sm aller m unicipal storm sewer system s and construction sites that disturb one to five acres. The rule allo ws for the exclusion of certain sou rces from the program based on a dem onstration of the lack of impact on water quality. EPA estim ates that the total cost of the rule on Federal and Stat e levels of governm ent, and on the private s ector, is $80 3.1 m illion annually. EPA considered alternatives to the rule, including the option of not re gulating, but found that the ru le was the option that was \"most cost effective or least burden some, but also protective of the water quality.\" EPA's National Primary Drinking Water Regulations; Arsenic and Clarifications to Compliance and New Source Contaminants Monitoring (2001): This rule redu ces th e amount of ar senic that is allowed to be in drinking water from 50 ppb to 10 ppb. It also revises non-trans ient, non-comm unity water sys tems to com e into com pliance with th e standard. This rule m ay affect eithe r State, local or tribal governm ents or the private sector at an approxim ate annualized cost of $206 m illion. The m onetized benefits of the ru le rang e from $140 to $198 m illion per year. The E PA selected a standard o f 10 ppb b ecause it determ ined that this was the level that best m aximizes health risk reduction benefits at a cost th at is ju stified by the benef its, as required by the Safe Drinking Water Act. EPA's Efflu ent Limita tion Guidelin es and New Source Performance Sta ndards for the Constructio n and Development Category (2002): This rule proposed three options to 200 address storm water discharges from constr uction sites. Option one proposed technology- based effluent limitation guidelines and standards (ELGs) for storm water discharges from construction sites required to obtain Nation al Pollu tant Discharge E limination System (NPDES) perm its. Option tw o proposed not to establish ELGs for storm water discharges from those sites, but to allow technology-based perm it requirem ents to continue to be established based upon the best professional judgm ent of the perm it authority. Option three would establish insp ection and certification requirem ents that would be incorporated into the storm water perm its issued by EPA a nd States, with other perm it requirem ents based on the best profe ssional judgm ent of the perm it authority. EPA is considering each of the three options, and did not state a pr eferred option in th e proposed rule. Options one and two would im pose a mandate on the States, local, or tribal governm ents, in the agg regate, or private secto r that would exceed $100 m illion per year. Option 3 would not im pose a m andate with cos ts that ex ceed $100 m illion per year for the public or private sectors. Although these seven E PA rules were the only ones over the past se ven years to require expenditu res by State, lo cal, and trib al govern ments exceedin g $100 m illion, they were not the only rules with im pacts on other levels of governm ents. For exam ple, 14 percent, 9 percent, and 6 percent of rules listed in th e April 2001 Unified Regulatory Agenda cited som e impact on State, local or tribal gov ernm ents, respectively. 201 CHAPTE R II: A REVIEW GNIFICANT REGUL ATORY M ANDATE S In FY2002, Federal agencies issued five rule s that were subject to Sections 202 and 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Refor m Act becau se they require expenditu res in any year by State, local or tribal governm ents, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of at least $100 million in any one year (adjusted annually for inflation).101 The Departm ent of Energy issued one f inal rule; the Departm ent of Transportation issued two proposed rules, and the Environm ental Protection A gency issued two proposed rules. There were no rules for w hich agency analyses demonstrated expected expenditure s in any year by State, local or tribal governm ents, in the aggregate, totaling m ore than $100 m illion. All of the rules discussed w ere covered by the Act because of anticipated expend itures by the private secto r. OMB worked with the agencies to ensure th at the selection of the regulatory option f or final rules fully com plied with the req uirem ents of Title II of the Act. For proposed ru les, OMB often worked with the a gency to ens ure tha t they also solicited comment on alternativ es. These were gener ally alternativ es tha t could , in ligh t of further public comm ent a nd additional analysis, be shown to be the least costly, m ost cost-effectiv e, or least burdensom e option at the f inal rule stage. Agen cy statem ents regard ing com pliance with the Act are in clude d with the d escrip tions of the rules below. DOE Energy Efficiency Standards for Centra l Air Conditioners and Heat Pump s (FINAL) This rule f inaliz ed new e nergy conse rvation stan dards f or ce ntral air con dition ers an d central air condition ing heat pum ps to a leve l of 20 percen t, which is th e am ount DOE determ ined was the m aximum amount that was econom ically feasible. Consistent with this proposed determ ination, DOE proposes a Seasona l Energy Efficiency Rating of 12, with a corresponding Heating System Perform ance Factor of 7.4. These standards would apply to manufacturers in 2006. DOE estim ates that the standards would not re sult in the expenditure by the private sector of $100 m illion or m ore in a year, with the ex ception of one year in which industry ex penditu res could to tal approxim ately $110 m illion. DOE be lieves that th is rule would estab lish energy conservation standards for central air conditioners and heat pump s that are designed to achieve the m aximum improvem ent in energy efficiency th at DOE determ ined to be both technologically feasible and econom ically justified. DOT Salvage and Marine Firefigh ting Re quirements ; Vessel Respon se Plans for Oil (NPRM) The Coast Guard proposes to revise the vessel response plan salvage and m arine firefighting requirem ents for tank vessels carrying oil. These revis ions will c larify the salvage and m arine firefighting services that must be identified in vess el response plans. The proposed 101 This listing inclu des only those ru les m eetin g the Section 202 thresho ld published during the time period covered by this report (October 1, 2001 through September 30, 2002). Rules subject to Sect ion 202 that were published after September 30, 2002, or that wer e withdrawn by the agency are not include d in this report. Rules with unfund ed mandates issu ed after Sep tember 30, 200 2 will be addressed in next year's rep ort. 202 changes will assure the appropriate salvage and marine firefighting resources are identified and available for responding to incide nts up to and including the wors t-case scenario. The proposed rulem aking will also set new respons e tim e requi rements for each of the required salvage and marine firefighting services. This rule is expected to cost m ore than $100 million in th e first year the rule is in effect as salvage and firefighting com panies invest in capital equ ipment. It will cos t an es timated $127.9 illion for the in and $30.9 m illion each year for ongoing operations. DOT Federal Motor V ehicle Improve d Tires Safety Standards (NPRM) The Transportation Recall Enhancem ent, Accountability, and Docum entation Act of 2000 m andates a rulem aking to revise and update th e safety perform ance requirem ents for tires. In response, the proposed rule establishes new and m ore stringent tire perfor mance requirem ents in a new Federal m otor vehicle safety standard that would apply to all new tires for use on vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds or less. The proposal is expected to result in the expenditure by auto mobile m anufacturers and/or tire m anufac turers of approxim ately $ 282 m illion in annual co sts, based on an estim ated additional cost of $3.00 per tire. EPA Effluent Limita tion Guidelin es and New Source Performance Standards for the Construction and Development Category (NPRM) This rule proposed three options to addre ss storm water discharges from construction sites. Option one proposed technology-based effluent limitation guidelines and standards (ELGs) for storm water discharges from cons tructi on sites required to obt ain National Pollutant Discharge E limination S ystem (NPDES) perm its. Option two proposed not to establish ELGs for storm water discharges from those sites, but to allow technology-based perm it requirem ents to continue to be established base d upon the best professional judg ment of the perm it authority. Option three would establish inspection and certification requ irements that would be incorpor ated into th e storm water per mits issued by EPA and States, with other perm it requirem ents based on the best prof essiona l judgm ent of the perm it authority. EPA is considering each of the three options, and did not state a pr eferred option in th e proposed rule. Options one and two would im pose a mandate on the States, local, or Tribal governm ents, in the agg regate, or private secto r that would exceed $100 m illion per year. (Option one would cost $ 130 m illion per ye ar and Option two would cost $ 505 m illion annually.) Option three represen ted a nonregulatory approach a nd therefore would not im pose a mandate with costs th at exceed $100 million per year for the public o r private sectors. EPA National Polluta nt Discharg e Elim ination System; Proposed Regulations to Establish Requirements for Large Cooling Water Inta ke St ructures at Existing Pow er Generating Facilities (NPRM) 203 This rule would establish national requirem ents applicable to the location, design, construction, and capacity of coo ling water intake structures at these facilities and would be implemented through National Pollutant Discharg e Elim ination System (NPDES) perm its. The rule provides facilities with several options for meeting the best technology available requirem ents under this proposed rule. EPA estim ated total annualized (post-tax) cost s of com pliance for the proposed rule to be $182 m illion. Of this total, $153 m illion would b e incurred b y the private sector and $ 19.6 million by State and local governm ents that offer in-s cope facilities. EPA selected th e approach taken in this proposed ru le becau se it m eets th e requirem ent of the Clean Water Act that the chosen approach reflect the best technology av ailable for m inimizing adverse environm ental impacts, and it is econo mically le. 204 APPE NDIX: AGENCY CONS ULT ATION ACTIVI TIES UNDER THE UNFUNDED MANDATES REFORM ACT OF 1995 Sections 203 and 204 of the Act require agen cies to seek input from State, local and tribal governm ents on new Federal regulations imposing significant intergovernm ental m andates. This appendix summ arizes consultation activities by agencies whose actions significantly affect State, local, and tribal governm ents. Nine agencies (the Departm ents of Ag riculture, Comm erce, Education, Health and Hum an Services, Housing and Urban Developm ent, Interior, Justice, and Transportation, and the Environm ental Protection Agency) have involved St ate, local, and tribal governm ents not only in their regulatory processes, but also in their program planning a nd im plementation phases. These agencies have worked to enhance the regulator y environm ent by im proving the way in which the Federal governm ent relates to its intergovernm ental partners. In general, the Departm ents not listed here (e.g., State, Defense) do not often impose m andates upon States, localities, or tribes and so have fewer occasions to consu lt with o ther levels of dom estic governm ent. As the following descriptions indicate, Fede ral agencie s are genera lly complying with both the letter and spirit of the Act by conductin g a wide range of consultations. Agency consultation s som etimes involve m ultiple levels o f governm ent, depending on the agen cy's understanding of the scope and im pact of the rule. OMB continue s to work with agencies to ensure that consultation occurs with the appropri ate level of governm ent. Departmen t of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) 1. The Food Stam p Program High Perform ance Bonuses The Farm Bill prov ided $ 48 m illion in bonuses for State agen cies that demonstrate h igh or im proved perform ance in adm inistering the Food Stam p Program (FSP). On September 30, 2002, the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) advise d State agencies regarding the perform ance measures upon which it will bas e the bonuses for fiscal year (FY) 2003. Holding m ultiple m eetings concern ing implem entation of the Farm Bill, F NS consulte d repres entatives of State agencies to get their inp ut on the perfor mance measures for the high ance bonuses. Meeting participants iden tified four perfor mance m that and have available data: paym ent accu racy, negative error rate s, participant access rates, and ap plication tim eliness. FNS subsequen tly adop ted perform ance each of the ca tegor ies iden tified during the Certif ication Provis ions of the Farm Security and Rural Investm ent Act of 2002 205 This proposed rulem aking am ends Food St amp Program regulations to implem ent 11 provisions of the Farm Security and Rural Investm ent Act of 2002 (FSRIA). The FSIRA established new eligibility a nd certification requirem ents for the receipt of food stam ps. Prior to drafting the proposed rule, F NS consulted with State and local ag encies that administer the Food Stamp Program. FNS held th ree conferences with representatives of State and local hu man services agencies s pecifica lly to discuss the pr ovisions of FSIA being implemented through this rule. The questions an d comments m ade by the State and local agency repres entatives at the co nferences give rise to many policy clarificat ions that were included in the rule. 3. Nationwide EBT Implem entati on and Ongoing Operations In 1996, the Personal Responsibility and W ork Opportunity Reconciliation Act m andated statewide Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) sy stem s in all States by October 1, 2002. By the end of FFY 2002, over 89 percent of all households received food stam p benefits electronically in the 48 States that operate an EBT system . 46 of these system s were operating Statewide. The im portance of having State agencies share their experience amongst all States has becom e especially im portan t as States work towards EBT implem entation and reprocurem ent. The f ollowing is a list o f activities F NS partic ipated in to f acilitate the sh aring of best practices, new ideas, issues, and alternatives between EBT stak eholders and the agency. States participated in a workgroup that suggested m odel RFP and cont ract langu age that State agencies can use to facilitate RFP development. An extr anet s ite was developed exclusively for State EBT partners as a way to bette r sha re information between States and FNS. Inform ation on the website includes inform ation on policies and regulations, standard RF P language, State RFPs that have been recently issued, State EBT profiles, and State contact inf ormation. 4. WIC Policy Mem orandum 98-9, Revisi on 6: Nutrition Risk Criteria This policy, issued in February 2002, addresse s the determ ination of nutrition risk as part of the W IC eligibility determ ination process, particularly t hose nutrition risk conditions and/or factors th at are allowable for us e by State and lo cal W IC agencies. Prior to issu ing the polic y memo, FNS consulted with the Risk Identification and Selection Collaborative (RISC), a Federal/State partnership establis hed to achieve con sisten cy in the nutrition risk criteria used to determine W IC Program eligibility. FNS also participated in regular conference calls to discuss the revisions to the W IC nutrition risk. There was State and local agency input at every step in the process of reviewing the scien tific ev idence and recomm ending approval/disapproval of all ne w or revised risk criteria. The revised W IC Nutrition Risk cr iteria in Revision 6 developed as a r esult of this p rocess addressed th e assessm ent of wom WIC Policy Mem orandum 2001-7, Immuniza tion Screening and Referral in W IC 206 This policy, issued in August 2001 and supplem ented in December 2002, is intended to assure that children served by W IC are screened for imm unization status and, if needed, are referred for immunizations. The policy m emo and associated training m aterials were developed by the National W IC- Immunization W orking Group, which included F NS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National W IC Association, the Am erican Academ y of Pediat rics, the Association of Immunization Managers, the Association of Stat e and Territorial Health Officials, and Every Child By Two. Prior to issuing the final policy memo, FNS issued a d raft version of the policy to all W IC State agencies for their review and comment. The final W IC policy m emo on Immunization was issued on August 30, 2002; supplem ental training m aterials, identified as critical during the consu ltation pro cess, were pr ovided to all W IC State agencies in Decem ber 2002. 6. Commodity Supplem ental Food Program (CSFP) FNS was concerned whether it should issu e tentative caseload allocations pending enactm ent of the fiscal year 2003 full a ppropriations. State and Local CSFP Program Administrators and CSFP participants were affect ed by this policy, so FN S consulted with States and locals via conference calls with the boa rd members of the National C SFP Association. State and local CSFP Ad ministrators were conc erned that a further de lay in enactm ent of fiscal year 2003 appropriati ons would jeopardize States = ability to utilize additional caseload slots. As a result of consultations with the National CSFP Association, on January 22, 2003, FNS issued tentative caseload allocations pe nding the enactment of fiscal year 2003 full appropriations 7. Prom oting Summ er Feeding: Nationwide Expansion of the Seam less Summer Feeding Waiver The Seam less Summer Feeding W aiver stream lines program managem ent and operations norm ally ass ociated in feeding low-in come child ren in the summer and during other tim es when school is not in session by allowing school dist ricts to operate under procedures that combine aspects of the Su mmer Food Service Program (SFSP) and the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and the School Break fast Program (SBP). Consultations that resulted in the FY 2002 expansion of the seam less waiver prim arily occurred through norm al channels of communica tions from State education agencies through FNS Regional Offices, including regional m eetings held by F NS with State agencies. In addition, USDA officials, including the Under Secretary for F ood and Consum er Services, discussed the seam less waiver and prom oted its expansion with advocates, State and local food program operators, and school officials at num erous conferences, including two held in Washington, DC in February and March of 2002. Thus, in October 2001, FNS expanded the seam less waiver to any eligible SFA. The e xpansion resulted in ove r 500 SFAs providing m ore than 13 m illion m eals to child ren und er the wa iver in over 3,8 00 sites du ring the summ er of 2002. 207 8. Prom oting Su mmer Feeding: Elim inating the SFSP budget requirem for eligible spo nsors par ticipating in the 14-State Pilot Proje ct Under this policy, the 14 States participat ing in the pilo t project to elim inate cos t accounting have the authority to waive the budget requirem ent for e ligible sponsors. Normally, SFSP regulations require that sponsors m ust sub mit a budget as part of th e application process each year. The purpose of this policy is to prov ide adm inistrative relief to school spo nsors in the pilot States, thereby allowing the schools to operate the SFSP in a m anner sim ilar to their operation of the NSLP during the school year. Several S tate agencies questioned the need for budget subm ission by the sponsors participating in the pilot pr oject based on their interpreta tion of the statutory language authorizing the pilot project. In addition, there was considerable interest in reducing paperwork burdens where possible, especially for schools, as an inducem ent to sponsor the SFSP. As a result of discussions with State ag ency staf f and in view of a positiv e ass essment of operations in FY 2001 by sponsors in pilot S tates, FNS issued policy guidance addre ssing these issues in 2002. 9. Prom oting Summ er Feeding: Perm itting More Flexibility in Meal Serv ice Tim es This policy perm its State agencies to gr ant exceptions to SF SP sponsors to program regulations that stipulate specific time intervals b etween m eals. The purpose of this policy is to remove barriers that some sponsors have expe rienced in providing m eal services to SFSP participan ts. State ag encies are respo nsible fo r approving requests for exemptions to required time interva ls between meals. State ag encies reques ted greater flexibility in the tim ing of meal se rvice and inte rvals between m eals at num erous regional and nationa l meetings. During these occasions, State agencies, sp onsors and advocates en couraged flexibility, expressing concern to FNS that requiring rigid tim e intervals m ay impose barriers to participation f or so me sites ser ving m eals to children. As a result of learning about the problem s this caused som e SFSP sites, FNS issued policy guidance in January 2002 that provides Stat e agencies with the authority to waive the regulations at section 225.16( c) on a case-by-case basis. 10. Prom oting Summ er Feeding: Allowing Alaska to W aive Pre-Approva l Visits for Several School Food Authorities (SFAs) This policy perm its the Alaska State agen cy to exem pt the requirem ent at section 225.7(d)(1) for pre-approval visits to for two SFAs. The Alaska State agency requested this exem ption because of th e prohib itive cost in trav eling to thes e locations. In addition, the State agency poin ted out that both SFAs were succes sful sponsors of the National School Lunch Program (NSLP); no problem s were found during the last C RE reviews of NSLP operations at either school district. 208 As the result of these cons ultations, in May 2002 FNS agreed to allow Alaska to waive pre-approval visits at these two SFAs. Instead of the pre-approva l visits, the State agency was directed (1) to provide tec hnical assistance over the phone, (2 ) to request docum entation of production records, the m eal counting and clai ming syste m, and m enus prior to operation, and (3) to conduct a full review w ithin the first three weeks of the start of program operations. 11. Prom oting su mmer feeding: Allowing Closed Enrolled SFSP Sites To Qualify for Participa tion Based on Area Eligibility Data This policy exem pts closed enrolled sites located in eligible a reas ope rated by the New York City Board of Education from the requ irement to qualif y for SFSP participation based incom e eligib ility of the indiv idual participants at each site. Instea d, these clos ed enrolled sites m ay use area eligibility data for the location of each site to qualify for SFSP participation. The New York City Board of Education re quested this policy as a way of reducing paperwork and encouraging the participation of mo re sites. It comm unicated its requ est to the New York SFSP State ag ency, which consulted with FNS. As a result of th e request su bmitted by the New York State agency, FNS issued a waiv er for the New York City Board of Education in May 2002. 12. Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP): Rule to Strengthen Program Integrity: Simplifying Appeal Rights Proces s for Day Care Hom es This interim rule (67 FR 43448) was pub lished June 27, 2002, incorporated changes mandated by the Agricultural Risk P rotecti on Act of 2000 and the Grain Standards and Warehouse Improvem ent Act of 2000. Several po licies in the interim final rule reflect recomm endations m ade by CACFP State agencies , sponsoring organizati ons, and advocates on a number of occasions at regiona l and national m eetings. In addition, thes e groups and other members of the public encouraged adoption of thes e policies at nine list ening sessions held by USDA around the country in the spring of 2002 on reauthorization issues affecting child nutrition program s. Changes in the law required the provision of appeal rights to seriously deficient hom es prior to their disqualification fr om program participation. FNS simplified the requirem ents for the appeal p rocess for day care hom es as a result of consultations with sponsoring organizations and State agencies. In order to m ake the syst em workable for sponsoring organizations, which must initiate action again st seriously def icient p roviders, the n ew rules gua rantee appeal rights for providers through adm inistrative review (conducted either by the State agency or the sponsor). 13. CACFP: Interim Rule to Strengthen Program Integrity: Give State agencies authority to disregard insignificant errors Under the new serious deficiency process outlin ed in the interim final rule, Sta te age ncies must be able to distinguish between errors in program managem ent by CACFP institutions and problem s that trigger initiation of the serious defi ciency p rocess. The process relies on a State 209 agency =s ability to m ake these d istinc tions. The in terim rule provides gu idance to Sta te agenc ies in making these determ inations about the relati ve seriousness of an adm inistrative problem by listing serious deficiencies for new, re newing, and participating institutions. Consultations included Stat e agencies, sponsoring organiza tions, and program advocates. State agency and sponsoring organizations asked for FNS to clarify the def inition of serious deficiency a nd to iden tify a com plete list of actions that m ust be treated as serious deficiencies. As a result of the feedback from State agencies and sponsors on this issue, the interim rule lists serious d eficiencies f or institu tions at different phases of their partic ipation in the C ACFP. 14. CACFP: Interim Rule to St rengthen Program Integrity: Develop an On-line Database List of Disqualified Instituti ons and Daycare Hom e Providers To facilitate the national f eature of the new in tegrity prov ision s, the list of disqualif ied institutions and hom es will be av ailable onlin e so that all State agencies and sponsoring organizations can have access to the list. An online system perm its frequent updates. Consultations included Stat e agencies, sponsoring organiza tions, and program advocates. State agency and sponsoring organization adm inistrators encouraged FNS to develop an online system to make the na tional list of disqualif ied in stitutions and hom e providers instantly access ible to them . As a result of the feedback fr om State agencies and sp onsors on th is issu e, an online da tabase of disqu alified institutions and providers is in development by FNS. 15. Fruit and Vegetable Pilot Program The Farm Security and Rural Investm ent Ac t of 2002 am ended section 18 of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to require th at fresh and dried fruits and fresh vegetables be m ade available to 25 elem entary or seconda ry schools in four States and elem entary or secondary schools on one Indian reservation (cal led the Fruit and Vegeta ble Pilot Program ). FNS consulted the affected State agencies, th e National Cancer Institute, Produce for Better Health Foundation, and the Am erican School Food Service Association. During the consultation process, the need for flexible guidance was di scussed, along w ith the need for rapid response to issues due to short tim e fram e of project. As a result of the consultation, criteria were developed for schools = participation, m ethods of reaching potential par ticipants were developed, along with criteria ho w to expend funds. In addition, our guidance w as modified to allow add itional funds to be used towards administrative costs that allowed schools additional flexib ility in m eeting the pilot project goals. Animal and Plant Hea lth Inspectio n Service (A PHIS) 1. APHIS = Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) Program This program carries out num erous activities to detect and contain, and in som e cases, to manage or eradicate plant pests damaging to ag ricultural and environm ental resou rces of the United States. These program s are conducted co operatively with State agencies, which share 210 the cos ts with APHIS. In cases where APHIS re gulations affect Nativ e Am erican trib es, those tribes are included in co nsulta tions. Concerns arise over the e ffects of APHIS regulations and policy on States, who are often largely respons ible for enforcing th e regulations under cooperative agreem ents. Points of concern m ay include availability of resources, practical obstacles to program success, coordinated natio nal approach, and balanc ing the in terests of stakeholders affected by quarantine actions with those who could be adversely affected by spread of the pest of concern. APHIS reports th e following result s of our extensive consultations: Phytophthora ramorum and Emerald Ash Borer : Through consultations with the States of California and Oregon (P. ram orum ) and Ohio and Michigan (Em erald Ash Borer), w e were able to devise regulatory strategies that protects again st the inte rstate spr ead of these pes ts while being practical to enforce gi ven the affected industries. Through consultations with States that produce citrus, we were able to devise protocols to facilitate the m ovement of Mexican fruit fly host crops while protecting agai nst the spread of the pest to un affected areas. Through consultations with States, we were able to devise a national certification program that f acilita tes the continu ed inte rstate move ment of seed potatoes while protecting against the spread of Mop Top Virus. 2. National Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) Program The program =s goal is LPAI subt and H7 in the United States. State veterin ary officials and th e State comm issioners of agricultu re were consulted individually and as part of the U.S. Anim al Health Organization =s Transm issible Diseases of Poultry Comm ittee (referred to below as the Comm ittee), which includes USDA, State, industry, and academ ic representative s. The Comm ittee develope d and presented to APHIS a m odel plan that includes recomm endations regard ing live b ird markets, commercial su rveillance, and v accine use. APHIS is currently in consultation with the Comm ittee regarding its recomm ended m odel program . Additionally, in 2002, there were outbreaks of LPAI in several States, m ost extensively and severely in Virginia. State repres entatives in the affected St ates raised the issu es of the limits and scope of indemnity payments for poultry and m aterials destroy ed because o f LPAI, trade ram ification s of the outbre aks, and the sev ere Sta te liability in the ev ent of the Virginia outbreak (i.e, the State confiscated and destroyed poultry and materials but lack ed sufficient funds to compensate for the destroyed poultry and m aterials). APHIS compensated owners and growers of poultry for losses suffered due to an LPAI outbreak in Virginia. In 2002, APHIS worked closely with State officials in Virginia and surrounding States to control and elim inate the LPAI outbreak. To assist the State in co mpensating for poultry and m aterials destroyed, APHIS secured over $52 million f rom the Commod ity Cred it Corpor ation to pay o wners and growers of poultry for losses suffered due to the outbreak. 211 3. Prevention of the Spread of Brucellosis fr om Bison in Yellows tone Nation al Park to Dom estic Livestock APHIS wor ked closely with affected partie s, including producers of dom estic livestock, State governm ents, and Federal agencies. Each of these entities is represented on the Greater Yellowstone Inter agency Brucello sis Comm ittee. Governm ental representatives to include the States of W yoming, Montan a, and Idaho, as well as APHIS, the Forest Service, the National Pa rks Service, a nd the Departm ent of the Interior. The comm ittee m ade recomm endations for research and ranked the recomm ended research in priority order. APHIS is providing funds for the research in the order recomm ended by the Comm ittee. 4. Program to Eradicate B ovine Tuberculosis Livestock owners, dairy owners , and States are affected by this program . Consultations were conducted with State Departm ents of Agricu lture and the U.S. Ani mal Health Association =s Governm ent Relations Group, which includes re presentatives of State Departm ents of Agriculture. State rovide inform ation to APHIS to allo w USDA to accurately class ify each State with regard to tuberculosis risk. A State =s class ificatio n determ ines what conditions must be m et before cattle, bison, and captive cervids m ay be moved interstate from that State. In 2002, based on inform ation supplied by California, Texas, and Michigan, APHIS initiated rulem aking to downgrade the tuberculosis status of California and Texas and to upgrade that of Michigan. Based on consultation w ith States and on comments received during a rulem aking process, AP HIS initiated rulem aking to modify certain provisions of the dom estic tubercu losis regulations. Also, in res ponse to comments join tly subm itted by State V eterinarians in Arizona, California, New Mexi co, Oklahoma, and Texas, APHIS is modifying an interim rule that revis ed testing requ irements for cattle im ported into the United St ates. The m odification will streng then requirements reg arding certification of herd testing. 5. Program s to Prevent Dis eases and Predati on of L ivestock on Native Am erican T ribal Lands APHIS consults regularly with Native Am erican trib es and pa rticipa tes in nationa l meetings of the Intertribal Ag riculture Council, Native Am erican Fish and W ildlife Society, and the National Congress of Am erican Indians (NCAI). The issues raised by tribal governm ents in 2002 included protection of livestock from predat ors, identification and eradication of foreign anim al diseases that m ight be introduced into the United States, and em ploym ent in careers in agricu lture. Actions taken by APHIS in 2002 include the fo llowing: Presentation of infor mation to tribal pred availab le from APHIS =s Wildlife Serv ices program ; work with th e Montana /Wyoming Indian Livestock Growers to develop cooperative agreem ents, funding agreem ents, and work 212 plans to protect livestock on reservations from foreign anim al diseases; coordination of tribal efforts to initiate rab ies vaccine p rogram s; iden tification of tribes in Alask a involved in sheep production in preparation for potential funding of scrapie testing; and pa rticipation in outreach program s and job fairs sponsored by Native Am erican schools and professional organizations. Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) 1. Recordkeeping Requirem ents for Certified Applicators of F ides These requirem ents are comm known as the Federal Pesticide Recordk eeping Program , which was m andated in th e 1990 Farm Bill. The regulations require certified private pesticide ap plica tors to m aintain rec ords of their federally re stricted u se pesticide ap plica tions f or a period of two years. The Agency has consulted with the State agencies that have au thority to regula te pes ticide s in th eir respe ctive States. The consultations in clude State agencies that have State statutes com parable to the Federal regul ations and are recognized by the Agency. The Agency also works closely with the State Cooperative Extension Services that deliver educational program s to the certif ied private applicators. State cooperators have requested m ore flexibility in how the ran dom select ion of applicators to be inspected is m ade each year to better utilize their lim ited staf f resourc es. As a result o f the reques t for addition al recordkeeping tools the Agency produced and distributed 20,000 Federal recor dkeeping books, which are provided free to certified private applicators. The Agency worked with its S tate Cooperators to identify how selections of private certified applicators could be conducted on a ra ndom basis and m inimize the am ount of travel and tim e being used by State personnel. States we re allowed to custom ize the selections to best suit th e need s of each State. National Rural Develop ment Partnership (NRDP) 1. California R ural Develo pment Council (CRDC) ted the Tribe in Northe rn California with de veloping a m eans of facilitating Native Am erican tribes' access to governm ent grants and funding opportunities. Tribal communities face significa nt shortages of non-govern ment, community org anization s that can assist in providing ec onom ic vitality and indepe ndence to rural areas. By providing the Tribes with inform ation about funding opportunities, the Council encouraged the deve lopment of nonprof it organ izatio ns with in tribal communities. As a result of inform ation gained through CRDC' s network, th e Hoopa Tribe has created an independent, nonprofit organization, and is now able to appl y for funding while stil l maintaining their sovereignty. The organization, established under the new Hoopa nonprofit code, is the Tribe' s first step to ward gainin g access to comm unity-revitalizing g overnm ent grants. 2. Kansas Rural Development Council (KRDC) 213 KRDC recently develop ed a Community Resource Team to assist Leo ti, Kansas, the S tate's only Enterprise (EZ/EC) Commun ity. Leoti had already m ade considerable progress towards completing an excellent strategic plan, but f ound itself bogged down with the prioritization and implementation of developm ent projects. KR DC adapted and developed the Comm unity Resource Team progra m to m eet the particul ar needs of this E Z/EC community. KRDC comm issioned the team , met with the community to exam ine the obstacles to succes s, and developed a final report. KRDC and the Comm unity Resource Team provided the com munity with a detailed m ethodology on how to work with and develop volunteers without overburdening them . KRDC also extended the training and reso urces to the local school and hospital boards. As a result o f the KRDC's ef forts to collabo rate with loca l communities, Leoti is no w able to more fully m aximize the contributions of its local volunteers. Departmen t of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospher ic Administra tion (NOAA) 1. Coastal Im NOAA consulted extensively with representa State and Local governm ents in the developm ent of guidelines related to the Coastal Im pact Assistance Program . The 2001 amendm ents to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act created the CIAP, which recognizes that impacts f rom Outer Continen tal Sh elf oil and g as activities f all disp roportion ately on the coas tal States and lo calities nearest to where the activities occur, and wh ere the as sociated facilities are located. Accordingly, the CIAP legislation approp riated m oney to the Secretary of Comm erce to disburse it to eligible States and coastal political subdivisions. In order to guide eligible States and local governm ents on how to participate in th e CIAP, NO AA developed guidance providing necessary infor mation. Pursuant to the legislation, seven States are eligible to par ticipate in the CIAP: Alabam a, Alaska, California, Florida, Lou isiana, and Mississipp i. Counties, parishes or equivalent units of governm ent with in those States lying all or in part within the coastal zone (as defined by the Coastal Z one Managem ent Act) are also eligible for CIAP funding. In developing the CIAP Guidelines, NOAA frequently and consisten tly enlisted the advice of the eligible States and local jurisdictions. The guide lines were circulated in draft for m with the express purpose of providing affected parties with an opportunity to suggest changes and im provem ents. The States and local governm ents who elected to par ticipate in the cons ultation process raised num erous issues about the guidelines. For example, it was disputed whether the grants would be distributed d irectly to the local governm ents, or if they would ha ve to use the appropriate State agency as a conduit. Addition ally, th e issue of whether the grant m oney could be placed in interest-bearing trus t funds was raised. As a result of the collaborative process am ong Federal officials, the affected States, and eligible local governm ents, the Departm ent of Commerce was able to publish a Notice of Availability of Final Guidance fo r the Coastal Impact Assistance Program . As a result of input from interested State and local governm ents, severa l key issues were clarified. For exam ple, as a direct result of discussions with affected parties, it was decided th at grants could go directly to State o r local governm ents, rather than using a State agen cy as a conduit. Additionally , in the 214 spirit of comprom ise, it was determ ined that gr ant m onies could be placed in a trust f und, but that the State and/or local governm ents would not be able to retain the interest. Subsequent to the publication of the guidelines, consultation be tween NOAA and its intergovernm ental partners continued. The States and local co mmunities s ought to am end or rev ise their plan s for spendin g their grant money, and continue to work closely with NOAA to find appropriate m ethods of doing so without com prom ising the le tter or the spirit of the CIAP. Department of Education Federal Stu dent Aid Programs 1. Federal Perkins Loan Program Under this program , institutions of higher e ducation provide their st udents with loans to pay the costs of attendance. The loans are m ade from a fund m aintained by the institution that includes both federally provided funds and inst itutional funds. Once the borrower enters repaym ent, the institu tion is requ ired to take step s to collect on the loan. Many of the institutions participa ting in this P rogram are State institu tions. Many of these institutions asked for m ore discre tion in determ ining how to m aintain docum ents re lating to the loans and on when to stop colle cting o n low balanc e loans. The Departm ent met with re presentative s of State in stitutions of higher education and conducted a for mal ne gotiated rulemaking proc ess that included representatives of th ese institutions. The State in stitutions of higher edu cation a sked the Departm ent to incre ase the level at which an ins titution cou ld write off a loan from the current level of $5 to $25 or m ore. The Departm ent agreed to raise the lim it to $25. Thes e sam e institutions also asked the Departm ent to give them m ore discretion for deciding when to file suit against a bo rrower and how often to review ca ses for purpose s of litigation. The draf t and f inal re gulations we re modified to give the schools m ore discretion in this area. The institutions also asked for certain reductions in requirem ents relating to prom issory notes and other records used in the Perkins Loan Program . The Departm ent largely agreed to make thes e changes. 2. Higher Education Act Under this program , a student loan borrower who has defaulted on a student loan m ay regain elig ibility f or more studen t aid by m aking 12 consecutive reasonable and affordable monthly paym ents. This is referred to as \"r ehabilitation.\" In the pa st, the Departm ent of Education's regulations have allo wed borrowers who are subject to a judgm ent for the defaulted loan to hav e the opportu nity for \"reh abilitation.\" A num ber of institu tions of higher ed ucation that m ake loans under the Federal Perkins Loan Program argued that offering these borrowers rehabilitatio n was not in the bes t interests of the program because of the s ignifican t costs of litigating th ese cases in the first p lace and becaus e these bo rrowers rem ain likely to n ot pay their loans even after rehabilitation. Also, representatives of som e State institutions of higher education and State guaranty agencies wanted to maintain som e discretio n to of fer borrowers against whom they have judgm ents m any of the bene fits of rehabilitation even if these borrowers would not be entitled to rehabili tation. Representative s of institu tions of higher education that 215 make loans under the Federal Perkins Loan Program , including State instituti ons, participated in the Department's negotiated rulem aking process. Additionally, State Attorneys General offices that represent State institutions of higher education provided comments on the proposals through the rep resentatives of the institu tions. Based on consulta tions with State in stitutions of higher edu cation and S tate gua ranty agencies, the regulations were m odified to provi de that borrowers who ar e subject to a judgm ent for defaulted loans are no longer entitled to rehabilitati on. The regulations were also am ended to specifically provide that institut ions and guaranty agencies have the au thority to of fer borrowers against whom they have judgm ents m any of the benefits of rehabilitation. 3. Federal Fam ily Education Loan Program Guaranty ag encies in the Federal Fam ily Education Loan Program , whic h are either State agencies or non-profit agenci es, are required to take appropr iate action to try to recover student loan s that are du e if the borrower files for bankruptcy. To get a loan discharged in bankruptcy, the borrower m ust file an adversary ac tion again st the ho lder of the loan. However, many courts have held that a Stat e guaranty agency m ay assert its right to sovereign immunity to avoid such adversary actions. The Departm ent of Education's regulations needed to be revised to avoid restrictions on the State agency's auth ority to asse rt soverei gn immunity. State guaranty agencies were the p arty most affected by the regulations and Education addressed the issue through a negotiated rulem aking process that in cluded representatives from organizations repres enting guaranty ag encies. State agencies asked the Departm ent to modify the regulations to ensure that actions by lenders would not preclude the assertion of sovereign imm unity. Based on these consultation activ ities, the regu lations were modified to authorize State guaranty ag encies that h old loans affected by ban kruptcy filings to instruct lenders not to file a proof of claim in the ban kruptcy. This will p rotect the S tate guaranty ag ency's ab ility to asse rt sovereign immunity. 4. Higher Education Act Under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), institutions that participate in the Federal student financial aid program s are requi red to return unearned funds on behalf of students that withdr aw within 30 days after the in stitution knows the student left. Many of the institutions participa ting in the HE A Program are State institu tions. Many of these institutions asked for more lenient tim eframes for returning f unds due to the com plexities and delays present in the State governm ent paym ent system s. The Departm ent met with representatives of State instit utions of higher education a nd conducted a for mal negotiated rulem aking process that included representatives of these institutions. The State institu tions of higher education asked the Depart ment to incre ase the tim eframes for returning unearned student funds from the current 3 0 day period , particularly for funds that were retu rned by m ailing checks rather than using an electronic funds transfer. Some State representative s suggested that, as an alternative standard, the Departm ent consider using the date when the paym ent request was initiated by the institution, rather than the date when the funds were actually returned. 216 As a result of the consultation process, th e Departm ent kept the 30-day requirem ent for returning unearned student funds, but added a new provision that allows a tim ely issued check to clear within 45 days af ter the in stitution knew the student left. An appeal process was also added that pe rmits an institu tion to dem onstra te tha t a failure to m ake the r equired tim ely paym ents was due to System s This regu lation perm its a State con siderable f lexibility in de signing its S tate assessm ent system required by Title I of the Elem entary and Secondary Education A ct, as am ended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. For exam ple, a State m ay include in its assessm ent system either or both criterion-referenced assessm ents and assessm ents that yield national norm s. The State m ay also use a co mbination o f State and local assessm ents, provided its system has a rational and coherent design. Prior to negotiated rulem aking, the Departm ent solicited advice and recommendations from the public, including re presentatives of State and local educational agencies, parents, teach ers, parap rofessionals, members of local boards of education, and other organization s involved w ith th e implem entation a nd operation of Title I p rogram s. To obtain additional advice and recommendati ons, the Departm ent invited a broad spectrum of individuals and organizations, including re presentatives of State and lo cal educational agencies, to participate in one of 7 focus groups held in Tampa, FL; New Orleans, LA; W ashington, DC; and Denver, CO. conducted ne gotiated rulem aking, whi ch consisted of five sessions over a two-week period. Of the team of 22 m embers, 11 were representatives of State or local edu cation al agencies. State edu cational ag encies, in particular, were very concerned that the regulations afford them maximum flexibility to design their State as sessm ent system s to best m eet their individual needs. Some States, for exam ple, already have assessm ents in place in grades 3-8 as required by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 and wanted to be able to continue to use those assessm ents. Other States argued for flexibility to com bine criterion-referenced asses sments in some grades with norm -referenced assessm ents in other grades. Still other States lobbied for flexibility to com bine State- level assessments in some grades with locally developed assessm ents in other grad es. The final regu lations accomm odate each of th ese appro aches, but with sufficient caveats to e nsure tha t the resulting d esign is rational and coherent a nd produces valid and reliable results that can be used to hold schools and districts accountable for student achievem ent. 6. Funding for Choice-related Transportation and Supplem ental Educational Services This regulation im plements am biguous and conflicting statutory provisions concerning a local educational agency's re sponsibility to m ake funds ava ilable to provide choice-related transportation and supplem ental educational servi ces. The Departm ent consulted with State and other en tities. Many loc al educa tional agenc ies wo rried th at the statute c ould be interpreted to place an un limited obligation on th em to provid e choice-related transpo rtation to any s tudent attending a school in need of i mprovem ent who wish ed to transfer schools. Large city districts, in particular, expressed serious concerns that an unlim ited obligation went well beyond their responsibilities under the Federal T itle I program and could po tentially bankrupt them . 217 Based on State and other input from a num ber of early consultation opportunities, the Departm ent produced both proposed and final regula tions that m ake clear that a local educational agency's responsibility to provide choice-rela ted transportation and supplem ental educational services as required under Title I is lim ited to an amount equal to 20 percen t of the agency's Title I allocation. 7. Disaggregation of Data Under NCLB, a State must use data disaggr egated by race/ethnici ty, poverty, English language proficiency, and disabili ty to hold schools and school districts accountable for the perform ance of students in those subgroups. Prior to negotiated rulem aking, the Departm ent solicited advice and recommendations from the pub lic, including represen tatives of State and local educational agencies, parents, teachers, paraprofessionals, m embers of local boards of education, and other org anizations in volved with the im plem entation and operation of Title I program s. Som e comm enters urged the Departm ent to establish a m inimum num ber in the regulations that would apply to all S tates. State educational agencies, ho wever, expressed the desire for m aximum flexibility on this issue in or der to select a m inimum number that was m ost appropriate for their circum stances. Based on th e results of the consultation, the regulations p ermit each State to set its ow n number, based on circu mstances specific to that State. A State m ay determ ine the m inimum number of students who constitu te a sufficient nu mber to m ake the results reliable for accountability and reporting purposes. This m inimum number m ay vary among States as well as among purposes within a State. For exam ple, a State m ay set a different num ber for reporting purposes than for determ ining adequate yearly pr ogress. Similarly, it m ay be appropriate for a sparsely populated S tate to set a sm aller m inimum num ber than a densely populated S tate that generally has larger schools. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare a nd Medicaid Services 1. Independence Plus Independence Plus is an initiative de signed to promote fa mily or individual independence and choices regarding the selecti on of long-term care supports and services provided in the hom e. The intent of the Independen ce Plus initia tive is to expedite the ability of States to offer fam ilies with a m ember who requires long-term supports and services , or individuals who require long-term supports and services, greater opportunities to take care of their own health and d irect the ir own servic es. Families and individua ls exercis e greater choice, control and responsibility for their services within cost neutral standards. In developing the proposal and draft tem plates, CMS consulted with States, advocates, part icipants and national organizations representing the needs of participants . States are required to consult with the Tribes as part of the public notice process used in developm ent of 1115 dem onstrations. 218 As a part of the Independence Plus initiativ e, CMS is requiring that States establish specific criteria in order to protect the health and welfar e of program participants. These criteria include em ergency backup system s, crim inal background checks and incident m anagem ent system s. States have raised concerns regarding CMS' autho rity to im pose these criter ia. As a result of the consultation process, C MS is worki ng to rev ise the draf t waiver tem plate s and is also developing additional guidance to States regarding com pleting the templates and program developm ent/im plem entation in the f orm of template and reso urce m aterials. 2. Health Insu rance Flex ibility a nd Accountability (HIFA) Initiative In August 2001 the President announced a ne w section 1115 approach called the Health Insurance Flexibility and Account ability (HIFA) initiativ e, whic h makes it easier for States to expand coverage to the uninsured. The HIFA in itiative enables States to u se Medicaid and unspent State Children's Health Insurance Prog ram (SCHIP) funds in concert with private insurance options to expand cove rage to low-incom e uninsured individuals. The goal of the HIFA initia tive is to cr eate a Fede ral framewor k that encou rages State inn ovation to improve health insurance options. CMS works prim arily with State a gencies on the HIFA initiative, although C MS requires States to co nsult with the public (including Tribes) in the developm ent of HIFA proposals. There are currently 8 approved HIFA initia tives. Through consultation and technical assistance provided throughout the ap proval process, States have been able to adm inister their Medicaid/S CHIP program s in m ore flexible ways to better m eet the needs of their citizen s. Through consultation and technical assistance, CMS has worked to expedite the review process and reach closure in a tim ely way about HIFA concepts and p roposals. 3. Pharm acy Plus As part of the 2003 Budget, the Adm inistrati on introduced the Pharm acy Plus initiative, through which States can extend Medicaid drug-only coverage to certain low-incom e elderly and disabled individuals. The initia tive includes a te mplate to f acilita te Sta te applic ation s. The template outlines the m ajor param eters of Pharm acy Plus, including use of private-sector benefit manage ment techniques and eligibility for people below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. Like all Section 1115 waivers, Pharmacy Plus de monstrations m ust be budget neutral to the Federal governm ent. CMS works prim arily with States on Pharm acy Plus, but CMS requires States to con sult with the public (inc luding Tribes) in the developm ent of Pharm acy Plus proposals. 4. Program for All-Inclusive Ca re for th e Elderly (P ACE) PACE is a prepaid, capitated plan that provi des com prehensive health care services to frail, old er adults in the co mmunity, who are elig ible for nurs ing hom e care acco rding to State standards. In order for a dem onstration program to be transitioned to a perm anent provider, the State m ust com plete a State Plan Amendm ent to elect PACE as a State Plan option. The State, CMS and the provider enter into a three-party agreem ent to authorize the organization as a perm anent provider. 219 CMS worked closely with States to approve the S tate P lan amendm ents and process applic ation onstra tions to perm anent providers by the required statutory timeframe. As a result of these consultation effo rts, thirteen dem onstration program s have been approved as perm anent providers in F Y 2002. There were eight State Plan Am endm ents approved which enabled the States to en ter into the program agreem ents. 5. Trade Act-consu ltation with States The Trade Adjustm ent Assistance Refor m Act of 2002 appropriated $20 million for seed grants to Sta tes to crea te qualif ied h igh risk health insuranc e pools and $80 million f or operation grants to States with existing qua lified high risk pool to fund losse s incurred in the operation of the pools. State high-risk health insurance pools are, in m ost cases, operated under the jurisd iction of the State Departm ent of Insurance. Accordingly, the State Departm ents of Insurance ap ply for the g rants. Consultations have occurred with officials f rom State Departm ents of Insurance, with officials from the National Association of State Com prehensive Health Insurance Plans (NASCH IP), with high-risk pool admi nistrators, S tate legislative officials, staff from State c ongressional delegations and w ith several non-profit agencies interested in health insurance issues. States expressed concer n about the tim ing and eligibility requirem ents of the grants. Through the consultation process, C MS was educated by States about the operation of their high-risk pools and was able to announce the gr ant application procedures for the seed grant program on Nove mber 26, 2002. The procedures for the operation of the larger high-risk grant program were published in the Federal Register on April 25, 2003. 6. HHS Internal Tribal Communication and Coordination Project This project was designed to enhance the e ducation of HHS staff to better em ploy tribal consultation activ ities with Am erican Indian, Al aska Native and Indian organizations com pliant with Executive Order 13175 and HHS Tribal Consultation P olicy. 300 HHS regional staff participated and benefited from 10 regional sessions conducted by the Office of Intergovernm ental Affairs to assist them in unde rstanding the basis for consultation requirem ents with tribal intergovernmental partners. The underlying assumption being that im proved communication and coordination would lead to better consultation processes, and access to program s and im proved services. The educati on intervention aim ed at bringing HHS staff together as \"One HHS,\" im prove the understandi ng of the basis of HHS policy regarding tribes, identify the priorities and needs of tribes, and the ability of HHS to address those needs. The team collected specific recomm endat ions to improve the HHS consultation, communication and coordination process for it Native American groups and individuals. All five recommendations stemm ing from the consultation are being im plem ented. Regional Directors and IHS Area Directors are co ordinating information to/f rom tribal organizations. On April 3, 2003, HHS Regional Directors and IH S Area Directors conducted the first-ever joint m eeting to collaborate on issues and prepare for the first of annual regional tribal consultation sessions beginning in June 2003. Public Affairs st aff are collaborating on HHS 220 public rela tions activitie s to im prove communication and coordinati on with tribal organizations. The Office of Intergovernm ental Af fairs is enhancing its W EB page to include m ore infor mation regarding HHS consultation activ ities and links to im prove comm unication and coordination throughout the Departm ent. All 10 re gions have for med regional based \"Tribal Issues Workgroups\" which m eet regularly to discuss tribal issues an d areas of common interest and concern. 7. Reactivation - Intradepartm ental Counc il on Native Am (ICNAA) HHS revitalized the Intradepartm ental C ouncil for Native Am erican Affairs (ICNAA). The Council was authorized under the Native American Program s Act of 1974, as amended. However it rem ained m ostly dorm ant for well over a decad e. This Council serves as an advisory body to the Secretary and has the responsibility to assure Native Am erican policy guidance and budget formulation is implem ented across all Divi sions. The Council intergovernm ental partners include American Indians, Alaska Natives, Na tive Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders (including S amoans). A profound im pact of this Council is the revi sed prem ise within HHS that all Agencies bear responsibility for the governm ent's responsibili ty and obligation to the Native people of this country. The \"One HHS\" Initiative has been of be nefit to HHS as well as the Am erican Indian, Alaska Native and Native Am erican constitu ents of the Departm ent in addressing HHS consultation requirem ents. One action item of th e Council is the for mation of a workgroup that is assigned to ent's cu ake recomm endations to im prove and enhance the Depart ment's consultation process consistent with E.O. 13175 and in conjunction with an external consultation process underway to solicit tribal input on the policy as well. 8. Title VI T ribal Self -Governance Fe asibility Stu dy The Indian Self-Determ ination and Education Assistance Ac t requ ired a determ inatio n of whether th e Tribal Self-Governance Program adm inistered b y the Ind ian Health Serv ice could be expanded to other program s with in the Departm ent. A tribal advisory group and HHS staff carried out consultations jointl y during the entire two-year st udy period. Stakeholders were consulted on key study issues such as wh at HHS program s should be included in a demonstration, the im pact of a dem onstra tion on beneficiaries, and the design of a demonstration. The process was used to try to re ach a consensus, to the extent possible, on the recomm endations contained in the final report . Tribal, S tate, lo cal and nongovernm ental partners raised issues such as: contract support costs, program s consolidation, appeals, types of program s for inclusion, program implem entation and other programm atic needs, number of demonstration projec t participan ts, eligibility an d selection process and evaluation requirem ents. Based on th e inform ation gained th rough thes e consultations, the Departm ent subm itted a report to the Congress and determ ined that a demonstration proj ect was feasible for 11 of its program s and identified potenti al costs and other requirem ents for im plementation of a demonstration project. 221 9. Electronic L aboratory E xchange Network (eLEXNET) eLEXNET is an intergo vernm ental projec t that draws on the expertise of Federal, S tate and local officials to ensure safe food for consum ers and i mprove the response when food emergencies or outbreaks of food borne illness occu r. This pilot project is an Internet-based system that shares inform ation on E. coli 0157:H 7 among participating labor atories. This pilot project, funded by FDA and FSIS, started with 8 pa rticipating labs. eLEXNET serves as the first integrated food safety system for laboratory food samples and test resu lt data. Curr ently, th ere are 53 labs in 37 States involve d in the eLEXNET project. A c onsensus w as reached that there was a need to integ rate food safety activ ities at all levels of governm ent. A vision of a successful food safety system was form ed, obstacles to developing that system were identified, and proposed action item s were assigned. As part of the eLEXNET project, in additi on to th e extraordin ary ability to exchange laboratory data am ong Federal, State, and local food safety agencies, a comm on form at for data sharing ha s been develo ped. This includes s tandardiz ation of how results will b e reported, use of food product identification codes, and use of comm on m ethodology. This provides invaluable inform ation in the coordination of m ulti-State outbreaks of foodborne illness. 10. Mammography Quality Standards A ct The Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQ SA) required Federal ce rtification of US mammography facilities. Under MQSA, FDA fa ced the task of inspectin g and accred iting approxim ately 10,000 mammography providers throughout the country. Therefore, F DA contracted with the States. The MQSA inspection program is part of one of FDA's m ajor State collaborations. Under these contracts, FDA trai ns, audits, and provides technical ex pertise to State inspectors. These State inspectors are certif ied by FDA to perform a regulatory f unction. This collabo ration works well becau se FDA often has the greater con centration of technical expertise and scientific resources, but States are closer to the source of any problem and can respond to public health em ergencies qui ckly. The results of the MQSA FDA-State collaboration have shown that there is a 34 percent im provem ent in i mage quality of mammogra ms, and a 20 percent decr ease in the am ount of ra diation required to provide a quality image. This is consistent with the program 's goal of reducing unnecessary public radiation exposure. Department of Housing and Urba n Development 1. Working with Public Housing Agencies (PHAs ) and Residents on Revisions to the Public Housing Assessm ent System (PHAS) On February 6, 2003 (68 FR 6272), HUD published a proposed rule for public comm ent proposing to m ake several signif icant changes to the PHAS. Through the PHAS, HUD m easures the perform ance of PHAs on four aspects of their operations : physical co ndition, financial condition, managem ent operations, and resident se rvice and satisfaction. The goals of the PHAS are to im prove the delivery of services in public housing and enhance trust in the public 222 housing system among PHAs, public housing residents, HUD, and the general public. The February 6, 2003 proposed rule was the direct result of HUD' s efforts during Fiscal Year 2002 to consult with PHAs, residents of public housing, a nd other stakeholders in the PHAS process. Consultations were held with public housing residents and wi th the four m ain national organizations representing PHAs: the Public Housing Authorities Directors Associatio n (PHADA); the Council of Large Public Housing Au thorities (CLPHA); th e National Association of Housing and Redevelop ment Officials (NAHR O); and the National Or ganization of African Americans in Housing (NOAAH). Several issues, questions, and concerns were raised during H UD's consultation process. These questions and issues covered a variety of topics re lating to the a ssessm ent and scoring of PHAs. Othe r topics raised by the public housi ng stakeholders were questions regarding the impact of resident-caused dam ages, and the de tails of the PHAS physi cal condition indicator. The proposed rule includes changes to specific P HAS com ponents in respons e to concerns raised during the consultation process. For exam ple, three com ponents of the Managem ent Assessm ent Sub-System have been removed as a result of the concerns ex pressed by stakeholders. 2. Working with Stakeholders to Stream line and Improve the Consolidated Plan Process During Fiscal Year 2002, HUD, in response to the President's Managem ent Agenda, began with its partners a consider ation of ways to stream line the C onsolidated Planning process. Communitie s develop f ive-yea r Consolida ted Plans to guid e their use of Community Developm ent Block Grant (CDBG), HOME, Emerge ncy Shelter, and Housing Opportunities for People W ith AIDs (HOPWA) grants. The Consolid ated Plan is a strate gic plan describing how grantees plan to use com munity developm ent funds to m eet their priorities. The President's Managem ent Agenda directed HUD to work with local stakeholders to stream line the Consolidated Plan, m aking it m ore results-oriented and useful to comm unities in assessing their own progress toward addressing the problem s of lo w-incom e areas. As pa rt of its consultation process, HUD worked with States, counties and cities. Issues a ddressed included: reduction in compliance burden, better use of technology, stream lined planning, pilots of alternative planning procedures and legislative and/or reg ulato ry chan ges to im plem ent ref ormed, results-o riented planning and reporting system s nationally. A report outlining the ef forts of the work ing groups and steering comm ittee is being prepared. Pilots are being designed to test som e of the recomm endations offered during consultations. In addition, HUD has posted b ackground inform ation, m eeting summ aries, and reports reg arding this initiative on its website and is soliciting public com ment on the efforts to stream line the Consolid ated Plan. Departmen t of the In terior Minerals Management Service Interior's Minerals Revenue Managem ent program (MRM) collects, verifies, and distributes m ineral revenues from Federal and Indi an lands. The program conducted a variety of consultation initiatives, discussed below. 223 1. State and T ribal Royalty Audit Comm ittee One m eans of consultation is the S tate and Tribal Royalty Audit Comm ittee, com prised of State and Tribal audit m anagers who have cooperative aud it agreem ents with MMS under the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Managem ent Act. The Comm ittee m eets at leas t quarterly, and subgroups of the comm ittee m ay meet more often. This Comm ittee has achieved results in a num ber of areas: State and T ribal auditors from Colorado, Nort h Dakota, and Oklahom a helped design various tools used in the new co mpliance sy stem and will help tra in system users. Representatives from Colorado, Utah, W yoming, and the Northern and Southern Ute T ribes helped design the com pliance process for onshore oil and gas. Representative from States and Tribes work together on the C oal Subcomm ittee resolving a variety of coal related issues. 2. Work with State and Tribal auditors MMS works on a contin uing basis w ith Sta te and tribal aud itors to: Improve the language and content of orders se nt to com panies for royalty underpaym ent; Resolve valuation issues for royalty purposes invol ving Federal leases in their State or Indian leases on their Indian reservations; and Resolve complicated royalty disputes through negotiation. MMS also negotiated an Intergovernm ental Personnel Act (IPA) Fellowship Program with the Chippewa Cree Tribe. This IPA began May 2002. Departmen t of Justice Community Oriented Po licing Services (COPS) 1. The application of community policin g principles to hom eland security State, local and tribal la w enforcement agencies are all affected by the n ew dem ands being placed on them with regard to hom eland security and were consulted in the process of developing this initiative. Since its inception in 1994 through the Violen t Crim e Control Act, COPS has c onsulted regularly with professiona l law enforcem ent organization s. COPS also maintains re gular con tact with in tergovernm ental organizations such as the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National League of C ities, and the National As socia tion of Counties, which provides the perspective of local governm ent on law en forcem ent issues. COPS has conducted research and evaluations with local police departm ents to identify barriers and challenges to their implementation of community policing. 224 COPS' cons ultation with State and local government is reflec ted in the training provided through th e Regional Co mmunity Policing Ins titutes, best practices publications, and targeted initiatives. T he COPS Office convened a worki ng session of its nationa l network of Regional Community Policing Institutes (RCPI s). The RCPIs work clos ely with State, local and tribal agencies to create curricula and provide trai ning. This session gave them the opportunity to discuss law enforcem ent's comm unity policing need s post 9/11. The prim ary concerns raised at this working session were balancing the new re sponsibilities of hom eland security with the continuing responsibilities of traditional law enfo rcem ent. This working session resulted in the COPS Office charg ing the RCPIs with creating a cu rriculum to addres s community polic ing in a post 9/11 w orld. 2. The tim ely and appropriate acquisition and im plem entation of law enforcem ent related technology All COPS technology grantees from State, local , and tribal agencies were consulted for problem identification and resolu tion. The m ajority of consu ltations on this issu e too k place inform ally at various COPS funded or attende d law enforcement conferences and workshops. Additionally , consultatio ns have tak en place over the phone with proactive grantees that sought solutions to the technology im plementation problem s they were facing. The issues raised were sim ilar in nature. Agencies were granted funding for technology implementation, but m any did not kn ow how to proceed in acqui ring, integrating and implementing for optim al use. In response to these issues, the COPS Office enhanced its technology training and funded the developm ent of a com prehensive publication entitled Law enforcement Tech Guide -- How to plan, pur chase and manage techno logy (successfully!) . Office of Justice Programs: Office on Violence against Women 1. The STOP Violence Ag ainst W omen Form ula Grant Prog ram This grant program was authorized by th e Violen ce Against Wom en Act to develop and streng then effective law enforcem ent and prosecu tion strategies to com bat violen t crimes agains t wom en, and to develop and strength en victim services in cases i nvolving violent crimes against wom en. This program provides grants to St ates. The Office on Violence Against W omen (OVW ) regularly consults with the S tate adm inistrators of the STOP Program . Throughout the year, State adm inistrators have raised concer which inclu ded: insuf ficient inistrative funds, e planning process, need for incr eased em phasis on sexual assault, and a desire for m ore resources available on the web. In response to concerns expressed during the consultation process, States are now allowed ten percent of their STOP funds for their administrative costs, States now need to subm it a com prehensive im plem entation plan only once ev ery three years, as opposed to annually, conferences devoted to sexual assault, additi onal for ms and infor mation available on the OVW website. Office of Justice Programs: Bureau of Justice Assistance 225 1. Byrne Formula Grant Program The issue involved stream lining the adm inistration of the Edward Byrne Mem orial State and Local L aw Enforcem ent Assistance Grant Progr am (Byrne Form ula Grant Program ). This program is a partnership am ong Federal, State, and local governm ents designed to create safer communities. BJA provides gran ts to States for use by States and units o f local governm ent to improve the functioning of the crim inal justic e system - with em phasis on violent crim e and serious offenders - and enforce State and local laws that es tablish of fenses sim ilar to those in the Federal Controlled Substances Act. S tate Ad ministering Agencies (SAAs) were consulted. SAAs are appointed by governors and are res ponsible for the planning, m anagem ent, and sub- granting of the Federal funds. The SAAs were contacted via em ail for input on how BJA could simplify the application and award process under the Byrne F ormula Grant Program . The National Crim inal Justice Agency (NCJA) contacted the SAAs and com piled the suggestions. NCJA represents State, tribal, and local gove rnments on crime prevention and crim e control issues. As a result o f these cons ultations, th e Byrne For mula Grant Program application will be on-line to simplify the app lication process. In addition, the requirem ents of the strategic plan have been reduced in sco pe to includ e only Byrn e-funded program s and projects. BJA will continue, however, to request som e broader qu estions, such as coordi nation issues, but only those required by the statute. A four-year grant cycle will be allowable. The planning updates required in the strategic planni ng off-years will be provided in a level of detail deem ed appropriate by the grantee (e.g., a grantee m ay subm it a brief letter noting th at there has been no significant change to the plan). In addition, Byrne Form ula Grant prog rams are now on four- year funding cycles. 2. Residential Substance A buse Treatment Program The issue in volved steps to stream line the administration of the Residential Substance Abuse Treatm ent for State Prison ers (RSAT) Fo rmula Grant Program , whic h ass ists States and units of local governm ent in developing and im plementing residential substance abuse treatm ent program s within State an d local correctional a nd detention facilities. State Adm inistering Agencies (S AAs) were consulted. Issues raised included: the 25% cash match requirem ent was financially b urdensom e; the th ree-y ear gran t cycl e was too short to m ake most effective use of funding; and the RSAT and Byrne Form ula Grant program s have different grant cycles m aking program integration m ore difficult. As a result of the consultative process, grantees and subgrantees m ay now satisfy the match requirem ent through cash, in-kind contributions, or a com bination thereof. The RSAT grant period has been extended to four years. The RSAT and Byrne Formula Grant Program s are both on four-year funding cycles. 3. Southwest Border Prosecution Program 226 The Southwest Border P rosecution P rogram provides funds to the four southwest border States (Arizona, California, New Mexico, and T exas) and th eir respective counties for the handling of any federally-initiate d and declin ed-referred crim inal case that was pros ecuted by a State or county prosecutor. Jurisdictions providing pre-trial detention for eligible case defendants are also eligible for funds. BJA cons ulted with prosecutors, judicial officials of county and State governm ents, and State crim inal justice officials. The intergovernmental consultative process involved the developm ent of the program's scope, form at, and we b-based application design. Results from various consultations indicated that the best m ethod for application delivery and m anage ment was through a cen tralized website that would be commo n and accessible to all participants at the county and State levels; that all counties in the f our States should be eligible to participate, as opposed to just those along the bord er; that the application process be stream lined and sim plified, since previous program s of th is nature had been overly cumbersom e to administer and request paym ents; and that the St ates have only m inimal influence and comment over the app lications sub mitted by th eir respectiv e county ju risdictions. Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD) 1. Joint Sta te/Federa l Civil Environm ental Enf orcement In the past two years, ENRD has joined with nearly every State to bring enforcem ent cases. ENRD worked with States th at were inte rested in strengthening th eir wetlands protection program s, in light of a S uprem e Court ruling in 2001 that decreased Federal protection over certain isolated wetlands. Two Federal agencies and four State associatio ns joined with DOJ as \"cooperative parties\" in organizi ng and bringing the conference. The State associations were: National Governors Association (Center for Be st Practices ), National Co nference of State Legislatures, NAAG and Associatio n of State W etland Managers. In fiscal year 2002, States were awarded, through settlem ent or judgm ent, more than $27 million as th e result of joint civil environm ental enf orcem ent action s with ENRD. States increasingly participate in ENRD 's most prom inent cases. In fiscal year 2002, ENRD obtained a total of $3.6 billion in envir onmental protection w ork through injunctive relief. States participated as co-plaintiffs in cases that yielded $3.3 of the $3.6 billion in environm ental protection w ork. Exam ples of r ecent cooperative civil enforcem ent actions include the following: ENRD joined with 11 States and 3 county air authorities in obtaining a proposed Clean Air Act consent decree with a m ajor grain com pany. The settlement requires the com pany to implement sweeping environm ental improvem ents at 52 plants in 16 States to reduce air pollution by 63,000 tons per year. The estim ated cost of the work is $34 0 million ov er 10 years. The s ettlem ent includes a civil penalty of $4.6 m illion supplem m U.S. v. Archer Dan iels Midland C o. (C.D. Ill.) ENRD joined with the State of Arkan sas in obtain ing a Clean Air Act cons ent decree w ith an oil com pany. The com pany will install env ironm ental im provem ents at its petro at an estim ated cost of $17 m illion and pay a civ il penalty of $3 48,000. U.S. and State of Arkansas v. Lion Oil Co. (W.D. Ark.) ENRD joined with the States of Dela ware and Louisiana, and a region al air pollution control agency in Washington S tate, in reach ing a Clean Air Act agreem ent with com panies operating nine petroleum refineries. The c onsent decree will reduce air em issions by over 60,000 tons per year. The com panies also will co llectively pay a $9.5 m illion civ il pen spend about m illion on environm ental projects in co mmunities affected by the refineries' pollution. United States v. Motiv a Enterprises Lim ited Partnership, et al. (S.D. Tex.) ENRD joined with the States of Alab ama, Arkansas, Nebraska, Utah, South Carolina and Texas in reaching agreem ents with a steel m anufacturer under three envi ronm ental statutes - the Clean Air Act, Clean W ater Act a nd th e Resource Conservation and R ecovery Act (\"RCRA\"). The consent decree requires opera tion of pollution control equipm ent for nitrogen oxide em issions, rem ediation of areas of contam ination and improvem ents in waste manage ment. The com pany will pay a civil penalty of $9 m illion, and sp end $4 m illion on supplem ental environm ental projects. United States v. Nucor Steel, Inc. (D. S.C.) 2. Federal, S tate and Local Task Forces for Crim inal sta tutes provide for delegation of program s to the States and recognize State enforcem ent authorities. Therefore, si nce the inception of the Federal environm ental crim inal program , it has been esse ntial to work close ly with State and lo cal agencies. Information and other as sistance is sought and obtained from State and local law enforcem ent and regulatory agencies . ENRD attorn eys frequ ently s erve as faculty for State and local training program s. ENRD solicits State and local prosecutors to participate in Federal training courses. More importantly, however , such efforts are now going far beyond the solicitation of infor mation and cros s training, to the form ation of ta sk forces and other m eans of cooperation and coordination. These task forces have been form ed in m any districts to address environm ental crim es and related enf orcem ent concerns. The Divisi on's attorn eys act as members of the ta sk forces as they w ork join tly with Assista nt United St ates Attorneys on cases in the district. They also provide inform ation, general assistance, and su pport to all such task forces as called upon. An exam ple of a closely coordinated crim inal env ironm ental p rosecution was recen tly brought against a petroleum refinery operator in Texas for co vering up violations under the Clean Air Act and f or su bmitting f alse statements. The plea a greem ent re quires paym ent of a criminal pen alty of $20 illion, with $10 m fines and $10 m illion in specia l projects to im prove the env ironment in Co rpus Chris ti. The case was investigated by the Texas Environm ental En forcem ent Task Force, w hich includes State and Fe deral investigators. See United States v. Koch Petroleum Group (S.D. Tex.) 3. Indian Resources 228 The Indian Resources S ection represents the United States in its capacity as trus tee for American In dian tribes. To this end, the Section litig ates cases in order to estab lish an d protect the followin g: treaty hun ting and f ishing righ ts; tribal water rights; tribal and trib al jurisdic tion and authority. The Secti on also defends actions by the Secretary of the Interior and Congr ess intended to further tribal sovereignty and Indian rights. This litiga tion is of vital importance to Indian tribes and Indian people. Although the Indian Resources Section represen ts the interests of the United States and particula rly the in terests of the Inte rior Depart ment, thes e interests are often aligned with the interests of Indian tribes. We therefore work both informally and f ormally with tr ibes in pursuing litigation and negotiating settlem ents. In the past several years we have had rem arkable success in working with trib es, St ates, and private parties to settl e disputes. For exam ple, last year we engaged in settlem ent negotiations to re solve Zuni P ueblo claim s to water rig hts in Arizona, working closely with representatives of the Trib e, the State and community water districts to reach a settlem ent that the interested groups join tly could supp ort before C ongress. Other exam water ents working with the Shivwits Band of the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, the S tate of Utah, and area irrigation districts to secure enactm ent of the Shivwits Band of the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah W ater Rights Settlem ent Act and working with the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation and the State of Montana to settle the Chippew a Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Reserv ation's w ater righ ts. With regard to tr eaty fishing rights, we worked closely with five Mi chigan tribes an d the State o f Michigan to negotiate a consent decree in United States v. Michigan, regarding treaty-fishing rights in Lake Michigan. Finally, we also play ed a role in negotiating and draf ting a le gisla tive settlem ent of three tribes' long-standing claim s to the bed of the Arkansas River in Oklahom a. Congress enacted the legislation at th e close of the 107th term. Departmen t of Transportation Federal Mo tor Carrier Safety Administration 1. Hours of Service Regulations The FMCSA's hours-of -service regulations regulate the m aximum driving hours and minimum off-duty tim e of comm ercial m otor vehicl e (CMV) drivers. The States are required to adopt and enforce hours-of-service regulations consistent with the Federal standards in order to remain eligible f or Moto r Carrier Saf ety Assi stance Program (MCSAP) grants. Many States participated directly in FMCSA's recently completed revision of the hours-of-service regulations, and all of them were represented in directly throu gh the Comm ercial Vehicle Safety Allianc e the age ncy's propo sals. The States and CVSA argued that the proposed rules were exces sively com plex, would re quire a great deal of re-training o f enforcem ent officers, and were vi rtually unenfo rceable at ro adside. Motor carriers and CMV drivers argued that the rules were disruptive of trucking operations, excessively complex, far more expen sive th an the agency recognized, and ultim ately s elf-defeating because the rules would require more drivers and trucks on the road in peak traffic periods, thus producing m ore - not fewer - accid ents. 229 The proposed hours-of-service rules were fundam entally revised. The final regulation is simpler and cheaper, eas ier to enforce, and m ore com patible with curr ent motor car rier operations. Research and Special Programs Administration 1. Notice of Proposed Rulem aking on Pipe line Integrity Managem ent for Gas Transm ission Pipelines in High Consequence Areas This rule proposed to require the identifica tion of high consequence areas that could be affected by a pipeline failure and the establishm ent of integrity m anagem ent program s to provide additional safety m easures to be tter protec t for persons in tho se high consequence areas. State pipeline safety program s will share in spection an d enforcem ent respons ibilities for the integrity manage ment regulation. State pi peline safety officials have been consulted. State pipeline safety officials have expressed co ncern that the proposed rule is su fficiently clear to enable them to enforce it and that there needs to be training for State inspectors. The agency has planned an approach to enfor cement tha t will include the e xtensiv e use of protocols for inspectors (both Federal and State) to use for compliance in spection s and for training in the use of these protocols. The ag ency does not charge States tuition for pipeline safety training. Environmental Protection Agency 1. National Environm ental Perform ance Partnership System (NE PPS) EPA consults with States through the Environm ental Council of the States (ECOS), whose objec tive is Sta te participa tion in Agency activities, par ticularly tho se affecting State - implemented program s. Comm ittees consisting of both State and EPA m embers perform most of this work through forum s that are open to other stakeholders. EPA and the ECOS have an active joint work group to address continuing im plementation issues and work to identify and rem ove remaining barriers to effectiv e implem entation of NEPPS. ECOS has also launched several other proj ects with EPA consultation including work on child ren's h ealth issue s, a partn ership to build locally and nationally accessible enviro nmental system s, and developm ent of core perform ance m easures. 2. Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (O PPT) EPA has several continuing outreach m echanis ms related to its m ission that allow OPPT to routinely secure State and tr ibal insights and advice. These institutionalized pro cesses are therefore to som e extent independent of speci fic rulem aking. Established in early 1990s, OPPT created the Forum on State Tribal T oxics Action (FOSTTA) as a vehicle to encourag e State and tribal involvem ent in OPPT d ecision m aking. OPPT also uses the State Federal FIFRA Issues Research and Evaluation Group (SFIREG), es tablished in 1974 by cooperative agreem ent between EPA and the Am erican Association of Pest icide Con trol Officials, the asso ciation that 230 repres ents S tate leve l pesticide regulatory officials. SFIREG id entifies, analyzes and provides State comment on pesticide regulatory issues and provides a m echanis m for ongoing exchange of inform ation about EPA and State pesticide program s. Some specif ic exam ples of results f rom consultin g with SFIREG include the f ormation of joint EPA-S tate workg roups to dea l with a num ber of issues/projects. The SFIREG aids in developing guidance do cuments for use by EPA Regi ons and State ag encies to def ine Quality Managem ent and Quality Assurance procedures for State pes ticide prog rams (com pleted in 2000). The Group also works on improving or cl arifying several pestic ide labeling issues, including products used in public health m osquito control program s, restri cted reentry intervals for worke rs, label p recautions to p rotect bee s and other po llinators, and n ew requirem ents for the safe handling and use of phos phine gas fum igants (these are on-going now). EPA has used SFIREG t o provide State input on labeling policy in general through comments on revisions to the Label Review Manual used by EPA staff. 3. Office of Policy, Econom ics, and Innovation (OEPI) EPA, through the Office of Policy, Econom ics, and Innovation (OPEI), has m any continuing m echanis ms for consultation with S tate and local governm ents on regulatory issues. OPEI consults with thr ough them with local governm ents to promote regulatory efficiency and im proved environm ental results. Some of these m echanisms includ e the Joint EPA/State Agreement to Pursue Regulatory Innovation signed in 1998 by EPA and the Environm ental Council of the St ates (ECOS). The latter organization enables EPA and a num ber of States to consult regularl y on nearly 35 active innovation atten its m eetings and we extend a sim ilar invitation for representatives from the Comm ittee to attend the m eetings of the EPA Innovation Action Council. States use these venues to identify issues relevant to regulatory innovation and to collaborate on dem onstrati ons and evaluations. OPEI also sponsors a State Innovation Gran t Program , designed to provide resources to States to promote innovation in their regulatory program s through a competitive solicitation process. EPA recently com pleted a process designed to gath er comm ent by State ag encies on the design of this year' s solicitation. Historically, EP A has consulted regularly with States as our co\u00ad regulators o n regulatory innovation projects under Project XL and Project XL for communities. OPEI and its predece ssor organiz ations also collaborated with and c ommunities in supporting a community-based environm ental protect ion initiative. OPEI supports several S tate initiatives for innovation in envi ronmental regulation, and consults frequently with individual States on sp ecific pro jects. 4. Local Governm ent Environm ental Assistance Network (LGEAN) EPA helps support this Internet-based info rmation service (that has parallel toll-free voice and fax-back options). LGEAN provides a f irst stop for local governm ent officials with questions about environm ental compliance. The s ite conta ins information from EPA and eight participating nongovernm ental organizations. U sers can ask questions of experts, consult with their peers, review and comm ent on developing re gulations, and find the full text or summaries 231 of State and Federal environm ental statutes. LGEAN alerts us ers to hot topics and new developm ents in env ironmental complianc e, tells them where to find technical and financial support, and provides them with a grant writing tutorial. 5. RCRA Burden Reduction Initiative The RCRA Burden Reduction Initia tive rulem aking will s treamline or re move a third of the RCRA r eporting and recordkeeping requirements. Many changes will a ffect State hazardous waste program s. Individual States and the States ' national organization, the Association of State and Territorial Solid W aste Management Offi cials (ASTSW MO), responded to our proposed changes. They often rais ed issues that the ag ency would have otherwis e been unaware of, and identified benefits of proposed changes that had not been considered. EPA engaged ASTSWM O in a productive dialog ue to fully understand their concerns. This dialogue resulted in com prom ises suiting the needs of th e States while allowing u s to achieve EP A's objective of significantly reduc ing burden associated with RCRA reporting and recordkeeping. 6. Hazardous Waste Identification Rule EPA worke d closely with the States in de veloping the revisions to the m ixture and derived -from rules that were finalized in the 2001 Hazardo us W aste Id entification Rule (HW IR). Seven States participated on the EPA rulem aking workgroup (California, Colorado, Missouri, Oklahom a, Oregon, Virginia, and Washington), offering comm ents on early drafts of the proposed and final rules, particularly on im plementation issues. For example, State input was key in developing proposed options on how m uch data should be included in the HWIR exem ption notification package. EPA also attended at least f our national m eetings of St ates (three hosted by ATSW MO and one hosted by the Northeast W aste Managem ent Of ficials' Association.) In those m eetings, EPA presented updates on the HW IR rulem aking and answered Stat es' questions on the proposal. The States' input was especially key in contingent m anage ment, as they requested options for a \"clean b reak\" from hazardous waste regulation for these wastes. Records of those meetings are available in the HW IR docket. 7. State and Local Governm ent Input on EPA's Public Involvem ent Policy In June 2003, EPA released the new Pub lic Involvem ent Policy, \"A Framework for Implementing EPA's Public Involvem ent Policy\" , and \"EPA's Response to Public Comments on Draft 2000 Public Involvem ent Policy.\" The fina l 2003 Policy highlights the unique roles that these governm ental units play as well as the im portance of partnerships with delegated program s. The Policy reaffirm s our comm itment to early and m eaningful public involvem ent. EPA received comments from 26 State agencies, 12 local gov ernments, and four tribal governm ents on the draft Policy and m ade the appropriate changes. States expressed strong in terest in partnering on public involvem ent activities, and in using the tools (training, ev aluation, and sharing inform ation) that EPA is creati ng to improve public involvement in decisions. EPA also invited 232 States and tribes to aid infor mally in developing the Policy's implementation le at http://www.epa.gov/publicinvolve ment/policy2003/index.htm . EPA includes governm ent officials f rom States, localities, and tribes in developing regulations, policies, and guidan ce th at affects them. The agency continu es to use vario us policies, advisory boards, newsletters, and refe rence handbooks to help S tate, local, and tribal officials learn about federal regulatory plans and to let them know how they can engage in the rule developm "}
