Raising medical school standards andthereby reducing their enrollment, medical reformers believed, would simultaneously winpublic confidence inmedical practice andreduce theoutput ofdoctors. Theproblem they faced washow tocontrol the independent, proprietary medical schools. MEDICAL SOCIETIES Local andstatemedical societies, representing thepractition- ers,fought with medical schools intheir areas. the societies banded together toform theAmerican Medical Associa- tion(AMA).Atthefounding convention, leading practitioners passed requirements nary education according tohistorian William Roth- stein, \"would have closed down practically every medical school inthecountry, andwould have depleted theranks offormally educated physicians theAMA was hostile tothe interests ofproprietary colleges andtheir faculties. practitioners wanted toreduce theoutput schools in *Theterm \"elite\" refers reputations for clinical orresearch techniques, byincome, and/or byorganizational leadership positions, hadachieved prominence within theprofession. 66 IScientific Medicine I order toreduce competition within theprofession, while the medical faculties opposed anyattempted reforms because oftheir interests inmaximizing their lecture feesandfuture consulting fees.

The chief prominent professional spokesmen bytheendofthecentury were the \"surplus\" ofdoctors, \"low\" incomes, andthelowsocial status of theprofession. Three underlying problems plagued medical reformers who tried toheal these wounds. First, physicians lacked anagreed upon technical basis forsettling among themselves disputes between thesects. public consensus ofeffectiveness andvalidity, public support putthem allinaweak position toestablish political control over entry intomedical practice. Earlier efforts touse licensing ended inhumiliating defeat fortheregular profession because oforganized opposition from other sectsandadistrustful public. Third, within atleast thedominant sect different economic interests divided thosewho practiced medicine from thosewho trained future practitioners. Practitioners wanted torestrict the supply ofphysicians, andpart-time faculty wanted topreserve institutions thatwere lucrative additions totheirown practices.

Between 1870andtheoutbreak of WorldWar Iin1914, about 15,000 American physicians studied medicine inGermany alone.^^ While mostAmerican doctors who studied inEurope re- turned todevelop lucrative private practices, afewputtheirmain energies into developing laboratory medical sciences inthe United States. Carl Ludwig's physiology institute inLeipzig produced several luminaries ofAmerica's infant medical science. Henry Pickering Bowditch, oneofLudwig's pupils, founded the country's firstexperimental physiology department atHarvard University in1871. William Henry Welch, another ofLudwig's pupils, started America's firstpathology laboratory atBellevue Hospital medical school Fifteen years laterAmerican medical science came ofagewith theopening oftheJohns Hopkins medical school, modeled after theGerman university medical schools with aheavy emphasis on research inthebasic medical sciences.

SPECIALIZATION: LESSCOMPETITION FORTHEELITE Advances inmedical science during the late nineteenth century rapidly developed thetechnical basis forsome physicians tooffer highly specialized expertise not available from the ordinary practitioner.

Most states hadestablished medical licensing boards, however The ofHealth inparticular advances didnotyetresolve twomajor obstacles to professional uplift. First, medical schools remained unregulated. Inthefinalquarter ofthenineteenth century more than114new schools hadbeen founded.\"^The finances ofmedical schools forced their faculties tooppose thereformers' strategy of promoting scientific medicine toreduce output. Medical schools were forthemost part small profit-making enterprises, owned mainly bytheir faculties. Theonlycommodities theycould sell were medical degrees. Dependent fortheir survival aswell as their profits onstudent fees, theschools continued topour forth their products. Being proprietary incharacter butprofitable only tothefaculty directly involved, theywere unable toattract outside oroperating funds tosupport expensive teaching afewuniversity medical Hopkins, which wasfarfrom thenorm.
