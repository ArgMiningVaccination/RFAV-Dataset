I feel the tests Dr Kalidas ordered were comprehensive and helped in getting a whole picture of what was going on with me. My primary never ordered anything similar. After following the recommended regimen for a few months, the positive effects were steady and continuous. My anxiety and palpitations disappeared, I was able to sleep through the night again, my energy was greatly improved, my hair stopped falling out and my nails went from ridged, thin and breaking to strong and healthy again. Dr. Kalidas addressed my thyroid issues and I feel I have a plan to address them and keep me healthy. Doctor Kalidas combines years of practice in traditional medicine with a wholistic approach. His medical and office team is great as well. Dr. Kalidas and APRN Elizabeth, teamed up to answer all my questions regarding dosages through the portal. Great Responsiveness! The Attention to detail helped us avoid wasted time and appointments. I got a call before my follow up appointment, making sure all the necessary labs were complete before the follow up. I had missed getting a set of labs so they helped me get the follow up appointment rescheduled. If you've ever felt like doctors see you as the organ they specialize in, rather than a whole system and person, I highly recommend Dr. Kalidas. He'll give you the whole picture, get to the root of your symptoms and define a game plan to address your health issues. - 11/8/2020 Continuing my journey to good health I find myself in the office of Dr. Kirti Kalidas once again. I met him a couple of years ago with my mom but she was not agreeable. I need his IV therapy and Dr. Fernandez thought IV chelation would be the best way to get rid of toxins. From the moment I walked in, was greeted with smiles and professionalism. Everyone in this office I met are so friendly and caring. Dr. Kalidas is a Bredesen trained physician. He is a very knowledgeable compassionate doctor. He suggested a few weeks of wellness IV to bring my nutrient level up and than IV chelation beginning January to get rid of the heavy metal toxins. Sounds like a plan, I can't wait for the new year! The IV suite consists of recliners around the room. It took about an hour. It was a nice social hour. There were a few other woman there. I met a lovely young woman named Nicole she's a Functional Medicine health coach if your looking for one. Very knowledgeable. I highly recommend this office. The office does not take insurance but I'm going to submit receipts to my insurance company and hope to be reimbursed. - 12/6/2018 Dr. Kalidas is truly amazing! He helped me improve my health tremendously by treating the root cause and not just the symptoms. I've been seeing his team for almost 5 years and feel great. Just brought my husband in for the first time and Dr. Kalidas right away was able to identify the root cause and recommend a plan of action. I recommend his practice to anyone looking for a comprehensive consultation from a knowledgeable and compassionate doctor! - 3/12/2019 Just had my 3rd visit with Dr Kalidas. As a relatively healthy 58 y/o my concerns about arthritis and other aging related issues have been addressed with compassion and presence. It was nice to hear that the things I had been doing were great and there were more things that I could be doing. My brain fog has lifted and we're continuing work on hormonal issues. My whole family sees Dr Kalidas and will continue to. - 11/5/2017First to Review This place is amazing!!! If you want to follow these doctors treatment plans, and heal your body, this is the place for you! Treatments are customized for you individually, and each and every aspect of your health is considered. The time taken to provide the care and understanding of what your specific needs are, is beyond anything I have ever experienced in the medical world. My daughter was diagnosed with crohns disease 8 years ago, and her health and quality of life continually got worse through biochemical drugs, repeated hospital stays, and treatment from some of the best proffessionals in Orlando. I know now that they were not the best...Doc Kalidas, and Doc Amar are the best and for the first time in 8 very long years my daughter has hope, and a quality of life that is filled with healing, not illness. She has a future to be excited about....her body is healing! I praise God for bringing my daughter to these amazing doctors, nurses, and staff at The Center for Natural and Intergrative Medicine. - 7/27/2020 I am forever grateful to Dr. Kirti Kalidas & the Center for Natural and Integrative Medicine for healing me as a whole person and not just trying to mask symptoms. Prior to going to Dr. Kalidas I spent years in and out of multiple doctor offices and specialists. I had a myriad of issues ranging from unusually high blood pressure for someone of my size and weight (145/115), stabbing sharp pains all throughout my body, hair loss, and extreme weight loss. In my first appointment with Dr. Kalidas it was the first time I had seen a doctor in years (and probably ever) that I felt I was talking to a doctor that was truly listening to me. After just one round of blood work and a cortisol test, Dr. Kalidis was not only able to pinpoint the root(s) of all my issues (hormonal imbalances and a list of several other key factors), but was able to give me ways I could immediately being fixing everything. By fix everything I do not mean mask the symptoms, I mean fix the actual issue. To my delight, none of my recovery included pharmaceutical medicine. Every doctor I had been to in the past just wanted to throw me on blood pressure medicine instead of trying to figure out why I had high blood pressure with no clear reason. Dr. Kalidas gave me a regime of natural vitamins/supplements, some diet changes, and methods/resources to balance what was going on internally. I am now completely pain free, with normal hair growth, normal weight, and my blood pressure is nearly perfect ranging right around the 120/80. If you decide to go to Dr. Kalidas or the Center for Natural and Integrative Medicine (and I hope you will), please know that you have to be willing to take responsibility for your own health and put in the work. Consider whatever you pay for your visit an investment to extend your life and live a better life now. There is no magic pill or pixie dust that will make you better, you may have to change your diet, change your supplements, or even change your routines, but Dr. Kalidis will give you whatever tools you need to take your health into your own hands and truly begin healing from the source, not the symptom.
