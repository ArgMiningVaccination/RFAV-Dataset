Various pieces of research show that the human lifespan is decreasing with time. Similarly, there has been an increase in ailments that may not have existed a few centuries back. Professionals across various fields blame pollution, stress, chemicals, a sedentary lifestyle, and unhealthy food choices as the root of health issues. In the past, communities depended on natural herbs, plants, minerals, and vitamins to boost their defense system and fight infections. The Bible is among the oldest religious books. It has been translated into hundreds of languages. However, the translation has supposedly led to some words getting different meanings. [The Exodus Effect](https://recent-science.com/the-exodus-effect) is a bible-based wellness program comprising God-approved ingredients lost during translation. About the Product: What is the Exodus Effect? Anointing oil is a common ingredient in most religious ceremonies. The Exodus Effect is a religion-based anointing oil containing natural and science-based ingredients to diminish pain, improve immunity, and strengthen faith. The Exodus Effect is a systematic guide that allows Christians and non-Christians to create their healing oil using natural ingredients. It is 100% stimulant-free and non-addictive. The active ingredients are linked to longevity and well-being. Per Exodus Effect creators, notable biblical figures such as Methuselah, Adam, and Ibrahim, among others, purportedly used the anointing oil daily. However, bible translation to various languages led to the loss of the \"key\" ingredient in the anointing oil. Pastor Andrew and Dr. Benet, both of Divine Origins LLC, claim that multiple scientific and biblical evidence proves that CBD oil can enhance physical, mental, and spiritual health. According to the developers, Kaneh-Bosem originally referred to the cannabis plant. However, wrongful bible translation gave it a new meaning, \"Calamus,\" which refers to an herb with minimal health benefits. Exodus 30:22 supposedly lists the benefits of the original anointing oil created by God. The cannabis plant in the Bible created health-improving anointing oil that can: - Diminish chronic pain in the muscles, joints, and body - Strengthen the immunity - Improve blood flow - Support digestion - Fortify faith in God - Combat sleep issues Still, the Exodus Effect creators claim that biblical cannabis had zero THC elements and did not give users any side effects. How Does the Exodus Effect Work? Pastor Andrew warns that most Christians may disagree with using the cannabis plant for medicinal purposes. Today, marijuana is associated with causing mental issues and giving users nasty side effects with long-term usage. The Exodus Effect comprises pure CBD oil from high-quality hemp. In combination with other natural extracts, the Exodus Effect rapidly absorbs into the system to provide users with significant health benefits. The guide provides information on how to prepare THC-free CBD locally. Dr. Benet explains that [the Exodus Effect](https://recent-science.com/the-exodus-effect) improves and strengthens the endocannabinoid system. It improves various processes, including digestion, the circulatory, and respiration. It also targets pain and quickly erases it from the root. Similarly, CBD can inhibit the overproduction of cortisol, enabling the body to manage anxiety naturally. In addition, it reduces stress levels and minimizes oxidative damage at cellular levels. It can heighten immunity and lower unhealthy inflammations. Key Exodus Effect Ingredients The makers of the Exodus Effect claim that you can replicate the original bible-based anointing oil using cinnamon, cannabis, myrrh, cassia, and olive oil. The step-by-step guide supposedly explains how anyone can create THC-free CBD oil in the comfort of their home. However, the dosage should be potent and fresh to provide consumers with the advertised health benefits. Cannabis The human endocannabinoid system (ECS) depends on natural cannabinoid molecules to function optimally. Per various kinds of research, toxicity, unhealthy diet, and use of certain chemicals can lower cannabinoid levels, thus weakening the ECS. Cannabis comprises CBD elements that provide the body with cannabinoids, thus boosting its functions. Dr. Benet explains that CBD oil can alleviate pain, particularly in the muscles, back, and joints. In certain dosages, it may combat chronic headaches and migraines. Additionally, pyre CBD oil is a crucial ingredient in managing stress symptoms. Considerable evidence shows that it can promote relaxation and alleviate anxiety.
