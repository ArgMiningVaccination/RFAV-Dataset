These minimum standards: were developed by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) w ith the assistance of child -care operations, parents, stakeholders, and other experts in a variety of fields; reflect what the citizens of Texas consider to be reasonable and minimum; and meet the guidelines set forth in Chapter 42 of the Texas Human Resou rces Code (law) for what must be included in the minimum standards. The Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act requires that proposed standards be published for public comment before they are adopted as rules. All members of the public, including providers, are encouraged to provide input when proposed minimum standards are published for comment. The commission considers recommendations from interested persons or groups in formulating the final draft, which is filed as rules with the Secretary of State. Deficiencies A deficiency is any failure to comply with a minimum standard, rule in Texas Administrative Code Chapter 745, law, specific term of the permit, or specific condition of probation or suspension. Weights The minimum standards are weighte d based on a common understanding of the risk to children presented if the standard or rule is violated. The weights are: high, medium -high, medium, medium -low, and low. The assigned weights do not change based on the scope or severity of an actual deficie ncy. Scope and severity are assessed by Child Care Regulation (CCR) staff, documented, and considered in conjunction with the weight when making CCR decisions. You will see the weight is noted at the end of each standard or subsection in green. Only those minimum standards which can be cited as a deficiency are weighted. For example, the minimum standard prohibiting physical discipline is weighted but minimum standards that are definitions are not weighted. Revised: August 20237 Maintaining Compliance It is essential that you, your employees, and your caregivers recognize four critical aspects of CCR's efforts to protect the children in care and to help operation employees and caregivers comply with the law, rules, and standards. The four aspects are: Inspection Technical assistance Investigations Caregiver's rights and entitlements The Inspection Various aspects of regulated operations are evaluated for compliance with the minimum standards, rules, and laws during regular inspections. The emphasis on these inspections is to prevent risk to children in care. The frequency of inspections will fluctuate depending on the type of permit and the operation's history of compliance with the minimum standards, rules, and law. During any inspection, if we find that your operation does not meet minimum standard, rule, or law, the deficiencies are discussed with the person in charge at the time of the inspection. You will be given the opportunity to correct deficiencies within a specified period of time. If you have questions, concerns, or disagree with the citation, we encourage you to talk with us before we leave your operation. If your concerns are not resolved, you may request an administrative review. Technical Assistance We are available to offer consultation to potential applicant s, applicants, and permit holders regarding how to comply with minimum standards, rules, and laws. While we most often provide technical assistance during inspections and investigations, technical assistance can be requested at any time. The Child Care Reg ulation section of the HHSC web site has a Technical Assistance Library that allows you to view or download information about a variety of topics related to child care. You can view it by going to https://hhs.texas.gov/doing -business -hhs/provider -portals/protective - services -providers/child -care-licensing and selecting Technical Assistance Library from the Resources section. A featu re of the minimum standards publication are the Technical Assistance boxes that follow certain minimum standards to provide additional guidance, clarification, resources, and/or best practices related to the applicable rule. Revised: August 20238 Investigations When a report al leges a violation of minimum standards, rule, or law, CCR staff must investigate the report, notify you of the investigation, and provide a written report to you of the investigation results within prescribed time frames. Your Rights and Entitlements Waive rs and Variances You may request a waiver If your operation is unable to comply with a standard for economic reasons. You may request a variance if your operation wishes to meet the intent of a standard in a way that is different from what the standard spe cifies. Waiver and variance requests are submitted through your online provider account or made in writing to your assigned CCR inspector. Administrative Review If you disagree with a CCR decision or action, you may request an administrative review, during which you are given an opportunity to show compliance with applicable minimum standard, rule, law, action, permit restriction(s) and/or permit conditions. Appeal Hearing You may request an appeal hearing on a CCR decision to deny an application, revoke, s uspend, or refuse to renew a permit or a condition placed on the permit after initial issuance. Appeal hearings are conducted by the State Office of Administrative Hearings (SOAH). For Further Information It is important that you, your employees, and your caregivers clearly understand the purpose of minimum standards and the reasons for CCR's inspections and investigations. Do not hesitate to ask us questions that will help you understand any aspect of our regulation. You may obtain information about minimu m standards or procedures by calling your local CCR office or by visiting the HHSC web site -care-licensing . 2023 9 Subchapter A, Purpose and Scope \u00a7748.1.

For example, if we license your operation to offer emergency care services only, you do not have to comply with the minimum standards that apply to treatment services for a child with an emotional disorder, treatment services for a child with an intellectual disability, or a transitional living program; however, you must comply with all other applicable minimum standards of this chapter. [High] (b) For an unlicensed general residential operation that is subject to Licensing's regulation, the operation's administrator, owner, or operator or any other co ntrolling person who has the ability to influence or direct the operation's management, expenditures, or policies must ensure compliance with all the minimum standards in this chapter at all times, with the exception of those minimum standards identified for specific types of services that the unlicensed operation does not offer.

(d) Limitation of exceptio n. Notwithstanding subsection (c) of this section, and as further described in \u00a7745.8313 of this title (relating to Is a waiver or variance unconditional?), the department retains the authority for placing conditions on the scope of the exceptions authoriz ed for a family residential center, including conditions related to limiting occupancy in accordance with fire safety standards, limitations related to allowing children and adults of the opposite gender to occupy the same room only if they are part of the same family, and any other limitation determined by the department to be necessary to the health, safety, or welfare of children in care. (e) Division of responsibility. In addition to the application materials described in \u00a7745.243(6) of this title (relating to What does a completed application for a permit include?), an applicant for a license under this section must submit the policies, procedures, and any other documentation that the department deems necessary to clarify the division of supervisory and car etaking responsibility between employees of the facility and the parents and other adult family members who are housed with the children. The department must approve the documentation during the application process and any subsequent amendments to the poli cies and procedures .

Revised: August 2023 17 Technical Assistance The distinguishing variable between a PRN (as needed) psychotropic medication and an emergency medication is the circumstances under which the medication is given. A medication given to help a child manage his/her behavior or to de -escalate a child who is having trouble managing his/her behavior is regulated only as a PRN psychotropic medication. However, if the medication is given in response to an emergency situation, it is an emergency medication. For example, a child becomes increasingly agitated after a family visit, to the point of screaming and becoming verbally abusive to caregivers and other children. The child is not able to use self -calming techniques. If the child is offered a PRN psychotropic medication under these circumstances, it is not regulated as emergency medication, because there is no emergency situation. The medication serves to help the child manage the behavior before it escalates into an emergency. However, if the child had escalated to the point of physically assaulting someone and requiring physical restraint, then a medication offered during the restraint to help the child calm would be regulated as an emergency medication. (22)Emergency situation - A situation in which attempted preventative de -escalatory or redirection techniques have not effectively reduced the potential for injury, so that intervention is immediat ely necessary to prevent: (A) Imminent probable death or substantial bodily harm to the child because the child attempts or continually threatens to commit suicide or substantial bodily harm; or (B) Imminent physical harm to another because of the child's overt acts, including attempting to harm others. These situations may include aggressive acts by the child, including serious incidents of shoving or grabbing others over their objections. These situations do not include verbal threats or verbal attacks. (23)Employee - A person an operation employs full -time or part -time to work for wages, salary, or other compensation. For the purposes of this chapter, employees include all operation staff and any owner who is present at the operation or transports any child i n care. Revised: August 2023 18 (24)Family members - An individual related to another individual within the third degree of consanguinity or affinity. For the definitions of consanguinity and affinity, see Chapter 745 of this title (relating to Licensing). The degree of the relations hip is computed as described in Texas Government Code, \u00a7573.023 (relating to Computation of Degree of Consanguinity) and \u00a7573.025 (relating to Computation of Degree of Affinity).

[Medium -High] Technical Assistance Regarding subsection (c)(1) for annual suicide prevention training: o More than likely training on suicide prevention will have to be tailored for each operation because some of the training is based on an operation's own safety planning and the specific screening too l an operation uses to screen for risk. However, related to training on risk factors, protective factors, and warning signs of suicide, one resource that might be helpful is the AS+K? Basic Gatekeeper Training. o An inspector should cite: \u00a7748.125(c)(1) (th is rule) if a caregiver or employee does not have the annual suicide prevention training; \u00a7748.935(a)(1) or (2) if a caregiver or employee has taken the training, but it was not completed timely; \u00a7748.941(a)(1) - (4) if the training doesn't meet the instructor -led requirements; \u00a7748.949 if the training documentation requirements are not met; and \u00a7748.125(c)(1)(A) - (C) (this rule) if the training does not cover the curriculum requirements. Regardi ng subsection (c)(1) annual suicide prevention training for caregivers and employees and subsection (d)(3) training on the suicide risk screening tool, both types of training may be used to complete the annual training requirements at \u00a7748.930 and \u00a7748.931 . Regarding subsection (c)(2): o Examples of non -employees that may be appropriate for suicide prevention training are non -employees that have routine contact with a child or perform a supervisory role for the child; and o Examples of the promotion of suicide prevention training may be to share your suicide prevention policies and other relevant resources with the appropriate non - employees or encourage appropriate non -employees to participate in other specific suicide prevention training. Regarding subsection ( d)(2), you may use any evidenced -based screening tool that is appropriate for your program. Two screening tools that are free, evidence -based, and have ample research supporting their validity and reliability, are the: o Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scal e (CSSRS); and o Ask Suicide Screening Questions (ASQ).

Subchapter C, Organizat ion and Administration Division 1, Required Plans and Policies, Including During the Application Process January 2017 Yes, if you violate plans, policies, or procedures, then we may cite the relevant standard in Division 1 of this Subchapter (relating to Plans and Policies Required for the Application Process) as a deficiency; Technical Assistance Licensing only enforces plans, policies, and procedures required by the minimum standards. For example, Licensing does not enforce your policies on purchase approvals. In addition, Licensing will not cite this standard if you meet a specific minimum standard but do not meet your policy that requires more than the minimum standard. For example, if your policy requires caregivers to complete 12 hours o f general pre -service training and inspection results indicate an employee only completed ten hours of training, we will not cite you for failing to meet your policy. If this chapter contains another relevant minimum standard, then that standard would be cited for failure to comply with a policy. For example and using the same example as above, if an employee only completed six hours of general pre -service training, we will cite \u00a7748.863(a)(1) because the minimum standards require eight hours of general pre - service training. However, if there isn't another relevant minimum standard, then we would cite the relevant standard in Division 1. For example, if your professional staffing plan became outdated, then we would cite \u00a7748.105(3). Revised: August 2023 60 Division 2, Operational Responsibilities and Notifications \u00a7748.151.

Subchapter D, Reports and Record Keeping Division 1, Reporting Serious Incidents and Other Occurrences June 2020 These terms have the following meanings in this subchapter: (1) Serious incident --A non-routine occurrence that has or may have dangerous or significant consequences for the care, supervision, or treatment of a child. The different types of serious incidents are noted in \u00a7748.303 of this division (relating to When must I report and docume nt a serious incident?).

Only those incidents involving a \"substantial physical injury or critical illness\" must be reported and documented as a serious incident. The definition of \"substantial physical injury\" contains some examples of reportable serious incidents. Visits to the emergency room or emergency clinic (that did not result in hospitalization) for a common illness such as the flu, for a chronic illness su ch as an asthma attack, or for a routine medical exam would not warrant reporting as a serious incident. Also, it is the nature of the injury or illness that determines whether it is reportable as a serious incident, not the venue in which it is treated. T aking a child to the emergency clinic or doctor's office for stitches is still reportable as a serious incident, even though the treatment did not occur at an emergency room or hospital. Regarding children receiving treatment services for primary medical n eeds, planned admissions to the hospital are not reportable as serious incidents. If the child sustains a substantial physical injury or contracts a critical illness, a serious incident report is required. However, ongoing treatment for the child's chronic illnesses or conditions is not reportable as a serious incident. In addition, admission to a psychiatric hospital only warrants a serious incident report if the admission is precipitated by a reportable incident, such as a suicide attempt. The admission itself is not reportable as a serious incident. Regarding paragraph (e)(3), a disaster may be declared by the governor or the presiding officer of the governing body of a political subdivision. The operation must be located in the area impacted b y the declared disaster before paragraph (e)(3) applies. Regarding subsection (e)( 7), see the Citizen's Guide for the Texas Criminal Justice Process for more information on criminal matters. Revised: August 2023 78 \u00a7748.305. What constitutes a suicide attempt by a child?

Suicidal thoughts are not reportable as a suicide attempt. \u00a7748.309. How do I make a report of a serious incident or occurrence to Licensing? Subchapter D, Reports and Record Keeping Division 1, Reporting Serious Incidents and Other Occurrences January 2017 All serious incident reports must be made directly to the Texas Abuse and Neglect Hotline.

[Medium] Technical Assistance Regarding subsec tion (3), this requirement is not intended to conflict with confidentiality laws or rights. Identifying information for one child should not be placed in the record of another child. You may choose to 1) write one incident report that is filed centrally (n ot in each child's record) and de -identified when released as part of a child's record, 2) write one incident report that is filed in each child's record, with each copy de -identified to not show the full name of other children involved in the incident, or 3) write a separate incident report for each child, with only the first name or initials of each other child involved. Regarding subsection (5), witnesses to the incident are persons who were present when the incident occurred and can give a first -hand ac count of what they experienced during the incident. A person is not automatically a witness because he lives in the same unit or cottage as the child involved in the incident. Witnesses may also be persons unaffiliated with the operation, such as a visitor to the operation who was present at the time of the incident. \u00a7748.313.

Subchapter G, Child/Caregiver Ratios January 2007 The child/caregiver ratio is the maximum number of children for whom one caregiver can be responsible. \u00a7748.1003. For purposes of the child/caregiver ratio, how many children can a single caregiver care for during the children's waking hours? Subchapter G, Child/Caregiver Ratios January 2017 (a) The number of children that a single caregiver may care for during waking hours depends on the ages and treatment service needs of the children in the group. A single caregiver may care for five children if at least one child in the group requires treatment services, or eight children if none of the children in the group require treatment services. Children younger than five years old count as two children. [Medium -High] (b) You may separate children into groups based on age and/or treatment services in order to vary the child/caregiver ratio required for each group, as long as [Medium ]: (1) The groups remain easily distinguishable and separated, such as by cottage or unit; and (2) The child/caregiver ratio is re -calculated any time groups intermingle, such as on a field trip or in the dining room. (c) A cottage home may be out of ratio during waking hours for short periods to enable a normal home -like routine as long as the care and supervision needs of the children continue to be met. S taff or other caregivers must be on the premises and available to respond in an emergency. These additional staff or caregivers must be specifically addressed in the written professional staffing plan. [Medium ] (d) A child does not count in the child/caregiver ratio while participating in an approved unsupervised childhood activity. Revised: August 2023 161 Technical Assistance Examples of how to calculate ratio: Children in the group are 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11 years old. None of the children require treatment services, so the ratio is 1:8. Even though the 4 -year-old counts as two children, only one staff person is needed. If you added another 4 -year-old to this group, two staff would be needed: 4-year-old counts as 2 children 4-year-old counts as 2 children 6-year-old counts as 1 child 7-year-old counts as 1 child 7-year-old counts as 1 child 9-year-old counts as 1 child 11-year-old counts as 1 child This is a total of 9 children, so a second caregiver is needed to comply with the 1:8 ratio. Children in the group are 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 years old. One of the children requires treatment services, so the ratio is 1:5. Since the 4 -year-old counts as two children, two staff are needed. A group of children is determined largely by the layout of the building and/or c ampus. For example, the children in a cottage home are counted as one group. Since building structures vary greatly, each facility is assessed on a case -by-case basis. \u00a7748.1005. Can child/caregiver ratios be averaged on an operation - wide basis? Subchapter G, Child/Caregiver Ratios September 2010 Each group of children must have sufficient caregivers to meet the required child/caregiver ratio for that group of children. A person may not be counted in the ratio for a group of children if he is cari ng for children outside the group or working in an administrative capacity.

Subchapter G, Child/Caregiv er Ratios September 2010 (a) The number of children that a single caregiver may care for during night -time sleeping hours depends on whether the caregiver stays awake or sleeps during these hours and on the ages and treatment service needs of the children in the group. Children younger than five years old count as two children. [Medium -High] (b) If the caregiver stays awake, the caregiver may care for: (1) 15 children if at least one child in the group requires treatment services [Medium -High] ; or (2) 24 child ren if none of the children in the group require treatment services. [Medium -High] (c) If the caregiver sleeps, the caregiver may care for: (1) 10 children if at least one child in the group requires treatment services [Medium -High] ; or (2) 16 children if none of the children in the group require treatment services.

Efforts should be reasonably spaced, allowing enough time for a person to respond yet not unreasonably delaying the acquisition of the requested information. Example: Calling a CPS caseworker or parent three times in one day would not be considered three separate \"reasonable efforts\" to obtain needed information, as this does not allow the person reasonable time to respond to each of the requests. Example: Calling a CPS caseworker or parent once every three months to obtain information needed for an admission assessment would not be considered reasonable effort to obtain the information, as the third attempt would be made at least s ix months after the child was placed. Example: Calling a CPS caseworker or parent once a week for three weeks to obtain information needed for an admission assessment would be considered reasonable effort to obtain the information, as this gives ample time for the person to respond to each call, and also seeks to obtain the information within one month of admission. No further attempts would be expected if the information was not obtained after these three attempts. Revised: August 2023 139 \u00a7748.1223.

[Medium -High] Technical Assistance Children's Nutrition Research suggests the following: Milk and milk products served to children 12 months old or older should be Grade A pasteurized or from sources approved by the Department of State Health Services. The following milks do not contain the right amounts of all the nutrients infants need and can harm an infant's health. Iron -fortified infant formula is the best substitute for breast milk. Revised: August 2023 185 Technical Assistance Infants should not be given the following unless recommended by the infant's health -care professional: Cow's milk; Evaporated cow's milk Sweetened condensed milk; Goat's milk; Soy milk; or Imitation milks, including those made from rice or nuts (such as almonds) or nondairy creamer. (http://www.fns.usda.gov/tn/Resources/feeding_infants.html Feeding Infants: A Guide for Use in the Child Nutrition Programs p.24) Milk should be fluid milk. Breads and grains should be made from whole -grain or enriched meal or flour. Cereal should be whole grain or enriched or fortified. Vegetable or fruit juices should be 100% vegetable or fruit juice when used to meet a serving from the vegetable or fruit group. Children unde r one year old should not be offered unpasteurized or raw honey because it may contain spores that pose a health risk. Food Allergies A food allergy is caused by the body's immune system reacting inappropriately to a food or food additive. Symptoms may inc lude wheezing, difficulty breathing, diarrhea, rashes, itching, hives, and headaches. Food allergies are most common in infants, due to their immature digestive systems. Food allergies are usually outgrown during the preschool years. Although any food may cause an allergic reaction, six foods are responsible for most of these reactions in children. These foods are: Peanuts; Eggs; Milk; Tree nuts; Revised: August 2023 186 Technical Assistance Soy; and Wheat. A child who is pregnant or breastfeeding should avoid consuming peanuts and peanut products due to its association with the development of peanut allergies in infants. It is best not to offer children under two to three years old peanuts or peanut products, such as peanut butter and foods containing or cooked in peanut oil, because of the potential o f developing this life -threatening and often life -long allergy. Foods that cause allergic reactions should be eliminated from the diet. However, it is important that the diet still contain a variety of foods for healthy growth and development. A child shou ld receive a medical evaluation if food allergies are suspected. If the child's licensed physician determines that the child has a food allergy, a determination should be made of whether the child's allergic condition meets USDA's definition of disability. Food Intolerance A food intolerance is an adverse food -induced reaction that does not involve the body's immune system. Lactose intolerance is one example of food intolerance. A person with lactose intolerance lacks an enzyme needed to digest milk sugar. When that person eats milk products, gas, bloating, and abdominal pain may occur. It is best to provide food substitutions for children with food intolerances who cannot consume the regular meal. (http://www.fns.usda.gov/tn/Resources/blocks1.pdf - pg. 18) Choking Research has shown that 90% of fatal choking occurs in children younger than four years old. Examples of foods that present a risk of choking include hot dogs sliced into rounds, whole grapes, hard candy, nuts, seeds, raw peas, dried fruit, pretzels, chips, peanuts, popcorn, marshmallows, spoonsful of peanut butter, and chunks of meat larger than can be swallowed whole. Revised: August 2023 187 \u00a7748.1695. What are the specific requirements for feeding an infant?

[Medium ] Revised: August 2023 235 Technical Assist ance It is a good idea for disciplinary measures to be consistent among caregivers. Using positive methods of discipline and guidance encourage self -esteem, self -control, and self -direction. Positive methods of discipline include the following: Using praise, positive reinforcement, and encouragement of good behavior instead of focusing only on unacceptable behavior; Reminding a child of behavior expectations daily by using clear, positive statements; Talking with the child about the situation; Focusing on the rule to learn and the reason for the rule; Focusing on solutions that are respectful, reasonable, and related to the problem behavior, rather than blaming or focusing on conse quences; Redirecting the child's attention or behavior using positive statements; Providing prior notice of possible consequences for inappropriate behaviors; Giving the child acceptable choices or alternatives; Using brief supervised separation or time aw ay from the group or situation, when appropriate for the child's understanding, age, and development. Best practice suggests that quiet time or time out from the group be limited to no more than one minute per year of the child's chronological or developme ntal age. However, this time frame may need to be adjusted for some children, such as a child who has attention -deficit disorder. Time out is not appropriate for infants and is not recommended for toddlers, since they are too young to understand this intervention; Arranging the environment to allow safe testing of limits; Using kind but firm action; Giving logical consequences that are appropriate to the situation and severity of the behavior; and Withholding privileges. \u00a7748.2303.

What are the requirements for hiking or camping excursions? Subchapter Q, Recreation Activities Division 4, Wilderness Hiking and Campi ng Excursions September 2010 When you participate in a hiking or camping activity in an area unfamiliar to the participating adults, and the hiking activity lasts more than two hours: (1) The person qualified to supervise the hiking or camping excursion must consider the following when selecting the area for hiking or camping: (A) Evacuation [Medium ]; (B) Communication [Medium ]; and (C) Water quality and quantity [Medium ]; (2) The person qualified to supervise the hiking or camping excursion must have experience leading a group in hiking or camping at the elevation, terrain, and climate where the activity is to take place [Medium ]; (3) Before participation, the caregivers and children must receive instruction on: (A) The fundamental safety procedures for the ar ea where the hiking or camping will occur [Medium ]; (B) Procedures to follow if the participant gets lost [Medium ]; (C) Proper health and sanitation procedures [Medium ]; (D) Potential high -risk areas where the hiking or camping will occur [Medium ]; and (E) Fire risks [Medium ]; (4) The emergency medical care consent forms must be readily accessible to the caregivers accompanying them [Medium ]; (5) Caregivers participating in the hiking or camping activity must regularly monitor and care for the health and safety of children [Medi um-High] ; and (6) If the excursion will be on private land, you must have an agreement with the person responsible for that land. [Medium -Low] Revised: August 2023 339 Technical Assistance The following are suggestions for when a child is in or around a grassy, wooded area while camping, hiking or participating in any other outdoor activity, especially in the months between April and October: Cover arms and legs. Have the child wear a long -sleeved shirt, and tuck his pants into his socks. Wear a hat to help keep ticks away from th e scalp. Keep long hair pulled back. Wear light -colored clothing to make it easier to spot ticks. Wear enclosed shoes or boots. Avoid wearing sandals in an area where ticks may live. Use insect repellent. Products with DEET are effective against ticks and can be used on the skin. However, large amounts of DEET can be harmful to the child if it is absorbed through the skin. Look for products that contain no more than 30 percent DEET. Wash the DEET off with soap and water when your child returns indoors. Products with permethrin can be used on clothing, but cannot be applied to the skin. Stay on cleared trails whenever possible. Avoid wandering from a trail or brushing against overhanging branches or shrubs. After coming indoors, check for ticks. This will onl y take a few minutes. Ticks often hide behind the ears or along the hairline. It may take up to 48 hours for a person to become infected, so removing any ticks soon after they have attached themselves can help reduce the chances of becoming infected. Remov ing leaves and keeping your yard clear of brush and tall grass may reduce the number of ticks. You may wish to talk to a licensed professional pest control expert about other steps you can take to reduce ticks in your yard. \u00a7748.3843. What are the requirements for monitoring children's safety and health during hiking or camping excursions?

[Medium ] (f) You must discard any contaminated foods. [Medium -High] Technical Assistance The following are health and safety recommendations related to cooking and food storage on hiking and camping trips. Keeping Food Cold: It is best to: Fill the cooler with cold or frozen foods. Pack foods in reverse order. The first foods packed should be the last foods used, except that raw meat or poultry should be packed below ready -to- eat foods to prevent raw meat or poultry juices from dripping on the other foods. Take foods in the smallest quantity needed (e.g., a small jar of mayonnaise). Revised: August 2023 343 Technical Assistance In the car, put the ice chest in the air -condit ioned passenger section, rather than in the trunk. At the campsite, insulate the cooler with a blanket, tarp, or poncho. When the camping trip is over, discard all perishable foods if there is no longer ice in the cooler or if the gel - pack is no longer frozen. If you are planning to fish, check with the fish and game agency or state health department to see where you can fish safely, then follow these guidelines: Finfish: Scale, gut, and clean fish as soon as they are caught. Live fish can be kept on stringers or in live wells, as long as they have enough water and enough room to move and breathe. Wrap fish, both whole and cleaned, in water -tight plastic and store on ice. Keep 3 to 4 inches of ice on the bottom of the cooler. Alternate layers of fish a nd ice. Store the cooler out of the sun and cover with a blanket. Once home, eat fresh fish within 1 to 2 days or freeze them. For top quality, use frozen fish within 3 to 6 months. Shellfish: Crabs, lobsters, and other shellfish must be kept alive until cooked. Store in live wells or out of water in a bushel or laundry basket under wet burlap or seaweed. Crabs and lobsters are best eaten the day they are caught. Live oysters should be cooked within 7 to 10 days. Live mussels and clams should be cooked with in 4 to 5 days. Eating raw shellfish is extremely dangerous. People with liver disorders or weakened immune systems are especially at risk. Using a Food Thermometer: Revised: August 2023 344 Technical Assistance If you are cooking meat or poultry on a portable stove or over a fire, you will need a way to determine when it is done and safe to eat. Color is not a reliable indicator of doneness, and it can be especially tricky to tell the color of a food if you are cooking in a wooded area in the evening. When cooking hamburger patties on a grill or po rtable stove, use a digital thermometer to measure the temperature. Digital thermometers register the temperature in the very tip of the probe, so the safety of thin foods, such as hamburger patties and boneless chicken breasts, can be determined. A dial thermometer determines the temperature of a food by averaging the temperature along the stem and, therefore, should be inserted 2 to 2 \u00bd inches into food. If the food is thin, the probe must be inserted sideways into the food. It is critical to use a food t hermometer when cooking hamburgers. Ground beef may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, a particularly dangerous strain of bacteria. Illnesses have occurred even when ground beef patties were cooked until there was no visible pink. The only way to insure that ground beef patties are safely cooked is to use a food thermometer, and cook the patty until it reaches 160 \u00b0F. For chicken, cook breasts or cutlets to 170 \u00b0F and legs and thighs to 180 \u00b0F. Pork should be cooked to 160 \u00b0F. Heat hot dogs and any leftover food to 165 \u00b0F. Be sure to clean the thermometer between uses. \u00a7748.3855. What requirements must I meet for food utensils and equipment when camping? Subchapter Q, Recreation Activities Division 4, Wilderness Hiking and Camping Excursions January 200 7 (a) A common use drinking cup, container, or utensil must be washed with uncontaminated hot water and detergent before another person uses it. [Medium -Low] (b) You must not use a dish, container, or utensil that is chipped, cracked, broken, damaged, or construct ed so as to prevent proper cleaning and sanitizing. [Medium -Low] Revised: August 2023 345 (c) You must discard disposable or single -use dishes, containers, or utensils used in handling food after one use. [Medium -Low] (d) You must store eating utensils: (1) Separately from foods or other materials or substances [Medium -Low]; and (2) In clean, dry containers. [Medium -Low] Technical Assistance The following are best practices for food utensils and equipment when camping: Food utensils and equipment should be rinsed in hot water and sanitized in disinfected water. Prepare each solution daily and place it in a closed and labeled container; or Where group dishwashing is practiced, all food utensils should be immersed for at least two minutes in a lukewarm chlorine bath containing at least 50 ppm of available chlorine. Where chlorine is used, a three - compartment vat or three containers should be used for washing, rinsing, and immersing. \u00a7748.3857. What parameters must I follow for drinking water during a hiking or camping excursion? Subchapter Q, Recreation Activities Division 4, Wilderness Hiking and Camping Excursions January 2007 (a) Drinking water used during a hiking or camping excursion must come from a source known to be safe or must be rendered safe. [Medium -High] (b) An adequate sup ply of water, under pressure where possible, must be provided at the cooking area for hand washing, dishwashing, food preparation, and drinking. [Medium -Low] Technical Assistance It is recommended that drinking water be disinfected by one of the following methods: Boil water for at least 1 to15 minutes after it reaches a full boil; A water purifier; A water filter; Revised: August 2023 346 Technical Assistance Iodine tablets or crystals - add five drops of iodine per quart of clear water or ten drops per quart of cloudy water, thoroughly mix the solution, and wait 30 minutes before using; Chlorine dioxide tablets, or halazone tablets used according to the manufacturer's directions; or Liquid iodine or household chlorine bleach - add two drops of household chlorine bleach per quart of water. You must ensure the chlorine does not have an active ingredient other than 4% to 6% sodium hypochlorite. Thoroughly mix the solution and wait 30 minutes before using. If the water does not have a slight chlorine odor and taste, add two more drops of chlorine b leach and wait 15 more minutes before using. Safe Drinking Water: It is not a good idea to depend on fresh water from a lake or stream for drinking, no matter how clean it appears. Some pathogens thrive in remote mountain lakes or streams and there is no w ay to know what might have fallen into the water upstream. It is best to bring bottled or tap water for drinking, starting out with a full water bottle, and replenishing your supply from tested public systems when possible. On long trips, you should consid er purifying any water taken from the wild, no matter how clean it appears. The surest way to make water safe is to boil it. Boiling will kill microorganisms. First, bring water to a rolling boil, and then continue boiling for 1 minute. Before heating, mud dy water should be allowed to stand for a while to allow the silt to settle to the bottom. Dip the clear water off the top and boil. At higher elevations, where the boiling point of water is lower, boil for several minutes. As an alternative to boiling wat er, you may also wish to use water purification tablets and water filters. The purification tablets - which contain iodine, halazone, or chlorine - kill most waterborne bacteria, viruses, and some (but not all) parasites. Because some parasites are not kil led by purification tablets, you should also use a water filter. These water filtering devices should be 1 micron absolute or smaller. Over time, purification tablets lose their potency, so it is important to keep your supply fresh. Water sanitizing tablet s for washing Revised: August 2023 347 Technical Assistance dishes can also be purchased (just do not confuse the two). Water purification tablets, filters, and sanitizing tablets can be purchased at camping supply stores. \u00a7748.3861. What are the requirements for toilet facilities during overnight ca mping excursions?

[Low] Revised: August 2023 360 Subchapter S, Additional Requirements for Operations That Provide Emergency Care Services Technical Assistance Only an emergency care services program that plans to admit a specific child population requiring treatment services i s required to meet treatment service requirements. Emergency care service programs which do not limit their admissions with regard to treatment service needs are not required to meet minimum standards related to treatment services. For example, an emergenc y care services program specifically for children with primary medical needs is required to meet all minimum standards related to primary medical needs. However, an emergency care services program with a broader admissions policy, able to admit children wi th a variety of needs, is not required to meet treatment services requirements. In the first example, the emergency care services program knows that most or all of the children admitted will require a certain type of care. Therefore, the operation is able to plan appropriately for the required professional staff and services needed for the care of these children. In the second example, with a broader admissions policy, the emergency care services program is not able to predict the needs of children being ad mitted. Therefore, the operation does not have the opportunity to plan in advance to have professional staff, staff training, or services available for the specific, specialized needs of children in care.

Revised: August 2023 407 Appendix B, Vaccine -Preventable Diseases This guide is i ntended to provide you with more information to assist in the development and implementation of a vaccine -preventable disease policy for your program. What must the policy for protecting children from vaccine - preventable diseases include? Your operation is responsible for developing a policy that includes all areas addressed in \u00a7748.241. How will Licensing evaluate for compliance? Licensing will review your program's policy to ensure that it covers each of the eight required areas. Licensing staff will ensure that your operation outlines how you will maintain either written or electronic records for each employee's compliance with your policy as well as any exemptions. We will not evaluate based on the content of each policy item. What would be an exampl e of how licensing will evaluate my operation's compliance with the new rule? The new rule requires you to specify any vaccines that you have determined an employee must have based on the level of risk the employee presents. Licensing staff will review you r policy to ensure you have specified any vaccines an employee must have. For example, if your policy outlines that all employees must only obtain a flu vaccine once every 12 months then we would only review compliance with the employee's requirement to ob tain a flu vaccine. What immunizations are recommended for adults? The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) develops the recommendations and they are listed on the CDC website at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/adult/adult -schedule.pdf Revised: August 2023 408 Do I have to require employees to obtain all immunizations recommended by the CDC? No, employ ees at your program will only need to obtain immunizations that are required in your policy. It is up to you to determine what immunizations will be required and which employees are required to obtain them based on their level of risk as determined by thei r routine and direct exposure with children. How do I determine an employee's level of risk? An employee's level of risk is determined by the policy you develop. The basis for determining an employee's level of risk must be outlined in your policy and must be based on the employee's routine and direct exposure to children. Items to consider when you develop policy include: What are the employee's primary duties? How closely does the employee work with children? (For example, does the employee change diapers , assist with toileting, prepare or serve food) How often does the employee work with children? (Regular contact vs. substitute basis) What are the ages of children the employee works with? Can an employee be exempt from immunizations that my program's policy requires? Yes, an employee may be exempt from one or more of your program's required immunizations for: Medical conditions identified as contraindications or precautions by the CDC; or Reasons of conscience, including a religious belief. What procedures must an employee follow to be exempt from having a required vaccine? Your policy must address exemption procedures an employee must follow in order for you to determine the employee's qualification of an exemption. Revised: August 2023 409 What are some examples of acce ptable documentation for exemptions? For medical conditions, acceptable documentation may include a note from the employee's health care professional providing a statement that the required vaccine is medically contraindicated or poses a significant risk t o the health and well -being of the individual. For reasons of conscience, acceptable documentation may include a signed and dated statement from the employee that states the employee is exempt for reasons of conscience, including the person's religious beliefs. What are some examples of procedures that an exempt employee must follow to protect children in care from exposure to disease? It is up to your operation to determine what and when protective procedures will be required. Examples of protective proced ures include: Wearing gloves when handling or cleaning body fluids, such as after wiping noses, mouths, or bottoms, and tending sores; Specifying that an employee with open wounds and/or any injury that inhibits hand washing, such as casts, bandages, or br aces, must not prepare food or have close contact with children in care; Wearing masks when the employee has respiratory symptoms to reduce the spread of droplets to surrounding areas; Wearing masks when taking care of children with respiratory symptoms; Removing gloves and washing hands immediately after each task to prevent cross - contamination to other children; Excluding the employee from direct care when the employee has signs of illness. How can I determine that an employee has complied with my operation's policy? You must specify in your policy how you will verify that an employee has complied with your policy. This must include what written and/or electronic documentation you will accept. Examples of documentation may include: Revised: August 2023 410 Copy of the emplo yee's current immunization record; Receipt that includes date a required immunization was received; Letter signed by a health care professional that lists the date an immunization was received; Documentation of exemption for medical reasons from a health care professional; Signed and dated statement from the employee for exemption based on a reason of conscience. Where can my employees get the recommended immunizations? Individuals should start with their health care provider. Other resources in you r area include pharmacies, the health department, and public or community health clinics. For a list of local health departments in Texas visit the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) website at: http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/regions/lhds.shtm Are there any other resources available for employees to receive the recommended immunizations? Yes, the Adult Safety Net program created by The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS ) to increase access to vaccination services in Texas for uninsured adults. What is the Adult Safety Net program? The Adult Safety Net (ASN) program provides vaccine purchased with public funds to participating clinics to be used for immunizing uninsured a dults. How do I find an Adult Safety Net provider in my area? Visit the ASN website at www.dshs.state.tx.us/ASN and click on the search page to locate an ASN clinic near you. (Please check with the clinic before visiting to make sure they can see you. ) Who is eligible to receive vaccinations from the ASN program?

Individuals who do not qualify for ASN vaccines include: Adults who have Medicare, Medicaid, or any other insurance, including private insurance. Adults who are underinsured for adult vaccines (e.g., those who have healthcare insurance that does not cove r adult vaccines). Individuals younger than 19 years of age. What vaccines are offered through the ASN program? The following is a list of vaccines currently offered through the ASN program and a description of the diseases they prevent. Hepatitis B Vaccine \u2014 prevents infection of the liver by the hepatitis B virus, which can lead to liver cancer, cirrhosis of the liver, liver failure, and death. Hepatitis A Vaccine \u2014 prevents infection of the liver by the hepatitis A virus. Symptoms of hepatitis A include lack of energy, diarrhea, fever, nausea and jaundice (yellow color to the whites of the eyes or skin). Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B Combination Vaccine \u2014see above. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine \u2014 prevents infection from several strai ns of HPV, including those that cause genital warts and several types of cancer, such as cervical, anal, penile, and throat cancer. Measles/Mumps/Rubella (MMR) Vaccine \u2014 prevents infection from the measles virus, which can lead to rash, ear infection, brai n damage, and death. Prevents infection from the mumps virus, which can cause fever, swollen glands, headache, and can lead to deafness and meningitis. Prevents infection from rubella virus, which can cause rash, arthritis, and miscarriage in pregnant wome n. Pneumococcal Polysaccharide (PPSV23) Vaccine \u2014 prevents infection by the Streptococcus pneumoniae bacterium, which is one of the most common causes of severe pneumonia and can lead to other types of infections, such as ear infections, sinus infections, meningitis (infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord), and blood stream infections (bacteremia). Revised: August 2023 412 Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis (Tdap) Vaccine \u2014 prevents tetanus, which can cause muscle spasms, lockjaw, paralysis, and death. Prevents diphth eria, which can cause suffocation and heart failure. Prevents pertussis (known as \"whooping cough\"), which can cause severe coughing that can lead to rib fractures, pneumonia, and death. The CDC recommends* one dose for all pregnant women during every preg nancy and all other adults who have not yet received Tdap vaccination, especially those who come in contact with infants. Tetanus and Diphtheria (Td) Vaccine \u2014 similar to Tdap vaccine (see above), but protects against tetanus and diphtheria only, without t he pertussis component. If I qualify for ASN vaccine, do I have to pay anything? ASN vaccines are supplied to participating medical providers at no cost. This means that ASN providers cannot charge a fee for the vaccine itself. However, providers are allow ed to charge an administration fee of up to $25 for each vaccine that is administered. Although ASN providers may charge this administration fee, they cannot deny the vaccine because of an inability to pay it. Revised: August 2023 "}
