Over the winter we are often less active, our diet is different, our energy changes. We accumulate more toxins due to being less active and sweating less. However, Spring is a time of change where the energy of action and movement is all around us - we can harness this energy and intention in how we care for ourselves. Each season brings a different energy and focus; we can do the same with our health and well-being. Supporting our elimination channels and systems at this time is a great opportunity to refocus and get your health back on track. Since the advent of homeopathy in the 1800s, remedies have been used to clear, cleanse, drain and detoxify the various organs and systems in the body. This can be done as part of a constitutional prescription, as part of a homeopathic balancing programme or as a regular part of your annual health and well-being. Just as you turn your attention to supporting our immune system as winter approaches, throughout spring we can spend a little bit of time focusing on supporting our elimination channels. Think of a cleanse as a support programme to ensure your elimination organs and systems are working to the best of their ability. Which parts of the body need cleansing? It's helpful to know which systems are responsible for which function in our body and what to look for if they are struggling. These are the primary organs and systems which are involved in processing waste and toxins from our body: Kidneys filters the blood and makes urine through which toxins are excreted. Signs and symptoms include: dark circles under eyes; water retention; painful/urgent/frequent urination; cystitis. The Liver transforms toxic substances into non-toxic, water-soluble forms so they can be excreted. This powerhouse of an organ is vital in processing toxins that enter our digestive system so it plays an important role in the immune system. Signs and symptoms include: constipation; bad breath; sore breasts before menses; poor digestion of fats; fatigue. Our Lymphatic system transports toxic substances from cells to the filters (liver and kidneys). This system is part of our immune system as it helps to purify our blood. Signs and symptoms include: sore and puffy tissue just under the skin; chronically swollen lymph nodes; aching soft tissues. The Bowels gut wall helps protect us from harmful substances using the surrounding immune system to alert the dangers. Signs and symptoms include: constipation or diarrhoea; leaky gut where toxins flow back into the bloodstream; allergies and sensitivities; poor immune function. The Lungs and sinuses exhale toxins to the outside world. Signs and symptoms include: chronic breathing problems; asthma; bronchitis; sinusitis; chronic cough. Our Skin excretes toxins through sweat and hair follicles. Signs and symptoms include: hair loss; acne, rosacea, eczema; dry skin and rashes; body odour; and excessive and/or burning sweat. Where to start? In many cases, cleansing the kidneys and/or liver is a good place to start because these are the two main filters for the blood. The liver is where the toxins are converted into non-toxic substances which can be and excreted. The kidneys start working from the moment of our birth until to the moment of death sorting the bad stuff from our blood. That's a lot of work 24/7. So, given all they do for us, giving our kidneys some support every now and again seems like a good idea! How can Homeopathy help? Homeopathic remedies can open up and stimulate the elimination channels to help them function more efficiently, both physically and energetically. The organs and systems can do their job more effectively which will result in increased vitality and energy as our body becomes more efficient at processing and clearing toxins. Which remedies? For general support the following remedies are known to support particular organs: Kidneys - Solidago, Berberbis Vulgaris Liver Lycopodium, Hydrastis Lungs - Lobelia, Verbascum These remedies have been used for many years to support the action of each organ. The suggestions made here are for consideration as part of a spring cleanse, or as part of your self-care routine. If you are dealing with complex health issues relating to a particular organ, or you are considering a \"detox\", individualised treatment is recommended with a homeopath who can review your whole health picture and prescribe in your specific needs. Please get in touch if you would like to discuss this. Emotional cleansing Your body does not function in separate parts independently of each other; therefore, a holistic health practitioner will assess your health as an integrated whole - the body, mind and soul. Neither is your body's health separate from your emotional health. If our emotions are not recognised and released, they can be stored in the body and put strain on it so it is unable to function at its best. We often talk about the \"weight\" of emotions, imagine who good it would feel to experience a healthy flow of emotions? Emotions do not need to weigh us down. All emotions have value and meaning in our lives. However, we can often become stuck in a pattern of negative emotion which is not serving us, unable to move past it. Which emotion? Which organ? ANGER is stored in the LIVER FEAR is stored in the KIDNEYS GRIEF is stored in the LUNGS ANXIETY and WORRY are stored in the GUT and COLON If you are experiencing particularly intense feelings, it could be a sign a particular organ could benefit from some help. By supporting the associated organ, the emotion become unstuck and is able to flow out of the body just as toxins and waste matter are. Small changes can make a huge difference Making a few small changes in your day is often more sustainable than embarking on big shifts. Here are some thing you can try today that will start to make a difference to your overall health and well-being. - Start the day with a cup or hot water and lemon. - Reduce coffee, alcohol, sugar, meat and processed foods from your diet. Sometimes completely removing a food group from your diet feels a huge shift. Is there a way to reduce the intake of 1 or more of these foods groups? A good start is reducing your coffee intake by 1 per day. Or having 1 meat free day per week. - Increase your water intake throughout the day. [Here's why](https://rachaelricheshomeopathy.com/skin/hydration-matters/). - Go to bed a little earlier. Our body does most of its processing and filtering at night. If we are in deep sleep before midnight, it is easier for our body to focus on this work.
