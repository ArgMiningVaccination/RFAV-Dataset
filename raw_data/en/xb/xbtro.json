Stravitz, President Connecticut Natural Care 6 Ward Dr Danbury, CT 06810 The State of Connecticut's Department of Consumer Protection has issued draft regulations concerning the palliative use of marijuana. These regulations include significant requirements in the areas of operational policies and procedures, inventory control, patient recordkeeping, information security and patient education, among other topics. Below is information from MJ Freeway on how GramTracker and GrowTracker software meets each relevant section of regulations. Sec. 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad34. Operation of dispensary facility (a) No person may operate a dispensary facility without a dispensary facility license issued by the department. (b) A dispensary facility shall not dispense marijuana from, obtain marijuana from, or transfer marijuana to, a location outside of the state of Connecticut. (c) A dispensary facility shall not obtain, cultivate, deliver, transfer, transport, sell or dispense marijuana except: (1) It may acquire marijuana from a producer; and (2) It may dispense and sell marijuana to a qualifying patient or primary caregiver who is registered with the department pursuant to the Act and section 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad6 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. MJ Freeway's sales records, vendor records, purchase orders, transfer records and transport manifests document the source and destination of all marijuana that is dispensed from or obtained by the dispensary facility. These records are all time and date stamped and tied to an individual user to ensure accountability. MJ Freeway's GramTracker batch tracking system allows a dispensary to keep detailed records of all movements of product, ensuring the dispensary's capability to ensure that both incoming and outgoing product are associated with legally permitted sources and destinations. (d) No person at a dispensary facility shall provide marijuana samples or engage in marijuana compounding. MJ Freeway's inventory capabilities provide accuracy to the tenth of a gram, using integrated legal-\u00adfor-\u00adtrade scales.

(f) Only a dispensary may dispense marijuana, and only a dispensary or dispensary technician may sell marijuana, to qualifying patients and primary caregivers who are registered with the department pursuant to the Act and section 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad6 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies.

(n) A dispensary facility shall make publicly available the price of all marijuana products offered by the dispensary facility to prospective qualifying patients and primary caregivers. Such disclosure may include posting the information on the dispensary facility Internet web site MJ Freeway provides several methods for dispensary facilities to publicize their pricing, including through online menus and integration with locator services.

Stravitz, President Connecticut Natural Care 6 Ward Dr Danbury, CT 06810 (4) Signs and symptoms of substance abuse; and (5) Opportunities to participate in substance abuse programs. MJ Freeway provides the ability for dispensary facilities to provide patient educational information at the point of sale, and to capture a record of the date and time that such information was provided to the patient. Multiple pieces of educational material can be created and notes of which specific ones were provided can be captured in the patient purchase record. (q) All deliveries from producers shall be carried out under the direct supervision of a dispensary who shall be present to accept the delivery. Upon delivery, the marijuana shall immediately be placed in an approved safe or approved vault within the dispensary department where marijuana is stored. When purchase orders or transfers are received in MJ Freeway, the incoming product count and weight is captured.

MJ Freeway's sales records capture the date and time of each sale, the name of the dispensary making the sale, and attach that information to the patient record. This is maintained both as a log of daily sales, as well as a log of sales to the patient. (e) A dispensary may dispense a portion of a qualifying patient's one-\u00admonth supply of marijuana. The dispensary may dispense the remaining portion of the one-\u00admonth supply of marijuana at any time except that MJ Freeway sales@mjfreeway.com www.mjfreeway.com 888-\u00ad932-\u00ad6537 x2 Mr. Jonathan D.

Stravitz, President Connecticut Natural Care 6 Ward Dr Danbury, CT 06810 no qualifying patient or primary caregiver shall receive more than a one-\u00admonth supply of marijuana in a one-\u00admonth period. MJ Freeway includes safeguards to monitor the weight of medicine on a particular order and compare that to the total weight dispensed to that patient over the previous one month. If an individual sale will exceed the remaining portion for a one-\u00admonth supply, the dispensary is alerted and the sale is blocked. (g) A dispensary shall document a qualifying patient's self-\u00adassessment of the effects of marijuana in treating the qualifying patient's debilitating medical condition or the symptoms thereof. A dispensary facility shall maintain such documentation electronically for at least three years following the date the patient ceases to designate the dispensary facility and such documentation shall be made available in accordance with section 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad70 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. MJ Freeway's SymptomTracker module provides a mechanism for the dispensary to review with the patient their symptoms and self-\u00adassess the effects of marijuana on those symptoms or conditions. This self-\u00adassessment is attached to the patient record. Self-\u00adassessments can be scheduled to ensure that dispensaries are communicating with their patients about symptoms and conditions on a regular basis. Sec. 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad39. Dispensaries to assign serial number and maintain records.

(c) When a dispensary department closes temporarily or permanently, the dispensary facility shall, in the interest of public health, safety and convenience, make its complete dispensing records immediately available to a nearby dispensary facility and post a notice of this availability on the window or door of the closed dispensary facility. The dispensary facility shall simultaneously provide such notice to the commissioner. MJ Freeway sales@mjfreeway.com www.mjfreeway.com 888-\u00ad932-\u00ad6537 x2 Mr. Jonathan D.

Stravitz, President Connecticut Natural Care 6 Ward Dr Danbury, CT 06810 MJ Freeway's GramTracker currently has the ability to capture all of items outlined above. Should the state provide the framework to allow it, MJ Freeway will happily construct an integration to report all required information directly to the state database as seamlessly and conveniently as possible. Sec. 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad52. Operation of production facility (b) A producer shall not: (1) Produce or manufacture marijuana in any place except its approved production facility; (2) Sell, deliver, transport or distribute marijuana from any place except its approved production facility; (3) Produce or manufacture marijuana for use outside of Connecticut; (4) Sell, deliver, transport or distribute marijuana to any place except a dispensary facility located in Connecticut; MJ Freeway's sales records, vendor records, purchase orders, transfer records and transport manifests document the source and destination of all marijuana that is dispensed from or obtained by the dispensary facility. These records are all time and date stamped and tied to an individual user to ensure accountability. Sec. 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad53. Minimum requirements for the storage and handling of marijuana by producers (c)(4) Document the chain of custody of all marijuana and marijuana products. MJ Freeway's seed-\u00adto-\u00adsale data management capabilities are specifically designed to capture the chain of custody of all marijuana products from creation of the plant, through cultivation, harvesting, processing, distribution, inventory and sale. (d)(1) Handling mandatory and voluntary recalls of marijuana products. Such process shall be adequate to deal with recalls due to any action initiated at the request of the commissioner and any voluntary action by the producer to remove defective or potentially defective marijuana products from the market or any action undertaken to promote public health and safety by replacing existing marijuana products with improved products or packaging; MJ Freeway's batch tracking information ties any finished product, all the way back to the original plant in came from. In addition, all sales of product from that batch can be identified. In the case of a product recall, simply reporting on the batch ID of the defective product would enable the dispensary facility to remove all product from that batch from their inventory and to contact all patients who purchased product from that batch.

This procedure shall provide for written documentation of the marijuana disposition; MJ Freeway captures destruction of marijuana by recording an inventory adjustment, requiring that the reason code for the adjustment be entered to indicate destruction, giving the ability to enter a note with further information, and providing a time and date stamp, as well as identification of who entered the record. The destroyed product shows as a unique entry on inventory reports, enabling future reporting on destroyed product. Sec. 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad54. Producer record keeping Producers shall keep records of all marijuana produced or manufactured and of all marijuana disposed of by them. Such records shall be maintained and made available in accordance with section 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad70 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies and, in each case shall show: (1) The brand name, kind and quantity of marijuana involved; (2) The date of such production or removal from production; (3) A record of all marijuana sold, transported or otherwise disposed of; (4) The date and time of selling, transporting or disposing of the marijuana; (5) The name and address of the dispensary facility to which the marijuana was sold; (6) The name of the dispensary who took custody of the marijuana; and (7) The name of the production facility employee responsible for transporting the marijuana. MJ Freeway's GrowTracker allows for detailed records of plant production, from seed to shipment, tracking strain/brand, harvest date and ingredients. Once harvested, useable product, useable byproduct, and waste can be tracked, and dealt with, independently. With static historical data and the Transport Manifest, chain of custody becomes traceable and unchangeable. MJ Freeway software serves as a thorough database of current and historic inventory and transactional data. The software features a suite of prepared reports, and its robust reporting engine allows dispensary ownership to produce custom reports as required. Should the state create its own custom form, we will strive to build it and incorporate it into the system. Sec. 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad56. Packaging and labeling by producer (c) A producer shall label each marijuana product prior to sale to a dispensary and shall securely affix to the package a label that states in legible English: (1) The name and address of the producer; MJ Freeway sales@mjfreeway.com www.mjfreeway.com 888-\u00ad932-\u00ad6537 x2 Mr. President, Connecticut Natural Care (203) 702-\u00ad4465 andy@inaturalcare.com Page 11 of 17 Mr. Jonathan D.

(8) A pass or fail rating based on the laboratory's microbiological, mycotoxins, heavy metals and chemical residue analysis; and (9) Such other information necessary to comply with state of Connecticut labeling requirements for similar products not containing marijuana, including but not limited to the Connecticut Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, Connecticut General Statutes, sections 21a-\u00ad91 to 21a-\u00ad120, inclusive, and Connecticut General Statutes, sections 21a-\u00ad151 to 21a-\u00ad159, inclusive, regarding bakeries and food manufacturing establishments. (d) A producer shall not label marijuana products as \"organic\" unless the marijuana plants have been organically grown as defined in section 21a-\u00ad92 of the Connecticut General Statutes and the marijuana products have been produced, processed, manufactured and certified to be consistent with organic standards in compliance with section 21a-\u00ad92a of the Connecticut General Statutes. MJ Freeway captures all of the data outlined above and will meet any production labeling requirements specified by Connecticut. Any specific label formatting or disclaimers required by the Department of Consumer Protection will be adhered to. After harvest, the production facility will be able to track the conversion of finished flower to discrete, uniquely label, sellable packages. MJ Freeway creates both inventory labels, which are applied to the product at the production facility, prior to sale, and patient labels, which include required patient information and are applied at the point of sale. MJ Freeway's current batch tracking and test result logging structure already allows discrete packages of inventory to carry unique details including expiration dates and cannabinoid profiles.

The laboratory shall test each sample for microbiological contaminants, mycotoxins, heavy metals and pesticide chemical residue, and for purposes of conducting an active ingredient analysis. (c) From the time that a batch of marijuana has been homogenized for sample testing and eventual packaging and sale to a dispensary facility, until the laboratory provides the results from its tests and analysis, the producer shall segregate and withhold from use the entire batch of marijuana, except the samples that have been removed by the laboratory for testing. During this period of segregation, the producer shall maintain the marijuana batch in a secure, cool and dry location so as to prevent the marijuana from becoming ontaminated or losing its efficacy. Under no circumstances shall a producer include marijuana in a marijuana product or sell it to a dispensary facility prior to the time that the laboratory has completed its testing and analysis and provided those results, in writing, to the producer or other designated production facility employee. Test Specification Alfatoxin B1 <20 uG/KG of A <20 uG/KG of Substance (3) For purposes of the heavy metal test, a marijuana sample shall be deemed to have passed if it meets the following standards: Metal Natural Health Products Acceptable limits uG/KG BW/Day Arsenic <0.14 Cadmium <0.09 Lead <0.29 Mercury <0.29 (4) For purposes of the pesticide chemical residue test, a marijuana sample shall be deemed to have passed if it satisfies the most stringent acceptable standard for a pesticide chemical residue in any food item as set forth in Subpart C of the federal Environmental Protection Agency's regulations for Tolerances and Exemptions for Pesticide Chemical Residues in Food, 40 CFR 180. (f) If a sample of marijuana passes the microbiological, mycotoxin, heavy metal and pesticide chemical residue test, the laboratory shall release the entire batch for immediate manufacturing, packaging and labeling for sale to a dispensary facility. (g) The laboratory shall file with the department an electronic copy of each laboratory test result for any batch that does not pass the microbiological, mycotoxin, heavy metal or pesticide chemical residue test, MJ Freeway sales@mjfreeway.com www.mjfreeway.com 888-\u00ad932-\u00ad6537 x2 Mr. Jonathan D.

(h) A producer shall provide to a dispensary facility the laboratory test results for each batch of marijuana used in a product purchased by the dispensary facility. Each dispensary facility shall have such laboratory results available upon request to qualifying patients, primary caregivers and physicians who have certified qualifying patients. MJ Freeway's batch tracking and inventory location functionality supports the requirements above for product control prior to the completion of testing. Finished product that is not yet tested can easily be maintained as separate inventory from that which is already tested and available for packaging or further processing. Laboratory results can be attached to product entries once they have been sent to the producer. MJ Freeway's GramTracker test results module allows a dispensary to attach test data to individual batches within the dispensary's inventory, ensuring that each unit of inventory can be correctly assigned a necessary test profile. Sec. 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad59. Brand name (a) A producer shall assign a brand name to each marijuana product. A producer shall register each brand name with the department, on a form prescribed by the commissioner, prior to any sale to a dispensary facility and shall associate each brand name with a specific laboratory test that includes a terpenes profile and a list of all active ingredients, including: (1) Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); (2) (4) Cannabidiolic acid (CBDA); and (5) Any other active ingredient that constitutes at least 1% of the marijuana batch used in the product. (b) A producer shall not label two marijuana products with the same brand name unless the laboratory test results for each product indicate that they contain the same level of each active ingredient listed within subsection (a)(1) to (4), inclusive, of this section within a range of 97% to 103%. (c) The department shall not register any brand name that: (1) Is identical to, or confusingly similar to, the name of an existing non-\u00admarijuana product; (2) Is identical to, or confusingly similar to, the name of an unlawful product or substance; (3) Is confusingly similar to the name of a previously approved marijuana product brand name; MJ Freeway sales@mjfreeway.com www.mjfreeway.com 888-\u00ad932-\u00ad6537 x2 President, Connecticut Natural Care (203) 702-\u00ad4465 andy@inaturalcare.com Page 14 of 17 Mr. Jonathan D.

RFA C4 Accessibility Accessibility beyond ADA Requirements CTNC plans for its facility to be easily accessible by all people. We embrace the \"Universal Design\" concept that strives to make spaces and activities accessible to all people and not to create separate facilities or accommodations for people with disabilities. The Universal Design concept ensures equal access to all, yet doesn't create \"eyesores\" like special handicapped accessible ramps that detract from the natural beauty of the design. Instead, form and function become united. An example is provided below (from www.universaldesign.com ): Although we realize redesigning our entire facility is not feasible, we will do our best to meet universal design go als when we upgrade, expand or add new features. In our initial construction we will offer many accessibility features beyond what the ADA requires. We worked with Disabilities Protection and Advocacy in Hartford, CT and the New England ADA Center in Boston, MA to find out common requests for improvements for people with disabilities. We will incorporate the following features in response to the feedback we received : 36-inch doors in all areas with patient traffic Automatic opening doors where allowable Available wheelchair AED Unit Large format monitors and posted collateral Open Floorplan Wheelchair height counters and tables Wide Hallways RFA C4 Accessibility beyond ADA Requirements Rather than having \"turning zones\" at the end of a hallway or designated areas for wheelchairs, we have incorpor ated simple universal design so that all areas, including right inside a door jamb, are accessible and maneuverable for people of all abilities. We believe this fosters an inclusive culture and doesn't stigmatize our patients for their disabilities. RFA C5 Air Quality Equipment - Odor Reduction RFA C5 Air Quality Equipment - Odor Reduction CTNC is a Dispensary Facility. Odor control is of little concern because the products are stored in air- tight containers from the Producers and are locked inside a zero -air-flow safe (fire -rated, 2hrs) until dispensed. The only time a package can actually be opened on the premises is by request from a patient who is unable to open child -proof containers due to his or her disability. However, air quality is a concern of CTNC. We will be serving patients with compromised health and we will ensure that our air quality is superb so as not to exacerbate our patients' conditions. To this end we will install a HEPA filter on the main branch of our HVAC influent line. In order to facilitate odor reduction (if odors are present), the HEPA filter will be paired with an activated charcoal filter. The HVAC effluent will also be filtered by a HEPA filter so that all air is cleaned on the way into the system and on the way out to the space. We will also place ionizing air filters in areas where patients may gather, such as the waiting area, to provide additional air handling and scrubbing. RFA C6 Marijuana Product Delivery 1.

FOIA 1 -210 (B)(20) Standards and Procedures, Entire Document is Exempt RFA C8 Process Controls to Prevent Diversion1 CTNC's entire business operation workflow is built around product and process control. Our policies and procedures are designed to prevent leakage and diversion and to aid in detection and prosecution when prevention fails. The CTNC Facility Security Program is an extremely important pillar of our business. Paramount to our success is a safe environment in which to serve our patients. Our patients come to CTNC because we exemplify not only quality of service and product, but also because they feel safe shopping with us. Our Facility Security Program has been specifically designed for CTNC and our intended business operations. Our program is application -specific to the business of dispensing cannabis and is designed to support that endeavor fully while keeping our employees and patients as safe from harm as humanly possible and was devised by two career law enforcement officers with a combined 62 years' experience in operational security. This control is ach ieved primarily by two means: Rigid workflow controls with incremental data entry o Each transaction is tracked step -by-step and logs each person's activities o Only the Dispensary has access to product storage o Only the Dispensary picks cannabis orders MJ Free way Software Platform o \"Seed to Sale Tracking\" Our policies and procedures explain complete details of our diversion prevention program.

FOIA 1 -210 (5)(B)(A) and (B)(20) Trade Secrets, Standards and Procedures, Entire Document is Exempt RFA D1 Marketing Plan1 CTNC has prepared a thorough Marketing Plan designed to advance our position in this emerging market. Below is the truncated Marketing Plan. Please see Appendix G for the complete document including the Company's marketing philosophy, etc . 1) THE MARKETING PLAN a) Company Marketing Objectives i) Promote our Dispensary Facility ii) License our intellectual property to Producers and Dispensary Facilities in Connecticut iii) Provide effective outreach to physicians and patients iv) Expand our market presence in Connecticut with additional sites or expansion of our primary site v) Expand IP licensing to other markets b) Market Analysis i) Our proposed market is growing slowly due to an absence of legal producers and dispensaries. Therefore, we are unable to accurately project the patient base. Through our contact with many patients and prospective patients we understand that many people wil l not register with the program until there is a legal supply. We believe many more patients will register with the advent of state licensed producers, dispensaries and the addition of more qualifying diseases are added, i.e. chronic pain. CTNC will only t arget customers who are qualifying adults 18 and older who suffer from debilitating medical conditions that are deemed suitable for treatment using medical cannabis. The most recent program analysis, from October, 2013 reveals there are over 1200 patients registered to use medical cannabis although patients won 't be able to buy it legally until 2014. The average patient age is 42.8 with approximately a three to one male to female ratio CTNC estimates that at market maturity there will be between 22,000 a nd 44,000 registered medical cannabis patients in Connecticut under the current regulations. c) Target Market Segmentation i) CTNC has recognized two key patient segments to which the company will cater: (1) Adults who have experience with cannabis and (2) Adults with no history of cannabis use (3) Both segments are looking for an effective natural alternative to man -made palliative treatments (a) We can further classify these two segments as either: (i) \"Health -Conscious \" 1. Health -conscious patients are concerned with palliating their symptoms and are not bothered about any social stigma associated with cannabis use RFA D1 Marketing Plan 1. FOIA 1 -210 (5)(B)(A) and (B)(20) Trade Secrets, Standards and Procedures, Entire Document is Exempt (ii) \"Image -Conscious\" 1. Image -conscious patients are more concerned about their social or professional image and negative impacts of being labeled a \"marijuana user\" (iii) Both segments have different preferred modes of treatment. 1. Health -conscious patients are primarily concerned with what best palliates their symptoms, and will rely on experience and their physicians' recommendations for choosing an appropriate treatment method 2. Image -conscious patients are primarily concerned with their privacy and concealing their use of marijuana 3. Both patient types will discuss medical cannabis treatments with their physician, but the image -conscious patient i s likely to choose a more \"unassuming\" type of treatment, such as sublingual drops or transdermal patches Both patient types are ultimately seeking the same benefit from our products but exhibit two widely disparate value proposi tions upon which CTNC may capitalize. d) Products and Services Offered i) Products (1) CTNC will offer raw cannabis flowers as well as other products such as balms, salves, tinctures, oils, concentrates, transdermal patches, foodstuffs, orally ingestible caplets and sublingual drops provided by CT Producers . (a) CTNC will offer for sale a wide variety of Producer brands (b) We will engage the Producers that produce the highest quality products that are suitable for marketing as \"Natural Rx Care\" products (c) Producers will produ ce, package and label Natural Rx Care Products according to licensing arrangements (d) We will classify all Producer products for the Natural Rx Care System, regardless of Original Manufacturer (i) Products will be grouped into \"color families\" representing the Na tural Rx Care System (2) We will offer a complete line of paraphernalia and accessory equipment for the purpose of marijuana application (a) Rose Professional Services has ongoing relationships with OEM manufacturers of the finest marijuana application equipment available on the market today (b) CTNC will be able to offer wholesale pricing at our retail point of presence (i) E.g., \"Pax\" vaporizer 1. US retail price $250.00 2. RPS price from OEM, $50.00 (3) The Natural Rx Care System (a) CTNC's Natural Rx Care System is a unique and re volutionary medical cannabis rating system RFA D1 Marketing Plan 1. FOIA 1 -210 (5)(B)(A) and (B)(20) Trade Secrets, Standards and Procedures, Entire Document is Exempt (b) The \"Natural Rx Care \" Cannabinoid Profiling System was developed through the data derived from the Company's eighteen month pilot study examining the effects of certain cannabinoid combinations on a typical patient. We examined several years of data drawn from medical marijuan a rating and feedback websites. Each individual patient's responses about the effectiveness of any particular product were analyzed by creating groups of patients that had used the exact same product from a particular dispensary with public laboratory tes t reports available for that product. We correlated the patients' self -reported (PSR) effects to the cannabinoid profile of the medicine they used. By analyzing hundreds and hundreds of PSRs and their correlations to certain cannabinoid profiles we were able to develop an algorithm (CS3) to effectively express this correlation though the \"Natural Rx Care\" System. This system allows patients and doctors to know what cannabinoid profiles have been highly correlated with PSR data on treatment for specific s ymptomology (c) The \"Natural Rx Care\" number identifies the appropriate, medically purposeful product for the patient and the patient's physician. This helps patients and doctors choose the medicine that works best for the presenting diagnosis and symptom set. The laboratory report that comes with each package shows the complete testing report as well as a simplified explanation of its meaning (the \"Natural Rx Care\" System/Guide) (i) The \"Cannabinoid Simplified Scoring a proprietary algorithm that expresses each product's medically purposeful use based on its cannabinoid profile generated from the laboratory test report (ii) The cannabinoid profile is analyzed statistically for various ratios of active ingredients which determine the overall effect on the patient. Those results as processed by the CS3 algorithm yield a categorical assignment of a \"Natural Rx Care\" number 1 through 4 where each number represents a formulation known to produce typical effects in patients (e.g. appetite stimulant, anti -inflammatory, sleep aid, pain reducer, antiemetic, anticonvulsive, anxiolytic, etc) (d) The Natural RX Care System drives value with the combination of: 1. a variety of high quality products, 2. products that are safe, fresh and viable, 3. products that provide cons istent treatment (4) Natural Rx Care Packaging and Labeling (a) CTNC will make available through licensing its exclusive packaging and labeling system (b) CTNC has developed a novel packaging system to ensure that CTNC -branded products remain fresh, viable and contam inant free. Our \"Natural Rx Care\" packaging system was developed by our clinical science staff, led by our Consultant and select Advisors, to provide many benefits to us and to our customers. The simple color- coded system allows the patient to choose pro per medicines for his or her symptoms. Products from the same color family (i.e. the same \"Natural Rx RFA D1 Marketing Plan 1. FOIA 1 -210 (5)(B)(A) and (B)(20) Trade Secrets, Standards and Procedures, Entire Document is Exempt Care\" number) share common ratios of active ingredients and produce very similar results. Once the patient decides on the proper color family for the pr esenting symptoms, he or she then has numerous choices of strain and formulation to suit individual preferences. (i) The \"Natural Rx Care\" packaging has many features incorporated that we believe enhance the safety and security of the product. The \"Natural Rx Care\" Bottle is made with a hard to duplicate process and utilizes special inks for coloring, making it difficult to counterfeit (ii) As required by DCP regulations, our packaging will feature a child -resistant reversible cap, under a shrink -wrap tamper evid ent band and conforms fully to the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 (PPPA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1471 -1476 and FDA regulations for Special Packaging. Each unit will be color coded for the cannabinoid profile of the product it contains and we have the bottl es manufactured with a special high -barrier BPA -free resin in solid, fully opaque colors to protect the product from damage caused by visible light (iii) Additionally, our packaging will be made with a special soft plastic that cannot be shattered like a traditional hard plastic pill bottle which may have a child resistant cap that can be bypassed by simply crushing and shattering the bottle underfoot with less than 25 pounds of pressure. (iv) We have engaged Do Well Plastics Company, a custom plastics injection mold firm, to produce our custom packaging. The specifications are complete, proofs have been received and the first production run should be scheduled upon the granting of a license to dispense medical cannabis. Lead time for delivery should be approximate ly three weeks for the first delivery and subsequent deliveries should be immediate upon order (v) Packaging for Producers shall bear their production labels according to DCP regulations as well as their brand labeling which takes the fore on the package (vi) Product Images 1. Custom branded for \"Integrated Natural Care\" Production company RFA D1 Marketing Plan 1. FOIA 1 -210 (5)(B)(A) and (B)(20) Trade Secrets, Standards and Procedures, Entire Document is Exempt (c) Natural Rx Care Packaging System Benefits (i) The \"Natural Rx Care\" Bottle offers superior physical product protection. It will be tough and should be able to withstand all forms of abuse that may occur during handling including crushing, dropping, losing its seal, moisture, submersion, and extreme temperature variation. It should offer superior barrier protection and will be sealed under ideal sterile conditions so that it w ill be nearly free of oxygen and water vapor as well as common adulterants and contaminants. (ii) The \"Natural Rx Care\" Bottle will be printed with information that communicates to the patient how to use, store and recycle the packaging. Our labeling and graphics will be applied to the package to include critical RFA D1 Marketing Plan 1. FOIA 1 -210 (5)(B)(A) and (B)(20) Trade Secrets, Standards and Procedures, Entire Document is Exempt information about active ingredients in the particular product which encourages doctors to prescribe, and patients to use, medically purposeful products (i.e. the correct Cannabinoid Profile). (iii) The \"Natu ral Rx Care\" Bottle will be typically packed with either one eighth ounce or one quarter ounce of product and is re -sealable, so it will be convenient and right -sized for the patient conscious of dose control and possession limits. (iv) The \"Natural Rx Care\" Bo ttle will enhance product security by reducing the risk of leakage and illicit trade during all phases post -packaging because every individual package is trackable and traceable as well as extremely difficult to counterfeit. (v) The \"Natural Rx Care\" Bottle will feature a reversible child resistant cap for patients that have trouble opening this type of container and who don't have children in their homes who need protection from the product. The reverse of the cap will be threaded to mate with the bottle neck threads. (vi) The \"Natural Rx Care\" Bottle's simple color- coding scheme allows patients to quickly and effectively make medication choices based on in -stock content by ordering any product from their preferred color family. This promotes brand loyalty as well - \"I use Natural Care number one. What do you have in green today?\" (vii) The \"Natural Rx Care\" Bottle will be the standard of excellence in medical cannabis packaging and will clearly transmit the important message that the product is safe and by virtue of individual lab reports, \"is what it says it is .\" ii) Services (1) Our key value driver is the personal, knowledgeable and friendly service of our experienced Dispensary, Rick King, a CT licensed pharmacist in good standing for over three decades . He has studied cannabis based treatments for the past several years with industry -leading figures from Connecticut, California and Colorado. He has received personal tutelage in all phases of cannabis production, processing and dispensing from some of the best talent in the country (2) Our well- educated and trained dispensary technicians and staff will provide technical information and training on all of our patient -centric products and services (a) Medicinal formulations (b) Delivery methods (c) Equipment training (3) CTNC will offer a broad spectrum of patient services through our dispensary facility (a) Wellness management (b) Educational services (c) Patient support services (i) In-home consultations and follow -up visits from our Dispensary as is practical (d) Physician support services (e) Caregiver support services RFA D1 Marketing Plan 1.

Economically disadvantaged 2. Seniors 3. Veterans 4. Hospice e) Market Communications and Messaging i) Market -based Branding and Advertising CT Natu ral Care's marketing activities will be targeted at building our dispensary brand, while our advertising activities will be targeted at generating near- term sales. We believe positive promotional activity will help to significantly drive revenue. We int end to allocate resources to establish our brand through internet partnerships with firms whose websites appeal to our target buyers. We believe these potential buyers are active users of the internet and, accordingly, the vast majority of the dispensary' s brand marketing efforts will be targeted at online audiences. We intend to partner with several complementary websites which will display online banner advertising that publicizes the Company and its retail products, services and promotions. The Comp any's extensive market research clearly indicates that tightly targeted internet promotion is the most socially accepted form of marketing for cannabis products. In the present economy many successful companies build strategic alliances in order to furth er their corporate business goals through synergistic endeavors. The Connecticut Cannabis Business Alliance is a professional trade association comprised of patient advocates, industry leaders and service providers. Our Consultant is a \"Founding Father\" of the CCBA and the Company sits on its Board of Directors. Our Dispensary is a member of the Connecticut Pharmacists Association. We believe that Mr. King's partnership with the CPA affords us increased visibility, creates and sustains fair and ethical role models in the dispensary industry, provides recognition via community visibility and promotion, keeps the Company informed of important, ever -changing issues, trends and legislatio n within our marketplace and allows us to focus our finite resources on our core competencies, thereby fostering a sustainable competitive advantage. CPA membership also projects a positive image to our targeted patients and is a primary conduit providin g labor to our industry. ii) Reaching Patients (1) According to a study by The Partnership at DrugFree.org released on July 16, 2013 \"while most Americans seem willing to accept legalized marijuana under specific circumstances, they are nearly united in opposing its marketing.\" Additionally, out of RFA D1 Marketing Plan 1. FOIA 1 -210 (5)(B)(A) and (B)(20) Trade Secrets, Standards and Procedures, Entire Document is Exempt the 1,603 American adults surveyed \"Twenty -one percent...were willing to live with marijuana advertising if it's online, and 17 percent were OK with it appearing inside of retail stores. But those numbers fell through t he floor when it came to any media likely to be seen by children.\" (AdWeek, 2013) CTNC has adopted a Through The Line (TTL) marketing strategy that uses primarily Below The Line (BTL) tactics and some sparing Above The Line (ATL) activity to reach our selected audience and which will never target children or teenagers. Targeted Digital Communications and BTL marketing strategies will be used to communicate our brand exclusively to an adult audience. BTL activities are highly measurable, and will allow deeper understanding of our Return -On-Investment for this form of marketing. Below The Line (BTL) activities will promote our brand and reach our target audience through direct channels of communication based on patients' expressed needs and preferences. This approach reduces widespread marketing \"clutter\" which could otherwise diminish the impact of our commercial messages, and could potentially be viewed by minors. o BTL campaigns will be our primary vehicle to drive individual responses regarding the Company' s brand and to establish and reinforce one -to-one relationships between the Company and the consumer. o Pamphlets, handbills, stickers, promotions, pre -printed inserts, brochures placed at the point of sale and other \"leave behind\" literature will be crafted and tailored for distribution in hospitals, hospices, and physician's offices. o Other BTL promotion activities will include public relations and on -site educational awareness programs, direct mail campaigns, and quarterly email campaigns to targeted client s and synergistic businesses. Above The Line (ATL) strategies will also be implemented in small measures and are designed to reach as large a consumer audience as possible. o ATL activities will include television spots, radio spots, print ads and internet campaigns strategically positioned on venues designed for \"18 and over\" access and followership which can significantly increase awareness of our company and our products while strictly avoiding unintentional marketing to minors. (2) The Company's web presenc e will drive our audience to submit information requests, and it will be very useful for lead generation and research for potential clients. When we commence operations we intend to strengthen our web presence with the addition of product images, testimoni al videos, audios and letters along with product and pricing updates from our integrated point of sale system which is capable of direct -to-web publishing of this data, as is our potency testing workstation. Planned enhancements and upgrades will include, but not be limited to: information regarding health conditions, help for new patients, medical reports, clinical studies, RFA D1 Marketing Plan 1. FOIA 1 -210 (5)(B)(A) and (B)(20) Trade Secrets, Standards and Procedures, Entire Document is Exempt reports on clinical trials, lists of reputable doctors, institutions and other organizations, guides to safe usage and dosage, guides for choosing the correct \"Natural Rx Care\" number, explanation of legal rights for CT patients, information about treatable illnesses, caregiver information, an \"Ask An Expert\" Q&A forum and other features deemed to be necessary or appropriate. (3) Promotional activities will be part of our advertising strategy designed to stimulate near -term revenue and increase our immediate visibility. We will offer special introductory pricing and other typical special offers to attract and reward our customer base. We believe positive promotional activity will help CTNC to significantly drive revenue. The Company expects to offer special pricing for quantity purchases and \"bundle specials\" to increase our sales.

RPS has no management authority or control and has no ownership in the Company. If the Company is successful in being awarded a license from the State to dispense medical marijuana, RPS shall be paid the sum of $ 90,000 for its completed work which shall not exceed 10 00 hours in total. From May 1, 20 11 unt il November 15, 2013 RPS has and will provide consulting services to the Company. General Consulting Services provided by RPS include, but are not limited to: o ffice setup including phone, fax and mail, all business filings and meetings, coordinating the RFA response, drafting CTNC policies and procedures, performing policy audits to ensure compliance to all applicable laws and regulations, representing the Company at publi c hearings, negotiating on the C ompany's behalf, selecting and retaining Advisors, e tc. After the granting of a license to CTNC, the Company will begin to make payments to RPS according to the following schedule: $7,500 per month for 12 months Payments will begin the first month that the Company's net income exceeds $10,000 and shall cont inue monthly until paid in full No interest will be charged so long as 12 consecutive monthly payments have been received Failure to make 12 consecutive p ayments triggers a penalty of 2 % of the value of each payment missed The Company has engaged in only one other significant financial deal, our lease. CTNC has agreed to lease terms for 497 Watertown Ave, Waterbury, CT with the Frank Devino Limited Partnership (\"FDLP\"), landlord. The lease has been signed by both parties, contingent upon two factors: CTN C receives a license to dispense medical marijuana; and CTNC receives municipal approval to operate at the above address. Should either contingency test be failed, the lease is void. CTNC paid no monies to FDLP and will not unless both contingency tests are passed, resulting in a clear path to operations. CTNC has also agreed, upon passing both trigger tests outlined above, to retain Rick King as our Dispensary Facility Manager. Mr. King shall be moved to full- time, exempt (salaried) , regular employment on the first day CTNC opens for business at the compensation rate of $120,000 salary plus full benefits (total compensation = salary + (salary).30, or $156,000 total compensation).

We are funded solely by Jonathan Stravitz and need no other source of capital or credit at present. Mr. Stravitz has used his personal funds to start the Company ($5,00 0 initial petty cash) and is prepared to offer the requisite funds to achieve operational stability. CTNC expects major expenditures as follows: Initial construction and remodeling - $75,000 Security system - $20,000 Product safe - $8,000 We anticipate up to an additional $50,000 for aggregate small expenses leading up to commencement of operations. Presently we expect that Mr. Stravitz will fund all of our capital requirements. Our plan is to fund CTNC 's launch ourselves and once we have secured a license finding willing creditors should not be difficult and we could raise additional funds as needed.

Services requested in connection with other tax matters will be invoiced separately on a time basis. Audit Objectives The objective of our audit is the expr ession of an opinion about whether your financial statements are fairly presented, in all material respects, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We will conduct the audit in accordanc e with auditing st andards generally accepted in the United States of Americ a established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (\"AICPA) a nd will include tests of your accounting records and other procedures we consider necessary to enable us to express such an opinion. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the finan cial statements based on our audit, and is limited to the period covered by our audit. If, for any reason, our opinion is other than unqualified, we w ill fully discuss the reasons with you in advance. If, for any reason, we are unable to complete the audit or are unable to form or have not formed an opinion, we may decline to express an opinion or to issue a report as a result of this engagement. If circumstances occur related to the condition of your re cords, the availability of sufficient, appropriate audit evidence, or the existence of a significant risk of material misstatement of the financial statements caused by error, fraudulent financial reporting, or misappropriation of assets, which in our professional judgment prevent us from completing the audit or forming an opinion on the financial statements, we retain the right to take any course of action permitted by professional standards, including declining to express an opinion or issue a report, or withdrawing from the engagement. Jonathan D. Stravitz Connecticut Natural Care, LLC November 7, 2013 Page 2 Audit Procedures Our procedures will include tests of documentary evidence supporting the transactions recorded in the accounts, di rect confirmation of cash, receivables and certain other assets and liabilities by correspondence with selected customers, creditors, and financial instit utions. We will also request written representations from your attorneys as part of the engagement and they may bill you for responding to this inquiry.

An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements; therefore, our audit will involve judgment about the number of transactions to be examined and the areas to be tested. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error, fraudulent financial reporting, misappropriation of assets, or violations of laws, governmental regulations or contractual agreements.

Also, an audit is not designed to detect error, fraud, or violat ions of laws or governmental regulations that is immaterial to the financial statem ents. However, we will inform you of any material errors that come to our attention, and we will inform the appropriate level of management of any fraudulent financial reporting or misappropriation of assets that comes to our att ention. We will also inform you of any violations of laws or governmental regulations that come to our attention, unless clearly inconsequential.

The commencement of fieldwor k during December 2014 is predicated on the availability of your key personnel and the receipt of information in accordance with the attached schedule. Fa ilure to comply with this requirement will likely result in a delay in the completion of the engagement and an increase in the cost of the engagement due to the need to re-assign staff. Other factors exist which can also cause an unanticipated increase in the cost of your audit. Those factors include, but are not limited to, the following: The discovery of numerous accounting errors in the books and records or the incorrect application of an accounting principle will most likely result in the need for us to perform additional work. The application of a new accounti ng principle or the change from one generally accepted accounting princi ple to another generally accepted accounting principle. The need to consult with attorneys or other professionals on audit matters including litigation and changes in your business environment. Professional standards require that we report illegal acts that have or may have incurred.

In such an instance, additional fees, including legal fees will be billed to the Company. The Company agrees to cooperate fully with any procedures that we deem necessary to perform. A request by you for additional services not contemplated in this letter. Should any of these factors arise, we will discuss them with you and the anticipated effect on the engagement fee.

RFA F2 Compassionate Needs Program RFA F2 Compassionate Needs Program CTNC offers a Compassionate Needs Discount Program (\"CNDP\") to all patients who fall at or below 150% of the federal poverty limit, currently defined as $23,550 for a family of four (Federal Register, 2013) to help defray the costs of their medicine because it is not covered by third party payers. Excerpted from \"CTNC Compassionate Needs Discount Program,\" BUS -0004 -A: 1. OVERVIEW The CNDP discount will be applied as a sliding scale from 10% -30%, depending on income level. For example: A patient from a family of four with a household income below $23,550 would receive a 30% discount on medicine. Whereas, a patient from a family of four earning $ 28,000 would receive a 20% discount on medicine. A patient from a family of four with a household income of up to $35,325 would receive a 10% discount on medicine. We will also offer a similar discount for one -time purchases of durable goods and equipment to help patients use their medicine properly and effectively. CTNC is a member of the Connecticut Cannabis Business Alliance and through our participation there and in various events and forums around Connecticut we have established relationships with prospective producers in regard to comp assionate needs discounts. It is uncertain which firms will be granted a license to produce. However, for example, CTNC has agreements in place with Integrated Natural Care and Advanced Grow Labs, both of which have agreed to the above discount schedule. Should other firms ultimately realize licensure, we believe that this schedule will be amenable to them and we will use our bargaining power insofar as we may to influence producers' participation rates in our discount program. In addition to seeking par ticipation from potential producers, CTNC has created a dedicated carve -out in our budget for our Compassionate Needs Discount Program. We will directly subsidize up to $1000 of patient costs per month in our first year of operation and will continue to p rovide and expand funds for this purpose as allowed by our income in the future. 2. COVERAGE The CNDP covers all patients who are CTNC dispensary customers and who earn less than 150% of the federal poverty limit as adjusted for family size/dependents. 3. RESPONSIBILITIES All CTNC employees must be aware of the CNDP and be able to discuss it effectively with patients. All patients who intend to use the CNDP must provide tax returns for the most recent year available to certify their need for a discount sche dule. If tax returns are not available CTNC may accept other RFA F2 Compassionate Needs Program documentation at the sole discretion of the Dispensary Facility Manager. All CNDP determinations are final. 4.

FOIA Procedures, Processes, Entire Document Exempt F3 Research Plan1 The \"Natural Rx Care \" Cannabinoid Profiling System was developed through the data derived from the Company's eighteen month pilot study examining the effects of certain cannabinoid combinations on a typical patient. We examined several years of data drawn from medical marijuana rating and feedback websites. Each individual patient's responses about the effectiveness of any particular product were analyzed by creating groups of patients that had used the exact same pro duct from a particular dispensary with public potency test reports available for that product. We correlated the patients' self reported (PSR) effects to the cannabinoid profile of the medicine they used. By analyzing hundreds and hundreds of PSRs and th eir correlations to certain cannabinoid profiles we were able to develop an algorithm (CS3) to effectively express this correlation though the \"Natural Rx Care\" System. This system allows patients and doctors to know what cannabinoid profiles have been highly correlated with PSR data on treatment for specific symptomology. The Natural Rx Care system is essentially a histogram analysis of PSR data as it relates to discrete cannabinoid profiles. We hope to use the data generated by our information systems and patients to follow up our pilot study with a peer- reviewed pivotal study. During the past year or more our Dispensary has developed relationships with academic institutions during the course of public speaking engagements and lectures. Recently, he de livered a lecture to the University of St. Joseph School of Pharmacy entitled \"Medical Marijuana from a Pharmacist's Perspective,\" which was very well received and spurred interest in the MMP from pharmacy students. We intend to approach USJ to help perfor m the pivotal study to confirm our pilot study results. The study will be conducted to assess the patient reported effects of certain cannabinoid profiles. CTNC will use targeted surveys to gain feedback from patients after they use certain medications. We will incentivize patient participation by offering small discounts on future purchases in exchange for filling out and returning the survey cards. We would engage our academic partner to design the study and CTNC will implement the research. Our study, depending on participation, could last up to a year or more. Once we have determined the results of the study we will use the data to make improvements to the CS3 algorithm and the Natural Rx Care System. RFA F4 Community Benefits Plan RFA F4 Community Benefits Plan As a small startup company, CTNC realizes that providing impactful community service is challenging, but possible. Some community benefits we intend to offer include: Educationa l seminars about medical marijuana o Schools o Colleges o Libraries o Public events o Health facilities o Hospice o Cancer centers o Senior citiz en centers Partnering with local charities o CTNC will have a small budget, so we intend to donate funds to charities who support our mission and can achieve more impactful results Example : Easter Seals Nonprofit Nonreligious Helps people with disabilities RFA F5 Substance Abuse Program 1. FOIA 1 -210 (B)(20) Standards, Processes, Procedures, HR Manual Content Exempt RFA F5 Substance Abuse Program For the Public at Large CTNC understands that the public at large may require services and education to combat substance abuse. We intend to offer the same 24/7 hotline to our customers. Patients may call the number at any time to be offered guidance and assistance to help with pro blems that may seem momentarily overwhelming. Our Dispensary intends to continue to offer public lectures and speaking engagements for the general public or as requested by entities or venues. We believe that education is the key to avoiding substance abuse. Our Dispensary will also make home visits as his schedule allows providing additional counseling and supporting as needed by patients or their caregivers. We cannot yet say with whom we would partner to perform these services, but we will seek synergi stic partnerships where they are available. CTNC will make available its subject matter experts in all areas relevant to substance use and abuse to provide educational and support services as well. The Company will also seek to engage lecturers or subject matter experts in order to provide meaningful events that can benefit attendees and recipients of the materials. Please see our budgetary pro forma in Appendix G to see our $500/month dedicated carve -out for our substance abuse prevention program. For Our Employees CTNC offers a robust substance abuse policy for our employees via our Human Resources policies. Our staff will have access to help whenever they may require it via an Employee Assistance Program which will feature a 27/7 hotline for drug abuse issues. Our employees will know clearly what is acceptable and what is not in regard to the use of substances. Excerpted from \"CTNC Human Resources Manual,\" HRM -0001 -A: 1 SECTION 38 - SUBSTANCE ABUSE 1.

Connecticut Natural Care, LLC. CONFIDENTIAL HRM -0001 -A CTNC Human Resources Manual Effective Date DRAFT 10.20.13 The foregoing misconduct examples are not intended to be inclusive of all of the required discipline, proper standards of conduct or obligations of Company employees. In addition, nothing herein shall be construed as limiting the Employ mentatWill relationship between the Company and our employees. 3. INVESTIGATION Management personnel who suspect that an employee's actions constitute a violation of misconduct must notify the Human Resources Department immediately and summarize the con duct in a confidential memorandum to the Human Resources Department. Sufficient time should be allowed to inform the employee of the charge and hear the employee's explanation, evaluate all pertinent facts and establish proof. The alleged misconduct must b e sufficiently established and disciplinary action should not result until the facts justify the action to be taken. Speculation, conjecture or vague circumstantial evidence does not constitute sufficient proof. Past, unrelated or otherwise irrelevant off enses should not be considered supportive evidence of the present charge (although they may be considered subsequently in the determination of appropriate disciplinary action). There may be cases where circumstantial evidence may be sufficient proof if its weight is substantial. The determination that an employee has committed misconduct does not require proof equal to that necessary to secure conviction in the courts. The determination must only be made in the Company's reasonable judgment. 4. SUSPENSION Suspension with or without pay may be warranted in situations involving investigations into an employee's potential misconduct, depending upon the circumstances. All suspensions require the prior approval of the Human Resources Department. 5.

MJ Freeway is ready to enter into a services agreement with you immediately thereafter on terms already discussed. Sincerely yours, Amy A Poinsett Chief Executive Officer MJ Freeway sales@mjfreeway.com www.mjfreeway.com 888-\u00ad932-\u00ad6537 x2 Mr. Jonathan D. Stravitz, President, Connecticut Natural Care (203) 702-\u00ad4465 andy@inaturalcare.com Page 2 of 17 Mr. Jonathan D. Stravitz, President Connecticut Natural Care 6 Ward Dr Danbury, CT 06810 The State of Connecticut's Department of Consumer Protection has issued draft regulations concerning the palliative use of marijuana. These regulations include significant requirements in the areas of operational policies and procedures, inventory control, patient recordkeeping, information security and patient education, among other topics. Below is information from MJ Freeway on how GramTracker and GrowTracker software meets each relevant section of regulations. Sec. 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad34. Operation of dispensary facility (a) No person may operate a dispensary facility without a dispensary facility license issued by the department. (b) A dispensary facility shall not dispense marijuana from, obtain marijuana from, or transfer marijuana to, a location outside of the state of Connecticut. (c) A dispensary facility shall not obtain, cultivate, deliver, transfer, transport, sell or dispense marijuana except: (1) It may acquire marijuana from a producer; and (2) It may dispense and sell marijuana to a qualifying patient or primary caregiver who is registered with the department pursuant to the Act and section 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad6 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. MJ Freeway's sales records, vendor records, purchase orders, transfer records and transport manifests document the source and destination of all marijuana that is dispensed from or obtained by the dispensary facility. These records are all time and date stamped and tied to an individual user to ensure accountability. MJ Freeway's GramTracker batch tracking system allows a dispensary to keep detailed records of all movements of product, ensuring the dispensary's capability to ensure that both incoming and outgoing product are associated with legally permitted sources and destinations. (d) No person at a dispensary facility shall provide marijuana samples or engage in marijuana compounding. MJ Freeway's inventory capabilities provide accuracy to the tenth of a gram, using integrated legal-\u00adfor-\u00adtrade scales. Any discrepancy in inventory levels is plainly visible in inventory and reconciliation reports, ensuring that dispensary facility managers have the ability to ensure that policies prohibiting the provision of samples or compounding are being upheld. (f) Only a dispensary may dispense marijuana, and only a dispensary or dispensary technician may sell marijuana, to qualifying patients and primary caregivers who are registered with the department pursuant to the Act and section 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad6 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. A dispensary technician may MJ Freeway sales@mjfreeway.com www.mjfreeway.com 888-\u00ad932-\u00ad6537 x2 Mr. Jonathan D.

Stravitz, President Connecticut Natural Care 6 Ward Dr Danbury, CT 06810 assist, under the direct supervision of a dispensary, in the dispensing of marijuana. (h) A dispensary facility shall not permit any person to enter the dispensary department unless: (1) Such person is licensed or registered by the department pursuant to 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad1 to 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad70, inclusive, of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies; (2) Such person's responsibilities necessitate access to the dispensary department and then for only as long as necessary to perform the person's job duties; or (3) Such person has a patient or caregiver registration certificate, in which case such person shall not be permitted behind the service counter or in other areas where marijuana is stored. 43 (i) All dispensary facility employees shall, at all times while at the dispensary facility, have their current dispensary license, dispensary technician registration or dispensary facility employee registration available for inspection by the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative. MJ Freeway's GramTracker allows a dispensary to prevent sales and check-\u00adins of patients without valid licenses, and also tracks which user within the database performs a sale, allowing a dispensary to track and ensure that all transactions take place between two legal parties. (n) A dispensary facility shall make publicly available the price of all marijuana products offered by the dispensary facility to prospective qualifying patients and primary caregivers. Such disclosure may include posting the information on the dispensary facility Internet web site MJ Freeway provides several methods for dispensary facilities to publicize their pricing, including through online menus and integration with locator services. (o) A dispensary facility shall provide information to qualifying patients and primary caregivers regarding the possession and use of marijuana. The dispensary facility manager shall submit all informational material to the commissioner for approval prior to being provided to qualifying patients and primary caregivers. Such informational material shall include information related to: (1) Limitations on the right to possess and use marijuana pursuant to the Act and sections 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad1 to 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad70, inclusive, of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies; (2) Safe techniques for proper use of marijuana and paraphernalia; (3) Alternative methods and forms of consumption or inhalation by which one can use marijuana; MJ Freeway sales@mjfreeway.com www.mjfreeway.com 888-\u00ad932-\u00ad6537 x2 Mr. President, Connecticut Natural Care (203) 702-\u00ad4465 andy@inaturalcare.com Page 4 of 17 Mr. Jonathan D. Stravitz, President Connecticut Natural Care 6 Ward Dr Danbury, CT 06810 (4) Signs and symptoms of substance abuse; and (5) Opportunities to participate in substance abuse programs. MJ Freeway provides the ability for dispensary facilities to provide patient educational information at the point of sale, and to capture a record of the date and time that such information was provided to the patient. Multiple pieces of educational material can be created and notes of which specific ones were provided can be captured in the patient purchase record. (q) All deliveries from producers shall be carried out under the direct supervision of a dispensary who shall be present to accept the delivery. Upon delivery, the marijuana shall immediately be placed in an approved safe or approved vault within the dispensary department where marijuana is stored. When purchase orders or transfers are received in MJ Freeway, the incoming product count and weight is captured. The date and time stamp, as well as the name of the person receiving the product is also captured. An inventory location for the received inventory is recorded as the product is checked in. Sec. 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad38. Rights and responsibilities of dispensaries (a) A dispensary, in good faith, may sell and dispense marijuana to any qualifying patient or primary caregiver that is registered with the department. Except as otherwise provided by sections 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad1 to 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad70, inclusive, of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, the dispensary dispensing the marijuana shall include the date of dispensing and the dispensary's signature or initials on the dispensary facility's dispensing record log. MJ Freeway's sales records capture the date and time of each sale, the name of the dispensary making the sale, and attach that information to the patient record. This is maintained both as a log of daily sales, as well as a log of sales to the patient. (e) A dispensary may dispense a portion of a qualifying patient's one-\u00admonth supply of marijuana. The dispensary may dispense the remaining portion of the one-\u00admonth supply of marijuana at any time except that MJ Freeway sales@mjfreeway.com www.mjfreeway.com 888-\u00ad932-\u00ad6537 x2 Mr. Jonathan D. Stravitz, President, Connecticut Natural Care (203) 702-\u00ad4465 andy@inaturalcare.com Page 5 of 17 Mr. Jonathan D. Stravitz, President Connecticut Natural Care 6 Ward Dr Danbury, CT 06810 no qualifying patient or primary caregiver shall receive more than a one-\u00admonth supply of marijuana in a one-\u00admonth period. MJ Freeway includes safeguards to monitor the weight of medicine on a particular order and compare that to the total weight dispensed to that patient over the previous one month. If an individual sale will exceed the remaining portion for a one-\u00admonth supply, the dispensary is alerted and the sale is blocked. (g) A dispensary shall document a qualifying patient's self-\u00adassessment of the effects of marijuana in treating the qualifying patient's debilitating medical condition or the symptoms thereof. A dispensary facility shall maintain such documentation electronically for at least three years following the date the patient ceases to designate the dispensary facility and such documentation shall be made available in accordance with section 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad70 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. MJ Freeway's SymptomTracker module provides a mechanism for the dispensary to review with the patient their symptoms and self-\u00adassess the effects of marijuana on those symptoms or conditions. This self-\u00adassessment is attached to the patient record. Self-\u00adassessments can be scheduled to ensure that dispensaries are communicating with their patients about symptoms and conditions on a regular basis. Sec. 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad39. Dispensaries to assign serial number and maintain records. Transfer of records to another dispensary facility (a) A dispensary shall assign and record a sequential serial number to each marijuana product dispensed to a patient and shall keep all dispensing records in numerical order in a suitable file, electronic file or ledger. The records shall indicate: (1) The date of dispensing; (2) The name and address of the certifying physician; (3) The name and address of the qualifying patient, or primary caregiver if applicable; (4) The initials of the dispensary who dispensed the marijuana; and (5) Whether a full or partial one-\u00admonth supply of marijuana was dispensed. (b) A dispensary facility shall maintain records created under this section and shall make such records available in accordance with section 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad70 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. (c) When a dispensary department closes temporarily or permanently, the dispensary facility shall, in the interest of public health, safety and convenience, make its complete dispensing records immediately available to a nearby dispensary facility and post a notice of this availability on the window or door of the closed dispensary facility. The dispensary facility shall simultaneously provide such notice to the commissioner. MJ Freeway sales@mjfreeway.com www.mjfreeway.com 888-\u00ad932-\u00ad6537 x2 Mr. Jonathan D.

Stravitz, President Connecticut Natural Care 6 Ward Dr Danbury, CT 06810 MJ Freeway assigns unique batch numbers to every strain, from every harvest. Furthermore, every package created from a batch of inventory is assigned a unique, non-\u00adrepeatable, package/serial number. These serial numbers, once generated and assigned, cannot be changed. MJ Freeway's sales records capture the date of dispensing, the recommending physician, and the quantity dispensed. This information is all attached to the record of the qualifying patient. MJ Freeway saves, and allows exports of, all inventory and sales history. Also, an MJ Freeway client can request an archived copy of their site, which will allow all records to be passed on quickly and easily as described in (5)(c). Sec. 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad40. Labeling of marijuana products by dispensary (a) A dispensary shall not dispense marijuana that does not bear the producer label required pursuant to section 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad56 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. (b) A dispensary, or a dispensary technician under the direct supervision of the dispensary, shall completely and properly label all marijuana products dispensed with all required information as follows: (1) The serial number, as assigned by the dispensary facility; (2) The date of dispensing the marijuana; (3) The quantity of marijuana dispensed; (4) The name and registration certificate number of the qualifying patient and, where applicable, the primary caregiver; (5) The name of the certifying physician; (6) Such directions for use as may be included in the physician's written certification or otherwise provided by the physician; (7) Name of the dispensary; (8) Name and address of the dispensary facility; (9) Any cautionary statement as may be required by Connecticut state statute or regulation; and (10) A prominently printed expiration date based on the producer's recommended conditions of use and storage that can be read and understood by the ordinary individual. (c) The expiration date required by this section shall be no later than the expiration date determined by the producer. (d) No person except a dispensary, or a dispensary technician operating under the direct supervision of a dispensary, shall alter, deface or remove any label so affixed. MJ Freeway currently captures and retains all data described in the requirements above. Any specific label formatting or disclaimers required by the Department of Consumer Protection will be adhered to. MJ Freeway creates both inventory labels, which are applied to the product at the production facility, prior to sale, and patient labels, which include required patient information and are applied at the point of sale.

MJ Freeway provides dispensary facilities with the ability to provide this statement at the point of sale. It may be provided through an information sheet that prints upon completion of the sale and is then included in the bag, or it may be added to the receipt itself. Sec. 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad49. Electronic system record-\u00adkeeping safeguards (a) If a dispensary facility uses an electronic system for the storage and retrieval of patient information or other marijuana records, the dispensary facility shall use a system that: (1) Guarantees the confidentiality of the information contained therein; (2) Is capable of providing safeguards against erasures and unauthorized changes in data after the information has been entered and verified by the dispensary; and (3) Is capable of being reconstructed in the event of a computer malfunction or accident resulting in the destruction of the data bank.

Operation of production facility (b) A producer shall not: (1) Produce or manufacture marijuana in any place except its approved production facility; (2) Sell, deliver, transport or distribute marijuana from any place except its approved production facility; (3) Produce or manufacture marijuana for use outside of Connecticut; (4) Sell, deliver, transport or distribute marijuana to any place except a dispensary facility located in Connecticut; MJ Freeway's sales records, vendor records, purchase orders, transfer records and transport manifests document the source and destination of all marijuana that is dispensed from or obtained by the dispensary facility. These records are all time and date stamped and tied to an individual user to ensure accountability. Sec. 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad53. Minimum requirements for the storage and handling of marijuana by producers (c)(4) Document the chain of custody of all marijuana and marijuana products. MJ Freeway's seed-\u00adto-\u00adsale data management capabilities are specifically designed to capture the chain of custody of all marijuana products from creation of the plant, through cultivation, harvesting, processing, distribution, inventory and sale. (d)(1) Handling mandatory and voluntary recalls of marijuana products. Such process shall be adequate to deal with recalls due to any action initiated at the request of the commissioner and any voluntary action by the producer to remove defective or potentially defective marijuana products from the market or any action undertaken to promote public health and safety by replacing existing marijuana products with improved products or packaging; MJ Freeway's batch tracking information ties any finished product, all the way back to the original plant in came from. In addition, all sales of product from that batch can be identified. In the case of a product recall, simply reporting on the batch ID of the defective product would enable the dispensary facility to remove all product from that batch from their inventory and to contact all patients who purchased product from that batch.

Stravitz, President Connecticut Natural Care 6 Ward Dr Danbury, CT 06810 (d)(3) Ensuring that any outdated, damaged, deteriorated, misbranded, or adulterated marijuana is segregated from all other marijuana and destroyed. This procedure shall provide for written documentation of the marijuana disposition; MJ Freeway captures destruction of marijuana by recording an inventory adjustment, requiring that the reason code for the adjustment be entered to indicate destruction, giving the ability to enter a note with further information, and providing a time and date stamp, as well as identification of who entered the record. The destroyed product shows as a unique entry on inventory reports, enabling future reporting on destroyed product. Sec. 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad54. Producer record keeping Producers shall keep records of all marijuana produced or manufactured and of all marijuana disposed of by them. Such records shall be maintained and made available in accordance with section 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad70 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies and, in each case shall show: (1) The brand name, kind and quantity of marijuana involved; (2) The date of such production or removal from production; (3) A record of all marijuana sold, transported or otherwise disposed of; (4) The date and time of selling, transporting or disposing of the marijuana; (5) The name and address of the dispensary facility to which the marijuana was sold; (6) The name of the dispensary who took custody of the marijuana; and (7) The name of the production facility employee responsible for transporting the marijuana. MJ Freeway's GrowTracker allows for detailed records of plant production, from seed to shipment, tracking strain/brand, harvest date and ingredients. Once harvested, useable product, useable byproduct, and waste can be tracked, and dealt with, independently. With static historical data and the Transport Manifest, chain of custody becomes traceable and unchangeable. MJ Freeway software serves as a thorough database of current and historic inventory and transactional data. The software features a suite of prepared reports, and its robust reporting engine allows dispensary ownership to produce custom reports as required. Should the state create its own custom form, we will strive to build it and incorporate it into the system. Sec. 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad56. Packaging and labeling by producer (c) A producer shall label each marijuana product prior to sale to a dispensary and shall securely affix to the package a label that states in legible English: (1) The name and address of the producer; MJ Freeway sales@mjfreeway.com www.mjfreeway.com 888-\u00ad932-\u00ad6537 x2 Mr. President, Connecticut Natural Care (203) 702-\u00ad4465 andy@inaturalcare.com Page 11 of 17 Mr. Jonathan D.

(8) A pass or fail rating based on the laboratory's microbiological, mycotoxins, heavy metals and chemical residue analysis; and (9) Such other information necessary to comply with state of Connecticut labeling requirements for similar products not containing marijuana, including but not limited to the Connecticut Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, Connecticut General Statutes, sections 21a-\u00ad91 to 21a-\u00ad120, inclusive, and Connecticut General Statutes, sections 21a-\u00ad151 to 21a-\u00ad159, inclusive, regarding bakeries and food manufacturing establishments. (d) A producer shall not label marijuana products as \"organic\" unless the marijuana plants have been organically grown as defined in section 21a-\u00ad92 of the Connecticut General Statutes and the marijuana products have been produced, processed, manufactured and certified to be consistent with organic standards in compliance with section 21a-\u00ad92a of the Connecticut General Statutes. MJ Freeway captures all of the data outlined above and will meet any production labeling requirements specified by Connecticut. Any specific label formatting or disclaimers required by the Department of Consumer Protection will be adhered to. After harvest, the production facility will be able to track the conversion of finished flower to discrete, uniquely label, sellable packages. MJ Freeway creates both inventory labels, which are applied to the product at the production facility, prior to sale, and patient labels, which include required patient information and are applied at the point of sale. MJ Freeway's current batch tracking and test result logging structure already allows discrete packages of inventory to carry unique details including expiration dates and cannabinoid profiles. Sec. 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad58. Laboratory testing MJ Freeway sales@mjfreeway.com www.mjfreeway.com 888-\u00ad932-\u00ad6537 x2 Mr. D.

During this period of segregation, the producer shall maintain the marijuana batch in a secure, cool and dry location so as to prevent the marijuana from becoming ontaminated or losing its efficacy. Under no circumstances shall a producer include marijuana in a marijuana product or sell it to a dispensary facility prior to the time that the laboratory has completed its testing and analysis and provided those results, in writing, to the producer or other designated production facility employee. Test Specification Alfatoxin B1 <20 uG/KG of A <20 uG/KG of Substance (3) For purposes of the heavy metal test, a marijuana sample shall be deemed to have passed if it meets the following standards: Metal Natural Health Products Acceptable limits uG/KG BW/Day Arsenic <0.14 Cadmium <0.09 Lead <0.29 Mercury <0.29 (4) For purposes of the pesticide chemical residue test, a marijuana sample shall be deemed to have passed if it satisfies the most stringent acceptable standard for a pesticide chemical residue in any food item as set forth in Subpart C of the federal Environmental Protection Agency's regulations for Tolerances and Exemptions for Pesticide Chemical Residues in Food, 40 CFR 180. (f) If a sample of marijuana passes the microbiological, mycotoxin, heavy metal and pesticide chemical residue test, the laboratory shall release the entire batch for immediate manufacturing, packaging and labeling for sale to a dispensary facility. (g) The laboratory shall file with the department an electronic copy of each laboratory test result for any batch that does not pass the microbiological, mycotoxin, heavy metal or pesticide chemical residue test, MJ Freeway sales@mjfreeway.com www.mjfreeway.com 888-\u00ad932-\u00ad6537 x2 Mr. Jonathan D.

(h) A producer shall provide to a dispensary facility the laboratory test results for each batch of marijuana used in a product purchased by the dispensary facility. Each dispensary facility shall have such laboratory results available upon request to qualifying patients, primary caregivers and physicians who have certified qualifying patients. MJ Freeway's batch tracking and inventory location functionality supports the requirements above for product control prior to the completion of testing. Finished product that is not yet tested can easily be maintained as separate inventory from that which is already tested and available for packaging or further processing. Laboratory results can be attached to product entries once they have been sent to the producer. MJ Freeway's GramTracker test results module allows a dispensary to attach test data to individual batches within the dispensary's inventory, ensuring that each unit of inventory can be correctly assigned a necessary test profile. Sec. 21a-\u00ad408-\u00ad59. Brand name (a) A producer shall assign a brand name to each marijuana product. A producer shall register each brand name with the department, on a form prescribed by the commissioner, prior to any sale to a dispensary facility and shall associate each brand name with a specific laboratory test that includes a terpenes profile and a list of all active ingredients, including: (1) Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); (2) (4) Cannabidiolic acid (CBDA); and (5) Any other active ingredient that constitutes at least 1% of the marijuana batch used in the product.
