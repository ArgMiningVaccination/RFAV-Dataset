Winter to me means \"putting the aromatic garden to bed\" and days spent indoors dreaming about spring planting. But if we look more carefully at our surroundings we will discover many different aromatic joys in the winter landscape\u2014and in the aromatherapy blending room! For example, the resinous, balmy, and pine-y scents of the evergreens of the landscapes symbolize the continuation of the \"aromatic garden,\" even as other plants are \"sleeping\"\u2014and these are great scents to combine with some of the traditional warming and spicy aromas we find in our oils in the blending room. As this is often a time of year that we need to care for ourselves more deeply, both physically and emotionally, many of these aromas and oils can help to keep us healthy and happy until spring arrives again. If you are looking for ideas and inspiration on how to keep yourself healthy this winter look no further than the articles penned by our talented team of aromatic writers in this issue of the NAHA Aromatherapy Journal. Amy Emnett discusses the importance of Immune Power for Kids with Aromatherapy while Tricia Ambroziak looks at how essential oil therapy can help with the varicella zoster virus. Anna Doxie talks about Recognizing the Symptoms of Adrenal Fatigue and Using Phyto-Therapy to Support Recovery. Skin issues are addressed with Kathy Sadowski's article on The Amazing Esters Found in Essential Oils , KG Stiles talks about which essential oils to use for anti-aging and skincare, and Elizabeth Ashley looks at the benefits of St. John's Wort oil. Cheryl Murphy profiles the Burseraceae plant family, a plant family which produces essential oils for use with aging skin. And Dawn Shipley summarizes the use of aromatherapy in a case study relating to burns. If you are looking for some winter reading, take a look at my book review and interview with author Jennifer Peace Rhind, where I discuss her two books, Fragrance and Wellbeing and Aromatherapeutic Blending. Finally, aromatherapy blending inspiration can be found with the aromatherapy recipes shared by the NAHA directors in this issue. Winter can be enjoyed, both from the armchair and in the landscape, if we open our eyes and look more closely. As always, our aromatic plants and aromatherapy oils play a part in balancing our bodies (and minds) through each season. With aromatic blessings, Sharon Falsetto Sharon Falsetto, BA (Hons), NAHA Certified Professional Aromatherapist\u00ae Journal Winter 2017.4 \u00a9 Copyright Return 2017 NAHA Return to Oils for Anti-Aging and Skin Care by KG Stiles Treat your skin gently. Good skin care - gentle cleansing, proper hydration and nourishment, in addition to sun protection - can help to keep your skin healthy and glowing at any age. You don't need to spend excessive amounts of time or money on expensive and intensive skin care therapy to enjoy all of the natural anti-aging benefits of good skin care. Pampering yourself with just a few simple skin care basics, along with a healthy lifestyle, can also help to prevent, or even eliminate, skin problems. I have to admit that I never once saw a member of my family perform a skin care routine. Neither do I recall seeing any hygienic routines for skin care even from my mom who was a licensed cosmetologist. My mom was really into the idea of beauty. She was always buying the latest skincare lotions, creams and make-up, but cleansing did not seem to be a part of her beauty care routine. It wasn't until I reached the age of thirty that it suddenly dawned on me that a facial cleansing ritual might be a good idea. At this same time I started hydrating with ample amounts of pure fresh water. It was well before the bottled water craze that came along several years later. As with all of my health routines and habits, my skin care treatment program has evolved over time. Periodically I'll change things up a bit, but essentially this is the basic skin care and beauty treatment program that I follow. In addition, I seldom use any body lotions or oils on my skin. I used to do so, but not anymore. My diet contains quality oils, like olive (Olea europaea) oil, that nourish my skin from the inside out and I hydrate with a sufficient amount of pure, fresh water daily to help my skin to stay moist and supple. As I've always had a tendency towards oily skin, my genetic make-up may also play a factor. For beautiful healthy and radiant skin try a skin care routine like the one that follows and customize it to fit your individual needs. Keep in mind to use the skin care formulas that are most suitable for your skin type. 1. Wash your skin daily with a gentle facial wash. I recommend that you avoid plain, water- based soaps, or soaps that contain harsh chemicals which clean, but do not protect, your skin. Your facial skin is delicate and it can begin to look damaged, if not taken care of properly. Consider investing in a high-quality facial wash. Your skin is acidic, whereas soap is alkaline- based. Your skin's natural barrier for protection is made up of an acid mantle. When you use soap, which is extremely alkaline, to wash your face it shifts the normal acid pH balance to alkaline and it throws the skin's natural pH out of balance, which, in turn, weakens 8 Aromatherapy Journal Winter 2017.4 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to Topits acid mantle of protection and makes skin conditions worse.\u00b9 Instead, use a cleanser that is formulated for your skin type (normal, oily, dry, sensitive or combination skin) and made with pure, natural ingredients. Harsh facial cleansers like salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide, while temporarily ameliorating problems like acne outbreaks, can strip away the natural oils of your skin, causing irritation, and disturbing the natural balance of hydration for your skin. Natural anti-bacterials like honey or oats can help to keep your skin fresh and radiant, as well helping to delay or reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles. For facial cleansing I like to use raw, unscented goat milk soap fresh-made from the farm. If you haven't tried goat milk soap then you're missing out on a truly great facial cleanser! It's certainly the best facial soap I've ever used to date. It is gentle, soothing and nourishing for your facial skin, inexpensive, and one bar lasts an incredibly long time. Raw goat milk soap is beneficial for dry, sensitive, oily, combination or problem skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis, and also for keeping your skin healthy. I use either a hypoallergenic facial mitt made from flax (my preference) or a natural facial loofah to gently wash and exfoliate my skin daily. Be sure to wet your skin first before beginning to cleanse with your natural facial cleanser. If you have dry or sensitive skin, or areas of combination skin, you may wish to use your fingertips to wash your face, or use a soft, cotton wash cloth. Apply gentle, even pressure at the areas of your chin, nose, forehead and cheeks where oil and dirt tends to accumulate. Essential Oils for Anti-Aging and Skin Care continued Skin falls into five main types: Normal, oily, dry, sensitive, or combination.2 Your face may actually fall into one or more of these categories, and different areas of your face can be dry, oily, healthy, or unhealthy. Normal skin is usually characterized as neither dry nor oily. It feels supple and smooth to the touch with few imperfections and no sensitivity. The skin pores are almost invisible and the skin looks radiant and glowing. Little care is needed for normal skin types. Oily skin is characterized by large pores, and often a greasy or shiny complexion. There is more prevalence to pimples and blemishes. Stress, hormonal imbalances and exposure to harsh environmental influences may negatively impact oily skin conditions.Dry skin can look dull, taut, and have dry, flaky patches. It is less elastic and the pores can be fine and less visible. The complexion can look uneven. Again, stress, hormone imbalance and environmental influences may play a factor. Sensitive skin may be red, burning, itchy, dry or tender to the touch. As with oily and dry skin types, sensitive skin can indicate an overreaction to something in the environment or one's diet, as well as hormonal imbalances. Combination skin is the most common skin type. It is a combination of all three skin types (oily, dry, and sensitive) and it can vary from perfectly healthy to overly dry or oily. Frequently the combination skin type has a T-zone of oily skin (across the forehead, and down the nose to the chin) and everywhere else is either normal to dry skin. Your Skin TypeYour Skin TypeWinter 2017.4 Return to TopBe very gentle with your skin when cleansing to avoid exacerbating any problems, or damaging the skin. Rinse your face with cool water, removing all the soap completely, and pat dry. Some people like washing their skin in the morning and at night time. When I wear make-up I wash my face twice daily, but otherwise it seems to make my face oilier. Experiment and find out what works best for your skin type. As I said, my skin care routine tends to evolve and change over time, so be open to switching things up on occasion. 2. Use a facial toner. Though not an absolute necessity to your skin care routine, I recommend using a facial toner after washing your face to close pores, cleanse the skin of any traces of make-up, in addition to shrinking the appearance of pores. Facial toners are also excellent for controlling acne outbreaks, skin blemishes, or plugged pores. Add toner to a cotton or wool facial round before applying it to your face in long upward strokes, starting at your d\u00e9colletage. Facial toner can also be sprayed directly on the face. 3. Moisturize dry skin. After washing, or toning your skin, you may wish to use a moisturizer if your skin is dry. Be sure to use a moisturizer suitable for your skin type. Apply gently in upward strokes, starting at your d\u00e9colletage. 4. Protect your skin from the sun. Protecting yourself from overexposure to the sun is not an issue most of us face during the winter months in the United States (unless you're lucky enough to be a snow bird or you live in southern states such as Arizona or Florida or if you travel to some sunny destination abroad) but it is one of the best ways to take good care of your skin. Sun exposure over time can cause wrinkles, lines, age spots and other skin issues, as well as increase your risk of skin cancer. I'm a sun lover and love sun bathing early in the morning during the summer months. According to Dr. Mercola, \"Fifteen to twenty minutes in sunlight a day helps your body produce the vitamin D it needs to absorb calcium and promote bone growth and keep the heart healthy. But sunscreen \u2014important to protect against skin cancer \u2014reduces the body's ability to manufacture the vitamin.\"\u00b3 For sun protection: Cover your skin with protective clothing like long-sleeved shirts, pants and wide-brimmed hats. During the peak of the day's heat when the sun's rays are strongest hang out in shady spots and avoid exposure to direct sunlight between 10 a.m. - 2 p.m. When necessary use sunscreen. If you just can't avoid direct sunlight during the day use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15. Apply liberally on exposed skin and reapply every two hours, or after swimming or perspiring heavily.Essential Oils for Anti-Aging and Skin Care continued Jasmine officinale)10 Aromatherapy Winter 2017.4 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to Top5. Don't smoke. Smoking contributes to skin looking old and wrinkled, and it is well known for causing smoker's mouth wrinkles. Smoking narrows the tiny blood vessels of the epidermis (the outermost layer of skin) which results in decreased blood flow and depletion of your skin's oxygen and the nutrients necessary for skin health. Lastly, smoking damages collagen and elastin fibers which give your skin its natural strength and elasticity, necessary for maintaining its youthful appearance. 6. Eat a healthy, whole foods diet and drink plenty of pure, fresh water . A healthy, whole foods diet helps you to look and feel your best. Eat foods that nourish you and give you lots of energy. The antioxidants in fruits and vegetables help to fight wrinkles while the hydrating effects of healthy fats found in olive oil and fish help to reduce free radical damage, as well as providing anti-aging effects and helping you to lose weight. Research suggests that a diet rich in vitamin C, and low in unhealthy fats and processed or refined carbohydrates, might promote younger looking skin.Drink plenty of pure, fresh water daily. Drinking water eases stress on your liver and helps to flush toxins and waste products from your body which, in turn, improves your skin complexion. The recommended intake of water daily in ounces to body weight in pounds is half your body weight in ounces, i.e. if you weigh 120 pounds you would drink a minimum of 60 ounces of water daily. You skin is less likely to dry out if you stay well-hydrated. 7. Manage stress. Uncontrolled stress can make your skin more sensitive, and may trigger acne breakouts and other skin problems. Keeping stress levels low not only supports healthy skin, but it can help you to stay in a relaxed and alert, healthy state of mind. Learn to say no, set reasonable limits, be clear on your priorities, scale back your to-do list, make time for regular exercise, meditate, and do the things that you love. 8. Deep exfoliation once or twice a week.Deep exfoliation once or twice a week, though not absolutely essential, can be a great way to help to remove dead skin cells, so they don't collect in the pores and turn into blemishes. Use minimal pressure and a gentle exfoliating mitt or cotton cloth. For deep exfoliation the time spent on exfoliating is longer than for your daily facial cleansing. You are stimulating the first few layers of your skin with gentle, even pressure. You can use your usual facial cleanser, or a mixture of baking soda (deodorizer/cleanser) and pure, fresh water. Mix baking soda and water in equal portions in a ceramic bowl and make a thick paste to use as an exfoliating cleanser. You may want to tone and moisturize after exfoliating.Essential Oils for Anti-Aging and Skin Care 2017.4 Aromatherapy Journal11 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to Top9. Facial mask to rejuvenate your skin, every 1-2 weeks. This restorative treatment can help to maintain the quality of your skin tissue, as well as its tone. Depending upon the ingredients, a facial mask can be useful for treating anti-aging, spots, wrinkles, skin tone, improving facial radiance, in addition to brightening and toning up your skin.Face and Body Skin Tonic Spray A skin toner may be used for your body or face and it is designed to cleanse and freshen your skin, as well as to shrink the appearance of pores. You can use your body and facial toner in different ways, including applying it to a cotton or damp wool cloth, or you can spray it directly onto your body or face as a freshener.Essential Oils for Anti-Aging and Skin Care continued Use this simple method of gentle full body exfoliation after your shower.

Depending upon the condition of the skin you may use a more brisk motion when applying the oil. Cautions: Do not apply the oil blend directly on any open sores as this can cause sensitization to essential oils. You may apply the oil blend around an area with broken skin, but not directly onto it.After Shower Body Therapy Blend12 Aromatherapy Journal Winter 2017.4 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to TopEssential Oils for Anti-Aging and Skin Care continued Adding an essential oil or blend to your toner that has skin nourishing and healing properties suitable for your skin type enhances the effectiveness of your toner.

Add 3-5 drops of liquid lecithin and shake the bottle again to mix thoroughly. Add the essential oils one drop at a time (between 12 and 24 drops total which is 1-2% dilution). After adding each drop of essential oil, spray the blend to test the aroma quality and check that the oils are dispersing thoroughly into the water. Add more lecithin if needed to keep oils blended. Shake well to blend essential oils into the water. Lightly spray the blend onto the desired skin areas to freshen, heal and tone the skin. You may also spray the toner onto a cotton or wool facial pad and apply to your skin with gentle upward, sweeping movements. Allow to dry thoroughly before applying body oil or lotion, if desired. * Citric acid powder is a natural preservative for skincare products.

The mildest and most gentle types of skin toner that is suitable for all skin types, as well as for dry and sensitive skin, is made with pure fresh water and a small percentage of an astringent like alcohol or witch hazel (0-10%). Some kind of humectant like glycerin may also be used to hold in skin moisture, as well as adding citric acid to act as a preservative, and lecithin which acts as an emulsifier. For slightly more skin toning action that's suitable for all skin types, as well as for oily and combination skin, use a bit more astringent (up to 20%) in water, along with a humectant, a preservative like citric acid, and an emulsifier like lecithin, if desired. Finally, the strongest body toners are excellent for oily skin and controlling excess sebum production. These skin toners contain higher percentages of astringent (up to 60%) and the strongest antiseptic properties and action which help to prevent and control acne outbreaks.References: 1.

An ester is an oxygenated compound that occurs during the \"esterification process\" when an acid combines with an alcohol, resulting in the formation of an ester along with a water molecule. This creates a typically gentle and strongly aromatic chemical found in essential oils. Esters are easily formed and broken down during the distillation process; an example of this is the combination of linalool with acetic acid, which forms the ester linalyl acetate plus water. 1 Made from the combination of an alcohol and an acid, its name is derived from both parent molecules such that the combination of linalool and acetic acid is named the ester: linalyl acetate. Best known for its sweet floral aroma, an ester also has the following therapeutic properties: Antimicrobial, anti- inflammatory, antispasmodic, calming, and skin vulnerary actions. 2 These constituents make for an excellent inclusion in a topical blend with their therapeutic actions and very low skin sensitizing and toxicity levels. Examples of esters in essential oils include: Benzyl acetate as found ylang Pinus species), spruce (multiple Picea species), fir Amazing Esters Found in Essential Oils by Kathy Sadoswski MS, LMT, RYT 16 Aromatherapy Journal Winter fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum), and citrus oils Essential Oils in Esters: angustifolia and Antispasmodic Calming / sedative Skin vulnerary.Cautions: While most esters are considered gentle, two exceptions include methyl salicylate as found in wintergreen (Gaultheria procumbens) essential oil, and sabinyl acetate as found in Spanish sage (Salvia lavandulaefolia) essential oil.1 Furthermore, it is important to be aware of other constituents in an essential oil that can be toxic and/or sensitizing. For example, clove bud ( Syzygium aromaticum ) contains up to 10% of the ester eugenyl acetate, but it also can contain over 75% of the phenol eugenol, which can be a dermal irritant, toxic, and carcinogenic when used improperly and excessively. 3 Scientific Research on the Therapeutic Actions of Ester Constituents Benzyl acetate, as found in jasmine absolute and ylang ylang essential oils, has a sweet, fruity aroma often used in perfumery. It can make up to 25% of jasmine absolute. 3The Amazing Esters Found in Essential continued benzoate has a faint, sweet, balsamic, floral aroma as found in balsam, benzoin resin, jasmine absolute, and ylang ylang essential oils. It is identified on the World Health Organization list of essential oils, and it has been used to treat scabies, lice, and used as an insecticide. 4,5 In addition, benzyl benzoate may be helpful in reducing dust mites by applying it to carpets and adding it to the laundry. 6,7 Bornyl acetate, with a woody, pine, herbal aroma, is found in tree species of essential oils like pine, spruce, and fir, as well as in rosemary, sage, and valerian. It has demonstrated the potential for improving bone density 8 and it can also be used as a sedative, related to valerian root (Valeriana isoborneol, and isobornyl acetate, which has caused a sedative effect in mice. 9 Citronellyl formate, also called tiglate, has a green, floral aroma and it can make up to 12% of geranium (Pelargonium graveolens) essential oil.3 It was found to show potential anti-tumor activity in a 1988 study.10 Eugenyl acetate, which is found in both clove bud and clove leaf (Eugenia caryophyllata) essential oil, as well as cinna- mon leaf (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) essential oil, has a fresh, woody, spicy aroma and it has demonstrated antioxidant activities in vitro comparable to those found in vitamin E. 11 Geranyl acetate, with an aroma that is sweet, floral, fruity, and green, is found in lemongrass essential oils.

Linalool and linalyl acetate are key constituents. 14 Furthermore, lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) essential oil, and its linalyl acetate and linalool constituents, had a local anesthetic effect in rats. 15 Linalyl acetate and citronellyl acetate showed antispasmodic activity in the rat ilium. 16 Linalool and linalyl acetate were anti- inflammatory in rats.17 Bergamot (Citrus bergamia) essential oil with a combined action of its monoterpene component limonene and the component ester linalyl acetate aided in cancer cell death induced by cytotoxicity in vitro. 18 Petitgrain (Citrus aurantium along with their constituents were tested against human pathogenic bacteria. Significant constituents included: Carvacrol, linalyl acetate, and others. 19 Linalyl acetate and that are found in clary sage ( Salvia sclarea) essential oil were antifungal in against soil-borne pathogens. 20 Linalyl acetate worked synergistically with linalool as an inhaled anti-anxiety treatment. 21 The constituent demonstrated a sedative effect upon inhalation.22 Neryl acetate has a floral aroma as found in citrus oils, fenugreek, and helichrysum, and it has shown to have pain reducing, inflammatory reducing activity used with cosmetic surgery. In a 2007 study, helichrysum (Helichrysum italicum) essential oil combined with a macerated oil of musk rose (Rosa moschata) was shown to reduce inflammation, edema, and bruising after cosmetic and reconstructive surgery, with the component of neryl acetate also contributing to pain relief. 23 Furthermore, the a-terpinolene, trans- carlophyllene, and neryl acetate components of helichrysum ( H. italicum) (Roth) Don essential oil showed antimicrobial activity against the Micococcus luterus bacteria, which commonly infects the human respiratory tract.24 The Amazing Esters Found in Essential Oils continued Floral Relaxation Bath Blend Ingredients: 8 oz. sea salt 2 oz. jojoba ( drop of bergamot ( Citrus bergamia ) Instructions for Making and Use: Mix together the essential oils with the carrier oil and add to the sea salt.

Its bright yellow flowers literally fill our garden in June; crush them, and they exude a blood red juice that stains the fingers blue! It really is very odd. Early History of UseAn incredibly ancient medicine, Roman and Greek authorities, Galen, Pliny and Dioscorides, pay testament to its prowess as a wound healer, a treatment for menstrual disorders (Dioscorides cites it specifically for encouraging menstrual flow), as a diuretic and cure for intestinal worms, and a salve for snake bite. 1, 2 Medieval authority, London herbalist John Gerard (1545 - 1612) wrote: \"St. John's Wort, with his [sic] flowers and seed boyled and drunken, provoketh urine, and is right good against stone in the bladder.\" 3 Not surprisingly, with that beautiful corona like flower, English herbalist Nicholas Culpepper (1616 - 1654) places it under the rulership of the sun. He writes : \"It is a singular wound herb; boiled in wine and drank, it heals inward hurts or bruises; made into an ointment, it open obstructions, dissolves swellings, and closes up the lips of wounds. The decoction of the herb and flowers, especially of the seed, being drank in wine, with the juice of knot-grass, helps all manner of vomiting and spitting of blood, is good for those that are bitten or stung by any venomous creature, and for those that cannot make water. Two drams of the seed of St. John's Wort made into powder, and drank in a little broth, doth gently expel choler or congealed blood in the stomach. The decoction of the leaves and seeds drank somewhat warm before the fits of agues, whether they be tertains or quartans, alters the fits, and, by often using, doth take them quite away.\" 4 A quick recap on the medieval wording: Ague is delirium from a fever, and tertain pertains especially to a malaria fever. Quartan , too, means malarial, but it is a milder version that causes a fever on every third day. In fact, Gerard, Culpepper, and Swiss physician Paracelsus (1493 - 1541) all recommend what they refer to as the red oil to alleviate pain. Paracelsus, in particular, speaks highly of the plant as a means to disperse depression, melancholy and over excitation. 5 In 1525, he wrote: \"Every physician should know that God has placed a great acanum* in the herb, just for the spirits and the mad fantasies that drive people to despair. \".6 *An acanum: A secret. 24 Aromatherapy Journal Winter 2017.4 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to TopParacelsus's plaudits about madness are not isolated either, because Hypericum perforatum became one of the most important herbs of the medieval exorcism ritual. Named Fuga daemonum, 7 or Devil's fright, the bright yellow flowers gave deep reassurance to early Christians of Christ's dominion over the dark.8 Early German Christians christened the flower \"Bringer of light,\" again perhaps connected to the deep symbology of St. John being the light. Even the name of the genus Hypericum takes its name from the Greek words Hyper - meaning over, and eikon - meaning apparition. It can also be interpreted as exceeding any imagination . Scholars have also proposed the name could be an allusion to the Titan Hyperian whose union with the Titaness Theia produced the sun god Helios and is often depicted wearing a crown of rays. Interestingly, another name sometimes used for the plant is Corona Regia - meaning solar crown. The species nomenclature, incidentally, can be identified by holding the leaves up to the light and viewing the tiny needle like punctures: the perforatum . 6 Modern Day Nomenclature of St. John's Wort Our modern name, St. John's Wort, comes from the medieval declaration that it should be gathered on St John's birthday, June 24 th, when the flowers are at their fullest. Blooms were hung over doorways to protect the family and, at midsummer, the plants were burned on bonfires to frighten spirits away. Legend has it that the ruby red blood of St John's beheading also flows from the flower on August 29 th.9 While, at midsummer, the plant was used to ward away spirits, the rest of the year it was held in high esteem for its medicinal uses. Hortus Sanitatis The Hortus Sanitatis was the first natural history encyclopaedia. Published by Jacob Meydenbach in Germany in 1485, it lists Hypericum and it is recommended to \"stanch bleeding, bind wounds, join cut sinews, and counteract the thrusts of poisoned weapons.\" Indeed today, one of the principal uses, topically, for St. John's Wort is for wounds where nerves have been damaged. 10 St. John's Wort for Depression For many years it was surmised that the chemical component hypericin might be the source of Paracelsus's Arcanum and, for a while, it seemed it may be so. Research showed that hypericin stimulates capillary flow in the brain. 11 In 1984, rat studies also elucidated that hypericin inhibited enzymes called MAO A and MAO B that degrade neurotransmitters in the brain. 12 By curbing the degradation, levels of neurotransmitters remained higher at synapses between nerves thus, in theory, the person should stay happier. It worked on paper, but the action amounted to less than anticipated. It transpired that the levels required to make a difference would be far higher than are naturally found in brain tissue, 12 so the hypothesis was abandoned. St John's Wort continued ABOVE: to TopHypericin is an active constituent against depression in so much as it does have a very strong affinity for the sigma receptors that control dopamine levels. Likewise, it is a receptor agonist (the key that works the lock) for calming GABA A and GABA B receptors, for the adenosine (caffeine and wakefulness) receptor and for inositol triphosphate which, again, regulates levels of neurotransmitters. 13 All of those actions aside, hypericin's anti-depressant action is not enough to account for the herb's efficacy against melancholy on its own. More recent research suggests Paracelsus's Arcanum might be the slightly lesser (by volume) constituent Hyperflorin. A potent re-uptake inhibitor of serotonin, dopamine, nor-adrenaline, and it alters levels of neurotransmitters crossing the synaptic gap between nerves. This action (or maybe these actions because there is a lot going on at once!) alleviates depression. Now, one could be forgiven for thinking the actions of St. John's Wort mimic those of standard SSRI anti-depressants. Not so. The prescription medications block the serotonin receptors, but Hypericum perforatum works differently, somehow elevating levels of calcium 15 and sodium16 at the synapse depolarising the cell more efficiently. In addition, it increases the number of 5-HT (serotonin) receptors in the brain, making a larger surface area for the neurotransmitters to bind to. 17 Clinical trials have now proved the efficacy of St. John's Wort: As an antidepressant agent, it is directly proportional to the amount of Hyperflorin in the sample. 18 There are a couple of things to note here. St. John's Wort works very slowly. Often oral treatment with the herb will take two or three weeks or even months for the patient to report differences, topical use with the oil may take even longer. The rule for treatment here, is don't expect giant leaps and bounds quickly. Paracelsus may be right again in that it is better indicated for milder melancholia than full blown depression. The next concern is contraindications. Oral use of St. John's Wort interacts with a considerable number of drugs including antidepressants that particularly target those same monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MOAI). Sometimes the St John's Wort continued How to Make St. John's Wort Carrier Oil The carrier oil is a maceration of the flowers and it is extremely simple to make yourself if Hypericum perforatum grows nearby. Pluck the flowers at their fullest and steep them in olive (Olea europaea ) oil or a similar vegetable oil and leave the jar out in the sun for two to three weeks, shaking regularly to agitate the chemicals from the flower into your oil. Over time you will see the yellow flowers release their rich red magic, hypericin. This active constituent can be clearly seen on black dots around the edges of the petals. After three weeks the petals will have relinquished their potent elixir and you can proudly call yourself creatrix of the \"red oil.\" Dried flowers of St John's Winter 2017.4 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to Topactions are increased, sometimes they are reduced, making the treatments act unpredictably, often though St. John's Wort makes side effects of the drug more acute. According to Price and Price,19 topical use of the herb doesn't seem to have the same concerns. The only contraindication cited is phototoxicity. St. John's Wort for Wound Healing Surprisingly, given St John's Wort main attribution for wound healing, there is very little clinical research conducted in this area. Anadolu University in Turkey discovered that when St. John's Wort was added to chicken embryonic material, it activated more production of collagen, followed by the polygonal shape activation of the fibroblast cells that govern wound closure. 20 Antibacterial and Antiviral Properties of St. John's Wort According to Schempp, 21 hyperflorin is also the main antibacterial agent in St. John's Wort, and that it is capable of inhibiting all manner of micro-organisms, but interestingly only gram-positive bacteria, such as MRSA and PRSA (penicillin resistant). Staphyllococcus aureus was particularly weakened by the plant. 22 Gram-negative bacteria, however, seemed not to be touched at all. Hyperflorin is not the only active component. Our scarlet friend, hypericin, also has a quite extraordinary talent, in that it opens envelopes! Not the kind that you and I get excited about containing birthday cards, but St John's Wort continued Wound Healing Oil Carrier Oils: 0.5 oz. St. John's wort (Hypericum Essential Oils: Instructions for Making and Use: Combine all of the oils together in a one ounce bottle. Apply a small amount of the blend to the palms of the hands and massage gently around open wounds and over formed scar tissue. Apply only in the evening to avoid issues with photosensitivity. Cautions: Avoid use during pregnancy. Avoid use with patients taking anti-coagulant medication. The application of the blend over an open wound could increase the concentration of the blend being absorbed into the body. Possible phototoxicity. St. John's wort NAHA Return to Topenvelopes containing viruses. Some (not all) viruses are contained and protected by outer wrappings or envelopes - the capsid. This envelope derives from the infected host cell when it \"buds off.\" Here, the newly generated virus particles are shrouded in a coat created from tiny fragments of the host cell's plasma membrane. Enveloped viruses remain active as long as the capsid remains wet. Consequently, they are very happy in the respiratory tract or in droplets of mucous or saliva. These enveloped viruses are often the source of persistent infections. Some examples are herpes, HIV and Hepatitis B. Hypericin, strangely, seems to be able to deactivate these enveloped viruses. Research into hypericin's effects on the HIV virus cells, found this was particularly effective when the viruses were also exposed to light. 23 Their success relied on the hypericin disrupting the life cycle of the cell.24 Oddly, despite its voracious killing spree against these enveloped viruses, in vitro,25 hypericin seems completely ineffective against viruses that are un-enveloped. It has been suggested this might be due to hypericin's interference with proteins controlling the fusion of the membranes of the enveloped viruses, 26 a redundant stage in the evolution of an un-enveloped viral cell. These data are being closely studied to try to develop AIDS medications, attractive to drug companies, because St. John's Wort is a fairly inexpensive ingredient to use. Unusually, this success has already been carried forward into Phase I human trials and was tested on thirty patients with HIV, but sadly there was very little retroviral success and the drug caused extreme phototoxicity, with over half of the participants having to leave the trial because of toxic effects. 26a Nevertheless, the pharmaceutical quest continues. In 2002, a trial also proved that hypericin completely deactivated a cow diarrhoea virus.27 Certain catechins and flavonoids were also found to exert antibacterial activity, especially in the influenza virus.28 Anti-inflammatory Actions of St. John's Wort Modern science agrees with ancient testimonial of the anti-inflammatory prowess of the plant and has been able to elucidate some of the mechanisms of healing. Genes such as interleukin 6, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 all work as pro-inflammatory markers that gravitate to places of injury and begin the process of inflammation. Several constituents St John's Wort continued Melancholy-Lift Massage Oil Carrier Oils: 1 oz.

Possible phototoxicity.28 Aromatherapy Journal Winter \u00a9 quercetin, and pseudohypericin - all reduced these actions by turning down the volume on the signalling process.29 Again, the hypericum magic worked most effectively when the hypercilin was exposed to light.30 Reduction of Opium Dependence In 2007, The University of Peshwar reported that Hypericum perforatum decreased the symptoms of opiate withdrawal in adult Wistar rats.31 Diuresis and Incontinence Historical usage recommends St. John's Wort as a diuretic and especially for water retention, but when I trained to be an aromatherapist, I clearly remember that my study notes recommended it for incontinence, and indeed I have successfully used it to treat clients but the evidence for it is vague and thin. In 2004 it was found that Hypericum perforatum affected the contractibility of rat bladders. This, in part, also seemed to be executed through Hypericum's interaction with the opioid receptors. 32 To date, this has never been tested in human trials. Conclusion There is no doubt that our most ancient authorities had a very good understanding of the plant. Use for deep wounds, especially where there is nerve damage. Build into treatments for stress where there is an element of being worn out and becoming jaded and melancholy. Employ St John's Wort for issues with fluid, for those patients whose periods are scant, or who retain a great deal of water. Conversely, use as a gentle massage oil for the backs of children who are still wetting the bed or older members struggling with incontinence. Add to blends of antibacterial oils to fight antibiotic resistant viruses as well as influenza and diarrhea. Calm itching, soreness, sun burn or scalds with St John's Wort's gently healing properties. Its astringent but smoothing effects make it wonderful as an addition to beauty products, its actions on collagen plumping and ironing the skin! In all cases, be aware of its phototoxic effects and perhaps use in the evening to avoid any potential risks.St John's Wort continued TopReferences: 1. Castleman, M.

But there is a downfall to all that peer time: Illness. When a child develops something as simple as the sniffles, it spreads like wildfire in the classroom environment, especially in the winter months. The classroom windows remain closed in addition to the constant roar of the furnace which makes the classroom a perfect breeding ground for germs. The Benefits of Dirt!While no parent wants their child to be sick, you have to remember that exposure to dirt and microbes allow the immune system to differentiate between harmful and harmless irritants. If we over sanitize and make every environment pristine, we are suppressing our immune systems and not giving them the opportunity to \"fine tune\" their responses. In fact, if the immune system is so used to a \"germ-free\" environment, it will attack everything that comes its way, which leads to allergies or sensitivities to normal substances. 1 I'm not saying that this is a good excuse never to clean your house, but there is a healthy balance. Avoid overusing hand sanitizers, antibacterial soaps, and stop avoiding \"germy places.\" Let you child play in dirt! Don't worry about bathing your children every single night to \"get the germs off.\" Sanitize in moderation and don't be afraid of a few germs. Exposure to germs BENEFITS the immune response. Feed Your BodyAnother issue causing our suppressed health over the winter months is the food that we eat. Winter months usually mean carb-laden comfort foods, which are rarely nutrient dense. In order for waste to be eliminated from our bodies, we need good nutrition and exercise \u2014both of which seem to be lacking in the colder months. Make sure your child is consuming leafy greens such as spinach and kale. If they won't eat them on their own, \"tuck\" them into foods they enjoy or make a fruit/veggie smoothie. Gut health is essential for all of our body's processes. In fact, 32 Aromatherapy Journal Winter 2017.4 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to Top70% of our entire immunity resides in our gut.2 Not only can good nutrition play a role, but good bacteria can as well. This is where the use of probiotics is helpful. Try to get your probiotics with food first. Fermented foods such as sauerkraut and drinks such as kefir (a fermented milk drink) are great sources. You can also add a probiotic supplement to your daily routine. Herbs with Immune-boosting Properties On the herbal side, I like to incorporate the use of Elderberry syrup. Elderberry ( Sambucus nigra) boasts high antioxidant activity and it is immune-boosting. Combine elderberry syrup with honey to give an extra boost in nutrients to the body. Taken this way, elderberry is more palatable for children. Essential Oils with Immune PowerWhen it comes to essential oils for immune support in children, it is important to note that you don't need the \"heavy hitting\" essential oils to get the job done. Children really resonate with essential oils and gentle essential oils give them the push they need to bring their bodies back to balance. When diffusing, use only a few drops and limit exposure to 15-20 minute increments, then turn off the diffuser for at least an hour. When using topically with children over the age of two years, start with a 1% dilution, which is five-six drops of essential oils to one ounce of carrier oil. The essential oils which I have found to reap great benefits in immune support for children are as follows: Ho Wood (Cinnamomun camphora ct. linalool) is derived from wood and it has a floral, woodsy aroma. It is very high in linalool, which stimulates the immune system and has strong activity against some bacteria and fungi. It calms nerves and soothes tension. Lessening the stress response, it can improve immune function. It is a tonic to the body, which means it supports and strengthens overall health. Rosalina (Melaleuca ericifolia) is derived from leaves and twigs and it has a warm, earthy, herbaceous aroma. It is known as lavender tea tree and it has anti-infectious properties. This is a softer, more pleasant smelling alternative for those who dislike the aroma of tea tree ( Melaleuca alternifolia) essential oil . Rosalina essential oil is also high in the chemical component of linalool but it has a touch of the component 1,8 cineole as well which can be of extra benefit for respiratory system support. The oxidized essential oil can be skin irritating. Thyme ct. linalool to TopIImmune Power for Kids with Aromatherapy continued it has a soft, herbal aroma, unlike its other chemotypes. Be sure to check the chemotype of the essential oil as you want to use this specific gentle yet effective chemotype with children. It is an excellent airborne anti-microbial which stimulates the immune system. If using topically, a 1% dilution is recommended.Palmarosa (Cymbopogon martini var. motia) is derived from grass and it has a fresh, rosy, almost powdery aroma. It is an airborne anti-microbial and immune stimulating essential oil. It is best known for its affinity to the skin, especially with regard to fungal issues. There is a maximum dermal dose of 6.5%. 3 One forgotten gem about palmarosa essential oil is its anxiety-relieving power, which can have a positive effect on children who worry about illness. An essential oil high in d-limonene, such as grapefruit (Citrus x paradisi) , lemon (Citrus x limon) , or sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) , has been shown to activate white blood cells.4 This specific chemical component helps to stimulate the immune system. Adding these essential oils to any immune blend is a welcome and familiar addition for children. Not only do these essential oils support the immune system, they are uplifting and familiar. Children resonate with citrus essential oils and enjoy the gentle ambiance of them in the air. Proceed with caution when using cold-pressed lemon and lime essential oils topically, due to phototoxicity concerns. As mentioned above, harsh essential oils are not necessary, nor more effective with immune support for children. I see a lot of parents advised to put aromatherapy blends containing dermal sensitizers, such as ( Eugenia caryophyllata) essential oils, on the soles of the feet of small children to keep them healthy. This is a practice I do not recommend. Not only do these popular blends contain essential oils that are contraindicated for children, all age groups should avoid daily topical use of sensitizing essential oils. Doing Perfect Attendance! Diffuser Blend and Use: Combine essential oils in a 5 ml glass bottle. Add 5-6 drops to an aromatherapy diffuser as needed. Refer to the diffuser manufacturer's guidelines for use. Stay Away Germs! Personal Inhaler Essential Oils: 4 drops sweet Instructions for Making and Use: Add the essential oils drop by drop to an organic cotton wick of an aromatherapy personal inhaler. Cap. When needed, remove the cap and inhale. Replace cap after use.34 Aromatherapy Journal Winter 2017.4 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to Topso increases the risk of sensitization, a serious condition where severe and permanent effects can occur when exposed to the essential oil. As children are so sensitive to natural remedies, your first course of action whenever exposed to germs should be to focus on nutrition and the diffusing of essential oils that are gentle yet effective. These essential oils will support the body and bring it back to balance, which makes for a happier child and parent. References 1. NBC News website, Is it Possible to be Too Clean?

These glands, although small, cannot be ignored. They have a tremendous impact on our long-term health and quality of life. The purpose of our adrenal glands is to mitigate stress. These stressors can be physical, emotional, psychological, environmental, and even infectious. When the demand of stress is higher than our body's ability to adapt to and recover from that stress, our bodies become deficient. Adrenal Fatigue and Hormonal Balance Our adrenal glands are responsible for produc - ing, regulating and dispensing our hormones. Therefore any dysfunction, in relation to our adrenal glands, is directly related to hormonal balance. Hormonal imbalance is a result of a lack of homeostasis. Prolonged lack of homeo - stasis is the beginning of all disease. Hormones Produced by Our Adrenal Glands Epinephrine is responsible for our ability to reason and act on potentially lifesaving decisions. It is also known as adrenaline. Adrenaline determines how we respond to the \"fight or flight\" response. Cortisol contributes to blood sugar regulation, keeping inflammation under control, and managing how well our bodies adapt to stress. Aldosterone assists in the regulation of sodium, potassium, and electrolytes as well as fluid volume. Progesterone, along with estrogen and testos- terone play an inherent role in brain function. They help to maintain balance in our menses and sex hormones. Our hormonal balance is key to homeostasis, in turn, our overall wellness. It is also key to avoiding serious chronic and or long-term health concerns. Who is at Risk? Anyone who suffers from extended periods of stress or an overwhelming situation. If you suffer from emotional or physical trauma. Going extended periods of time without sufficient rest. The inability to leave an unhealthy relationship or situation whether it be personal or professional. Prolonged or reoccurring illness or sudden life changes, such as the loss of a loved one, or loss of a job/career leading to extended financial challenges. Adrenal Fatigue or Hypoadrenia (Hypo~ Low) (Adrenia ~related to the adrenals): Denotes a low functioning or a deficiency in the function of our adrenals glands. 36 Aromatherapy Journal Winter 2017.4 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to TopAccording to the Center for Disease and Control (CDC) 75-90% of all visits to health care providers are stress related.1 Signs and Symptoms of Adrenal Fatigue Most mainstream allopathic health professionals do not believe that adrenal fatigue exists. Therefore they do not test for it, and attribute clear signs of adrenal fatigue to other potential illness. Although complicated, the key to recovering from adrenal fatigue is best supported by over-the-counter (OTC) methods. \"There is no big money to be made by pharmaceutical companies. No patentable treatments.\" 2 Therefore it is up to you to recognize the signs and symptoms: Fatigue Allergies Insomnia Blood Sugar Fluctuations Anxiety or Panic Attacks Poor Memory Muscular and Joint Pain Depression Fertility Complications Digestive Disorders Headaches Sensitivity to Cold Food addictions or Cravings Low or No Libido Inability to Concentrate. Be prepared when working with your healthcare provider. The following list of tests are basic labs that can help your provider to determine how well your adrenal glands may or may not be functioning.Labs to Request: Saliva Hormone Testing DHEA-S Levels Urine Samples Blood Test. What are Adaptogens and Why do We Need Them? The term adaptogen was coined in 1947 by Dr. Lazarev, a Russian Scientist. However, the formal working definition was not formed until 1968, by Dr. Darymovhe, as \"A substance that normalizes or modulates a biochemical process or tissue function.\" 2 An adaptogen meets the hormone at its current level and then compensates for any deficiency by modulating or balancing the physiological process so that it can return to a normal functioning state. An adaptogen provides active support, so the body can avoid total collapse, increasing the body's threshold to resistance or stress or stressors. This then allows our body to return to a state of homeostasis. Adrenal Fatigue: Recognizing the Symptoms and Using NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal37 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 Type of Adaptogens are Best? Phyto-therapeutic adaptogens are very unique. They have the power to sedate, stimulate or maintain balance, or to modulate. This can depend on exactly what is needed by the body at that time. There are usually no negative side-effects. Synthetic drugs are simply not capable of doing this. In order to qualify as an adaptogen, the substance must be: Free of toxins. Have the ability to produce a physical, chemical or biological response in the body. Normalize, balance or modulate a physiological process. Five Tools to Complete Recovery Here are five tools that can help you to recover, when used properly: 1. A Nutrient Dense Diet 2. Vitamins 3. Essential Fatty Acids 4. Essential Oil Adaptogens 5. Herbal Adaptogens.1. A Nutrient Dense Diet Foods to Eat: Low glycemic foods. Alkaline foods. Foods high in fiber. Lean protein 75-100g per day. Balance of complex carbohydrates, vegetables, and lean protein. Super-foods (many super-foods are also adaptogenic): Kale, spinach, sweet potatoes, beans, berries, whole grains. Vegetable juice instead of fruit juice. Plant-based milk, and 80-100 ounces of water per day. Tip: Keep a food diary or use a food-tracking app. Foods to Avoid: Sugar and sugar-laden products such as soda, candy, and cookies. Coffee or other stimulants. Hydrogenated oil. Fried and fast foods. Foods that you are allergic to. Gluten and salt (Including foods high in these two ingredients). 2. Vitamins and Minerals that Support Adrenal Fatigue Vitamin C Vitamin E Vitamin B complex Magnesium and calcium Prebiotics and probiotics to help support digestion.Adrenal Fatigue: Recognizing the Symptoms and Using Phyto-Therapy continued38 Aromatherapy Winter 2017.4 \u00a9 Copyright for Adrenal Fatigue Omegas 3's play an important role in heart and brain health which includes the following:2 Managing blood pressure. Keeping triglycerides in check. Preventing blood clots. Preventing heart palpitations and tachycardia. Increasing production of serotonin and dopamine. Decreasing inflammation in the brain. The above are all common complications from those suffering from adrenal fatigue. Consider supplementing with: Plant-based omega 3's: Flax, Co-Q-10. 4. Essential Oils: Adaptogens that Smell Good Are essential oils adaptogenic? Yes, some essential oils qualify as adaptogens. There are essential oils that have the ability to sedate, stimulate or modulate, depending on the need at a particular time. These essential oils can, and do, affect the body's physiological processes. They are supporting the body so that it can more effectively adapt to stress. How does this happen? By means of an essential oil's unique and balanced chemical profile. This is why some essential oils may have the ability to calm or sedate, while also having the ability to uplift of stimulate our central nervous system. Examples of some adaptogenic essential oils: oils are derived from adaptogenic herbs .3 You may use any combination of the above essential oils that are aromatically pleasing to you. Always dilute the essential oils in a carrier oil, such as sunflower (Helanthius annuus) oil, at a maximum of 3%. Reapply your blend every 2-3 hours. A non- diluted blend is good for diffusers, but do NOT apply topically to the skin. For more assistance choosing an aromatherapy blend which is right for you, seek a professional consultation by a qualified Aromatherapist. 5. Herbs: The Original be selected based on your individual needs and are best taken in combination. Do not hesitate to consult a certified or registered herbalist when making your selection. This will help ensure any herbs Adrenal Fatigue: Recognizing the Symptoms and Topyou choose are not contraindicated for your specific circumstances, such as pregnancy, breastfeeding, medications or allergies. The Road to Recovery Adrenal fatigue can wreak havoc in your life. It can interfere with your metabolism, changing the shape of your body. It can alter your mental state and kill your sex drive. You may be left feeling like you lack total control. A full recovery is possible. However, recovery starts with an accurate diagnosis. Just be prepared in advance that you will need to do your own research. Most of what is required to achieve a full recovery lies within your power and willingness to make the necessary diet and lifestyle changes.References: 1.

Primary VZV infection causes chickenpox which most commonly affects children. After primary infection, viruses retreat to dorsal root ganglia of the nervous system, and can remain dormant for decades. In 10-20% of cases VZV reactivates and causes shingles. It's unclear how the virus remains in the body or reactivates but risk factors include advanced age, poor immune function caused by stress, illness, injury, certain medications, and having chickenpox before eighteen months of age. Anyone that has had chickenpox may develop shingles. Exposure to shingles will not cause you to get shingles, but a person who has not had chickenpox or a varicella vaccination could develop a primary infection (chickenpox) if they come in contact with the fluid in the shingles blisters. 1, 2 This article will focus on secondary VZV infection (shingles) and essential oil therapy. What are the Symptoms of Shingles? Shingles symptoms happen in stages as the virus moves along nerve fibers, multiplies, and returns to the skin. Shingles can produce flu-like symptoms, headache, and sensitivity to light, dizziness, or weakness. Typically itching, tingling, or pain is present. After a few days, a rash may appear in a band or small area, usually on one side of the body. Ordinarily the rash turns into a cluster of blisters, which fill with fluid and crust over, and then may take two to four weeks to heal. Some people get only a mild rash or no rash at all. This progression is typical of shingles and usually distinctive enough to make a correct diagnosis from other herpes infections . The most common complication from shingles is post- herpetic neuralgia (nerve pain) and headaches that may continue for months to years. Allopathic treatment of shingles includes antiviral and pain medications. Antiviral medications ideally begin within the first seventy two hours of seeing the rash, in order to shorten the length of the illness and prevent complications. 3, 4, 5 How can Essential Oil Therapy Help? Essential oil therapy can support, or be used alongside of, allopathic treatment, or used in a preventative manner in at-risk populations. Preventive aromatherapy measures could include emotional, immune, and sleep support as well as measures to manage stress. Support measures for those presenting with symptoms 42 Aromatherapy Journal Winter 2017.4 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to Topof shingles would include using essential oils and carriers with antiviral, analgesic, neuroleptic, and skin soothing properties, as well as supporting emotional health. Which Essential Oils are Most Effective? Preventative care includes reducing stressors. Adequate sleep, clean fresh air and water, gentle-to-moderate exercise, wholesome nutrition, and relaxation are important. Essential oils can offer support. For example, essential oils containing linalool demonstrate anti-anxiety, immunostimulant, anti-spasmodic, and sedative properties oils low dilutions into personal care products, inhalers, and diffusers supports healthy emotional response, relaxation, and sleep. 6, 7, 8 For a shingles outbreak, essential oils and carriers with anti-viral, analgesic, neuroleptic, and skin healing properties are beneficial (with the caveat that any essential oil used should be non-irritant and gentle on the skin). 9, 10, 11, 12 Ravintsara essential oil acts as an antiviral agent and tamanu (Calophyllum inophyllum) oil stimulates phagocytosis, a primary pathway to remove pathogens and cellular debris. 13Application should start at onset of symptoms and applied frequently (four to five times or more per day). Dr. Kurt Schnaubelt reports \"this treatment almost invariably offers stunning relief from the excruciating pain and brings renewed quality of life.\" Effects are expected within two days to a week. If pain persists after blisters disappear frequent application of Roman chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile) hydrosol may bring relief. 14 Additional suggested essential oils include blue gum eucalyptus ( Wort (Hypericum perforatum ) infused carrier oil is also suggested as an effective anti-viral agent, mood enhancer, and neuroleptic. 15 A 50:50 blend of (Cinnamomum camphora) essential oil (a strong antiviral) Varicella Zoster and Shingles continued Winter 2017.4 (Calophyllum inophyllum ) oil has also Ravensara aromatica and ravintsara (Cinnamomun camphora confused and currently ravintsara (Cinnamomun camphora) essential oil appears to be the preferred essential oil for shingles. Ravensara aromatica essential oil is purported to be a strong antiviral and nerve tonic. It is particularly rich in monoterpenes. Ravintsara ( Cinnamomun camphora ) essential oil is rich in oxides and monoterpenes and it is also considered an effective antiviral and safe nerve tonic, as well as being gentle. Thus it is important to verify scientific names to ensure which essential oil you are using.In one case study where ravintsara (Cinnamomun camphora) essential oil and tamanu (Calophyllum inophyllum) oil were not immediately available the therapist began with the oils she \"had on hand\" followed by the 50:50 mixture described above. 16 The client requested more for pain relief and an undiluted application of 40% blue gum eucalyptus ( Eucalyptus globulus) essential Mentha x piperita) essential oil five to six times per day was used for four days. This was followed by the 50:50 blend three times per day. With this approach the skin was Varicella Zoster Virus and Shingles continued Editor's Note: Tisserand and Young in their book Essential Oil Safety , 2nd Edition (UK: Churchill Livingstone), list Cinnamomum camphora CT, cineole CT or camphor CT) essential oil. The authors go on to state that although it \"is generally referred to simply as 'ho leaf oil. [...] Curiously, it is sometimes referred to as 'ho wood oil'.\" Additionally, Tisserand and Young state that ho leaf CT cineole essential oil is known as ravinstsara oil if it originates from Madagascar. Ravensara ( Ravansara aromatica ) essential oil also originates from Madagascar\u2014wherein lies confusion. Ravansara aromatica essential oil is also available as both a leaf and bark oil, although Tisserand and Young state that it is usually the leaf oil which is \"sold for aromatherapy use.\" Editor's Safety Note: Even though those in categories such as pregnancy, seniors, and children might be susceptible to herpes infections, take the usual cautions when using the essential oils mentioned with these client groups. In some cases, essential oils may not be appropriate for use, or they may need to be used at a lower dilution rate. Owing to the confusion and ravintsara (Cinnamomum camphora ) essential oils, make sure you know exactly which essential oil (and chemotype) you are using, and how, or if, it can be used appropriately for the client in question. Consult a certified aromatherapist for further advice in individual cases.44 Aromatherapy Journal Winter 2017.4 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to Topnearly clear and pain was gone within nine days of the onset of the rash.16 Conclusion Essential oils and carrier oils have proven effective against shingles especially when applied at the onset of symptoms. Addressing stressors that can act as triggers to shingles outbreak can be very beneficial. Adequate sleep, wholesome nutrition, taking time to relax, and incorporating tonic essential oils into personal products can go a long way towards supporting the health of the body. References: 1.

It is comprised of about 540 different species. Many of these plant species are woody plants that produce fragrant resins or oils in their bark. Members of this plant family often have leaves that alternate along the stem and are composed of many leaflets, solitary or clustered flowers and fleshy fruits. 1 Some species contain much larger amounts of resin and burn so fiercely that they are commonly called torchwoods . This plant group is valued in the perfume and incense industries and has long been used in religious and sacred ceremonies (including embalming) throughout history. The Burseraceae Plant Family in Aromatherapy The most common essential oils from the Burseraceae plant family are steam distilled from the wood, bark and resins of the trees. This group of essential oils are generally analgesic, calming, and good for the treatment of wounds and aging skin.

Although the chemistry differs slightly between each species, the therapeutic properties are very similar and each variety has its own distinct aroma. Some sources claim that Boswellia sacra and Boswellia carteri are one in the same, but one study concluded that they are indeed two different species. 2 Left to Right: Resins of Myrrh (Commiphora myrrha.

Fragrance and Wellbeing , as the sub title suggests - Plant Aromatics and Their Influence on the Psyche - addresses how fragrance strongly links to our soul and spirit, and how each aroma plays a different part in addressing the problems of the mind. Aromatherapeutic Blending gives the reader a tool, or method, on how to bring these aromas, or essential oils, together in a synergistic blend to address the physical and emotional issues we may experience during life. Both books contain a lot of information: Fragrance and Wellbeing is over 400 pages and Aromatherapeutic Blending is over 300 pages. Fragrance and Wellbeing has comprehensive descriptions - at approximately 200 pages - of the wide variety of natural aromas to be found in the plant world. These include \"woody, coniferous, citrus, herbaceous, green, agrestic, floral, fruity, and cineolic\" aromas, in addition to the \"sub-categories\" that \"fine-tune\" these aromatic descriptions. In spite of my decade-plus long experience in the world of aromatherapy, I learned many new things from this part of the book. Students of my course program know that I encourage learning of essential oils through descriptions of their aromas from the beginning, and this book would be a good aid to the aromatherapist interested in developing their aromatic vocabulary! Aromatherapeutic Blending looks at the formulation of essential oil blends and how to get the \"best\" synergistic \" formula\" for the condition presented by each client. This book gives you some techniques for perfecting aromatherapy blends for such conditions as acne, pain, inflammation, infections, wounds, allergies, anxiety, and depression. There is also a profile on many of the common essential oils in relation to evidence-based practice and blending suggestions. An example is given in the case of acne of how Jennifer Peace Rhind's interest in aromatherapy developed from, among others, a career in flavor development. Two of her books, Fragrance and Wellbeing and Aromatherapeutic Blending reflect her years of teaching and study into aromatics and how they can be used for health. I was honored when Jennifer agreed to talk to me about these two books and answer some questions about her inspiration and interpretion of this complex subject area. Author Jennifer Peace Rhind54 Aromatherapy Journal Winter 2017.4 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to Topto use aromatherapeutic blending to create a synergistic blend, using the method described in the book. In summary, these two books are invaluable resources for the serious aromatherapist intent on improving both their fragrance and therapeutic blending techniques. They are two reference books which I will continue to refer to, both for inspiration and knowledge, each time I formulate either a scent or therapeutic blend for my clients. You can purchase a copy of both Fragrance and Wellbeing and Aromatherapeutic Blending through the NAHA bookstore. An Interview with Jennifer Peace RhindNAHA's Aromatherapy Journal recently caught up with Jennifer to ask her a few ques - tions about the two books discussed above.Which of these two books did you learn the most from in the research you carried out in the writing of the book? Or were they both insightful in different ways? Can you give an example of something from the book/s which inspired you, and that you perhaps didn't know prior to your research. Both books were valuable learning experiences. When I am working on a book, I try to let the manuscript evolve in accordance with my literature searching - so it takes on a life of its own, and takes me on a journey of discovery! I like to absorb and reflect, look around, make connections as I write - and I always feel that I am in a dialogue with my readers. Often the published research is supportive of our practice, and it is wonderful to include this, contextualize it, and make it meaningful and accessible for practitioners, and this was one of the main aims of Aromatherapeutic Blending. Fragrance and Wellbeing was considerably wider in scope and allowed me to explore literature from very diverse disciplines - and so naturally I learned more, and had the opportunity to present some novel perspectives on the impact of fragrance - on every aspect of our being. It's difficult to single out just one aspect that inspired me - but the concept that we select scents which enhance our biological signature is fascinating; the revelation that training our sense of smell can result in higher cognitive processing led me to explore Japanese incense traditions; and the role of fragrance in eliciting altered states of consciousness is endlessly intriguing! But what struck me most is the timelessness of natural scents - when we smell scents in their natural context or state, maybe a rose flower, or saffron stigmas, we are having the same experience as our distant ancestors. It is a precious, beautiful and enduring connection with our collective past. In addressing the title of the book, Fragrance and Wellbeing: Plant Aromatics and Their Influence on the Psyche, just how important is fragrance, or what part does fragrance play, to our overall wellbeing? I believe that it is crucial! The devastating impact of the loss of the sense of smell has been well documented yet most of us take our sense of smell for granted, most of the time, perhaps not stopping to appreciate its subtle yet profound effects. Even in aromatherapy, we tend to focus on the physiological impact of scents - looking at the role of specific oils in promoting positive mood changes, or maybe Interview with Jennifer Peace Rhind continuedWinter 2017.4 love how your book, Fragrance and Wellbeing: Plant Aromatics and Their Influence on the Psyche, addresses not just those plants which are used as oils and extracts in aromatherapy and natural perfumery, but those which are used simply as plants in the garden. For example, cottage garden scents, which are rarely used in aromatherapy because of the difficulty in extracting a lot of these aromas. In your opinion, do you think that scents used as oils/extracts affect us differently than those simply inhaled in the garden? How do the aromas differ? Yes, I do think that the effects are different. The effects of inhaling aromatic oils can be measured using, for example, EEGs, MRI scans, various physiological parameters, psychological self-reporting scales and so on. But if you inhale the fragrance of a scented plant in a garden it is so very different. Of course the scent itself will be different - as \"headspace analysis\" can reveal, the aromatic molecules are unaltered by extraction processes, and they evaporate into the atmosphere in a different way - but I think that the big difference is that you are experiencing Interview with Jennifer Peace Rhind continued in beauty and connecting with the natural world, centered in awareness rather than mental activity, and, most importantly, being completely and utterly in the moment.\" This is exactly how the conscious appreciation of (and connection with) fragrance can enhance wellbeing! enhancing cognitive processes. Now, this is important and it represents a conscious attempt to harness the benefits of fragrance. I think fragrance can influence every aspect of our being - on an emotional level it can elicit a sense of calm and peace; it can bring pleasure and stimulate focus and creativity. But more than that, it is evocative and beautiful and can help us transcend negative or destructive feelings, and when we become immersed in its presence it can take us to another level of consciousness. In the book, I defined wellbeing as feeling \"calm but alert, perhaps feeling a sense of wonder, or being engaged in a creative activity, or observing and immersing the self 56 Aromatherapy Journal Winter 2017.4 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to Topthe scent in its natural context. Your other senses will be involved - you might hear the wind moving leaves, feel the sun on your skin, you might be moved by the visual beauty of the flower, or its surroundings, you will also be smelling other flowers, leaves, the soil - you will be connecting with the natural world- and experiencing what it is like to \"be in the moment.\" Weber and Heuberger (2008), at the experimental Duftgarten (fragrant garden) in Vienna, explored this and revealed the subtle yet profound effects of scents when experienced in this context. 1 We can also see this in the Japanese practice of shinrin-yoku- \"forest bathing\"-where the scent of conifers and the forest environment affords numerous health benefits. In a few sentences, can you simply describe the term: Aromatherapeutic blending? Can you give us a quick example of an aromatherapeutic blend for pain? I used the term \"aromatherapeutic blending\" to describe the process of selecting essential oils to create synergistic blends for specific therapeutic purposes. There are synergistic interactions between molecules in each and every essential oil. For example, we know that l-linalool and linalyl acetate together produce a stronger anxiolytic effect than either constituent acting alone, and we find this particular synergy occurring in several essential oils including true lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), clary mint ( Mentha citrata). It is also very likely that minor and even trace components will contribute to therapeutic actions too - and so it presents a highly complex picture, especially when we realise that there are not only principal active ingredients but also \"co-effectors,\" and that synergy is context dependent! When we combine essential oils in blends, the picture becomes even more complex. For millennia, it has been known that some extracts work synergistically (think of frankincense [Boswellia species] and myrrh [Commiphora species])- and herbal traditions abound with formulae that exploit this phenomenon. So, I set out to explore the ways in which we can go about creating synergistic blends - from the molecular to traditional and holistic/energetic perspectives. For example, we could look to component research to inform a blend for joint pain. This could include the monoterpenol l-linalool, and the monoterpenes d-limonene, -caryophyllene, para-cymene and -myrcene - all of which are noted for their antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory actions. So, we could select true lavender Lavandula fragrans ), which would give us a blend containing these specific components. Or, we could create blends inspired by traditional aromatic combinations, where the actions of indigenous herbs and spices and their combinations have been observed, tried and tested over many years - such as the Thai formula for joint and muscle pain, which Piper nigrum ) and sandalwood ((Santalum album) which could be substituted with (S. austrocaledonicum)). Or, if we were taking a more holistic approach, we need to look at the type and context of pain. Here we might adopt the \"therapeutic positions\" model, where we select a main active essential oil, which will bring all round benefits to the condition, a second essential oil which will reinforce one or more of its properties, and then essential oils which will support this specific combination, and essential oils to give direction. For example, to address digestive discomfort accompanied by cramp and emotional distress, we need analgesic, antispasmodic, anti-inflammatory and mood-elevating aromatics such vulgare var. uplifting aurantifolia ) ( Citrus ( Xanthoxylum piperitum ) to \"direct\" the blend to the gut. Is there any particular aroma/plant/oils/group of oils etc. which you personally identify with more than others, and, if so, why? When I studied artisan perfumery it was clear to all present that my heart lay with the agrestic aromas - those that are reminiscent of the natural world - and especially with hay absolute and blackcurrant bud absolute. I also adore saffron, it is a bit of an obsession, and the more I learned about it the more immersed I became. I could lose myself in saffron! Saffron was my trigger for studying neurogastromony. I love the scents of the garden \u2014rosemary, artemisia, tea roses, sweet peas, peonies and carnation/dianthus\u2014because of the happy memories and good feelings that they evoke. I love the richness of base notes of patchouli and sandalwood, nagarmotha, labdanum and most incense; these scents make me feel grounded and relaxed. I will often wear attars as personal fragrances, but to my horror saffron attar does not sit well on my skin, and it makes me hot, irritable and headachy-it is not a good \"remedy\" for me-unlike rose or henna flower which balance my constitution!

I guess it highlights the difference between hedonics and therapeutics! References: 1. Sandra T.

Client also has homozygous MTHFR A1298C and CBS C699T gene mutations that cause the liver to have difficulty detoxing. May 23 2017: Client received a second degree burn from scalding water that covered over half of the front of the left thigh. Clothing was removed immediately as the scalding water hit the leg in order to avoid the skin sticking to the fabric, though some skin was actually disfigured by this move. Bubbling and discoloration of the skin also occurred. The first consultation was five minutes after the burn occurred,* and the client was still in a state of shock. Aromatherapy was used throughout the healing process. Client chose not go to the Emergency Room (ER) (which might have been advisable), but did go to the doctor two days after the burn occurred. Silver Sulfadiazine was prescribed by the doctor and was used for five applications only, as she decided not to use it due to her problems with detoxing; Silver Sulfadiazine puts additional stress on the liver. *Case study actually refers to the author herself.Aromatherapy Blends Chosen Days 1-3: (May 23 ( Lavandula x intermedia ) hydrosol: Used as a spray, and chosen for its properties as a cicatrisant, as well as analgesic. Aloe vera (Aloe Barbadensis) gel: Used for its cooling and healing properties. For shock, an aromatherapy blend of 7 drops lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) essential oil, 4 drops lime ( Citrus aurantifolia ) essential oil, and 2 drops neroli ( Citrus aurantium var. amara (flos)) essential oil was used in an inhaler as needed for the remainder of the first day. Aloe vera (Aloe Barbadensis) 62 Aromatherapy Journal Winter 2017.4 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to TopDays 4-9 (May 26 - 31 2017) 4 oz. aloe vera gel with 40 drops tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) essential oil for its anti-infectious, anti-microbial and antibiotic properties, 40 drops lavender ( Lavandula angustifolia) essential oil for its analgesic, cicatrisant properties, 25 drops helichrysum ( Helichrysum angustifolium ) essential oil for its and 5 drops calendula ( Calendula officinalis) CO2 (heated to blend in with the rest of the mix) for its cicatrizant properties. Continued with lavandin hydrosol as needed as well on day four, then mixed 2 oz. of aloe vera gel with 2 oz. of lavandin hydrosol in the spray bottle and used that as needed for the pain and cooling. Also used silver sulfadiazine once a day for days 6-9. Days 10-30 (June 1 - 30, 2017): Continue use of aloe vera gel blend as detailed above. Healing oil blend: A mix of 1.5 oz. 0.25 oz. rosehip seed ( Rosa canina L. ) oil, all used for their wound healing properties. How the blends were used: The client used the blends as directed for the duration of the healing process. Days 1-3: Client could not bend knee for the first five hours and was experiencing pain between levels 8 and 10 on a scale of 0-10 in intensity. Burn could not be touched or covered with clothing or bedding. After five hours, bending of knee was possible, but extremely painful. Client could only sleep on right side with leg outside of bedding. Client also experienced some symptoms of shock, including a wave of faintness and nausea when the pain was very intense, or when looking at some of the blistering and malformed skin. [See photo 1.] Lavandin hydrosol: Client says the lavandin hydrosol took the pain from a level 8 to 10 on a scale of 0-10 in intensity to a 0 with application every 3-7 minutes the remainder of the first day. On the second and third days, the spray was needed about every 20-30 minutes. Aloe vera gel: Client applied a thin coat of aloe vera gel in the evening after the initial burn, plus once in the morning and once at night on day two. On day three, the aloe vera gel was applied at night. The aloe vera gel was also cooling and provided a nice coat of moisture especially for sleeping. Inhaler blend for shock: The inhaler was used every 20-30 minutes, and as needed, to relieve nausea and other shock-related symptoms. Client says this was very helpful, and kept her feeling balanced and calm. She took a couple of deep breaths of this blend when symptoms became more intense and it helped the symptoms to subside. Days 4-9: Client reported pain to be subsid - ing and changing, more from a burning pain, to a stinging and itchy pain during the healing Case Study: Second Degree Burn From Scalding Water continued 1Winter 2017.4 TopCase Study: Second Degree Burn From Scalding Water continued process. She also noticed major changes in redness and blistering overnight on many of the nights, but during the day the redness and stinging would increase. There were still no signs of infection. Blisters formed after walking around at an outdoor festival for 4-5 hours on day five. It was still impossible to cover the burn during this period as well, though gently touch - ing it was ok. Walking was still difficult and redness, itching and stinging seemed to be increasing as the wound was starting to heal on day six. [See photo 2.] Aloe vera blend: Used three times a day. Kept leg cool and hydrated, as well as keeping away infection. Lavandin hydrosol: Not needed as often on days 4-9, but it was soothing now and then when the burn was feeling warm. Lavandin/aloe blend: Client used this blend as needed at an outdoor festival. She wore a dress that did not touch the burn, and the festival was in a somewhat dusty field, so she felt an extra coating of protection the aloe provided would be beneficial to keep dust and dirt away from the wound as well as helping with the pain. Client was pleased with this blend, saying it worked well and she only needed to use it 3-4 times at the festival. Silver sulfadiazine: Used on days 6-9 in case of possibility of infection at the festival. In addition, the stinging, redness and itchiness increased, and the client felt it may be beneficial to generate a little extra anti- infectious activity with the increase of redness. Client reported no difference using this, and decided it was probably better not to continue to avoid putting any extra load on her liver, which she was feeling was somewhat taxed at the moment. Days 10-30: After substantial progress in healing, the client was ready for an oil-based blend. The itching was still present, but most of the stinging and burning was gone. The skin peeled, blisters formed in different areas and then subsided. New skin was formed. It was still painful to touch the skin with fabric or sleep on her left side, though near day seventeen, the client could do these things gently for brief periods of time. By day thirty, all of the old skin was gone. [See photos 3, 4, and 5.] Photo taken June 8 2 3 4Photo taken June 4 5Photo taken June 1164 Aromatherapy Journal 2017.4 \u00a9 NAHA Return to TopAloe blend: Still used 1-2 times a day. Helped with itchiness mostly. Oil blend: Used two to three times a day, and it was rubbed in thoroughly for about five minutes each time. It was painful to rub into the burn at first, but she felt like taking the time to rub it in to help penetrate the skin more effectively and quicker. Final Outcome: The client was surprised at how quickly the burn healed [See photo 6], as the doctor said it would take three to six weeks to heal, and with the client's slow healing history, she expected it to take at least six weeks. The client does have a substantial scar and some nerve damage in the area, which may be due to previous nerve damage in the same area, though now the damage isn't just an internal pain and itchiness, but also extra sensitivity of the skin and sensations in other locations than where the client touches. Client continued with the oil blend occasionally to help with this over time.
