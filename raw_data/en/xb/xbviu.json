To position the Department of Medicine at the forefront of this rapidly expanding landscape in the era of precision medicine, Mount Sinai has established a Division of Genomic Medicine. The mission of the Division of Genomic Medicine is to advance, implement, and scale genomic approaches to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. Over 140,000 commercial genetic tests are now available, with more added every day. However, the scarcity of genetics experts in healthcare, including medical geneticists and genetic counselors, limits the widespread utilization of meaningful genomic information. The need for delivery and interpretation of genomic results adds to growing demands on physicians in primary and specialty care, who are increasingly expected to interpret genomic findings, recognize genomic risk, and assimilate genomics into the care of their patients. Through patient-centered clinical applications, collaborative research, and innovative outreach and training programs, the Division of Genomic Medicine is dedicated to creating an individualized healthcare experience in which genomic data are a routine part of patient care. This Division supports physicians and scientists across the Mount Sinai Health System to bring genomics into all aspects of medicine. The creation of this Division underscores Mount Sinai's commitment to novel scientific discovery and its translation into the practice of medicine. "}
