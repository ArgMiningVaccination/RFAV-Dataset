First, a summary is provided of howhealing has been de ned within medicine. Second, the dimensionality of healing is discussed. Third, healing 's putative determinants are outlined. For biomedicine, heal-ing mainly concerns repair of wounds or lesions and isunidimensional. For complementary medicine, by contrast,healing has been de ned alternatively as an intervention, an outcome, and a process \u2014or all of these at once \u2014and ismultidimensional, impacting multiple systems from the cellular to the psychosocial and beyond. Notwithstandingthese usages, a review of medical texts reveals that healing israrely de ned, nor is its dimensionality or determinants described. Persistent lack of critical attention to the mean-ing of \"healing \"has implications for medical research and practice. Key words: healing, natural history, etiology, nosology, diagnostic criteria (Explore 2017; ]:]]]-]]] & 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.) What is healing? This probably seems like an odd question. The concept of healing and the word itself are ubiquitous inmedicine and healthcare. In both biomedicine and the eld of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), the termis invoked frequently. It appears, on occasion, in the title ofpeer-reviewed articles in the most prestigious medicaljournals \u2014over 200, in fact, within the past four decades in ofcial journals of the American Medical Association, and hundreds more if counting mentions in abstracts. It appears asa keyword or indexing term throughout the medical literature \u2014a PubMed search on the term \"healing \"turned up, at the time of this writing, over 190,000 pub lications dating back to 1872. Yet, despite these usages, wha t do we really know about healing? One article laments: We all know that healing is something good, something that we want, for ourselves and for our clients, but no one has ever satisfactorily explained just what it is, how ithappens, and how to get there. There could be no more worthy scienti c enterprise than nding answers to these fundamental questions about healing. Yet, for all the writing on this topic, both popular and scholarly, there is still considerable confusion. 1(p302) Within Western biomedicine, the concept of healing has a precise, generally agreed upon meaning. It refers to the curingof disease or restoration of health among medically illindividuals or populations. In formal terms, it is an outcomeof secondary-preventive actions directed at people who havecrossed the clinical horizon within the pathogenic stage of thenatural history of disease and have presented symptomati- cally. Healing thus designates successful movement in asalutogenic (rather than pathogenic) direction, one 's clinical or epidemiologic status reverting back from diseased to notdiseased. This represents the ultimate goal, stated or unstated,of most therapeutic interventions. Notwithstanding these acknowledged conceptual parame- ters, the word \"healing \"rarely appears in contemporary medical textbooks, and where it is used in medical journalarticles it generally has a much narrower construction. Theterm is invoked mostly in reference to adhesion or granula-tion of a focal lesion, such as a dermal wound or a fracture oran ulcer of some kind. Moreover, most biomedical researchwhich explicitly references a concept termed healing hastended to follow this perspective for as far back as currentbiomedical journals can be searched. In contrast is the prevailing conception of healing found in the growing scienti c and popular literatures on alternative health-related topics such as CAM, mind-body medicine,consciousness research, spirituality and healing, and holisticand New-Age medical practices. In these arenas, the termhealing is invoked frequently, yet is almost never de ned and is confusingly conceived of alternatively or, worse, simulta-neously as an intervention, an outcome or state, and aprocess. This disturbing trend was described: To some, healing is an intervention, as in Therapeutic Touch or Reiki. Healing is something done by healers \u2014a therapeutic modality delivered by a practitioner to a client. To others, healing is an outcome, such as recovery from illness or curing of a disease. As a result oftreatment, whether conventional or alternative, we hope to experience a healing. To still others, healing is a process \u2014for example, Antonovsky 's concept of e-mail: jeff_levin@baylor.eduBaylor University, One Bear Place # 97236, Waco, TX 76798 1 &2017 Elsevier Inc.

When the pathogenic process is halted, we then ideally may begin healing \u2014moving from a state of disease to a state of renewed health. In some unfortunate pieces of writing, healing is all three of these things at the same time. Healing is something practiced by healers that initiates a healing process so that we may obtain healing. All things to all people, healing, so used, as a construct for systematic research isthus close to worthless.1(p302) In the CAM eld, moreover, regardless of its de nition (or non-de nition), healing as typically invoked possesses two other notable characteristics. First, healing is usually assertedto be multidimensional, expressing itself at various \"levels \"\u2014 physical, bioenergetic, emotional, mental, spiritual, interperso-nal, societal, cosmic, etc. One may obtain or experiencephysical healing, emotional healing, spiritual healing, and thelike. Second, the salutogenic process which engenders (or is)healing is usually conceived as multifactorial \u2014as having multi- ple antecedents or determinants, analogous to the epidemio-logic concept of diseases of multifactorial etiology. Manydifferent things \u2014different concepts, variables, factors \u2014are said to cause or lead to healing. These twin assertions \u2014 multidimensionality and multifactoriality \u2014are supported primarily by hypothetical presumptions or anecdotal observa-tions, or are taken for granted, rather than validated bysystematic empirical ndings or postulated theoretical or etiologic models. An interesting situation thus presents itself.On the one hand, biomedicine has a clear de nition of healing, and a narrow, circumscribed usage. The word \"healing \" designates a concept primarily referencing the repair of a flesh or tissue wound. Healing is thus considered unidimensional \u2014 that is, conceptually limited to the repair of wounds \u2014though multifactorial in antecedents. Yet the word \"healing \"itself is rarely used, nor is there anything like a de nedeld of basic or clinical research devoted to salutogenesis or healing-as-a-process. Indeed, most physicians may make it through medical school and postgraduate education with little exposure to the word \"healing \"or the underlying concepts, other than in reference to closing of a wound. On the other hand, the CAM eld has been much looser with the term \"healing. \"It appears to mean whatever anyone wants it to mean. By consensus, it (whatever it is) is almostuniversally acknowledged as multidimensional and denselyladen with antecedents. The word is used all the time, inmyriad settings, and, within the context of spiritual healing, isnominally invoked in empirical research studies regularly,although such studies remain controversial and most are notvery sound. Alternative practitioners, moreover, use the word\"healing \"ubiquitously \u2014again, in its multitude of tenses \u2014but few have posited a reasoned de nition. There is much here to re flect upon, and a conceptual history of \"healing \"with special reference to contemporary usages is long overdue. Since words come to mean simplywhat general agreement would have them to mean, we are notinterested here in deciphering the \"true\"meaning of the English-language word healing, such as through deconstruct-ing its etymology. This has been done expertly elsewhere, 2 and the origins of the word are also well documented.According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the rst uses of \"healing \"as a noun, designating \"restoration to health; recovery from sickness; curing, cure, \"date to appearances in theGospel of Nicodemus (c. 1000) and Cursor Mundi (c. 1340); therst medical use dates to an appearance in Lanfranc 's Science of Cirurgie , vol. 68 (c. 1400).3(p53)Rather, the goal here is simply to trace the recent conceptual history of healing, inits multiple contexts, and to bring a modest sense of order toa topic that, to now, has been confusing and not adequatelydocumented. In so doing, we hope to make the case forhealing as a reasonable topic for basic and applied research inclinical, laboratory, and population-based settings. A central theme of this article is that programmatic research on healing has long been inhibited by (a) the conceptualnarrowness of the prevailing usage (or, rather, non-usage) of\"healing \"in medicine and biomedical science, coupled with (b) the lack of conceptual clarity among those in the CAMeld who have been more interested in issues ostensibly related to a broader take on healing. In other words,biomedicine has been conceptually clear about what it meansby healing yet has not generally recognized this phenomenonor process as systemic or multidimensional, while proponentsof CAM generally have acknowledged a multidimensionalityand multifactoriality of something which they refer to ashealing yet remain perpetually muddled with respect to anactual de nition. This is more than just a semantic issue. The words that we use, how we language things like healing \u2014our implicit denitions and conceptual models \u2014ultimately drive the questions that we ask and how we go about answering them.Were the word healing reserved for the more circumscribedusage, but in the broader context, then we would be betterprepared to undertake systematic investigation of the saluto- genic or healing process. This matters, as research on the process of healing promises to expand our understanding ofhow ill people become well and how states of disease becomestates of health, among both individuals and populations.Medical and healthcare research, so focused on the patho-genic process, must be better equipped conceptually andtheoretically in order to focus on healing. Clari cation of conceptual issues surrounding healing is a critical rst step in jump-starting a science of salutogenesis. This in turn canvaluably inform efforts to model what has been termed thenatural history of health, 4a theoretical counterpart to the familiar and pathogenically based natural history of disease. In elaborating upon these ideas, this article addresses the following issues, what metaphorically might be termed the \"diagnostic criteria, \"\"nosology, \"and \"etiology \"of healing. Too much should not be read into this metaphor \u2014it is not meant to be taken literally \u2014but it does provide a useful starting point for a much needed conceptual unpacking ofhealing. By invoking these concepts an effort will be made todiscuss how healing has been de ned, to describe the various circumstances under which it is believed to manifest, and to identify its presumed \"causes \"or antecedents, to the extent to which this is possible in light of present knowledge. Moreto the point, this article seeks to establish what healing isand what it is not \u2014conceptually speaking \u2014and why this matters. 2 EXPLORE ]2017, Vol. ], No. ] What is \"Healing\"?

Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.First, a review is provided of denitions of the concept of healing (its \"diagnostic criteria, \"if you will) taken from recent editions of authoritative medical dictionaries and leadingtextbooks in multiple medical specialties. These prevailingusages are then contrasted with those of representativewritings on healing from within the CAM eld and by authors who have addressed the topic of spiritual healing. Second, the dimensionality of healing (its \"nosology \")i s described. According to the consensus of contemporaryCAM writing on healing, the concept of healing designatesa multidimensional process occurring at numerous levels (i.e.,from the cellular to the organic to the psychosocial andbeyond). Healing is also said to operate as an integrated anddynamic process. If so, three hypothetical possibilities areproposed for how these multiple dimensions or levels ofhealing might interact \u2014separately, step-sequentially, or synchronously. Third, potential determinants of the healing process (its \"etiology \") are discussed. Outlined are the many factors ostensibly associated with successful therapeutic outcomes,recovery, and salutogenesis across the many dimensions ofhealing, according to proponents of the concept. Also notedis how therapies, mainstream or CAM, are often formulatedwith a unitary focus \u2014addressing a particular etiologic factor, usually in relation to only a single outcome representing asingle dimension of healing. By contrast, a revised under-standing of healing consistent with broader de nitions of healing might encourage us to develop therapies that aremultifactorial and systemic. \"DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA \": DEFINITIONS OF HEALING So, again, the question is posed: what is healing? Upon closeinspection, two distinct approaches to answering this ques-tion can be identi ed. One, which we might term the classical approach to de ning healing, is based on prevailing usages within biomedicine, both clinical practice and the basicsciences. The other, which can be termed the alternativeapproach, derives from usages found within the CAM arenaand within discussions from substantive areas even furtheraeld, such as among New-Age writers and in the literature on spiritual healing. These two approaches, as will be apparent,are dramatically divergent and have little in common. Classical de nitions of healing The rst and most obvious places to look for usages and denitions of the word \"healing \"are in and pathophysiology textbooks. Up-to-date and comprehen-sive medical dictionaries provide a reliable indicator ofprevailing conceptual trends and standard usages withinmedicine and medical science. The best pathophysiologytexts offer the most trustworthy summary overview of thoseconcepts that are seen as pertinent to the nuts and bolt of thedisease-making, and presumably disease-unmaking process.What does a review of these resources tell us about healing? To begin, an examination was made of recent editions of the major medical dictionaries. These included leadingEnglish-language medical dictionaries, as well as several otherprominent medical and healthcare dictionaries. The results are pretty consistent. According to Stedman 's, healing is \"Restoring to health; promoting the closure of wounds and ulcers. \" 5(p892)Dorland 's concurs: \"1. a process of cure, 2. the restoration of integrity to injured tissue. \"6(p825)Likewise Taber 's:\"The restoration to a normal mental or physical condition, especially of aninflammation or a wound. Tissue healing usually occurs in predictable stages ...\" 7(p1076)Black 's states, simply, \"See WOUNDS. \"8(p317)Other nursing, allied health, and healthcare dictionaries are mostly in agreement. Forexample, Mosby 's gives a lengthy two-part de nition which mirrors the others just listed, the primary de nition being \"1. the act or process in which the normal structural and functional characteristics of health are restored to diseased,dysfunctional, or damaged tissues, organs, or systems of thebody. \" 9(p809)Similarly, McGraw-Hill de nes healing as \"The process of returning to a previous state of health, \" noting, too, that \"the term is often used by alternative medical practitioners. \"10(p286) We see here the two standard usages noted in the introduction to this article: healing as the recovery fromdisease and healing as the closure of wounds. In bothinstances, healing is de ned as a process \u2014not as an inter- vention (as in the work of \"energy healers \") nor as an outcome (as in an equation of healing with the word \"cure\"). Through- out these dictionaries, the former usage (e.g., as in faithhealing) is sometimes included as a secondary or supplemen-tal entry which also makes use of the word healing, but isnever included under the primary de nition of the term. The latter usage (healing-as-outcome) does not appear at all. Healing-as-a-process suggests something akin to the con- cept of salutogenesis, proposed by Antonovsky 11,12as an alternative to the concept of pathogenesis. Whereas patho- genesis names the process of disease-making, depicted bymovement of a person or population through the stages andphases of the well-known natural history of disease, saluto-genesis names the process of restoration or recovery, depictedby movement through the stages and phases of what has beentermed the natural history of health. 4In sum, healing, as dened by the most prominent medical dictionaries, is about the restoration of health or of structural or functionalintegrity to a previously diseased or wounded body part ororgan system or whole person. Pathophysiology textbooks are mostly consistent with this usage. In the most recent editions of a representative group of textbooks used in medicine and nursing, \"healing \"is indexed, but textual discussion is limited to the repair of wounds. InRobbins and Cotran, there is an index entry for healing, but itpoints to material on wound healing in a chapter entitled,\"Inflammation and Repair. \" 13In Hammer and McPhee,14 healing is not indexed, but the text includes plenty of material on the healing of wounds. In McCance and Huether,15a popular text for nurses, there is an index entry only for\"wound healing. \"In none of these texts is the broader usage of healing as the curative or restorative process from diseaseobserved. Within the basic biomedical sciences, if these textsare an indication, \"healing \"means the closing up of an open wound and little else. What is \"Healing\"?

No other uses without permission. Copyright \u00a92017. Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.What about the clinical practice of medicine? How has healing been conceived of here? A similar perusal of leadingtextbooks in both internal medicine and family practice wasundertaken in order to identify usages of the word \"healing \" and references, if any, to the concept. Among leading internalmedicine texts and most family practice texts, there were noindex entries for \"healing \"to be found. For internal medicine, this included the most recent editions of Harrison 's, 16 Goldman-Cecil,17and Oxford.18Within these texts there were modest to extensive discussions of the healing ofwounds, under various headings. Among family practicetexts, including Rakel and Rakel, 19Taylor,20and Freeman,21 some discussion of wound healing was offered, in multiplecontexts, but in Rakel and Taylor the term was not indexed.Family practice texts, on the whole, compared to internalmedicine texts, were more inclined to feature brief materialon healing in the sense of recovery from illness. Another place where it was anticipated that the concept of healing might possibly be invoked is within textbooks ofpublic health, preventive medicine, and epidemiology.Granted, public health is about promotion of health andprevention of disease across populations, and epidemiology,the basic science of public health, is usually de ned as study of the distribution and determinants of morbidity andmortality in populations. Healing is thus not a concept thattypically appears in the goals and objectives of public healthor preventive medicine programs, nor as an outcome inepidemiologic investigations. At the same time, the over-arching concern with improving the health status of peopleand populations and with focusing on the needs of wholepersons rather than fragmented organ systems suggested thatthis might be a place in which healing is at least broached anddiscussed. This presumption was wrong. In none of the most recent editions of selected popular textbooks of public health,preventive medicine, or epidemiology that were surveyeddoes healing appear in the index. These include Maxcy-Rosenau-Last, 22Oxford,23and Jekel 's24among major public health and preventive medicine texts. In none of these booksis healing de ned or described \u2014neither in the index nor in the text. Among leading epidemiology texts, this sameabsence of material on healing is observed. 25-28Nor is healing addressed even in infectious disease epidemiology texts.29-32 Among leading infectious disease texts directed to clinical subspecialists, rather than to epidemiologists, there is somebrief material on wound healing, naturally, but the wordhealing is not listed in the index. 33,34By all appearances, \"healing \"is not a concept that has, or ever has had, any traction in these elds, outside of a requisite need for basic instruction on wound repair among infectious diseasedoctors. The paucity of de nitions and descriptions of healing in so many texts juxtaposed with usages of \"healing \"in so many journal articles is intriguing. Perhaps the de nition of healing is so well known and so precisely conceived (i.e., in terms of wound healing) that extended discussion of healing is seen asunnecessary or super fluous \u2014akin to the flow of blood through the circulatory vessels or the movement of air inand out of the lungs. What is there really to say? This is amistaken notion, but a prevalent one, perhaps. Or maybe the concept of healing is tacitly held not to have much broad-based clinical relevance and is thus ignored or taken forgranted. Yet this does not explain the usage of the word\"healing, \"repeatedly, in the write-up of nearly 200,000 published medical studies. Certainly, the idea of healingmeans something to somebody and implies things thatcannot be captured by any other word or concept. Alternative de nitions of healing One place in which \"healing \"does indeed mean something \u2014 although just what that is remains muddled \u2014is the eld of CAM. By the prevailing usages of the word and its impliedconceptual boundaries, it is as if CAM \u2014at least when it comes to healing \u2014were an alternate universe with little connection to the thinking and presumptions of biomedi-cine. The biomedical and CAM perspectives on healing havelittle in common. For one, as noted in this article 's intro- duction, there is the conceptual imprecision of writing onhealing \u2014the confounding of healing as an intervention, process or a state, and outcome. There is also the very special(and extra-muddled) case of spiritual healing, which itselfsuffers from a cacophony of usages. Careful and scholarly efforts have been made to bring greater organization, rigor, and precision to these alternativeconceptions of healing. Dossey reported on the ndings of a national consensus conference on de nitions and standards for healing research. 35Healing was de ned here as the \"physical, mental, social, and spiritual processes of recovery, repair, renewal, and transformation that increase wholeness,and often (though not invariably), order andcoherence. \" 35(pA11)Note how much more expansive this reads than simply wound healing. More recently,Zahourek 36expanded on the usages of \"healing also acknowledged, \"The term 'healing 'itself may be a challenge to those holding conventionalunderstandings of physiological processes. The term is used in diverse contexts in the popular and professional literature. \" 36(p6)The religious or spiritual component or dimension of healing is implicit in these contexts,indicating a process of salutogenic movement toward\"wholeness of the human spirit. \" 37(p16) Consulting leading textbooks of CAM also proved helpful. The concept of healing is explicitly invoked in all of them,although not necessarily along with a de nition. In Micozzi, there are numerous indexed entries and subentries on thetopic of healing, only one of which touches on woundhealing. In the text, the word healing appears over 70 times,in numerous systemic and domain-speci c contexts including as distinguished from curing. 38In Mosby, results are much the same, with even more uses, especially in a spiritualcontext. 39In Pizzorno and Murray,40healing is indexed in many ways and appears in the text in dozens of places, inmultiple contexts (natural healing, wound healing, spiritualhealing, healing relationships, healing crisis, healing vs.curing, and more). In Jonas and Levin, 41to add another twist, healing is not indexed, but the book includes chapterson\"Spiritual Healing, \"\"Qigong, \"and many non-Western healing systems, and dozens of appearances of \"healing \"in the 4 EXPLORE ]2017, Vol. ], No. ] What is \"Healing\"?

Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.text. While there is not much in the way of consensus, one point is clear: in the CAM world, \"healing \"\u2014whatever it may be \u2014refers to something more than the closing up of physical wounds. This heterogeneity of meanings is mirrored in published scienti c articles in the CAM literature, according to a search conducted of the NLM 's Complementary Medicine Subset on PubMed. Nearly 10,000 English-language human studieslisted in this Subset matched on the subject term \"healing, \" dating to 1946. Of the 100 most recent citations (at the timeof this writing), dating to 2015, 21 articles used this term torefer to healing in the context of an intervention (mostlyrelated to a spiritual, energy-related, or other CAM modality),seven used healing to refer to an outcome (mostly frompastoral or nursing sources), and 72 used the term in referenceto the process by which an intervention ideally precedes apositive outcome (almost all in the context of woundhealing). Among published peer-reviewed studies, as opposedto textbooks, wound healing thus remains the most prevalentusage of \"healing \"even within CAM. A non-systematic search of books in elds associated with CAM turned up results similar to the CAM textbooks ratherthan the peer-reviewed research literature. It was non-systematic in the sense that the present author began withhis personal library of over 300 books on these topics. Perusalof dozens of the most popular volumes on mind-bodymedicine, human consciousness, holistic health, and relatedNew-Age medical topics found that healing is used muchmore frequently in these elds in the context of an inter- vention, as in reference to therapies such as energy healing orother forms of touch healing and to the professional role ofhealer as one who performs something called healing. Arecent review of over 100 published sources also has sum- marized the breadth of alternative de nitions of healing, 42 but nearly two-thirds of these de nitions centered on healing- as-a-process and about one-third on healing-as-an-outcome.Relatively few treated healing as an intervention or therapeu-tic modality. A subset of the CAM literature involves the special case of spiritual healing. Throughout the literature on this subject, themultiple con flicting usages of \"healing \"seem to be especially confounded. For example, sometimes \"spiritual healing \"means the use of religious or spiritual methods, such as prayer orenergy work, for purposes of repairing or making whole thebody or mind. 43,44This is the most typical usage in in the CAM eld and among New-Age and energy healers. Other times it means the experience of having received help for aspiritual problem or an issue related to one 'ss p i r i to rs o u lo r attaining an evolved or fully realized relationship with God orthe divine, whether in a traditionally religious or a metaphys-ical context. 45Yet other times it refers to the dynamic process of spiritual growth or self-actualization. There are many representative examples of this, often describing or explaining the spiritual healing process in relation to various arcaneconcepts, whether theological or cosmological \u2014for traditional religious healers, 46or having to do with, say, the chakras or subtle bodies \u2014for New-Age healers.47A recent work treats this subject in an especially clear and scholarly fashion.48In some discussions, spiritual healing is referenced in each of these ways at once, often haphazardly but on occasion,usually in esoteric contexts, with considerable insight. In onesuch discussion of the work of spiritual healers, the spiritualhealing process is detailed in terms of human bioenergeticsystems, emphasizing the experience of spiritual healing inone's life. 49It is with reference to spiritual healing that one is especially liable to encounter healing referenced in all itstenses simultaneously \u2014as an intervention, an outcome, and a process. The most comprehensive and scholarly take everpublished on healing, in all of these usages, is found in thecollected works of Daniel J. Benor, notably his multi-volumeSpiritual Healing . 50 Besides creating substantial challenges for scholarly engage- ment of this subject, such multiple and competing usages areproblematic for a different reason. The imprecision inlanguaging healing serves to marginalize and stigmatize whatis actually quite an interesting topic. For sure, there is thelurid aspect of this subject. \"Spiritual healing, \"for many medical professionals, connotes fraudulent faith healers ofboth the televangelist and psychic variety. But the phrase isalso valuably used as a descriptor in myriad psychotherapeu-tic, psychospiritual, and bioenergetic systems, includingcredentialed forms of bodywork, as well as in ministry andpastoral care. 51The connection between faith and healing, generally, has a solid naturalistic foundation theoretically,52 as well as more empirical support than biomedical scientistsand clinicians may realize. 53Regardless, if the narrower, and admittedly contentious, issue of spiritual healing remainsfringe among scholars and scientists, no matter a potentiallysubstantive value, then its proponents have mostly themselvesto blame. There is a price to pay for playing fast and loosewith words and concepts and for laxity in de ning what it is that one is about. The demedicalization of healing An interesting observation is that features of the respective classical and alternative de nitions of healing have managed to become merged within popular usage. Concomitant toCrawford 's 54famous observation of the \"medicalization of everyday life, \"the language of healing is now a ubiquitous metaphor used to commandeer the discourse on non-medicalproblems (e.g., family dysfunction, hurt emotions, disruptedcognitive patterns, spiritual malaise, unsatisfying life styles,friendships gone bad, poisonous work environments, andideological discord) by rede ning them as wounds whose treatment can be rationalized and professionalized and thusbest be de ned and delivered by experts in particular modes of healing or therapy. Further, because the subpopulationwhich has allowed it to become so medicalized would seemto overlap with that involved in CAM and other health-related alternatives, this self-help idiom has bled over intodiscourse on actual medical illness as well. This has served toengender a further layer of confusion in usages of \"healing \"in specically biomedical contexts. Healing is now referenced in relation to concepts that have nothing to do with medicine, disease, pathogenesis, ormedical therapeutics. That much is plain. But \"healing \"is not just invoked in non-medical contexts. It is also cited in What is \"Healing\"?

All rights reserved.reference to the healing of discrete medical conditions, as well, yet in its neologistic sense rather than in its stricter, moretraditional wound-healing sense. This can lead to confusionin efforting to elicit commonalities in understandings of whathealing is and to what end it serves. The use of \"healing \" applied to clinical phenomena is thus becoming as mixed upas its applications elsewhere. For example, imagine a case presentation of gastric ulcer. Is \"healing \"the word that describes the treatment received by one's primary care physician, by a gastroenterologist or, alternatively, by a practitioner of hands-on energy healing?Is\"healing \"the word that denotes the ideal end result of treatment, medical or surgical, whereby the ulcer is repaired,the patient is no longer symptomatic, and the disease is thusdeemed cured? Is \"healing \"the word that stands for the salutogenic process by which the stomach tissue is eventuallyrestored to its normal state, such as through a course ofantibiotics or other medication? Or, as the present author hasheard asserted many times at CAM conferences, are thesecompeting usages \"all just the same thing \"? This recalls the quotation cited at the beginning of this article: healing is whatis done by healers in order to elicit healing through thehealing process. If this were merely a semantic issue, then itmight be an amusing curiosity. But it is not. Philosophical schools of medicine and healthcare \u2014and CAM in the United States could perhaps be considered sucha school \u2014are more than just rational accommodations to ostensibly empirical observations. In a fascinating discussion,Baronov noted that biomedicine is not simply a scienti c enterprise. It is also simultaneously a \"symbolic-cultural expression \"and an \"expression of social power. \" 55As such, its putative foundation in objective scienti c principles \"conceals an ideological agenda ...that re flects structures of power and privilege. \"55(p235)The same might be said of CAM. Each of these schools de nes and re flects a worldview and psychic grid \u2014a lens through which medical reality is viewed and interpreted and made sense of, for the ultimate purposeof reinforcing the hegemony of the respective school as anarbiter of said reality. This is not necessarily done out ofconspiratorial malice; indeed, this phenomenon may be allbut invisible to most earnest practitioners. In the CAM worldview, and in fairness this is a general- ization, a kind of \"individualistic, victim-blaming ideolo- gy\" 56(p775)has been observed. The determinants of one 's health and the pathways to restoration of health areprimarily matters of individual responsibility. 57Indeed, health itself may be viewed principally, or solely, in termsof the status, functioning, or even feelings of individualbodies or body -mind complexes. This is in contrast to the prevailing understanding of health and its determinants found within public health, for example, whereby health isconsidered a communally experienced phenomenonimpacted by social-structural characteristics and politicaland economic realities and expressed in terms ofpopulation-wide rates of morbidity, mortality, and disability. Actions to restore health, in turn, encompass both the individual and the collective, such as policy-level interven-tions focusing on efforts to reduce inequities in access tohealthcare. Not so for some corners of CAM, where one mayobserve an obsessive self-absorption with one 's physical appearance and functioning as the ultimate markers of well-being, quality of life, even a just social order. Crawford 54(p365) described this as the elevation of health to a \"super value, a metaphor for all that is good in life, \"resulting in \"the privatization of the struggle for generalized well-being. \" \"Healing \"thus has become a default label for the restora- tion of goodness and righteousness in every human sphere, aconcept that evokes a positive emotional response and nearuniversal endorsement and thus comes to mean whateveranyone wishes it to mean applied to any setting. So we end upwith emotional healing, environmental healing, healing ofrelationships, and all the rest. Healing seems to have taken itsplace alongside words like change, progress, hope, and choiceas consensus social and political ideals. To be clear, this is notmeant to disparage the intentions behind this usage, nor usesof these other ne words. But surely something is being lost: the soul of a word, healing, that ostensibly stands for asubstantively signi cant and under investigated physiological process. Healing may soon be applied to every sphere ofhuman life except medicine. With everything in existence now medicalized, healing is thus effectively demedicalized. Thecultural historian Christopher Lasch had something like thisin mind when he lamented the \"therapeutic sensibility \" 58that had insinuated itself into domains of cultural discourse oncethe province of applied social ethics. The non-medical usagesof healing thus become something of a marker for what Laschtermed the \"culture of narcissism. \" 58 This is not a new critique, by any means; it goes back to the days when CAM was known as the holistic health move-ment. 59The substitution of \"healing \"for other concepts which might more effectively, and justly, describe and mobilizeefforts at health-related change in the social, environmental,political, and economic spheres mirrors the identi cation of individually and voluntarily modi able \"life styles \"as the predominant determinants of population health. 60 Accordingly, such overuse of \"healing \"challenges the persistent notion that CAM entails a radical rethinking ofthe assumptions of biomedicine. 61Proponents like to describe CAM as a heretical movement for medicine,62and it could have evolved into such, perhaps to its credit, but itdid not. It is now more a matter of old wine in new wineskins.Indeed, the liberal usage of \"healing \"bespeaks a kind of individualism that puts even stereotypes of biomedicine toshame. Because everything is about me and how I look andfeel and function, my own physical and psychological statusand quality of life are the most important things in the world.Thus, the most valued and pressing need that I or any of ushave is to fuss over these things. The name given to the idealized endpoint of this fussing, essentially, is \"healing .\"It is the ultimate value in life, the most lofty attainment of the individual andsociety, and it names the objective state to be sought after,more than any other, by every person and every social andpolitical institution. \"NOSOLOGY \": DIMENSIONS OF HEALING These observations are conditioned not just by how healing isdened, but by how for years it has been typologized, 6 EXPLORE ]2017, Vol. ], No. ] What is \"Healing\"?

For CAM, the laxity in de ning healing, simultane- ously, as an intervention, outcome, process, and so on goeshand in hand with the laxity in its application to describeresolution of every individual, interpersonal, or societal woe.Likewise, for biomedicine, the stringency in de ning healing narrowly as just one thing \u2014the repair of wounds \u2014is paral- leled by its application primarily to focal lesions and rarely toother ailments, physical, psychological, or interpersonal. Two issues come to the fore in discussing how healing has been taxonomically described. One of these is a moredescriptive issue: it is the matter of the \"levels \"at which healing is said to operate. Is healing only about the closure ofwounds or is it a salutogenic process that may occur elsewherein or throughout the human body (or body -mind), such as within the different anatomical or physiological systems? Thesecond issue is substantive and addresses physiological andpathophysiological matters: the manner in which healing, ifindeed multidimensional, is experienced across these variousdimensions or levels or systems. Does the salutogenic process,in such instances, occurring as it is said to do throughoutvarious bodily systems, manifest separately, step-sequentially,or synchronously? Such a characteristic of healing, if vali-dated, would be a de ning feature of healing-as-a- multidimensional process and a key element in any hypo-thetical model of what has been termed \"salutophysiology. \" 63 This section addresses these two issues: the postulated dimensionality of healing and its hypotheticalcharacterization as a systemic phenomenon. The multidimensionality of healing Within CAM and related elds, as noted, the term \"healing \" is invoked, in part, to name processes, states, and/or out-comes associated with various levels or systems of human life.That is, healing is a phenomenon said to occur within andamong cells, within and among cultures and civilizations, andwithin and among all kinds of things in between. This includes levels and systems de ning human biological, bio- behavioral, and psychosocial functioning and quality of life.Thus, besides the conventional wound healing, we see morenovel usages: \"cellular healing, \" \"75and \"environmental healing. \"76Actually, limitation here of the spectrum of healing to everything between cells and culturesis too narrow. To wit, we also nd references to \"sub-atomic healing \" 77and \"molecular healing, \"78at one end of the spectrum, and \"planetary healing, \"79\"earth healing, \"80\"gaia healing, healing, \"divine \"85at the other end. As for \"quantum healing, \"86it is not clear at which end of the spectrum it should be placed. And, lest we forget, there isMarvin Gaye 's famous \"sexual healing. \" 87 To be fair, some of these usages, particular those sticking closely to the human body, are not inherently unreasonableuses of \"healing. \"If indeed a status can develop in these domains that could be de ned as pathological (i.e., havingundergone a pathogenic shift away from a baseline of normal structure or function), then subsequent movement in asalutogenic direction becomes a legitimate possibility. Thisincludes sexual healing. Something that could rightly becalled healing may conceivably be experienced, even if itcannot accurately be de ned strictly in terms of repair of a tissue wound or lesion, as in the biomedical de nition of wound healing. Imagine a case in which a patient suffers from a constella- tion of signs and symptoms pointing to something patho-physiological occurring in multiple functional and organsystems due to a single diagnosis with known systemic effects.A course of therapy is begun which seeks resolution orimprovement across each system, leading, one hopes, to acure. If we choose to refer to this salutogenic movement as\"healing, \"then healing rightly could be considered a multi- dimensional phenomenon. That is, it occurs, ideally, atmultiple levels or within multiple subsystems of the humanbiological organism, and signals remission of symptoms andsigns, improved status according to particular biomarkers, andso on. Such a usage of the word healing, applied tobiomedical and clinical phenomena underlying human dis-ease, can and should be distinguished from, and valued over,usages misapplied to non-medical phenomena. It is easy to make light of the most extreme overextensions of the concept of healing (e.g., cosmic healing, gaia healing,and the like). We can question the medicalization of thesephenomena that manifest past the boundaries of humanbodies and that are unrelated to medicine, but, at the sametime, we can appreciate the extension of the healing metaphorbeyond reference to a discrete, localized lesion or wound.Emotional healing (such as recovery from diagnosed mooddisorders), even molecular healing (in light of rapidly accel- erating advances in genomics and molecular biology), are less easy to make light of and deserve consideration within certainbounds. Perhaps a happy medium would be to adopt\"healing \"for reference to salutogenic processes at all levels of expression of pathophysiological and psychiatric disease,but enforce a moratorium on its use beyond those bounda-ries. Thus, let us bid goodbye, for example, to sub-atomichealing and cosmic healing. The interaction of dimensions of healing It is one thing to state that healing, within bounds, can beconsidered multidimensional . From its many usages, listed above, such a statement appears to be at least somewhataccepted, as far as healing-as-a-process, or salutogenesis, isconcerned. It is quite another thing to describe how it isthat such healing occurs across multiple dimensions. Howare we to understand the potential multidimensionality ofhealing? To restate this question, how may we conceive of the operation of a broader, multidimensional usage of healing?What are these multiple dimensions, what is it that ishappening within them, and is there any relation amongwhat is happening within respective dimensions? A concep-tual expansion, such as what is proposed for healing, is onlyas good as the theoretical rationale underlying it. We mustattempt to describe how the presumptive salutogenic What is \"Healing\"?

Three hypothetical possibilities come to mind. Do these various dimensions or loci of healing occur separately \u2014that is, distinctively, with minimal correlation? Do they instead occurstep-sequentially \u2014that is, with some contingency among them, as in a chain or cascade? Or do they occur synchronously \u2014that is, simultaneously and in unison, manifesting as systemic orsystem-wide effects? First, healing may occur independently across separate dimensions of the human system. A clinical case may requirediscrete treatment of multiple pathologies manifestingthroughout the body due to a single underlying diseaseprocess. This may require different therapies or medicationsper respective bodily systems. Consider, for example, com-plications due to type 2 diabetes in a geriatric patient. Thepatient may, simultaneously, be suffering from metabolic,cardiovascular, orthopedic, respiratory, dermatologic, renal,ophthalmological, psychiatric, and/or other signs and symp-toms that are sequelae of the long-term degenerative effects ofthe underlying diagnosis. 88These problems, in turn, may require distinct treatment or intervention, at some point,from different specialists or subspecialists, albeit coordinatedor managed by a diabetes specialist. 89If\"healing \"is to be attained, whether a full cure (unlikely) or recovery from acuteemergencies, then this may require separate interventions byseparate practitioners seeking to elicit separate salutogenicprocesses in separate parts of the body. Second, healing may occur step-sequentially across multi- ple dimensions of the human body -mind. That is, \"healing \" of one set of signs or symptoms in one bodily system maynecessarily precede healing in another system, as in a cascadeeffect. Consider an example taken from the realm of CAM: classical homeopathy. 90No matter, for the sake of the present discussion, that this controversial modality has not beenvalidated to the consensus approval of Western medicine;that is grist for another conversation. For now, the key pointis the principle that a particular constitutional remedy mayengender the \"unwinding \"of symptoms, backward in time, so to speak, temporarily expressed and then resolved, until the patient is symptom-free \u2014a feature of a concept known to homeopaths as Hering 's laws. 91(pp18 -19)Hypothetically, this would be an example of a sequentially manifested salutogenicresponse across multiple bodily systems, although whetherthese respective systems and their pathologies are/wereauthentically correlated in some substantive way is indeterminate. One might not even know that these multiple systems needed \"healing \"until the transient symptomatic re-expression during the unwinding process.Another hypothetical example might be modern-day sweatlodges, whereby participants spend many hours over manydays sweating out \"toxins, \"presumably, that re-emerge sequentially, moving backward in time even to childhood, until the client is eventually healed. 92 Third, healing may occur synchronously across multiple dimensions or organ systems. For example, a patient may be suffering from an infection which expresses in signs andsymptoms impacting on multiple parts of the body. Beforethe situation becomes chronic, a course of treatment, such asantibiotics, may work to resolve, to \"heal, \"the disease throughout the entire body. Consider Lyme disease, whichcan manifest in dermatological, minor rheumatological, andflu-like signs and symptoms at rst, and, untreated, evolve into a more complex presentation with neurological, cardio-vascular, serious rheumatological, and other problems. 93 Antibiotics can knock out the disease early on, beforecomplications emerge, although in chronic cases, which aremore dif cult to treat and remain diagnostically controversial, long-term antibiotic treatment has been called into questionand other medications may be required. 94In contrast to the rst example above, diabetes, Lyme disease in its acute presentation is typically managed by a single specialist whooversees a course of therapy intended to resolve the disease,and thus, ideally, promote \"healing \"throughout the entire body. If healing can be conceptualized as multidimensional, then the way in which these multiple dimensions interact isa subject of considerable importance and deserves a place nearthe top of any research agenda. It may also be that theway in which the salutogenic process occurs is wholly orpartly dependent on the nuances of a particular diagnosis oron some other factors related to a particular case, includingfactors intrinsic to human hosts or environments or tomedical care. There may be constancies to all this and theremay be variable processes and phenomena. Someday,when we know as much about salutogenesis as aboutpathogenesis, these issues may not seem so opaque orconfusing. \"ETIOLOGY \": DETERMINANTS OF HEALING To review, we have considered two broad conceptualapproaches to the term \"healing. \"Therst approach consists of a couple of usages con ned almost exclusively to bio- medicine: healing as the repair of tissue wounds, and healingas the recovery from a pathogenic (disease) state. The secondapproach consists of competing usages found almost exclu-sively in CAM: healing-as-intervention, healing-as-process,and healing-as-outcome. Moreover, in the CAM contextespecially, healing is considered to be multidimensional andcapable of application to every level or dimension of humanexperience. This summarizes, more or less, what healing is,a t least according to prevailing usages \u2014in other words, the \"what \"of healing. We now further consider the \"how\"of healing, mostly in its healing-as-process or salutogenic context \u2014whether healing of focal lesions (as in biomedicine) or as applied to morecomplex biopsychosocial statuses or mechanisms (as inCAM). The question here is what are those other factors orvariables or concepts that are known or believed to cause orantecede or in fluence what is being referred to, in various contexts, as healing. How much is known? How much is justspeculation? What do we really know about the healingprocess? The multifactoriality of healing Within the narrower biomedical context, as already noted,healing means wound healing, and not much else. In some 8 EXPLORE ]2017, Vol. ], No. ] What is \"Healing\"?

Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.instances, again as noted, healing may also refer in a larger sense to recovery from illness. But to the extent to whichthere is a eld of scienti c research focused on healing, this eld consists almost entirely of bench research on the repair of physical wounds. As currently understood, the process ofwound healing is a complex phenomenon that entails asequence of stages and mechanisms involving multiplecategories of responses, various types of cells, and differenttypes of events. 95Phases of the healing response include coagulation and hemostasis, in flammation, proliferation of broblasts, and remodeling of the wound.96The healing response is classi ed into several categories, by the depth and severity of the wound and the complexity of the clinicalpresentation. These include healing by primary intention(e.g., suturing of a clean wound without tissue loss orinfection) and healing by secondary intention (e.g.,formation of granulation tissue over an open wound thathas undergone tissue loss). 95,96 A substantial number of factors have been identi ed that impact on wound healing, including antecedents whichhasten a healing response. The repair of acute wounds(e.g., dermal injuries) entails multiple mechanisms of cellularand molecular activity. These involve the immune system(including in flammation and phagocytosis), re-epithelialization (e.g., through growth factors), broblasts (which proliferate and contribute to granulation of the wound), angiogenesis(e.g., through oxygen and nutrient delivery), and innervation(leading to regeneration). 97This is actually the CliffsNotes version of the wound healing process; each of these categories,especially related to the presence of growth factors andcytokines involved in regulating tissue regeneration, 98denes substantial elds of basic research.99There are also pathologic aspects of repair: those intrinsic or extrinsic factors that hinder the healing process, including infection.99The healing of chronic wounds (e.g., diabetic foot ulcers) creates additionalcomplexities and folds in additional variables. 99From this perspective healing may only refer to the healing of wounds \u2014 and thus be unidimensional \u2014but it is clearly multifactorial, when taking into account the litany of factors that mayinfluence this process. According to the more expansive CAM context, healing is multidimensional, as already described, and, as in the bio- medical context, also multifactorial. That is, it is caused by, orhas associated with it, multiple antecedent factors. These varyby the dimension or level of healing under consideration. Arecent NIH-funded review of existing diagnostic question-naires and focused interviews with CAM providers andpatients identi ed several categories of factors believed to engender \"non-speci c effects \"on healing, de ned as a successful treatment outcome: patient -provider relationships, the healthcare environment, optimism, spirituality, pro-CAMattitudes, and treatment expectations. 100A non-systematic summary of many of the CAM resources referenced earlier, aswell as several early and in fluential books on holistic medicine, expands this list to include many additional determinants of healing, including techniques to diagnosewhat/where requires healing. These include psycho-emotionalfactors psychic healing, astrology, etheric surgery, and autogenics).103 Thus, while healing in this context covers many moredomains of the human system than simply open wounds, it is no more or less multifactorial, except that the scope of those factors deemed in fluential on the healing process covers considerably more ground, some of them highly unorthodox. As is apparent, not all of these putative healing factors in CAM context have their origins in anatomical structures,(patho-)physiological processes, or natural substances. Someinvolve phenomena that are clearly outside the mainstream ofhuman pathophysiology or psychology, or even biological orphysical science. One should also note the absence of anysubstantial overlap between this set of factors and thoseassociated with wound healing. As much as anything, thisone fact underscores how little the two approaches todening healing have in common. It is as if they occupy two different conceptual worlds. But regardless, as the existence of both of these sets of determinant factors makes plain, the multifactoriality ofhealing is widely accepted, whether we are speaking of woundhealing or of more multidimensional takes on healing. Somultifactoriality is not objectionable in principal. In simplestterms, multifactoriality means that there are a multiplicity ofantecedent factors associated with successful therapeutic out-comes, with recovery from disease, and with the salutogenicprocess generally. This much is conceded within bothbiomedicine and CAM. Rather, the substantive content ofthe multifactoriality \u2014the identity of those variables that are fair game in a discussion of healing \u2014meets with little consensus. That is a matter highly dependent upon thecontext of the discussion. For example, a regulator of tissue repair, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), 104is likely to nd wider acceptance within a future basic biomedical science of healing than, say,past-life karma, the latter of which might make perfect senseto a New-Age healer specializing in clients with intractablelife-long relationship problems. 105This is not stated here to beflippant, but to underscore that any productive study of the\"how\"of healing writ large \u2014such as in a theory of salutogenesis applicable in whole-person context \u2014is going to be contingent upon some sort of common agreement onthe\"what \"of healing. At present, this seems far away. The salutogenic focus of therapies Notwithstanding these observations, existing therapies withinthe mainstream of Western medicine more often than nothave a unitary focus. That is, they seek to effect healing orrecovery or restoration in relation to pathology of a primaryantecedent or etiologic factor or to pathogenesis occurringwithin a single \"level\"of the human system, as described earlier \u2014or to a select set of signs and symptoms or organ systems. 106Few discrete clinical regimens, such as a single drug or procedure, are intended or expected to act at once onthe human body -mind in its entirety: on, say, the immune system, the nervous system, the blood, cognitions, emotions,and multiple organ systems, such as the brain and liver and What is \"Healing\"?

This is as true for biomedicine as for CAM, except for certain alternative therapies such as classicalhomeopathy, which is believed by practitioners to actsystematically but which remains highly controversial. 91 Biomedicine seems to be more cautious and less prone to overpromise than CAM, on the whole, when it comes toexpectations about systemic effects. Respective medicationsor therapies do speci c things, and one clinical case may require multiple such courses of treatment in order to fullyresolve. This is because the goal is not necessarily anamorphous \"healing \"\u2014whatever that may look like \u2014but rather the remission of particular complaints or the restora-tion of levels of particular biomarkers to within normal limits. For healing, in its systemic context, the combined multi- dimensionality and multifactoriality implicit in such broaderdenitions of the healing process presents a signi cant chal- lenge for clinicians. Either (a) a medical practitioner needs tomanage a multiplicity of therapies and medications for onecase, or (b) he or she must identify respective therapies thatreliably act on multiple factors in most people. That is, for agiven complex diagnosis \u2014say, chronic fatigue syndrome 107\u2014 one must identify treatments targeting \"healing \"at multiple respective levels or within multiple systems (e.g., neurological,muscular, rheumatological, immunological, gastrointestinal,psychiatric, and so on) or one must identify a singletreatment that effects \"healing \"across all such systems. This situation is frought with special complexities: in the formersituation, the problem of polypharmacy, even if a case ismanaged by a single provider and if such validated therapieseven exist; in the latter situation, the limitations of existingpharmacotherapeutics \u2014a single systemic treatment may not exist for a given case. This reminds us that it may be easy to postulate and advocate for a broader perspective on a discrete biomedical issue such as \"healing \"as a result of a conceptual history, such as in this article, but the demands that may emerge in theclinical management of particularly complex cases under sucha perspective may render real-world application daunting toenvision at present. This suggests a third possibility \u2014(c) the job of the clinician is about something less florid and grandiose than effecting \"healing \"in its wider context. It may be enough simply to manage a case, in all its complex-ities, and hope to reduce suffering, halt or slow down anactive disease process, and restore function. CONCLUSIONS To summarize, healing is a word and concept that has beenand is still subject to a multiplicity of competing and oftenconflicting usages. In various contexts and by various authors, it may refer to an intervention, the outcome of an inter-vention, or the process by which the outcome occurs. Each ofthese is considered by some to de ne\"healing. \"One may observe different patterns of usage between biomedicalscientists and clinicians, on the one hand, and CAM practi-tioners and New-Age writers, on the other. For the former,healing is mostly about the repair of wounds; for the latter, itmay be about almost anything. This essay has sought toprovide an interpretive summary of the de nitions,dimensions, and putative determinants implicit in these multiple usages of the word. At the start of this article, a question was posed: \"What is healing? \"As this conceptual history of the term has shown, especially in its contemporary usages, this is not as off-the-wall a question as it rst may have appeared. A consensus answer is dif cult to nd. Perhaps this ought not to be surprising. There is no consensus answer to the question,\"What is a disease?, \" 108nor is there uniform agreement as to what differentiates disease and \"non-disease. \"109If medicine has so much trouble de ning disease, is it any wonder that \"healing \"remains elusive? Questions such as these are not simply arcane matters of word-parsing of concern only to historians and other academ-ics. How healing is de ned and described matters for the practice of medicine. If this act of de ning is not done carefully, then one must question the conclusions of respec-tive studies, reviews, and other pieces of writing on thesubject of healing, whether from the mainstream of biome-dicine or from CAM. Consider, for example, a bestselling textby a popular New-Age doctor. 110Throughout the book, healing is described in various competing ways. For theauthor, healing: ...is de nitely more along the line of healing through Spirit or spirituality ... 110(p150) ...is most accurately de ned as a \"spiritual communica- tion/information exchange.110(p150) ...isnot a technique at all .I ttranscends technique.110(p227) ...is not the \"how\"or\"why\"\u2014nor is it a recipe. It is a state of being.110(p333) ...is about an evolutionary process brought into existence through co-creation at the highest vibrational interaction with the Universe.110(p331) ...is mediated through higher or universal intelligence ... 110(p199) ...is a capacity shared by all.110(p212) ...is a decision reached between the patient and the universe.110(p172) None of this is being documented here to disparage these ideas nor to question the motives of the author. This book isa passionate account of whole-person healing and makesfascinating reading. But, in this one in fluential work, healing is described simultaneously as a method ( \"healing through Spirit \"), an exchange of information, not a technique, a state of being, a process, something mediated, a capacity, and an outcome ( \"decision \"), and this does not seem to have set off any alarms. The book was published by an established CAMpress in 2001, and endorsed by popular medical and health-care celebrities such as Drs. Deepak Chopra, Mehmet Oz,Christiane Northrup, and Wayne Dyer. The author assures usthat his content \"isrmly supported by the latest theories on nuclear and quantum physics, \" 110(p137)but no references are given. Perhaps the most reasoned statement about healing is found toward the end of the book: \"Some things are dif cult to explain ....\"110(p333) The conclusion here is plain: lots of folks use the word healing, for whatever reasons, but few of them are clear as towhat the word means or should mean, and fewer apparentlysee this as an issue that much matters. There is nothing new 10 EXPLORE ]2017, Vol. ], No. ] What is \"Healing\"? Downloaded for Anonymous User (n/a) at Duke University from ClinicalKey.com/nursing by Elsevier on June 07, 2017.

As noted at the startof this article, this enduring conceptual laxity renders \"heal- ing\"in its broader CAM/salutogenesis/healing-as-process context less than ideal as a research construct. Perhaps thisis why widespread programmatic research on healing in thiswider context has never emerged. 111Without greater conceptual clarity, such research is not possible. This point was brought home to the present author at a CAM conference over 20 years ago. Both before and after hispresentation, which reviewed epidemiologic research ndings on the primary-preventive population-health impact of meas-ures of the frequency of formal religious behavior (a relativelynew and quite contentious topic at the time), the discussantcontinually referred to this as research on \"healing. \"This author protested, publicly and later on privately, but thediscussant refused to acknowledge that these studies ofputative protective effects on population-level morbidityand mortality rates associated with the independent variableswere not evidence of \"healing, \"moreover of \"spiritual heal- ing.\"The present author had never conducted any empirical research on such a topic, ever, nor had anyone among thesmall group of physicians, epidemiologists, and medical socialscientists who had investigated this category of psychosocialexposure variables in population-based health research up tothat time. Moreover, the lecture had simply summarizedobservational survey data from prospective cohort studiesusing large-scale samples of healthy populations, typical ofepidemiologic research. Nothing in the way of clinicalsamples, experimental designs, nor any type of therapy orintervention was involved, much less the ministrations ofwould-be faith healers. This was pointed out to the discus-sant, in detail, and, again, the protest fell on deaf ears. This was research on healing, the results proved the healing power of spirituality, and how could it be any plainer? \"Healing \"seems to have become a politically-correct label or proxy for all things biomedical or health-related orostensibly therapeutic or even just good. It is a specialbuzzword with magical properties that, once invoked, reifyall sorts of presumed and unproven fantasies about thedeterminants of health and the putative causation and cureof diseases. For medical research, such a usage of \"healing, \"to reiterate, is worthless. More conceptually careful engagement of healing by biomedical scientists and clinicians would be welcomed. Better resolution of the issues broached in this article \u2014or simply more uniform usage \u2014might bene t the work of scientists and physicians and, thus, ultimately, patients andpopulations. This may seem like a bloodless statement afterthe i-dotting and t-crossing of this article, but we canprobably all agree that whatever healing is and is not, or however it should or should not be referenced, it is by all accounts a good thing. At the least, it is better than itsopposite. A true science of salutogenesis, of the healing process in its broadest and most systemic context, would be a welcomedevelopment. Because of existing confusion over conceptualfeatures of \"healing, \"these would need to attain a consensus before an actual eld of study could evolve. Butphysiological, psychophysiological, and pathophysiological (and \"salutophysiological \") research on healing may have something important to contribute to the ongoing knowledgebase of the basic biomedical sciences. 112There may be implications for epidemiology and public health, as well.Preliminary work has been done which suggests a place forhealing/salutogenesis in theoretical models of thedeterminants of population health, 4for health promotion and disease prevention,113and for public health development efforts.114Additionally, there may be signi cant implications for the clinical practice of medicine and for the healthcaresystem, such as through design of optimal healingenvironments. 115A more expansive and coherent view of healing thus may contribute to health and medicine inmultiple ways: through advancing our knowledge of humanphysiology and through fostering clinical, physical, and socialenvironments that foster whole-person healing and healthierpopulations.
