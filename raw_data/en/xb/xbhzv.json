As one of the first nontraditional healers allowed to work in an operating room, Julie Motz harnesses the body's own energy to help patients survive risky operations, such as heart transplants and cancer surgery. Now she shares remarkable case studies of healing, recovery, and transformation--and gives readers step-by-step guidance on accessing one's own innate healing energy. Treating the body and spirit as an interconnected whole, Motz explains her breakthrough form of healing, the ultimate synthesis of Eastern holistic healing and Western medicine. She shows how strong emotion affects our bodies, creating energy imbalances that can lead to illness if unaddressed, and illustrates how we can heal.
