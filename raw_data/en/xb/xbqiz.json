New studies and ongoing research regarding [cancer](https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm) [prevention](https://www.medicinenet.com/prevention/article.htm) have helped improve treatment. However, many questions are still unanswered. One of them is whether a weak immune system can cause [cancer](https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_quiz/quiz.htm). Your immune system plays a vital role in maintaining your health. But if you have weakened immunity, could it increase the risk of cancer? Cancer is caused by genetic changes that lead to uncontrolled cell growth. This genomic instability leads to tumor formation. Although some [cancers](https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm) are caused by genetic mutations, some other factors can also play a significant role in causing the disease. For example, drinking [alcohol](https://www.medicinenet.com/alcohol_metabolism/article.htm) and [smoking](https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm) tobacco can cause cancer. These risk factors are avoidable, but other important risk factors are not. These include old age and a weakened immune system. What is the immune system? The immune system is your body's defense mechanism that protects you from diseases. It's a system of biological processes that can detect various invading pathogens like bacteria, [viruses](https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm), parasites, or even cancer cells. Anything that is not a natural part of an organism's healthy tissue is recognized and destroyed by the immune system. This way, your immune system protects your body against illnesses and infections. What can weaken your immune system? Some people are born with a weak immune system. On the other hand, [aging](https://www.medicinenet.com/senior_health/article.htm) can weaken your immune system, as can some unhealthy habits. Here are some factors that can contribute to a weakened immune system: How does a weak immune system cause cancer? Genetic mutation plays a significant role in causing cancer. As you age, the frequency of mutations increases and your immunity decreases. With increased mutations and weakened immunity, you are at a greater risk of getting cancer. A less effective immune system makes you more susceptible to illness. The thymus gland, a part of your immune system, develops T cells. These play an essential role in building your immunity. The deterioration of your thymus gland causes it to produce fewer T cells, which weakens your immune system. When cancer cells show up in your body, your immune system usually kills them before they can form a tumor. First, the T cells scan your body for cancer cells. Then, they locate the cancer cells in your body and destroy them. When your immune system is weak and produces fewer T cells, they fail to scan your body for cancer cells. As a result, the abnormal cells are able to grow uncontrollably and form a tumor.

Some cancer treatments rely on your immune system to treat cancer. Immunotherapy is one such treatment. Different types of immunotherapy may boost or reduce your immune response to fight the cancer cells more efficiently. Some types of immunotherapies are: - Monoclonal antibodies: These are able to recognize proteins on the surface of the cancer cells. The antibodies then attack the abnormal cells. [Vaccines](https://www.medicinenet.com/immunizations/article.htm): Some [vaccines](https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm)help boost immunity so your immune system can efficiently recognize and attack cancer cells. - Cytokines: These are small proteins that help boost your immune system by facilitating communication between your immune system's cells. - CAR T-cell therapy: This is also called adoptive cell transfer. It changes the genes in your white blood cells to help them fight cancer. The effects of cancer on the immune system Cancer makes the immune system weak as it spreads into the bone marrow. The bone marrow is responsible for making blood cells that fight infection and invade foreign particles such as viruses, bacteria, parasites, etc. Cancer stops the bone marrow from making these blood cells. This is particularly common in [leukemia](https://www.medicinenet.com/leukemia/article.htm) and [lymphoma](https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm). Certain cancer treatments can also weaken your immune system because they reduce the number of white blood cells. These treatments include: - Cancer treatment [drugs](https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm) - Chemotherapy - Radiotherapy - Steroids The bottom line If you wish to take a more active role in boosting your immune system, there are some things you can do. For example: - Eat certain foods, like elderberries and yogurt - Minimize daily [stress](https://www.medicinenet.com/stress_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm) - Spend time with pets and loved ones - Take a multivitamin [Exercise](https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm) - Get enough [sleep](https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_quiz/quiz.htm) [Aging](https://www.medicinenet.com/healthy_seniors_pictures_slideshow_exercise_aging/article.htm) is not the only factor that weakens your immune system or puts you at risk of cancer. Many other factors can weaken your immune system as well. If you experience high levels of stress, stomach aches, or exhaustion on a regular basis, it's a good idea to consult a doctor.

Is Tumor a Cancer?A tumor is a mass or lump of tissue in an organ. In a healthy body, cells grow, divide, and are replaced by new cells. In the case of a tumor, the rate of cell multiplication is more than cell destruction. The word tumor is often associated with cancer; however, not all tumors are cancerous. Liver CancerLiver cancer is cancer of the liver cells (hepatocellular carcinoma) or of the ducts in the liver (cholangiocarcinoma). Liver cancer often arises due to liver damage, cirrhosis (scarring) caused by alcohol use/abuse, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C. Liver cancer may not cause any symptoms. Liver cancer is diagnosed with blood tests, imaging tests, and a liver biopsy. Treatment for liver cancer may include surgery, ablation, embolization, radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Prostate Cancer Early Signs and Symptoms Difficulty with urination - frequency, weak stream, trouble getting started, etc. - is usually the first sign of prostate cancer. But these and other early symptoms of prostatic cancer can also come from benign prostate conditions, so diagnostic testing is important, including PSA tests and digital rectal exam.

The Early Stages of Mouth CancerMouth cancer is also referred to as oral cancer. It is one of the cancers occurring in the head and neck region. It can arise from any part of the oral cavity, such as the lips, tongue, gums (gingiva), palate, the floor of the mouth, and the inner lining of the cheeks (buccal mucosa). Mouth cancers are locally invasive; it spreads to other parts of the head and neck, and eventually, the rest of the body. What Is the Survival Rate of Salivary Gland Cancer?The survival rate of salivary gland cancer depends on several factors. The overall five-year survival rate for salivary gland cancer in the United States is 75 percent. The survival rate depends on the type and stage of the salivary gland cancer. The five-year survival rate for people with early-stage (localized) salivary gland cancer is 94 percent. The five-year survival rate for people with salivary gland cancer that spreads to nearby structures and lymph nodes is 67 percent. The five-year survival rate for people with advanced-stage (metastatic) cancer is 44 percent. "}
