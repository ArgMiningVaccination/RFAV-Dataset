However, the role of CAM use in patients' health behaviors remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the extent to which patients report that CAM use motivates them to make changes to their health behaviors. Materials and Methods: This secondary analysis of 2012 National Health Interview Survey data involved 10,201 CAM users living in the United States who identified up to three CAM therapies most important to their health. Analyses assessed the extent to which participants reported that their CAM use motivated positive health behavior changes, specifically: eating healthier, eating more organic foods, cutting back/stopping drinking alcohol, cutting back/quitting smoking cigarettes, and/or exercising more regularly. Results: Overall, 45.4% of CAM users reported being motivated by CAM to make positive health behavior changes, including exercising more regularly (34.9%), eating healthier (31.4%), eating more organic foods (17.2%), reducing/stopping smoking (16.6% of smokers), or reducing/stopping drinking alcohol (8.7% of drinkers). Individual CAM therapies motivated positive health behavior changes in 22% (massage) to 81% (special diets) of users. People were more likely to report being motivated to change health behaviors if they were: aged 18-64 compared to those aged over 65 years; of female gender; not in a relationship; of Hispanic or Black ethnicity, compared to White; reporting at least college education, compared to people with less than high school education; without health insurance. Conclusions: A sizeable proportion of respondents were motivated by their CAM use to undertake health behavior changes. CAM practices and practitioners could help improve patients' health behavior and have potentially significant implications for public health and preventive medicine initiatives; this warrants further research attention.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2019-09-24", "cleaned_text": "Health Behavior Change and Complementary Medicine Use: National Health Interview Survey 2012 [https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina55100632](https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina55100632) with health providers\u2014especially primary health care professionals\u2014offer an opportunity to initiate health behavior change, although interventions to motivate such change have had mixed results to date. For example, one cluster-randomized trial found General Practitioner (GP)-delivered advice effectively increased physical activity levels among sedentary adults [ [2](#B2-medicina-55-00632)]. Yet, in another randomized trial, GP-delivered behavioral counselling failed to reduce levels of four risky health behaviors (smoking, alcohol use, exercise, and healthy eating) among primary care patients [ [3](#B3-medicina-55-00632)]. Patients may find behavior change programs more acceptable when they perceive them as patient-centered, and thus such program designs may be more effective than others at changing health behaviors [ [4](#B4-medicina-55-00632)], but evidence on this point is heterogeneous [ [5](#B5-medicina-55-00632)]. Another strand of research is focused on the identification and evaluation of effective components of interventions to improve health behaviors, known as behavior change techniques [ [6](#B6-medicina-55-00632)]. Some techniques, such as goal-setting, have shown promise [ [7](#B7-medicina-55-00632), [8](#B8-medicina-55-00632)], but the complexities of which techniques work for which patients, in what circumstances, and why, are still being investigated [ [9](#B9-medicina-55-00632)]. Given the mixed success of integrating health behavior change interventions within the context of mainstream medical care, it is important to consider whether and how other settings and providers might contribute to improving public health behaviors. [10](#B10-medicina-55-00632)]. Many CAM treatments are practiced not in isolation but as part of a philosophically-driven system of care, which integrates a range of treatments. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), for example, commonly encompasses herbal medicines, acupuncture, tai chi, and/or qi gong. Lifestyle advice is often provided during consultations as an essential part of healing in line with TCM philosophy [ [11](#B11-medicina-55-00632)]. Mind-body practices have also been specifically highlighted as providing an opportunity to address patients' health behaviors [ [12](#B12-medicina-55-00632)]. [13](#B13-medicina-55-00632)]. People use CAM for diverse reasons including to treat or manage (the symptoms of) disease and for wellness in the presence or absence of chronic conditions [ [14](#B14-medicina-55-00632), [15](#B15-medicina-55-00632)]. CAM use has previously been shown to be correlated with engagement in more positive health behaviors and fewer risky health behaviors [ [16](#B16-medicina-55-00632)], while adults who use CAM for health promotion may be especially likely to engage in healthy behaviors (compared to those who use CAM therapeutically) [ [15](#B15-medicina-55-00632)]. However, a significant proportion of CAM users present with health risk factors, including obesity and physical inactivity, suggesting an opportunity for CAM practitioners to engage in health behavior change work [ [17](#B17-medicina-55-00632)]. Furthermore, patients of CAM practitioners report empathetic, individualized, or patient-centered consultation experiences [ [18](#B18-medicina-55-00632)], which may make these practitioners more likely to facilitate successful behavior change via patient empowerment. Small scale qualitative work in specific CAM therapies such as acupuncture suggests some practitioners may offer self-care advice that explicitly includes health behavior change [ [19](#B19-medicina-55-00632)]. However, it is not yet known whether such practices are idiosyncratic or more widespread, or the extent to which patients themselves feel motivated by their CAM use to make health behavior changes. It is important to address these questions in order to help maximize the potential of CAM practitioners to possibly influence wider public and preventive health advances and act as important preventive medicine advocates and health behavior advisors within the broader health care system. Indeed, when considered in the context of the high levels of CAM use [ [20](#B20-medicina-55-00632)], the need for further examination of this issue is compelling. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Design and Participants [21](#B21-medicina-55-00632)]. 2.2. Measures 2.3. Statistical Analysis [21](#B21-medicina-55-00632)]. At most, 1.6% of the 10,201 cases had missing data (18 on education, 2 employment, 1 health status, 87 insurance); these were handled via pairwise deletion. 2.4. Ethics 3. Results 3.1. Prevalence of Health Behavior Changes [Table 1](#medicina-55-00632-t001)). Those CAM modalities that, by definition, involve certain integral and explicit health behavior changes were most likely to motivate respondents to change the behaviors integral to that modality. For example, 66.7% of people using movement or exercise techniques and 61.5% of those using yoga or tai chi/qi gong reported being motivated to exercise more regularly, while 77.3% of those following a special diet reported being motivated to eat more healthily. However, these therapies also motivated other behavior changes: 43.4% of people using movement or exercise techniques and 41.2% of those using yoga or tai chi/qi gong reported being motivated to eat more healthily; and 39.5% of those following a special diet reported being motivated to exercise more regularly. 3.2. Characteristics of CAM Users Motivated to Change Health Behaviors [Table 2](#medicina-55-00632-t002)shows the distribution of demographic and health characteristics of CAM users by motivation to change at least one health behavior. Statistically significant associations were observed between motivation to change after using CAM and all of the demographic and health characteristics. [Table 3](#medicina-55-00632-t003)). The multiple regression model showed that respondents with the following characteristics were significantly more likely to be motivated by CAM use to change at least one health behavior: 18-64 year olds (ORs = 1.64 to 2.13; compared to those aged over 65 years); females (OR = 1.61); people not in a relationship (OR = 1.24); people of Hispanic or Black ethnicity (ORs = 1.27 and 1.45, compared to White); people with at least college education (OR = 1.53; compared to people with less than high school education); and people with no health insurance (OR = 1.38; compared to those with private health insurance). People with 2 health conditions were less likely to change health behavior than those with no conditions (OR = 0.80). In this multivariable model, geographical region, body mass index, health status, and other numbers of chronic conditions were not significantly associated with being motivated by CAM use to change at least one health behavior. 4. Discussion [11](#B11-medicina-55-00632), [22](#B22-medicina-55-00632)]. The collaborative and patient-centered style that characterizes some CAM encounters [ [23](#B23-medicina-55-00632), [24](#B24-medicina-55-00632)] may also foster autonomy and empowerment, thus potentially motivating health behavior change [ [18](#B18-medicina-55-00632), [25](#B25-medicina-55-00632), [26](#B26-medicina-55-00632)]. Lending support to this interpretation, positive health behavior changes including increased physical activity, stress management, and dietary changes have been observed in chronically ill patients after participation in inpatient [ [27](#B27-medicina-55-00632)] and outpatient [ [28](#B28-medicina-55-00632)] CAM-based lifestyle modification programs. Conversely, an older study from the UK suggests that patients consulting CAM practitioners are often more interested in adopting a healthy lifestyle than are patients solely consulting general practitioners [ [29](#B29-medicina-55-00632)]. Indeed, cancer patients using CAM therapies have been shown to be much more likely to additionally use conventional lifestyle therapies such as dietary changes, conventional supplements, and exercise than patients not using CAM [ [30](#B30-medicina-55-00632)]. Furthermore, many CAM users consider the lifestyle guidance offered within these systems of care as a key reason for choosing to use such modalities [ [31](#B31-medicina-55-00632)]. Thus, there appears to be a bidirectional pathway at play with CAM practitioners being more likely than conventional practitioners to include health behavior advice as part of their treatment, and CAM users already being more interested in health behavior changes than CAM non-users. [32](#B32-medicina-55-00632), [33](#B33-medicina-55-00632)]. Having an internal health locus of control (i.e., a general belief that one's actions can influence one's own health) is also positively associated with undertaking health behavior change [ [27](#B27-medicina-55-00632), [34](#B34-medicina-55-00632)]. CAM use has been shown to shift an individual's beliefs about control of health outcomes towards a more internal and less external locus of control [ [35](#B35-medicina-55-00632)]. Likewise, participating in mind-body practices can increase exercise self-efficacy [ [36](#B36-medicina-55-00632)]. Thus, the motivational effect of CAM use for initiating positive health behavior change may be explained at least partly by an increase in health behavior-related self-efficacy as well as a change in health locus of control as a consequence of CAM use. [37](#B37-medicina-55-00632)], female sex [ [38](#B38-medicina-55-00632)], and higher levels of education [ [38](#B38-medicina-55-00632)]. Our analyses also showed that uninsured CAM users were more likely to make health behavior changes. Associations between health insurance coverage and health behavior change have not been thoroughly explored previously, although lack of health insurance may impact on an individual's access to health services [ [39](#B39-medicina-55-00632)] and encourage such individuals to undertake preventive self-care practices to mitigate out-of-pocket health care costs. This view is consistent with evidence showing uninsured people are more likely to use CAM compared to those with public or private health insurance [ [16](#B16-medicina-55-00632)]. [40](#B40-medicina-55-00632)]; and the potential for CAM practitioners to successfully integrate positive behavior change management within a collaborative interdisciplinary approach to patient care alongside conventional providers and broader preventive medicine initiatives. In terms of implications for practice, a better understanding of how CAM practitioners facilitate health behavior change may offer fresh approaches to health psychologists, public health workers, and others designing and delivering health behavior change interventions\u2014such as taking CAM diagnostic criteria into account [ [19](#B19-medicina-55-00632)] or expanding repertoires of techniques for health behavior change [ [6](#B6-medicina-55-00632)]. For those CAM practitioners recommending health behavior changes on a more opportunistic and/or idiosyncratic basis, health psychologists are well-placed to provide any necessary training [ [17](#B17-medicina-55-00632)] to help these practitioners facilitate health behavior change (where applicable) amongst all their patients. 5.
