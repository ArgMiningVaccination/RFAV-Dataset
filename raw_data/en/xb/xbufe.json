New York, 1 avril 2002 .............................. 385 XXV NOTE BY THE SECRETARIAT Under Article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations every treaty and every international agreement en- tered into by any Member of the United Nations after the coming into force of the Charter shall, as soon as possi- ble, be registered with the Secretariat and published by it. Furthermore, no party to a treaty or international agreement subject to registration which has not been registered may invoke that treaty or agreement before any organ of the United Nations. The General Assembly, by resolution 97 (I), established regulations.to give effect to Article 102 of the Charter (see text of the regulations, vol. 859, p.,VIIl). The terms \"treaty\" and \"international agreement\" have not been defined either in the Charter or in the regu- lations, and the Secretariat follows the principle that it acts in accordance with the position of the Member State submitting an instrument for registration that so far as that party is concerned the instrument is a treaty or an in- ternational agreement within the meaning of Article 102. Registration of an instrument submitted by a Member State, therefore, does not imply ajudgement by the Secretariat on the nature of the instrument, the status of a party or any similar question. It is the understanding of the Secretariat that its action does not confer on the instrument the status of a treaty or an international agreement if it does not already have that status and does not confer on a party a status which it would not otherwise have. Unless otherwise indicated, the translations of the original texts of treaties, etc., published in this Series have been made by the Secretariat of the United Nations.

(2) The Recipient Party will not pass or disclose to a Government official, Contractor, Contractors employee or to any other person holding the nationality of any third country, or to any international organisation, any Classified Information, exchanged under the pro- visions of this Agreement, nor will it publicly disclose any Classified Information without the prior consultation of the Originating Party. (3)) Nothing in this Agreement will be taken as an authority for, or govern the release, use, exchange or disclosure of intellectual property rights until the specific written autho- risation of the owner of these rights has first been obtained, whether the owner is one of the Parties or a third party. Volume 2179, 1-38356 Article 4. Protection of Classified Information (1) The Originating Party will ensure that the Recipient Party is informed of: (a) the classification of the information and of any additional conditions of release or limitations on its use, and that documents are so marked; and (b) any subsequent change in classification. (2) The Recipient Party will: (a) in accordance with its national laws and regulations, afford the equivalent level of security protection to Classified Information as is afforded by the Originating Party. The Receiving Party will take all steps legally available to it to keep transmitted and transferred Classified Information free from disclosure under any legislative provision, and each Party will maintain accountability and control procedures to manage the dissemination of, and access to, Classified Information. (b) ensure that Classified Information is marked in accordance with Article 1; and (c) ensure that the classification is not altered, except as authorised in writing by or on behalf of the Originating Party. (3) In order to achieve and maintain comparable standards of security, each NSA/DSA will, on request, provide to the other information about its security standards, procedures and practices for safeguarding Classified Information, and will for this purpose facilitate visits by the Competent Security Authorities. Article 5. Access to Classified Information Access to Classified Information will be limited to those persons who have a \"need to know\" and who have been security cleared by the recipient NSA / DSA, in accordance with their national standards, to the level appropriate to the classification of the information to be accessed. Article 6. Transmission of Classified Information (1) Classified Information will be transmitted between the two countries in accordance with the national security regulations of the Originating Party. One route will be through official diplomatic Government to Government channels, but other Arrangements may be established, such as hand carriage, secure communications (encryption), if mutually ac- ceptable to both Parties. The Party receiving Classified Information shall acknowledge its receipt in writing. (2) Additionally, Classified Information may be transmitted or transferred between a Swedish company and a Estonian owned company in the Kingdom of Sweden or a Estonian company and a Swedish owned company in the Republic of Estonia using the national transmission or transfer regulations applicable in the country in which the companies are based. Volume 2179, 1-38356 Releases may only take place between companies which hold the relevant facility and personnel security clearances (See Article 9 (1)) and where the information has been ap- proved for release to the other country. Article 7. Visits (1) The prior approval of the NSA / DSA of the host country will be required in respect of visitors, including those on detached duty from the other country, where access to Clas- sified Information or to defence establishments /defence contractor premises engaged in classified work is necessary. Requests for such visits will be submitted through the respec- tive Embassies. (2) Requests will include the following information: (a) surname and first name of proposed visitor, date and place of birth, nationality and passport number; (b) official status of the visitor together with the name of the establishment, company or organisation which the visitor represents or to which the visitor belongs; (c) certificate indicating the level of security clearance of the visitor; (d) name and ad- dress of the establishment, company or organisation to be visited; (e) name and status of the person(s) to be visited, if known; (f) purpose of the visit; and (g) date and duration of the visit.

(4) Visit requests should be submitted to the Recipient Party in accordance with the normal procedures of the Recipient Party. Short notice visits can be arranged in urgent cas- es by special, mutually determined, arrangements. (5) In cases involving a specific project or a particular contract it may, subject to the approval of both Parties, be possible to establish recurring visitors lists. These lists will be valid for an initial period not exceeding twelve (12) months and may be extended for a fur- ther period of time (not to exceed twelve (12) months) subject to the prior approval of the Competent Security Authority. They should be submitted in accordance with the normal procedures of the Recipient Party. Once a list has been approved, visit arrangements may be made direct between the establishments or companies involved in respect of listed indi- viduals. (6) Classified Information which may be provided to visiting personnel, or which may come to the notice of visiting personnel, will be treated by them as if such information had been furnished pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. Article 8. Contracts When proposing to place, or authorising a contractor in its country to place a Contract involving Classified Information with a Contractor in the other country the Originating Par- ty will obtain prior clearance from the NSA / DSA of the other country that the proposed Volume 2179, 1-38356 Contractor is security cleared to the appropriate level and also has appropriate security measures to provide adequate protection for Classified Information. The security clearance will carry a responsibility that the security conduct by the cleared Contractor will be in ac- cordance with national security rules and regulations and monitored by his NSA / DSA. (2) The Competent Security Authority will ensure that Contractors that receive Con- tracts placed as a consequence of these pre-contract enquiries are aware of the following provisions: (a) the definition of the term Classified Information and of the equivalent levels of se- curity classification of the two Parties in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; (b) the names of the Government Authority of each of the two countries empowered to authorise the release and to co-ordinate the safeguarding of Classified Information related to the Contract; (c) the channels to be used for the transmission or transfer of the Classified Information between the Government Authorities and / or Contractors involved; (d) the procedures and mechanisms for communicating the changes that may arise in respect of Classified Information either because of changes in its Security Classification or because protection is no longer necessary; (e) the procedures for approval of visits, access or inspection by personnel of one coun- try to companies of the other country are covered by the Contract; (f) an obligation that the Contractor will disclose the Classified Information only to a person who has previously been cleared for access and who has a \"need to know\", and is employed on or engaged in, the carrying out of the Contract; (g) an obligation that the Contractor will not disclose the Classified Information or per- mit it to be disclosed to any person not expressly cleared in writing by the Contractor's NSA / DSA to have such access; and (h) an obligation that the Contractor will immediately notify the Contractor's NSA / DSA or any actual or suspected breach or compromise of the Classified Information of this Contract. (3) The Competent Security Authority of the Originating Party will pass two copies of the relevant parts of the Classified Contract to the Competent Security Authority of the Re- cipient Party, to allow adequate security monitoring. (4) Each contract will contain guidance on the security requirements and on the clas- sification of each aspect / elements of the Contract. In Sweden this guidance will be set out in separate security agreements. The guidance must identify each classified aspect of the Contract, or any classified aspect which is to be generated by the contract, and allocate to it a specific security classification. Changes in the requirements or to the aspects / elements will be notified as and when necessary and the Originating Party will notify the Recipient Party when all the information has been declassified. Article 9. Reciprocal Industrial Security Arrangements (1) Each NSA / DSA will notify the security status of a company's premises in its coun- try when requested by the other Party. Each NSA / DSA will also notify the security clear- Volume 2179, 1-38356 ance status of one of its nationals when so requested. These notifications will be known as Facility security clearance (FSC) and Personnel security clearance (PSC) respectively. (2) When requested the NSA / DSA will establish the security clearance status of the company / individual which is the subject of the inquiry and forward a security clearance if the company / individual is already cleared. If the company / individual does not have a security clearance, or the security clearance is at a lower security level than that which has been requested, notification will be sent that the security clearance cannot be issued imme- diately but that action is being taken to process the request. Following successful enquires a security clearance will be provided which will then permit a reciprocal security clearance to be issued. (3) A company which is deemed by the NSA / DSA, in the country in which it is reg- istered, to be under the ownership, control or influence of a third country whose aims are not compatible with those of the host Government is not eligible for a security clearance and the requesting NSA / DSA will be notified. (4) If either NSA / DSA learns of any derogatory information about an individual for whom a PSC has been issued, it will notify the other NSA / DSA of the nature of the infor- mation and the action it intends to take, or has taken. Either NSA / DSA may request a re- view of any PSC which has been furnished earlier by the other NSA / DSA, provided that the request is accompanied by a reason. The requesting NSA / DSA will be notified of the results of the review and any subsequent action. (5) If information becomes available which raises doubts about the suitability of a re- ciprocally cleared company to continue to have access to Classified Information in the oth- er country then details of this information will be promptly given to the NSA / DSA to allow an investigation to be carried out. (6) If either NSA / DSA suspends or takes action to revoke access which is granted to a national of the other country based upon a security clearance, the other Party will be no- tified and given the reasons for such an action. (7) Each NSA / DSA may request the other to review any FSC, provided that their re- quest is accompanied by the reasons for seeking such a review. Following this review, the requesting authority will be notified of the results and will be provided with facts support- ing any decisions taken. (8) If required by the other Party each NSA / DSA will cooperate in reviews and inves- tigations concerning FSC and PSC. Article 10. Implementation of Security Requirements Implementation of security requirements can be advanced through reciprocal visits by security representatives of the Parties. Accordingly, security representatives of the Parties, after prior consultation, will be permitted to visit the other Party, to discuss the security sys- tem of the other Party. Volume 2179, 1-38356 Article 11. Breach or Compromise (1) In the event of a security breach involving loss of Classified Material or suspicion that Classified Information has been disclosed to unauthorised persons, the NSA / DSA of the Recipient Party will immediately inform the NSA / DSA of the Originating Party in writing. (2) An immediate investigation will be carried out by the Recipient Party (with assis- tance from the Originating Party if required) in accordance with the laws and regulations in force in that country for the protection of Classified Information. The Recipient Party will inform the Originating Party about the circumstances, measures adopted and outcome of the investigations as soon as possible. Article 12. Costs All costs incurred by one Party in the application of the obligations in this Agreement shall be borne by that Party. Article 13. Amendments This Agreement may be amended or supplemented in an annex after written consent by the Parties. Article 14. Disputes Any dispute regarding the interpretation or application of this Agreement will be re- solved by consultation between the Parties and will not be referred to any national or inter- national tribunal or third party for settlement. Article 15. Termination /Review (1) This Agreement will remain in force until terminated by either Party giving the oth- er Party six (6) months written notice of termination. Both Parties will remain responsible after termination for the safeguarding of all Classified Information exchanged under the provisions of this Agreement. (2) Similarly, all Classified Information which is exchanged under this Agreement will be safeguarded, even though its transfer may occur after notice by either of the Parties to terminate. (3) In the event of termination, solutions to any outstanding problems will be sought by consultations between the Parties. (4) This Agreement will be reviewed by the Parties within ten (10) years after its ef- fective date or as agreed when necessary. Volume 2179, 1-38356 Article 16. Effective Date This Agreement will enter into force upon signature of both Parties. Article 17. Signatures (1) The foregoing represents the undertakings between the Republic of Estonia and the Kingdom of Sweden upon matters referred to therein. (2) This Agreement is signed in two originals in the Estonian, Swedish and English language, all three texts equally authentic. In case of different interpretation of this Agree- ment the English text will prevail. Tallinn 30.01.2002 For the Republic of Estonia: SVEN MIKSER For of vilken +46 8 788 75 00, fax +46 8 788 82 63.

Spain and Korea reciprocally recognize national driving licences issued by the au- thorities of the two countries, provided that they are current. 2. The holder of a valid and current driving licence issued by one of the Contracting States shall be authorized temporarily to drive in the territory of the other State motor ve- hicles in those classes for which the licence is valid, for a period of time and in accordance with conditions to be determined by the national legislation of the country where such au- thorization is to apply. 3. After the period indicated in the preceding paragraph, the holder of a driving li- cence issued by one of the States who takes up habitual residence in the other State may exchange the driving licence for the corresponding licence issued by the State of residence, without having to pass a driving test. Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, a test may exceptionally be required if there are good reasons to doubt the aptitude of the holder of the driving li- cence or if a driver obtained the driving licence of the other country without observing the rules in force in the country of residence. 4. If there are reasonable doubts about the authenticity of the licence to be exchanged, the State in which the exchange is requested may request the authority or organ in the other State with competence to issue driving licences to verify its authenticity. 5. The provisions of this Agreement shall not affect the obligation to conduct the ad- ministrative formalities established by the regulations of each country for the exchange of driving licences, such as completion of an application form, presentation of a medical cer- tificate and certification of the absence of a criminal or administrative record or payment of the relevant fee. 6. The two Contracting States shall exchange specimens of their respective driving licences. The authorities or organs with competence to issue driving licences shall deter- mine the categories or classes of licences that may be exchanged under the provisions of this Agreement. Volume 2179, 1-38364 7. Exchanged licences shall be returned to the authority or organ designated by the two Contracting States prior to the entry into force of this Agreement. 8. This Agreement may not be applicable to licences issued in either State in ex- change for another licence obtained in a State other than the signatories to this Agreement. 9. The Agreement shall enter into force on the date of the latest note by which the Contracting Parties notify each other of the completion of domestic formalities relating to the conclusion and entry into force of international agreements. However, the two Parties agree that, although it is prior to the official entry into force, this Agreement shall be tem- porarily applicable from the date of receipt of the note verbale of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirming its acceptance. This Agreement shall have an unlimited duration and may be denounced by either Contracting Party following three months' prior notice. 10. If the proposal contained in this note verbale in Spanish and Korean is acceptable to the Government of Spain, the text thereof, together with the reply of the Ministry of For- eign Affairs in Spanish and Korean, shall constitute an agreement between the two coun- tries.

Soutien s~lectif A la production: -avances financier s6lectif A la distribution Financements Investissement par garanti ON CINEMATOGRAPHY BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE FRENCH REPUBLIC AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE FED- ERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY The Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, Considering their common resolve to renew and strengthen relations between France and Germany in respect of films, Considering the need to adapt to their respective new regulations, Considering the need to take into account the realities of the market, Have agreed as follows: I. CO-PRODUCTION Article 1 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term \"film\" means any film, irrespective of length, image media or genre (fiction, animation, documentary), which meets the provi- sions applicable to the film industry in each of the two States and the first-run exhibition of which takes place in cinemas. 2. Co-production films covered by this Agreement shall be treated as national films in accordance with the laws in force in each of the two countries. Co-production films covered by this Agreement shall by right be entitled in each State to enjoy the privileges deriving from the provisions relating to the film industry that are cur- rently in force or that may be adopted in each State. The competent authority of each Party shall transmit to the competent authority of the other Party the list of the legal provisions relating to the said privileges. If the said legal provisions are amended in any way whatsoever, by either State, the competent authority of the State concerned shall communicate to the competent authority of the other State the terms of such amendments. 3. Only the producer belonging to the State that accords the said privileges shall be entitled to enjoy them. 4. In order to enjoy the privileges accorded under this Agreement, a co-produced film must have received, no later than four months after its release in cinemas in France and/or the Federal Republic of Germany, the approval of the competent authorities of the two States. Applications for the enjoyment of the privileges shall be submitted in accordance with the relevant procedures established by each of the two States and shall meet the minimum requirements provided for in annex 1. Volume 2179, 1-38365 The competent authorities of the two States shall provide each other with full informa- tion relating to the granting, denial, amendment or cancellation of applications of the priv- ileges accorded under this Agreement. The competent authorities of the two States shall consult each other before denying an application. Once the competent authorities of the two States have approved the co-production of a given film, such approval may not subsequently be withdrawn unless the said competent authorities agree otherwise. The approval of a co-production project by the competent authorities of the two States shall not bind either State to issue a distribution number. The competent authorities shall be: -In France, the Centre National de la Cindmatographie (CNC); -In the Federal Republic of Germany, the und Ausfuhrkon- trolle (BAFA) and the Filmf6rderungsanstalt (FFA). Article 2 1. In order to enjoy the privileges provided for in this Agreement, the production en- terprises making the films must have a good technical and financial organization and pro- fessional experience recognized by the competent authority of the State to which they are linked. 2. Moreover, in order to be eligible for the privileges provided for in this Agreement, the production enterprises must meet the prerequisites stipulated in the German or French regulations, depending on the State to which they are linked. 3. The artistic and technical personnel shall be nationals of either France or the Fed- eral Republic of Germany or of another State member of the European Union or of a State party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Exceptions for personnel from other States may be granted by agreement between CNC and FFA. 4. Scenes shall be shot preferably in studios located in the territory of one or other of the two States Parties to this Agreement. 5. The shooting of scenes on location in the territory of a State which is not a member of the European Community and is not participating in the co-production may be autho- rized if the scenario or the plot of the film so requires. Article 3 The contribution of the producer or producers of each State to a co-production film may vary, between 20 (twenty) and 80 (eighty) per cent of the final cost of the film. The Parties to this Agreement hope that the said proportion may soon be allowed to vary between 10 (ten) and 90 (ninety) per cent of the final cost of the film, it being under- stood that that range is not at present compatible with the German legislation in force. Volume 2179, 1-38365 The German Party to this Agreement hereby undertakes to take steps to ensure that that legal obstacle is removed as soon as possible. Article 4 Each co-producer shall be co-owner of the tangible and intangible elements of the film. The material shall be deposited in the joint name of the co-producers in a laboratory selected by agreement between them. Article 5 Every two years the competent authorities of the two States shall consider whether the balance between the respective contributions has been maintained and, if not, they shall take the necessary measures. An overall balance shall be maintained with regard to both the artistic and technical and the financial contributions. This balance shall be assessed by the Mixed Commission provided for in article 13 of this Agreement. With a view to the establishment of that balance, each authority shall -- as part of the procedure for the granting to a film of privileges under this Agreement -- draw up a list of all the assistance and financing which the film has received (see annexes 2 and 3). The overall balance shall be analysed, inter alia, by: -The preparation of a breakdown of the assistance and financing provided for the production and distribution of co-productions in the year in question, it being understood that the breakdown will be evaluated in the light of the total budgets of the said co-produc- tions; The taking into account, over and above the number of films co-produced by the two States, of the films on which distributors and broadcasters of the two States purchased priority rights to the benefit of the producers of the films in the year in question, and the amount paid for those rights. If an imbalance should be perceived, the Mixed Commission shall consider ways to re- establish the balance and shall take all measures that it deems necessary to that end. Article 6 The credits, trailers and advertising material shall indicate that the film is a co-produc- tion of France and the Federal Republic of Germany. Article 7 The co-producers shall freely determine how receipts are to be divided. In principle, they shall be divided in proportion to their respective contributions. Volume 2179, 1-38365 Article 8 The competent authorities of the two States shall approve the co-production of films under this Agreement with one or more producers from States with which France or the Federal Republic of Germany has film co-production agreements. The conditions for the approval of such films shall be considered on a case-by-case ba- sis. 1I. COOPERATION IN CINEMATOGRAPHY AND TRAINING Article 9 The competent authorities of the two States shall pay special attention to basic and continuing training in film industry occupations. They shall consult each other with a view to considering jointly what measures should be taken to provide basic and continuing train- ing for film professionals. Article 10 The competent authorities of the two States shall consider ways of encouraging the dis- tribution and promotion of the films of each State. Article 11 The competent authorities of the two States shall endeavour to promote German film festivals in France and French film festivals in the Federal Republic of Germany. Article 12 The competent authorities of the two States shall endeavour to develop cooperation be- tween the film libraries and film archives of the two States. III. MIXED COMMISSION Article 13 1. A Mixed Commission composed of representatives of the competent authorities and professionals of the two States shall be established for the purpose of monitoring and facilitating the implementation of this Agreement and, if necessary, suggesting amend- ments to it. 2. For such time as this Agreement remains in force, the Mixed Commission shall meet each year, alternately in France and the Federal Republic of Germany. It may also be convened at the request of one of the competent authorities, especially in the event of any amendment either to the laws or to the regulations applicable to the film Volume 2179, 1-38365 industry or in the event that particularly serious difficulties are encountered in the imple- mentation of this Agreement, especially as a result of an imbalance in contributions. In the latter event, if the Mixed Commission does not meet as quickly as possible to consider ways of restoring the balance, the competent authorities shall approve the co-pro- duction of films under the terms of this Agreement only on a strictly reciprocal basis -- a film for a film. IV. FINAL PROVISIONS Article 14 This Agreement shall cancel and replace the agreements previously in force on the date of its signature, namely: -The Agreement concerning Franco-German relations in respect of films of 5 De- cember 1974; -The Agreement between the Government of the French Republic and the Govern- ment of the Federal Republic of Germany concerning the promotion of film co-production projects of 5 February 1981. Article 15 Each Contracting Party shall notify the other when national formalities required for the entry into force of this Agreement have been fulfilled. The Agreement shall enter into force on the date of receipt of the second notification. The Agreement is concluded for a period of two years. It shall be automatically renewed for two-year periods. It may be denounced at any timc by one of the Parties giving three months' notice in writing through the diplomatic channel. Such denunciation shall not affect the rights and obligations of the parties engaged in a project launched under this Agreement, unless the parties decide otherwise.

Paris, 23 April 1996 Entry into force: I February 2002 by notification, in accordance with article 25 Authentic texts: English and French Registration with the Secretariat of the United Nations: France, 9 April 2002 France et Etats-Unis d'Amkrique Trait6 d'extradition entre la France Paris, 23 avril vigueur : 2002 par 2002 Volume 2179, 1-38404 [ ENGLISH TEXT -TEXTE ANGLAIS ] EXTRADITION TREATY BETWEEN FRANCE AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA The President of the French Republic and the President of the United States of Amer- ica, Recalling the Extradition Treaty and accompanying Protocol between the United States of America and the Republic of France signed at Paris January 6, 1909 and the Sup- plementary Convention signed at Paris February 12, 1970 with Exchanges of Letters of June 2 and 11, 1970; Noting that these treaties continue in force between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the French Republic until entry into force of this Treaty; and Desiring to provide for more effective cooperation between the two States in the sup- pression of crime and to facilitate relations between the two States in the area of extradition by concluding a treaty for the extradition of offenders; Have decided to conclude a new extradition treaty and have appointed as their pleni- potentiaries for this purpose: The President of the French Republic: The Honorable, Jacques Toubon, Minister of Justice; The President of the United States of America: The Honorable, Janet Reno, Attorney General of the United States of America; Who, having communicated to each other their respective full powers, which were found in good and due form, have agreed as follows: Article 1. Obligation to Extradite The Contracting States agree to extradite to each other, pursuant to the provisions of this Treaty, persons whom the competent authorities in the Requesting State have charged with or found guilty of an extraditable offense. Article 2. Extraditable Offenses 1. Acts shall be extraditable if they are punished under the laws in both States by dep- rivation of liberty for a maximum of at least one year or by a more severe penalty. If extra- dition is requested for purposes of enforcing a judgment, the time remaining to be served must be at least six months. 2. An offense shall also be an extraditable offense if it consists of an attempt or a con- spiracy to commit, or participation in the commission of, an offense described in paragraph 1. 3. For the purposes of this Article, an offense shall be an extraditable offense: Volume 2179, 1-38404 (a) whether or not the laws in the Contracting States place the offense within the same category of offenses or describe the offense by the same terminology; or (b) whether or not the offense is one for which United States federal law requires proof or an element of proof, such as passage from one state to another, the use of the mails, wire, and other facilities of interstate or foreign commerce, or the effects upon such commerce, since such an element is required for the sole purpose of establishing the jurisdiction of United States federal courts. 4. Extradition shall be granted for an extraditable offense committed outside the terri- tory of the Requesting State, when the laws of the Requested State authorize the prosecu- tion or provide for the punishment of that offense in similar circumstances. 5. If the extradition request concerns distinct acts, each punishable under the laws of the two States by the deprivation of liberty, and if some of the acts do not fulfill the condi- tions set forth in Paragraphs I and 2 of this Article, the Requested State shall nonetheless grant extradition based upon such acts. 6. In matters concerning tax, customs duty, and foreign exchange offenses, extradition shall be granted pursuant to the terms set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article. Article 3. Nationality 1. There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State, but the executive authority of the United States shall have the power to surrender a national of the United States if, in its discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person sought shall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was committed. 2. If extradition is refused solely on the basis of the nationality of the person sought, the Requested State shall, at the request of the Requesting State, submit the case to its au- thorities for prosecution. Article 4. Political Offenses 1. Extradition shall not be granted by France when the offense for which extradition is requested is considered by France as a political offense or as an offense connected with a political offense or as an offense inspired by political motives. Extradition shall not be granted by the United States when the offense for which extradition is requested is consid- ered by the United States to be a political offense. 2. For the purposes of this Treaty, and in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article, the following offenses shall not be considered to be political offenses: (a) a murder or a willful crime against the person of a Head of State of one of the Con- tracting States, or a member of his or her family, or any attempt or conspiracy to commit, or participation in, any of the foregoing offenses; (b) an offense for which both Contracting States are obliged pursuant to a multilateral agreement to extradite the requested person or to submit the case to the competent author- ities for decision as to prosecution; Volume 2179, 1-38404 (c) a serious offense involving an attack against the life, physical integrity or liberty of internationally protected persons, including diplomatic agents; (d) an offense involving kidnapping, the taking of a hostage or any other form of un- lawful detention: (e) an offense involving the use of a bomb, grenade, rocket, automatic firearm or letter or parcel bomb if this use endangers persons; or (f) an attempt or conspiracy to commit, or participation in, any of the offenses listed in paragraphs 2(b), 2(c), 2(d) or 2(e) of this Article. 3. The Requested State may deny extradition of persons who committed any of the of- fenses mentioned in paragraphs 2(b), 2(c), 2(d), 2(e), and 2(f) of this Article pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article. In evaluating the character of the offense, the Requested State shall take into consider- ation the particularly serious nature of the offense, including: (a) that it created a collective danger to the life, physical integrity or liberty of persons; (b) that it affected persons foreign to the motives behind it; or (c) that cruel or treacherous means have been used in the commission of the offense. 4. Extradition shall not be granted if the executive authority in the case of the United States or the competent authorities in the case of France have substantial grounds for be- lieving that the request was for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person's race, religion, nationality or political opinions. Article 5. Military Offenses Extradition shall not be granted if the offense in respect of which it is requested is ex- clusively a military offense. Article 6. Humanitarian Considerations This Treaty does not prevent the executive authority in the case of the United States or the competent authorities in the case of France from denying extradition when surrender of the person might entail exceptionally serious consequences related to age or health. Article 7. Capital Punishment 1. When the offense for which extradition is sought is punishable by death under the laws in the Requesting State and is not punishable by death under the laws in the Requested State, the Requested State may refuse extradition unless the Requesting State provides the assurance that the death penalty will not te imposed or, if imposed, will not be carried out. 2. In instances in which a Requesting State provides the assurance in accordance with this Article, the death penalty, if imposed by the courts of the Requesting State, shall not be carried out. Volume 2179, 1-38404 Article 8. Prior Prosecution 1. Extradition shall not be granted when the person sought has been finally convicted or acquitted in the Requested State for the offense for which extradition is requested. 2. Extradition shall not be refused on the grounds that the authorities in the Requested State have decided not to prosecute the person sought for the acts for which extradition is requested, or to discontinue any criminal proceedings which have been instituted against the person sought for those acts. Article 9. Lapse of Time 1. Extradition shall be denied if prosecution of the offense or execution of the penalty has been barred by lapse of time under the laws of the Requested State. 2. Acts in the Requesting State that would interrupt or suspend the prescriptive period are to be taken into account by the Requested State to the extent possible under its laws. Article 10. Extradition Procedures and Required Documents 1. All requests for extradition shall be submitted through the diplomatic channel. 2. All requests shall be supported by: (a) documents, statements, or other types of information which state the nationality, probable location, and also describe the identity of the person sought in order to establish that the person is the subject of the prosecution or conviction; (b) information describing the facts of the offense and the procedural history of the case; (c) the text of the provisions describing the offense for which extradition is requested; and (d) the text of the law prescribing the punishment for the offense. 3. A request for extradition of a person who is sought for prosecution shall also be sup- ported by: (a) in the case of a request submitted by the United States, a duly authenticated copy of the warrant or order of arrest and the charging document; or (b) in the case of a request submitted by France, an original or a duly authenticated copy of the warrant or order of arrest and such information as would justify the committal for trial of the person if the offense had been committed in the United States. 4. A request for extradition relating to a person who has been found guilty or convicted of the offense for which extradition is sought shall also be supported by: (a) in the case of a request by the United States, if the person has been convicted, the original or a duly authenticated copy of the final judgment of conviction, or, it the person has been found guilty but has not yet been sentenced, a statement by a judicial authority that the person has been found guilty, and a duly authenticated copy of the warrant of arrest; Volume 2179, 1-38404 (b) in the case of a request by France, the original or a duly authenticated copy of the final judgment of conviction; (c) in all cases where a sentence has been imposed, a statement of the remainder of the sentence to be served; and (d) in the case of a person who has been found guilty in absentia, the documents re- quired by paragraph 3. Article 11. Admissibility of Documents The documents which accompany an extradition request shall be received and admit- ted as evidence in extradition proceedings if: (a) in the case of a request from the United States, they are transmitted through the dip- lomatic channel; (b) in the case of a request from France, they are certified by the principal diplomatic or principal consular officer of the United States resident in France, as provided by the ex- tradition laws of the United States, or they are certified or authenticated in any other manner accepted by the laws of the United States. Article 12. Translation All documents submitted by the Requesting State shall be translated into the language of the Requested State. Article 13. Provisional Arrest 1. In case of urgency, a Contracting State may request the provisional arrest of the per- son sought pending presentation of the request for extradition. A request for provisional ar- rest may be transmitted directly between the United States Department of Justice and the Ministry of Justice of the French Republic, by means of the facilities of the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), or through the diplomatic channel. 2. The application for provisional arrest shall contain: (a) a description of the person sought and information concerning the person's nation- ality; (b) the location of the person sought, if known; (c) a brief statement of the facts of the case, including the location and approximate date of the offense; (d) a description of the laws violated; (e) a statement of the existence of a warrant of arrest or a finding of guilt or judgment of conviction against the person sought; and (f) a statement that a request for extradition for the person sought will follow. 3. The Requesting State shall be notified without delay of the disposition of its appli- cation and the reasons for any denial. Volume 2179, 1-38404 4. A person who is provisionally arrested may be discharged from custody upon the expiration of sixty (60) days from the date of provisional arrest pursuant to this Treaty if the Requested State has not received the formal request for extradition and the supporting documents required by Article 10. 5. The fact that the person sought has been discharged from custody pursuant to para- graph 4 of this Article shall not prejudice the subsequent rearrest and extradition of that per- son if the extradition request and supporting documents are delivered at a later date. Article 14. Additional Information 1. If the Requested State considers that the information furnished in support of a re- quest for extradition is not sufficient to fulfill the requirements of this Treaty, that State may request that additional information be furnished within such reasonable length of time as it specifies. Such additional information may be requested and furnished directly between the United States Department of Justice and the Ministry of Justice of France or through the diplomatic channel. 2. If the person sought is under arrest for purposes of extradition and the additional in- formation furnished is not sufficient or is not received within the time specified, the person may be released from custody. Such release shall not preclude the Requesting State from making another request in respect of the same or any other offense. 3. When the person is released from custody in accordance with paragraph 2, the Re- quested State shall notify the Requesting State as soon as practicable. Article 15. Decision and Surrender 1.

If the request for extradition is granted, the authorities of the Contracting States shall agree on the date and place for the surrender of the person sought. The Requested State shall also notify the Requesting State of. the length of time the person has spent in detention for purposes of extradition. 4. If the person sought is not removed from the territory of the Requested State within the time prescribed by its law in the case of the United States, or in the case of France within 30 days from the date set for the surrender in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article, that person may be discharged from custody, and the Requested State may subsequently refuse extradition for the same offense. 5. In the event circumstances beyond the control of either Contracting State prevent the surrender or reception of the person sought, the Contracting States shall agree on a new date for the surrender, and the provisions of paragraph 4 of this Article shall apply. Volume 2179, 1-38404 Article 16. Temporary and Deferred Surrender 1. If the extradition request is granted in the case of a person who is being prosecuted or is serving a sentence in the Requested State, the Requested State may temporarily sur- render the person sought to the Requesting State for the purpose of prosecution. The person so surrendered shall be kept in custody in the Requesting State and shall be returned to the Requested State after the conclusion of the proceedings against that person, in accordance with conditions to be determined by mutual agreement of the Contracting States. 2. The Requested State may postpone the extradition proceedings against a person who is being prosecuted or who is serving a sentence in that State. The postponement may con- tinue until the prosecution of the person sought has been concluded and any sentence has been served. Article 17. Requests for Extradition Made by Several States If the Requested State receives requests from the other Contracting State and from any other State or States for the extradition of the same person, either for the same offense or for different offenses, the executive authority in the case of the United States and the com- petent authorities in the case of France shall determine to which State the person will be surrendered. In making its decision, the Requested State shall consider all relevant factors, including but not limited to: whether the requests were made pursuant to treaty; the place where each offense was committed; the respective interests of the requesting States; the gravity of the offenses; the nationality of the person sought and the victim; the possibility of further extradition between the requesting States; and the chronological order in which the requests were received from the requesting States. Article 18. Seizure and Surrender of Property 1. To the extent permitted under its law, the Requested State may seize and surrender to the Requesting State all articles, documents, and evidence connected with the offense in respect of which extradition is granted. The articles, documents, and evidence mentioned in this Article may be surrendered even when the extradition cannot be effected because of the death, disappearance, or escape of the person sought. 2. The Requested State may condition the surrender of the property upon satisfactory assurances from the Requesting State that the property will be returned to the Requested State as soon as practicable. The Requested State may also defer the surrender of such prop- erty if it is needed as evidence in the Requested State. 3. The rights of third parties in such property shall be duly respected Article 19. Rule of Speciality 1. A person extradited under this Treaty shall not be detained, tried, convicted, pun- ished, or subjected to any restriction of his freedom in the territory of the Requesting State for any act prior to the person's surrender, other than the offense for which extradition has been granted, except in the following cases: Volume 2179, 1-38404 (a) when the Requested State has given its consent. A request for such purpose may be submitted, together with the documents listed in Article 10, and any statements made by the person extradited concerning the offense for which the consent of the Requested State is requested; or (b) when, having had the opportunity to do so, the person extradited did not leave the territory of the Requesting State within 30 days of his final release, or returned to the terri- tory of the Requesting State after having left it. 2. If the denomination of the offense for which a person has been extradited is altered during the proceedings under the laws of the Requesting State or such a person is charged with a differently denominated offense, the person shall be prosecuted or sentenced provid- ed the offense under its new legal description is: (a) based on the same set of facts contained in the extradition request and its supporting documents; and (b) punishable by the same maximum penalty as, or a lesser maximum penalty than, the offense for which he was extradited. Article 20. Reextradition to a Third State 1. When a person has been surrendered by the Requested State to the Requesting State, the Requesting State shall not surrender the person extradited to a third State for an offense prior to the person's surrender, unless: (a) the Requested State consents to such surrender; or (b) the person extradited, having had the opportunity to do so, did not leave the terri- tory of the Requesting State within 30 days of the person's final release, or returned to the territory of the Requesting State after having left it. 2. Before granting a request under paragraph l(a) above, the Requested State may re- quest the documents referred to in Article 10, and any statements made by the person ex- tradited with respect to the offense for which the consent of the Requested State is requested. Article 21. Transit 1. Either Contracting State may authorize transportation through its territory of a per- son surrendered to the other State by a third State. A request for transit shall be made through the diplomatic channel or directly between the United States Department of Justice and the Ministry of Justice of the French Republic. The facilities of INTERPOL may also be used to transmit such a request. It shall contain a description of the person being trans- ported and a brief statement of the facts of the case. A person in transit may be detained in custody during the period of transit. 2. No authorization is required where air transportation is being utilized by one Con- tracting State and no landing is scheduled on the territory of the other Contracting State. If an unscheduled landing occurs on the territory of the other Contracting State, that Contract- ing State may require the request for transit as provided in paragraph 1. That Contracting Volume 2179, 1-38404 State shall detain the person to be transported until the request for transit is received and the transit is effected, so long as the request is received within 96 hours of the unscheduled landing. Article 22. Representation and Expenses 1. The Requested State shall advise and assist the Requesting State in connection with a request for extradition. Such advice and assistance shall be rendered in accordance with the provisions of the accompanying agreed minute, which shall form an integral part of this Treaty. 2. The Requesting State shall bear the expenses related to the translation of documents and the transportation of the person surrendered. The Requested State shall pay all other expenses incurred in that State by reason of the extradition proceedings. 3. Neither State shall make any pecuniary claim against the other State arising out of the arrest, detention, examination, or surrender of persons sought under this Treaty Article 23. Consultation The United States Department of Justice and the Ministry of Justice of the French Re- public may consult with each other directly or through the facilities of INTERPOL in con- nection with the processing of individual cases and in furtherance of maintaining and improving procedures for the implementation of this Treaty. Article 24. Application 1. This Treaty shall apply to offenses committed before as well as after the date it en- ters into force. 2. Upon the entry into force of this Treaty, the Treaty of Extradition between the Unit- ed States of America and the Republic of France signed at Paris January 6, 1909 and the Supplementary Convention signed at Paris February 12, 1970 with Exchanges of Letters signed at Paris June 2 and 11, 1970, shall cease to have effect between the United States of America and the French Republic. Nevertheless, the 1909 Treaty, as supplemented in 1970, shall apply to any extradition proceedings in which extradition documents have already been submitted to the courts of the Requested State at the time this Treaty enters into force. Article 25. Ratification and Entry into Force Each Contracting State shall notify the other of the completion of the constitutional procedures required for the ratification of this Treaty. The Treaty shall enter into force on the first day of the second month following the date of receipt of the last notification. Volume 2179, 1-38404 Article 26.

In witness whereof, the respective Plenipotentiaries have signed this Treaty. Done at Paris, in duplicate, this 23 day of April, 1996, in the French and English lan- guages, both texts being equally authentic. JACQUES TOUBON JANET RENO Volume 2179, 1-38404 AGREED MINUTE ON REPRESENTATION It is agreed that each country wishes to provide the other with the greatest degree of legal representation and legal advice (at no cost to the other) as would be permitted under its constitution and laws. In the spirit of this agreement, the two countries further agreed to provide each other legal advice and representation (including representation in court) at least equal to that giv- en to any other country pursuant to an extradition relationship whether existing at the present time or entered into in the future. For the United States, the agreement means that, at a minimum, the United States will provide legal counsel to review each request for extradition submitted by France with a view to advising and counseling France concerning strengths and weaknesses in its case. Further, to the extent necessary and appropriate, the legal counsel will work with France to improve the documentation in order to increase the likelihood of France's being successful in its request for extradition. Further, the United States undertakes to provide representation for France in all courtroom litigation arising in connection with a request for extradition and all pre-hearing and post-hearing matters connected therewith. Finally, the United States un- dertakes to provide representation for France in connection with all appellate and \"Habeas Corpus\" actions in regard to a request for extradition. For France the agreement means that at a minimum, France agrees to the following: 1) to include in the file presented to the Chambre d'Accusation any memoranda or doc- ument transmitted by the U.S. Government in support of its extradition request in order to allow the United States Government to conduct a continuing written defense of its extradi- tion request; 2) to request that the United States provide supplementary information or explanations as deemed necessary; 3) to communicate to the U.S. Government the notice of transmittal of the extradition request to the Parquet General of the Chambre d'Accusation; 4) to seek to postpone the ruling and to transfer the case to another session of the Chambre d'Accusation, in order to allow the U.S. Government, if necessary, the opportu- nity to argue its position and to submit additional memoranda in response to the oral argu- ments put forward by the defense. This postponement would be within a strict time limit and could be pronounced automatically or at the request of the Parquet; 5) to receive communications from. a U.S. Consular official or official of the U.S. De- partment of Justice designated to represent the United States interests in matters related to the extradition request. The names of these officials will be given to the Ministry of Justice and, if necessary, the prosecutor in question, for each extradition request; 6) to provide the authorized representative of the United States an opportunity, as soon as the extradition request is made, to furnish by note to the Ministry of Justice, all legal or factual data that he or she deems useful to support the request; Volume 2179, 1-38404 7) to communicate to the U.S. Government, by means of notice from the Ministry of Justice to the Embassy of the United States in Paris, that the request has been transmitted to the appropriate public prosecutor's office; 8) to notify the Embassy of the United States in Paris the date of the first hearing during which the extradition request will be examined by the Chambre d'Accusation; 9) to provide an opportunity for the authorized representative of the United States to furnish, before the hearing, an additional note within a sufficient time period for the inter- ested party to be notified and for the note to be added to the file; 10) to provide an opportunity for the authorized representatives of the United States to communicate, in a timely fashion, through the Ministry of Justice, to the same degree per- mitted to the Ministry of Justice, with the parquet general prior to the hearing examining the extradition request.
