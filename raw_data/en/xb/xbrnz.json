Has there been any recent study that suppports higher dosage? Have you personnally tried going higher, if so have you seen any additionnal benefits?", "sitename": "AnabolicMinds.com", "date": "2017-09-08", "cleaned_text": "Are ashwagandha, bacopa, boswellia, curcumin, arjuna, and Shilajit not from Ayurveda? are many modern studies backing up the \"traditional uses\" of all of the above Ayurvedic herbs. There's also tons of modern research showing that some things from Ayurveda DON'T work, or don't do certain things too, but that doesn't mean that they got NOTHING right. Ayurveda can have 100 herbs; hypothetically, if 90 of them can do nothing, 4 of them can kill you, and 6 of them are the six listed above that are being validated by modern research, their 6/100 record and 4 deadly recommendations doesn't mean that they didn't \"discover\" the 6 that do work. Not, it would mean that we shouldn't blindly trust what they say, and that we should do research to confirm safety and efficacy before trying any Ayurvedic things, but it doesn't take away that they did indeed discover the 6 things that work. Maybe they just got lucky 6/100 times, who knows, but if they were the first to use it, the first to widely document its preparation, use, and effects, how the hell did they not discover it man? Especially when even the studies on modern standardized extracts base their doses off these traditional doses. You're so anti-anything-that-can-even-be-construed-as-religious that you can't even admit that maybe Ayurveda blindly stumbled onto a few hits over several thousand years? I'm not claiming it's divinely inspired or even right most of the time. Only that they are credited with DISCOVERING these herbs, and the modern researchers say as much in the damn studies... "}
