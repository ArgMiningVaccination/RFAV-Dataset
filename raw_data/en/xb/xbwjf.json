One in four people in England will die from it. There are over 220,000new cases per year in England, and 128,000 deaths. The NAO is examiningNHS cancer services in England in a suite of three studies. This study, onwhether NHS cancer services are leading to better survival and lower mortalityfrom cancer, will be followed by one on the patient's experience of cancer careand one on the development and implementation of all aspects of the NHSCancer Plan. 2 In the early 1990s England suffered high cancer mortality rates and low rates of long-term survival compared with other European countries. The first step inresponding to this was the 1995 Calman-Hine report. The 2000 NHS CancerPlan built on this and was a comprehensive strategy to tackle cancer inEngland. The main aims of the NHS Cancer Plan are: to save more lives;improve support and care for patients; tackle health inequalities; and build forthe future through expansion of the cancer workforce, investment in facilitiesand research and preparation for the genetics revolution. 3 In this study we examine whether cancer services are saving more lives across England and in relation to other countries. We concentrated in particular on thefour cancers that cause the most deaths: breast, lung, bowel and prostate. 4 The Department of Health (through the NHS Cancer Plan) identified a number of key challenges in relation to saving lives from cancer. These are: ITo change lifestyles which increase levels of cancer, including smoking and diet; ITo expand cancer screening programmes where is it clear that they willsave lives; ITo detect cancer earlier and heighten public awareness of symptoms; ITo identify people with suspected cancer in general practice and have themassessed promptly by specialists; ITo speed up diagnosis; and ITo ensure the most appropriate treatment is available to all. 5 The Department of Health has set out a programme to build capacity through additional facilities and an expanded workforce in order to meet these challenges. This study considers actions being taken in relation to theareas above by drawing on a wide range of published and unpublished data forthis country and overseas, advice from experts, and surveys of Networks, GPsand cancer consultants.2summaryTACKLING CANCER IN ENGLAND: SAVING MORE LIVES Cancer survival and death rates are improving in England 6 To measure England's performance in saving the lives of cancer patients it is necessary to look at three measures - incidence, mortality and survival1: Incidence The number of cancers which occur each year in a population of given sizei. Mortality The number of people in a population of given size who die from cancer each year. Survival How long patients with a given type of cancer live on average after diagnosis - the proportion alive after five years is astandard measure. 7 Between 1971 and 2000 cancer incidence overall increased by 31 per cent (21 per cent for men and 39 per cent for women). This reflects in part morecomprehensive collection of data on the occurrence of cancer and in partincreases in several different cancer types such as prostate cancer in men, lungand breast cancer in women, and melanoma in men and women. 8 The reasons for increases in incidence are not fully understood although lifestyle factors such as trends in smoking and exposure to sunlight will impacton certain cancers. It should also be noted that, although the overall cancerincidence has risen, there has been a reduction in incidence in certain cancerssuch as stomach cancer. Again the reasons for this are not fully understood. 9 Despite the rise in incidence, mortality has fallen by 12 per cent (18 per cent for men and 7 per cent for women) between 1971 and 2002, mainly due to thereduction in lung cancer in men and better detection and treatment of breastcancer in women. 10 Five-year survival rates for all cancers diagnosed in the early 1990s (which is the latest data available for all cancers) were 36 per cent for men and 49 per centfor women. Whilst survival is improving for men and women in all socio-economic groups, survival rates for the better off have improved more than theyhave for those less well off. 11 England is continuing to improve on past performance in tackling the major cancers: IBreast cancer. Incidence rates have continued to rise in the last 20 years,chiefly among more affluent women, while mortality rates fell by onequarter. In 1970 the 5-year survival rate was around 50 per cent. It is nowapproaching 80 per cent for women diagnosed in the latter half of the 1990s; ILung cancer. In the absence of adequate tests to detect early-stage lungcancer, trends are determined by smoking patterns. The highest recordedlevel of smoking among men in the UK was 82 per cent in the first nationalsurvey in 1948. Incidence and mortality rates for men have fallen sharplysince peaking in 1974. The number of women smoking peaked in the late1960s, though at much lower levels than men. Incidence of lung cancer hasrisen by 76 per cent for women between 1971 and 2000, while mortalityrates are falling slightly after peaking in 1994. Lung cancer 5-year survivalrates are poor and have been largely static over time; 1 Incidence and mortality rates are expressed in this report as cases per 100,000 of the population, standardised for age to allow comparison between populations with different age structures. Cases arestandardised either to the European standard population, indicated by an (E), or the World standardpopulation, indicated by a (W). Survival rates are expressed as the percentage of those diagnosed whoare still alive after five years. In this report we have used relative, rather than absolute, survival rates.Relative survival rates allow for the fact that, had patients not had cancer, there is a possibility that theymight have died from some other cause in the five year period.3summaryTACKLING CANCER IN ENGLAND: SAVING MORE LIVES IBowel cancer. Incidence rates have risen very slowly for two decades, while mortality rates have fallen by over 25 per cent. 5-year survival rates haverisen steadily to nearly 50 per cent; and IProstate cancer. The introduction of the Prostate Specific Antigen test toindicate the possible presence of prostate cancer has accentuated existingtrends to increase reported incidence rates by half since 1980. Mortality hasfallen slightly since peaking in the mid 1990s and 5-year survival rates haverisen by two thirds since the early 1990s to over 60 per cent. 12 Cancer mortality varies widely within England, with higher rates in areas with high levels of deprivation. This is largely due to differences in incidence ratesfor lung cancer, which in turn are related to smoking rates. Reductions inmortality have been observed in recent years in almost all parts of the country.However, the degree of improvement has not been uniform. The rate ofprogress does not appear to relate to levels of affluence or deprivation. 13 For each of the four major cancers there are considerable variations in incidence and mortality between strategic health authorities (SHAs). These variations arewidest for lung cancer where incidence and mortality in the worst affected SHAare roughly twice that for the least affected SHA. Mortality rates may varybetween areas with similar level of incidence. Survival rates for the majorcancers consistently favour London and the south of England. 14 England's position in terms of the proportion of people who die from cancer is improving relative to other comparable countries. England now comparesfavourably with many other countries for mortality among men, for exampleFrance, Spain and Germany, although not so well for women. These resultspartly reflect the position of different countries on the curve of increasing anddecreasing smoking incidence and hence on the curve of rising and fallingincidence of lung and other cancers. 15 In the past, England's survival rates were lower than for most other European countries and the United States. However, the most recent data available on aninternationally comparable basis covers patients diagnosed in the early 1990sand whose 5-year survival pre-dates the changes introduced to English cancerservices in recent years. There are limitations on the ability to makecomparisons at a national level because cancer registries in many countries donot provide enough geographical coverage for direct comparison. Good practice is being introduced to build further on improvements in outcomes in the1990s, but progress varies by cancer and locality 16 The NHS has concentrated on cancer prevention measures for behaviours which clearly increase the risk of cancer, such as tobacco consumption, butthese measures will take time to have an impact. The NHS set up a nationalnetwork of services in 2000 to help smokers give up. It is one part of the widertobacco control strategy in the White Paper \"Smoking Kills\" ii. To date, the NHS Stop Smoking service, has helped about 340,000 people to quit at leasttemporarily (measured in numbers quitting for at least four weeks). We willcomment in more detail on cancer prevention initiatives in our forthcomingstudy on the NHS Cancer Plan.4summaryTACKLING CANCER IN ENGLAND: SAVING MORE LIVES 17 Screening women for breast cancer before symptoms are apparent has contributed to a sharp fall in mortality since its introduction in 1988. Theprogramme now faces the challenge of extending its coverage while addressinglow uptake in the London region. Clinical trials have established that screeningfor bowel cancer will significantly reduce mortality when it is introducedalthough it will inevitably add to pressure on resources for diagnosis andtreatment. Unlike the breast (and cervical) screening programmes, screening forlung and prostate cancers has not yet been shown to reduce mortality with thetechniques currently available, but research continues. 18 Some people do not seek immediate medical help when they develop symptoms that could point to cancer. There is little research on the reasons for,and impact of, patient delay, but a general lack of awareness of cancersymptoms continues to be a contributory factor in reducing survival. The NHSCancer Plan acknowledged this as an area that needed to be addressed. 19 There is increasing evidence from cancer registries within England and across Europe that, at least for some cancers, people in England are diagnosed withcancer at a more advanced stage of development than in other Europeancountries. This is likely to be due to a number of factors including patient delayin coming forward, difficulties for GPs in identifying symptoms early enoughand waits for diagnostic tests within the hospital. How much each of thesefactors contributes to overall delays is not known. There is some evidence fromindividual cancer registries that within England, people in deprived areas arelikely to be diagnosed with a more advanced stage of cancer than people frommore affluent areas. The reasons for this are not known. 20 NHS Trusts have a target to ensure that patients referred urgently by General Practitioners (GPs) on suspicion of having cancer are seen by a specialist withintwo weeks of referral. However, GPs can have difficulty identifying those mostat risk. GPs who responded to our survey gave us an indicative figure ofapproximately one third of patients they referred who were ultimatelydiagnosed with cancer but were not referred urgently and may therefore havehad longer waits for assessment by a consultant. About half of the GPs wesurveyed had seen the Department's referral guidelines and found them useful.Information flows between GPs and consultants are not always used as a wayof improving the accuracy of referral, urgent or otherwise. 21 Measures are being introduced to address delays for patients awaiting diagnosis for possible cancer. Suspected cancer patients are major users of endoscopy,pathology and radiology services. Waits for endoscopies can be too long,following substantial increases in demand in recent years. Pathology servicesalso suffer from shortages of trained staff and increasing demand. The NHS isgreatly expanding its training capacity for endoscopists and pathologists andpilot projects are increasing speed of diagnosis by re-designing both services. 5summaryTACKLING CANCER IN ENGLAND: SAVING MORE LIVES 22 In some areas there are still long waits for diagnosis through radiological procedures such as CT and MRI scans or barium meals, partly due to shortagesof skilled staff and large increases in demand for radiological procedures fromnon-cancer services. The NHS is improving services through a large-scalescanner replacement and renewal programme, increasing radiographer andradiologist numbers and innovative approaches to service redesign which havereduced waiting times considerably at pilot sites. 23 Dissemination of improving outcomes guidance (IOG) reports for specific cancers or groups of cancers started in the mid-1990s. The guidance reportsemphasise that multi-disciplinary team (MDT) working and specialisation ofcomplex cancer operations will improve outcomes for cancer patients. MDTworking is now increasingly well embedded in the NHS but is demanding onstaff time. Reconfiguration of some cancer services is already underway toenable specialisation in some complex procedures or cancers. However, IOGis at varying stages of implementation. 24 Waiting times for radiotherapy treatment can be too long, leading to courses of treatment not being delivered within good-practice times as specified by theJoint Council for Clinical Oncology. Delays are primarily due to a combinationof lack of trained therapy radiographers (a worldwide shortage) and lack oflinear accelerator capacity to deliver treatments. The Department of Health isseeking to address both issues through initiatives to recruit additional staff,increasing training places at universities (these have more than doubledbetween 1997 and 2002), introducing a new career structure for radiographersand procuring additional linear accelerators. There are also widespreadinitiatives to redesign local services for faster patient flows. 25 Large local variations in the availability of chemotherapy and other systemic therapies across England have been reported by pharmaceutical companies.The Secretary of State for Health has asked the National Cancer Director toinvestigate the variation in availability of cancer drugs approved by theNational Institute for Clinical Excellence. 26 Treatment for similar cancer conditions can vary according to area and age between different groups (for example affluent versus deprived groups andyounger versus older patient groups). There are some good reasons for this. Forexample, older people and those living in deprived areas may be less physicallyable to withstand radical treatments because of other co-existing illnesses.Variations in treatment may also, however, reflect lack of knowledge abouttreatment choices and some research has raised concerns that treatmentdecisions may not be made on all occasions on purely clinical grounds. TheNational Service Framework for Older People, published in 2001, recognisesthis. Unfortunately the data currently available do not permit a satisfactoryanalysis of these issues.TACKLING CANCER IN ENGLAND: SAVING MORE LIVES 6summaryTACKLING CANCER IN ENGLAND: SAVING MORE LIVES Recommendations (a) Reducing tobacco use can make a major contribution to prevention of cancer. Not enough is currently known about the long-term effectives of NHS StopSmoking services. The evaluation begun by the NHS to verify whether thosewho quit smoking through the services have managed to remain non-smokersshould be completed and published, and the NHS must then act promptly onthe conclusions. In addition, referral rates to stop smoking services and numberof patients quitting for at least 4 weeks vary substantially between StrategicHealth Authorities. Strenuous efforts should be made to bring all services up tothe level of the best. (b) Since there are lead times of several years to introduce screening programmes, the Department of Health should, following completion of its option appraisalof the best test available, move swiftly to finalise an implementation timetableincluding recruitment of staff and workforce expansion for the national roll-outof bowel cancer screening. Consideration needs to be given to prioritisation ofgeographical areas with the highest bowel cancer mortality. (c) More action is needed to tackle the delay on the part of some patients in England in coming forward for medical advice when they have suspicioussymptoms. In line with the NHS Cancer Plan the Department (working with theNHS) should co-ordinate the establishment of pilots to work with groups whichare consistently diagnosed with cancer at a more advanced stage, tounderstand why they delay seeking medical advice and to encourage them tocome forward earlier with symptoms. The pilots should be designed to avoidunnecessary anxiety to the public or overburdening primary care services. (d) The difficulty of identifying cancer symptoms at an early stage presents a major challenge to GPs. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) is currentlyrevising the Department's guidelines for GPs on referring patients with suspectedcancer. NICE and the Department should implement a strategy to ensure that theupdated guidelines for GPs are widely disseminated and acted upon. In addition,the NHS (through cancer Networks NHS trusts and PCTs) should encouragestronger relationships between GPs and hospitals to work together to improveassessment through the continued development of standardised referralprocedures and feedback on appropriateness of GP referrals. (e) Inevitably, given the real difficulties in making accurate diagnosis for some cancers and, even with better adoption of good practice in referring, aproportion of patients ultimately diagnosed with the disease will not initially bereferred urgently by GPs. The Department's existing target to measure time fromGP referral to assessment by a specialist, and time from referral to treatment,only covers patients deemed urgent by GPs. The Department should thereforedevelop a mechanism to audit the time taken for assessment and treatment ofpatients who are referred routinely and subsequently diagnosed with cancer. TheDepartment should also work with the Cancer Services CollaborativeImprovement Partnership to identify where in the patient pathway delays areoccurring for these patients, to enable action to be taken to address these delays. TACKLING CANCER IN ENGLAND: SAVING MORE LIVES 7summaryTACKLING CANCER IN ENGLAND: SAVING MORE LIVES (f) Given the shortage of radiotherapy and radiology staff, hospitals providing these services should compile information on the capacity and demand forservices in their area in order to assess local need for extra staff and facilities,and to assess opportunities for service improvement. Cancer Networks shouldwork closely with local Workforce Development Confederations to ensureadequate training places are available in each area. An overview of the positionshould be compiled nationally at regular intervals. (g) Information should be made available for the benefit of local communities to show service improvements intended to address poor cancer outcomes in theirlocality. Primary Care Trusts, in association with cancer Networks, shouldidentify the best vehicle to communicate this information, possibly throughannual reports or patient prospectuses. (h) Waiting times for radiotherapy treatment for cancer patients can be too long and should be monitored at the local level using standardised nationalmeasures as a basis for prioritising the need for additional resources. At a locallevel Primary Care Trusts, working collaboratively with cancer Networks,should take waiting times and capacity and demand analyses into accountwhen commissioning radiotherapy services. (i) Multi-disciplinary team (MDT) working is a key development in improving outcomes for cancer patients. In order to work effectively, it is essential thatMDTs have adequate administrative support but some lack this. Primary CareTrusts, working through cancer Networks, should set out how they intend toprovide this support, and set a timetable for doing so. (j) Patients access to anti-cancer drugs still appears to depend on where they live. SHAs working collaboratively with their PCTs and Cancer Networks should actspeedily on the findings of the National Cancer Director's review of take-up ofcancer drugs approved by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) tomake sure that patients in all areas have equal access to these cancer treatments. (k) It is currently very difficult to assess whether providers of cancer services deliver the best treatment to all age-groups of cancer patients. High priorityshould be given to implementation of the four national cancer clinical auditsthat sit within the National Clinical Audit Support Programme, which will allowthis issue to be examined in depth. Clinical audits of this kind should beextended to all other major cancers as soon "}
