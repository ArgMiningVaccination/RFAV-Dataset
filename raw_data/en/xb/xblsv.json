We believe that we are intrinsically interconnected with each other and that belief calls us to ensure that MUIH is a community where people of all identities and life experiences are understood, appreciated, and fully included. We believe that a diverse faculty, staff, and student body from a variety of backgrounds, experiences, identities and heritages, when working together, are more likely to produce the healers our society needs. MUIH must work to create an environment that thrives on the diversity individuals bring to this community of learners. As we open ourselves to a variety of viewpoints and experiences, we naturally become more compassionate and better able to address complex problems in our community, our nation, and the world. Deepening our understanding and caring for all people propels our commitment to addressing health care disparities and reaching underserved populations with integrative health care. As our community moves ahead, we will continue to enact our principles and values in ways that promote respect and dignity. We will stand by our responsibility to learn from and deepen our connections to each other. We will foster a community that allows individuals to flourish and promotes a just society. We will move forward together. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee The Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee is compromised of faculty, staff, and students at MUIH and is open to new members to join the committee at any time of year by emailing [. This committee meets on a monthly basis to discuss issues that have been brought forward, to plan educational events for the University, and to inform future events and policies for the University. Current committee members include:](javascript:;) Precious Boyd, Accounting Coordinator Michelle Coleman, Dean of Student Affairs Mimi West, Director of Academic Success & Accessibility Maria Hernandez, Marketing Manager Raejon Makonnen, Director of Counseling & Wellness Services Alyssa Seibert, Engagement Specialist Monthly Calendars of Observances The monthly calendar of observances are created to acknowledge the observances of many events in many cultures, religions, and holidays. These calendars are representative of the MUIH population and are designed to be educational calendars with links to more information of the observance. It is our hope that our community and those outside of our community will use these tools to expand their knowledge and be inclusive of all. 2023 Calendars Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Resources Disability Services The Disability Services department at MUIH is fully committed to creating an inclusive learning community and upholding the letter and spirit of federal and state laws that ensure equal treatment of persons with disabilities.

Project Implicit Project Implicit is a non-profit organization based out of Harvard University. Their research focuses on implicit social cognition - thoughts and feelings outside of conscious awareness and control. They have developed the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure attitudes and beliefs that people may be unwilling or unable to report. These tests measure the strength of associations between concepts and evaluations or stereotypes. The main idea is to identify aspects of human nature and to provide self-awareness on a variety of subjects. Each assessment takes roughly 10 - 15 minutes and there are 15 assessments available. To access these assessments, visit [https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html).
