How to best support your immune system Whilst there is not much we can do about our genes, the one thing we can do to support the immune system is to control our diets. There are certain vitamins and minerals that help the immune system function normally, so making sure that we keep them topped up is key. Vitamin C for immunity There is a reason your doctor tells you to make sure you are getting enough vitamin C during the winter months.

Vitamin D for immunity The elusive vitamin D is key for normal immune function but it is hard to get in areas like the UK. This is because the main source of vitamin D comes from the direct exposure of the skin to sunlight and we do not see that much of it year round in the UK! You can get vit D from some foods, including red meat, egg yolks and oily fish but some diets do not include these. Do not worry though, a vitamin D supplement could sort you out and keep your levels topped up.

Vitamin D3 is also known as the sunshine vitamin, as we get it from exposure to the sun. It helps to support the absorption of calcium and phosphorus, which in turn helps to keep bones strong. Vitamin D3 also helps to support the normal functioning of the immune system. There are a few food sources of vitamin D3, including fish such as salmon and mackerel as well as egg yolks. But we often do not eat enough of these to get the amounts of Vitamin D3 we really need. We also get vitamin D3 from exposure to the sun. But it can be difficult to get sufficient exposure during the winter months or if you spend a lot of time working inside. Therefore it is recommended that you should take a daily vitamin D3 supplement.

In humans, this means the body's ability to prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses, from invading and causing harm or illness. The immune system is made up of a number of different organs, cells and proteins within the body, which all work together to protect the body from invasion from bacteria and viruses. There are two different parts that make up the immune system. The innate immune system is the one which you are born with, and the adaptive immune system is the one which you develop as you are exposed to microbes. These two parts work together to protect you from infections and viruses. In humans, the immune system acts as the body's defence against infections. It attacks germs and foreign substances, banishing them from the body. Our immune system defends the body from infections and diseases. The functioning of our immune system is determined by multiple factors, including our genetic makeup, our lifestyle, our diet and the environments that we have been exposed to over the years. You can support your immune system by ensuring that you are getting the right nutrients, through both your diet and by taking supplements. You can take a vitamin-specific supplement if there is one you feel that you are deficient in, or else, an all-round immune support supplement.
