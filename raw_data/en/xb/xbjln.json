[Consultations](/pages/homeopathic-consultations/) Homeopathy is an expressive, creative practice that helps to raise the vital force of a person. This helps their body become strong enough to alleviate itself of an ailment, a mistunement or disease. This natural system of medicine works by using a small dose of a substance to help stimulate the body's healing forces. It is a safe and gentle treatment, yet extremely effective when used properly. Homeopaths treat the whole person rather than a single symptom. A common analogy would be 10 people with sore throats seeking the help of a physician. Each person will be treated the same way (for example, given antibiotics). The same 10 people seeking the help of a homeopath will have a 1 on 1 in-depth interview with the homeopath and the treatment given will be suited to each person on an individual basis. The homeopath does not diagnose an illness; rather, the homeopath treats the whole person and each person may receive a different remedy at a different potency designed to match each one's need. Founded by Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician, over 200 years ago, homeopathy is based on the \"law of similars.\" A substance that could cause symptoms in large amounts may heal you in minute homeopathic doses. For example, the homeopathic remedy Allium Cepa (Red Onion) is used to treat the runny nose and watery eyes from a cold or hay fever, the very symptoms it would cause if one were cutting a red onion in the kitchen. There are hundreds of remedies that homeopathic practitioners use. Homeopathic remedies are small pellets that are generally taken under the tongue or dissolved in water. They are non-toxic and safe for pregnant women, infants, adults, and pets and are FDA-approved. A typical homeopathic appointment can last from 1 to 2 hours and is a comprehensive discussion of your personal health history and what your health goals are. Homeopathy Is NOT: - Homeopathy is NOT herbal supplements. - Homeopathy is NOT vitamin supplements. - Homeopathy is NOT a fast cure.

Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine as children do. It's not just in some of us; it is in everyone. And as we let our own lights shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.\" "}
