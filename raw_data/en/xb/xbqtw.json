The R .g Veda Sam .hitam (hereafter RV) tells how humanity and the cosmos are embodied in theanatomy of Purusha, the \"Cosmic Man\" (RV 10: 90). In the Caraka Sam.hitam(hereafter CS) the principal text of Ayurvedic medicine, the human body is a homunculus embodying greater cosmological principles(CS IV: 1). Similarly, Banaras is considered to be a microcosm of the divine world. As such, the city is thought to encapsulate all other cen-ters of Hindu religious pilgrimage (Singh 1993 ). This concept is central in Diana Eck's comprehensive survey of Banaras's sacred geography:\"The symbol that condenses the whole into the part is common in theHindu world. The whole of the sacred Vedas, they say, may be packedinto a single powerful mantra . . . or the whole of the universe may bedepicted in the 'sacred circle' of a cosmic map called a mandala. [Banaras]is this kind of symbol, which condenses the whole of India into a great'sacred circle,' a geographical mandala\" ( 1983 : 41). Just as Banaras is a prototype for sacred India, her sacred features are prototypes for the divine roles of the city as a whole. Foremost amongthese features are the Ganga and the two famous cremation grounds(shmasha mns)along her banks. Pilgrims commonly say that Banaras is like the Mother Ganga, who accepts and puries anyone and anythingthat comes to her and transforms them into herself. Indeed, more thana million pilgrims visit Banaras each year for the same reasons that they 29bathe in the Ganga: to purify themselves of pollution and sin in hopes of better fortune in this life or the next, or spiritual liberation (moksha) from the perpetual cycle of rebirth. For those desiring the latter, the Ka mshmKan.d.a offers the promise of instant liberation for all who die within the sacred boundaries of the city (Skanda Pura mn.a [SP] IV. 1.30). Even people who die elsewhere can obtain an auspicious sendoff at the famous shmasha mnsat Manikarnika and most cremation grounds, which are typi- cally located on the outskirts of Indian towns and cities, these shmasha mns are centrally located in Banaras, along the bank of the river. Indeed, theshmasha mnof Manikarnika lies next to the purported site of cosmogen- esis, the place where Lord Vishnu carved out the world with his discus.Manikarnika is named for the earring that fell to earth when Shiva shook with ecstasy over this earthly creation. To this day, Shiva continues to dance the Nat.aramjamong the burning pyres of Marikarnika (SP IV. 1.26). Lord Shiva is the ultimate ascetic of the shmasha mn.Banaras is the city of Shiva. So it is said that Banaras is the mahamshmasha mn,the Great Crema- tion Ground these features\u2014the Ganga, the shmasha mn,and the city as a whole\u2014functions as a kind of cosmic sink, a sacred dumping ground for30 The Cosmic Sink Figure 3.

Yet although people who work as sweepers and cremation attendants are socially denigrated formanaging the excreta of humanity, the same stigma does not apply tothese sacred geographic features. On the contrary, people believe thatthese places derive their divinity and ritual power from their ability totake on the pollution of any and all who come to them. Shakti takes theform of Ganga Ma. Lord Shiva takes the form of cremation ascetic. Bothare as innite as their capacity to absorb the sins of the universe. These dynamics hold true for Aghor as well. The Kina Ram tradition asserts that Aghor is like the Ganga, accepting the purest streams fromthe Himalayas as well as the sewage of the cities. The Aghori considerBaba Kina Ram to be the manifestation of Lord Shiva; his dhuni, a cre- mation pyre; and the Ashram, the mahamshmasha mn.Like the city, the ashram and its namesake play the role of cosmic sink for theremoval of pollution and sin from the many pilgrims and patients theyreceive. Signicantly, this role is informed by the same models of puri-cation that people use when bathing in the Ganga or offering the bodiesof their ancestors to the fires of final sacrifice. These models of purifi-cation are the foundation for the practice of Aghor medicine. Thus, weneed to understand their relationships to the history and sacred geogra-phy of Banaras. baba kina ram The Kina Ram Aghor tradition emerged as an ideology of resistance to thepervasive social inequalities and power dynamics of Banaras during theBritish Raj. These dynamics have persisted through independence, andthey continue to shape the context in which Aghor medicine is practicedtoday. The hagiography of Baba Kina Ram illustrates this fact well,though it has been ltered through the lens of the postreform Aghor tra-dition. His story has taken shape through oral legends recounted by Aghordisciples, published in tracts written by the Aghori, and illustrated onthe many signboards hanging in Aghori ashrams (Ram 1997 ; Asthana 1994 a, 1994 b). Although the Kina Ram Aghori have left more written records than the kampamlikas before them, a reliable history of the lineage before the 1950 s awaits the discovery of sufcient primary source materials. Three potential sources exist for these materials, but such a historical project isbeyond the scope and scale of this investigation. 1I therefore represent the hagiography of the Aghori in the same way that I have operationalizedThe Cosmic Sink 31my denition of Aghor itself: that is, according to the stated beliefs of my informants. Although this denition is biased toward a postreformagenda, it is salient within the current Kina Ram Aghor tradition, its social and medico-religious practices, and the image the Aghori projected to the outside world. It follows the argument that one should evaluatesuch hagiographies more for their ideological lessons than for their his-torical accuracy (Lorenzen 1995 ). The Kina Rami tell of the miraculous circumstances surrounding the birth and early childhood of their founder and namesake. According to them, Kina Ram's parents were a childless elderly couple who lived in asmall village in the district of Chandouli near Banaras. Kina Ram wasconceived shortly after Lord Shiva visited his mother in a dream. Justafter his birth, the infant was visited by Lords Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva disguised as wandering sages, who whispered an initiating mantra into his ear. As a young child, Kina Ram gave inspirational teachings tohis age-mates and lived a pious life. His marriage was arranged by thetime he was nine, but he correctly foresaw the death of his bride-to-beon the eve of their wedding. The circumstances surrounding her deathwere considered ominous, and the young Kina Ram was released fromthe obligations of family life to become a wandering ascetic.32 The Cosmic Sink Figure 4. Statue of Baba Kina Ram in the middle of Krim Kund, 2000 .[To view this image, refer to the print version of this title.] Such miraculous accounts of early childhood are common in Indian hagiographies, where they serve to establish the saint's supernaturalpower and religious vocation at an early age, but they are more commonfor saints of lower caste or untouchable origins for the likely reason thatthey serve to mitigate or deny their natal social status (Lorenzen 1995 ). In the case of Baba Kina Ram, however, divine conception would miti-gate his upper -caste origins, supporting the argument that Aghor func- tions as an ideology of resistance to the entire schema of social hierarchy,not just to any caste or class within it. As a young ascetic, Baba Kina Ram wandered India for many years before encountering Hinglaj Devi, a goddess associated with a legendarycenter of tantric worship in northwestern India. Hinglaj Devi directedhim to go to Banaras, where she said he would find her once again,dwelling beside a sacred bathing tank that would eventually be knownas Krim Kund. This message was reinforced by Lord Dattatreya, anantinomian form of Shiva closely associated with the cremation ground,who appeared to Baba Kina Ram atop Girnar Mountain in Gujarat.Considered to be the adi guru (ancient spiritual teacher) and founding deity of Aghor, Lord Dattatreya offered his own flesh to the young asce-tic as prasamd(a kind of blessing), conferring upon him the power of clair- voyance and establishing a guru-disciple relationship between them. The young Kina Ram found his guru once again in Banaras. This time, Lord Dattatreya appeared in human form as Baba Kalu Ram, sitting inthe shmasha mnat Harischandra Ghat. The guru gave three supernatural tests to his disciple. In the rst, he fed grains to a group of chatteringskulls. Kina Ram commanded the skulls to stop eating. Baba Kalu Ramthen stated that he was hungry, so Kina Ram caused three sh to jumpout of the Ganga. The disciple cooked the sh for his guru with woodleft over from a cremation re. With Kina Ram having passed these twotests, Sri Kalu Ram offered a third: he pointed to a body floating in theriver. Kina Ram pulled the body ashore and brought it back to life. Therevived soul was an Aghor disciple who later became known as BabaJivayan Ram. Satisfied with the performance of his disciple, Sri KaluRam accompanied Baba Kina Ram to the dwelling place of Hinglaj Deviat Krim Kund. Having reunited with the goddess, Baba Kina Ram established his dhuni (and thus, the seat of the Aghor lineage) beside Krim Kund. There, he became famous for his social activism and healing, the two dominantthemes of his hagiography. The most famous story of Baba Kina Ramrelates his confrontation with Chet Singh, the maharaja of Banaras. 2TheThe Cosmic Sink 33maharaja built a grand fortress just south of the shmasha mnto improve his physical presence within the sacred boundaries of Kashi. In celebra-tion of its completion, he ordered a grand yaj\u00f1a (Vedic re sacrice) in the courtyard. The sacrice was to be a very auspicious affair. A number ofreputed Brahmin priests and pan.d.itswere on hand to perform the rite, and the richest and most powerful men of Banaras were in attendance. Baba Kina Ram was not on the guest list, but he nonetheless arrived at the ritual riding atop a donkey, an inauspicious way to show up at anorthodox ceremony. 3When the maharaja and his priests berated him, the Baba responded, \"Do you think that knowledge of scripture givesyou the authority to decide what is holy and virtuous? Such knowledgeis nothing special. Look, even my donkey can chant the Vedas.\" Thedonkey proceeded to chant the Vedas to an astonished court. Baba KinaRam then cursed the maharaja, foretelling that his new fort would beoccupied only by pigeons and that his family would never give birth tosons. Shortly thereafter, the British routed Chet Singh from the fortress.It has remained unoccupied ever since. Moreover, as Baba Kina Ram pre-dicted, Chet Singh's successors had to adopt male children to maintainthe lineage until the most recent generation. 4 Although some scholars emphasize potential conflicts between the ritual authority of Brahmin priests and the worldly authority of theirKshatrya kings (Dumont 1966 ; Gupta 1995 ), the story of Baba Kina Ram's curse instead serves as an allegory of resistance against the col-lusion between these two groups. Such collusion has been a recurringtheme in the history of Banaras, which has been as much a political andeconomic crossroads (tmrtha) as a symbolic one. The city arose out of a cluster of shrines and temples at the intersection of two key northernIndian trade routes, the Ganga and the Grand Trunk Road, sometimearound the ninth century b.c.e. (Eck 1983 ). Because of its strategic loca- tion, Banaras became a major inland commercial capital, developing asa nexus of economic activity in parallel with its development as a reli-gious center (Freitag 1989 ). This codevelopment of symbolic and mate- rial prosperity was evident in the activities of the Gossains, mendicantwarriors organized around local temple networks, who protected trav-eling merchants and pilgrims by providing armed escorts, safeguardingmerchandise, and enforcing trade agreements. The Gossains operated insmall decentralized, feudal houses that concentrated religious, economic,and military power into more than three hundred local neighborhoods,or muhallas, through complex networks of patron-client relationships similar to the jajmani system of rural India (Beidelman 1959 ).34 The Cosmic SinkThis complex and persistent web of local power relations made Banaras easily conquerable from without but totally untamable from within. Thecity's strategic location, auspiciousness, and wealth of resources havemade it a key asset for political rulers, beginning with its emergenceas one of sixteen Janapadas (\"Great Kingdoms,\" literally \"foothold ofa tribe\"), from the eighth to the sixth centuries b.c.e. Banaras was the capitol of the Gahadavala kingdom in the twelfth century c.e., before submitting to a long chain of Mughal and British colonial masters. Yetnone of these authorities were able to control Banaras without close col-laboration with its local centers of power. Such collaboration entailedcareful and often problematic exchanges of symbolic, social, and mate-rial power. The emergence of the maharaja of Banaras during the Mughal and British periods provides key examples of these problematic exchanges.The city's status shifted radically under Mughal occupation. Its religiousand cultural institutions enjoyed generous patronage under Akbar, onlyto see these mainstays destroyed two generations later under the intol-erant rule of Aurangzeb (Freitag 1989 ). These structures were partially rebuilt in the declining years of the Delhi Sultanate, for which Banarasremained an important source of revenue as well as a symbolic instru-ment for appeasing its Hindu subjects. To achieve the requisite localsupport for these objectives, the nawab of Awadh appointed the head ofa prominent family of Hindu Bumihar landholders to serve as tax col-lector instead of a Muslim zamindari, as was usually the case. Through key alliances with the Gossains and nine families of merchant bankersknown as the Naupatti, members of this Bumihar family became highlysuccessful government revenuers, indispensable to Mughal and laterBritish rulers, who granted them the title of raja, and then maharaja,in subsequent generations (Freitag 1989 ). Despite his success, the maharaja held a tenuous position in Banaras. Lacking a royal pedigree and perched between potential war with colo-nial authorities and a revolt by the local population, the new maharajawas badly in need of symbolic legitimacy. He therefore adopted the samestrategy of \"sanskritization\" that many of his merchant bankers hadpursued. 5He heavily patronized the city's temples, some with mahants of previously marginal standing. They, in turn, honored him in theirwords and ritual deeds. He patronized schools of traditional literatureand music, which lauded him in their arts. He supported large religiousfestivals, such as the Ram Lila, a public enactment of the epic Ramchar- itmanas (a popular form of the Ramayana), the largest of which had himThe Cosmic Sink 35appearing before thousands to exchange salutes with the gods (Lutgen- dorf 1989 ). Without the need for a costly standing army, royal patron- age of the arts increased under the British, resulting in more elaboratefestivals, expanded institutions of traditional learning, and a near monop-oly in publishing (King 1988 ). Not surprisingly, the products of these local institutions later served as templates for linguistic and religiousrevivalism and nationalist identity in the half centuries before and afterIndian independence (see Dalmia 1996 ). These historical relationships illustrate the classic struggle between temporal and ritual authority that Dumont ( 1966 ) describes. Yet these struggles never yield a clear winner, and the lines of defense are oftenblurred. Instead, a dialectic of coercion and conflict emerges that per-sists specically because it is never resolved (see Nuckolls 1996 ; Guha 1989 ). Baba Kina Ram attempted to break this dialectic by confronting the maharaja, the priests, and their mutual patronage. The Aghori wereusually explicit about this confrontation when retelling the story\u2014somewould even go so far as to trace the flow of money, power, and prestigebetween the various interests\u2014noting that that these overall dynamicscontinue into the present day. At a religious level, the curse of the maharaja closely parallels the Puranic tragedy of Daksha's sacrice. As the reluctant father-in-law ofLord Shiva, Daksha disapproved of the ascetic activities of his new sonand his association with the shmasha mn.Daksha therefore excluded Lord Shiva from a great fire ceremony, a yaj\u00f1a, to which he invited all the other gods (SP IV. 2: 87). In the end, the gods berated Daksha for his omission, and his daughter jumped into the re as an act of protest (SPIV.2: 87-88 ). Daksha's sacrice also has a more direct symbolic link to Baba Kina Ram. After the tragic death of his consort, Shiva wanderedthe earth, carrying his wife's corpse until Vishnu eventually cut her bodyinto many pieces with his ngernail. The places where these pieces fellbecame Shakti pmthas, major centers of power and tantric worship throughout India. Hinglaj, the place where the crown of the daughter'sskull fell to earth, is one of the most mythically prominent of these cen-ters. Her namesake is the goddess at Krim Kund (Ram 2000 ). Both of these stories depict their protagonists as sincere but mis - understood gures with close ties to the cremation grounds. The anti - nomianism of Lord Shiva and Baba Kina Ram incurs the disapproval ofthe landlords and priests of the Brahminical orthodoxy, who excludethem from Vedic rituals. Consequently, these rituals are rendered inaus-picious, the leaders of the orthodoxy are stricken with tragedies, and36 The Cosmic Sinktheir underlying hypocrisy is exposed. The protagonists, Lord Shiva and Baba Kina Ram, prevail as social revolutionaries against the powers-that-be in Banaras. Many other tales reinforce Baba Kina Ram's role as an advocate against social oppression. In one, he rescues his rst disciple and succes-sor from the violence of a brutal zamindar (feudal landlord) by correctly telling the latter that he can nd more than his share of rent buried rightbeneath his feet. In another story, Kina Ram poses as a beggar and hashimself arrested in a town where the nawab (Muslim ruler) has punishedbegging with hard labor at his mills. Kina Ram forces the millstonesto turn by themselves, thereby attaining from the frightened nawab therelease of his fellow prisoners and a pledge of alms for all beggars. KinaRam also stops a group of men from killing a young widow for givingbirth to an illegitimate son. The men skulk away after Baba Kina Ramsuggests that they kill the father of the child as well, a member of theirgroup whom he is fully prepared to reveal. He finds employment forthe widow as the resident caretaker of an auspicious samadh mshrine, the burial site of a famous saint. Baba Kina Ram's social activism extended to his healing practices as well. He particularly reached out to women with socially discreditedhealth conditions such as infertility or leprosy. Some people say that BabaKina Ram conferred fertility upon barren women in the same mannerthat Lord Shiva brought fertility to the baba's own mother. Once, afterKina Ram blessed a barren woman with four children, another saintasked his guardian deity for the secret of this power. The deity demandedthat the saint offer a piece of flesh from his own body for the knowledge.The saint was unwilling to make such an offering. Yet when the deitydirected the saint to obtain flesh from the body of Baba Kina Ram, thelatter readily cut a piece from his thigh. The deity stated that this will-ingness for self-sacrice enabled Baba Kina Ram to perform such mirac-ulous deeds. The allegory of healing as self-sacrice addresses two important chal- lenges to the traditional practice of medicine in Banaras. The rst is theimportance of establishing the sincerity of the Aghori healer among alarger population of dhus, save [yourselves] from these [in order to] enjoy Kashi). Bulls can be unpredictable. Stairs can be steep. But gurus can be the most dangerousof all, for the corrupt among them can poison their disciples, just as themost sincere can be their salvation. The same is true of healers, who areThe Cosmic Sink 37commonly revered as gurus in their own right, regardless of any other claims to religious authority. The outward expression of self-sacrice canhelp establish the underlying motivation and qualities of the healer. Wewill soon see how many patients of the Aghori come to value these qual-ities more than they value the medicines themselves. The most famous of Baba Kina Ram's miraculous cures established Krim Kund as a place of healing. A desperate mother approached theAghori in search of a cure for her dying son. In response, Kina Ramcharged a few grains of rice with the Krmmmantra, a seed mantra asso- ciated with Kali and other ery manifestations of the divine feminine.Kali is the ery goddess who is often seen \"dancing\" upon a supineShiva. She wears an apron of human arms and a necklace of humanheads. Blood drips from her extended tongue as she holds a scythe andsevered head. Yet despite her ferocious appearance, Kali is often consid-ered to be a loving mother who helps the spiritual seeker break awayfrom worldly attachments and limitations. Kina Ram cast the mantra-laden grains into the water and instructed the mother to bathe her son there on ve consecutive Sundays and Tues-days. The mother did as instructed, and the boy was cured. Shortly there-after, a courtesan was cured of leprosy by bathing in the kund \u2014despite the double stigma of having been a prostitute afflicted with the mostuntouchable of human diseases. News of these cures quickly spread, andmore people began bathing in its waters. Baba Kina Ram proclaimed,\"This kund shall live as long as the Ganga remains in Kashi.\" Like the Ganga who fed her waters, and the Aghori who charged them, the KrimKund acquired a reputation for great power in the context of limitlessnondiscrimination. ganga ma When I asked Agania Devi, a longtime Aghor disciple and retired school-teacher, about the healing powers of Krim Kund, she began discussing theGanga. \"'Ganga' means holy,\" she said. \"There is no kind of evil in her.All rivers flow into her and meet in her, and Ganga takes all into her. Evenso, her purity remains. In the same way, are these Aghor saints.\" Hercompanion, Sangita, expanded on this idea: \"There is no darkness in it.It has taken everything in it, meaning all things should be all right [i.e.,no discrimination against anything]. [One should] stay away from dis-crimination, have a simple nature, and live one's life with simplicity.\"These women spoke of the kund, the Ganga, and Aghor interchangeably.38 The Cosmic SinkSangita had previously bathed in the kund for a variety of ailments, and she claimed to have good results. We rst met when she brought herson to bathe for an undisclosed \"personal problem\" within the family.Her son summarized the situation as follows: \"Now we have put theburden of [these] problems on Baba. He will do it.\" used the verbd.amlnam,meaning \"to pour\" or \"to cast,\" verbalizing a hydraulic model of purication that frequently arose in the explanatory models of patientsat the ashram and elsewhere. The healing modalities of Aghor medicinein general, and Krim Kund in particular, were informed by such culturalmodels of purication, for which the Ganga is a major prototype. Onecould therefore learn a great deal about the dynamics of healing in Aghormedicine by examining models of pollution and purity with respect tothis holy river. The Ganga is the foremost of India's seven sacred rivers, winding f- teen hundred miles from the glaciers of the Himalayas through twenty-nine cities and seventy towns of the northern Indian plains and exitinginto the Indian Ocean through the great delta that feeds into the Bay ofBengal on the eastern coast. The river is the primary source of irrigationand alluvial deposits for the agrarian economies stretching out from herbanks. For many centuries, the Ganga was a major route for trade andtransportation. In recent decades, she has become a dumping ground foruntreated sewage, industrial waste, fertilizers, pesticides, and detergents\u2014in addition to an increasing number of animal and human bodies(Kumra 1995 ). The Ganga is also a pilgrimage destination for the hun- dreds of millions who bathe in her waters to remove the accumulatedkarma of many lifetimes, make offerings to deities and ancestors, andoffer themselves as the ultimate sacrice at the time of death. For theselatter reasons especially, the Ganga is more than a river. She is the HolyMother. She is Ganga Ma. The story of the Holy Mother's descent to earth has been recounted in numerous oral traditions, as well as in the Epic and Puranic literature.Through the single-minded austerities of the pious King Bhagiratha,Lord Brahma granted a boon that Ganga Ma would descend upon theearth so she might carry sixty thousand of his cursed ancestors to thenetherworld. Her fall was broken by Shiva's matted locks, which pre-vented the earth from being destroyed by her impact, and the locks chan-neled her downward flow from the Himalayas. Once upon the plains,Ganga Ma sought out King Bhagiratha in Banaras, who led her to theremains of his ancestors in Bengal, where she swept them along to theother world (Darian 2001 ; Eck 1983 ).The Cosmic Sink 39Although any point along the Ganga can serve as a pilgrimage site, a number of especially powerful tmrthas (sacred crossings) along her banks allow pilgrims to cover multiple spiritual bases with a single visit.6 Banaras is the largest and most visited of these tmrthas, presenting itself as Kashi (\"the Luminous\"), an otherworldly abode that rests uponShiva's trident and grants instant liberation to all who die within itsboundaries (SP IV. 1.26: 80). The Ganga forms the eastern boundary of Kashi, delineating the auspicious from the inauspicious, for people saythat those who die on her far shore are destined to be reborn as donkeys(Eck 1983 ). One might therefore expect that such a border would occupy a peripheral position in this sacred space. Nevertheless, the Ganga is acentral symbol and geographic feature of Kashi. Most pilgrims begin their visit to Banaras with a ritual bath in the Ganga. Ideally, they bathe just before dawn, when the river waters areoffered to the rising sun while reciting the Gayatri Mantra. 7Although the bath is a pumjamin itself, pilgrims may make other offerings of lamps, flowers, incense, rice, and prayers, just as they would in a temple or shrine.The ritual structure of these offerings can range from personal formulasto complex rites performed under the direction of Brahmin pan.d.ams,rit- ual specialists who hawk their services from umbrella-covered platformsalong the bathing ghats. Ritual bathing is the prototypical interaction with Mother Ganga. Yet amid the sacred ablutions, washerpeople (dhobms)scrub and pound the city's laundry. Herders bring their buffaloes to cool themselves in themidday sun. Pilgrims throw plastic bags full of flowers into the river,and people everywhere urinate and defecate along her banks with thefull knowledge that the next rain will wash their excreta into the watersbelow. The Ganga is also a dumping ground for the dead. The unburntremnants of more than eighty cremated human corpses are put in theriver every day (Parry 1994 ), and the remains of cows, buffaloes, and other animals float down the river like an endless convoy of bloatedbarges. But even these insults are dwarfed by the 125million liters of wastewater that the city generates, 84percent of which it dumps un - treated into the river every day (Ahmed 1995 ). As a consequence, this river of spiritual purication has a fecal coliform count that is two hun-dred times greater than the World Health Organization's recommendedlimit for safe swimming (Mishra 2000 ). The Ganga is often cited as an example of the apparent incongruence between Indian religious models of ritual pollution and scientic modelsof biological pollution. However, conversations with people along the40 The Cosmic Sinkghats reveal a more complex and ambivalent relationship between these two models of contamination. Despite local awareness of river pollu-tion, I found mixed interpretations of its implications. After hearingcountless opinions and anecdotes, I decided to formally interview twodozen people on the riverbank on the subject. A couple of cosmopolitan-looking young men told me (in Hindi) after their bath that \"the Gangais certainly pure. Mother Ganga is giving salvation to the whole world,be it cattle, be it sparrows, be it dogs, be it man.\" Then (in Bhojpuri)they said, \"Certainly [the Ganga] is polluted. You are seeing it, aren'tyou? You have the proof.\" On another day, a sherman spat a largemouthful of pamninto the river so that he could more clearly give me the opposite answer in similar terms: \"Certainly the Ganga is pure. Can younot see it?\" 8I replied on both occasions with a sideways nod: \"Yes, cer- tainly. I see.\" These statements reveal the range of models by which people under- stand the purity of the Ganga. Their use of different languages to describethese models is a common example of situational code switching amonglocal speakers of Banarsmbolm(Simon 1993 ). It is reminiscent of other societies, such as in Samoa, which use multiple speech registers to afrmor deny categories of cultural behavior (Shore 1996 ). Yet even in the same language, the nearly simultaneous use of apparently conflictingmodels is not unusual in Indian metaphysics, which O'Flaherty describesas a suspension of opposites ( 1976 ). At the same time, one should consider the different relationships that people have with the river and how these relationships might prompt theuse of one model over another. For example, the sherman above, usingthe same dialect and nearly identical sentence structure as the two youngmen, cited the same empirical evidence to support an opposite claim. Yethis adamant denial of pollution in the Ganga, on any level, was sharedby many who earned their living from the river, whether by shing,washing laundry, or watering their animals. If the Ganga could be dirty,even if only in a physical sense, then no one should put anything dirtyin it nor eat anything dirty from it. The sherman, like the washers andherders, would therefore have to choose between nancial ruin or karmicdisaster. In contrast, those who used the Ganga solely for ritual purposescould afford to be more philosophical about the coexistence of physicalpollution with spiritual purity. There may be nearly as many cultural models for the purity of Ganga Ma as there are people along her banks. Yet most of these models fallinto at least two generalized patterns, or schemata, of purication. TheseThe Cosmic Sink 41schemata inform not only ritual purication within sacred spaces but also the manner in which people clean themselves and their environ-ments on a daily basis. They include any means of dealing with physicalor metaphysical pollution within a particular zone of attribution, an area in which a coded substance may bring negative social consequences fora person or group of people. The rst category is a transportive schema of purication, entailing the transfer of pollution from one zone of attribution to another. Thisschema describes a process of externalization, of excretion from the insideout (gure 5). The transportive schema emphasizes the dynamic properties of water, an example of which is the common belief that a person can be properlycleansed only by running water (Babb 1975 ). Likewise, Banarsis often note that the relatively still waters of the city's sacred bathing tanks arereplenished, albeit inadequately in many cases, by underground springsoriginating from the Ganga. Krim Kund is one such tank, and ashramresidents afrm that it is constantly replenished by a spring that links itto the river. Even when people draw bath water from a relatively stag-nant source, such as a well or container, they make it dynamic througha pouring action (d.amlnam)from the top of the head to the bottom of the feet. Likewise, bathing in the Ganga involves a series of vertical bobs inwhich the bather submerges his or her entire head. These practices evokea top-down hierarchy from the auspicious to the inauspiciousness thatis embodied in gods and humans alike (Babb 1975 ). Signicantly, the Ganga herself has a vertical orientation, flowing from the realm of the gods far up in the Himalayas to the netherworld below(Eck 1983 ). One elderly woman stated that \"from where the Ganga orig- inated is pure in itself,\" noting that the river descended from a pure source.42 The Cosmic Sink Pollution Othe r External vector of purification Transportive agentZone of attribution Figure 5. woman's version of Ganga Ma's descent emphasized the height and purity of the river's source in the Himalayas (while typically conflat-ing the Ganga's heavenly origins with her earthly source). Therefore, \"allthe sins are washed away. Even the sins of gods are washed away.\" Where is this \"away,\" and what does the Ganga do with the sins once she receives them? Several people stated that the pollutants are washedinto the ocean, but the more popular destination was bamhar,meaning \"outside.\" Bamharillustrates transportive purication as a process of externalization: excretion from the inside out. Through externalization,pollution flows from one zone of attribution to another. Thus, trans-portive models by necessity emphasize trajectory over destination. Thedestination of ritual pollution is not important so long as its generaldirection is other, moving toward someone or somewhere else. Similar dynamics appear in the exchange of gifts for ritual services between people of different ritual status. For example, donations tohigh-status ritual specialists may carry with them the sins of their lesser-status patrons (Raheja 1988 ). Similarly, pilgrims drop rice and coins into the hands of beggars as a means of shedding some of their sins beforeentering temples or of getting a head start on their ablutions in the Ganga.The relative ranks of priests and beggars could not be more different, yettheir roles are essentially the same: the removal of karma in exchangefor material resources that function as a medium of transmission. As with human sins, so too with human waste. In Banaras, a child may urinate or defecate in the street or open sewer just outside (and fac-ing away from) the home. An adult male might urinate in the street orin an open sewer (facing away from everywhere else) that is not in frontof a home entrance or storefront. And anyone can relieve himself or her-self in an unoccupied lot, empty alleyway, or railroad embankment. 9The liminal areas where excretion is socially sanctioned in Banaras evenextend to the banks and ghats leading to the Ganga. Although defecat-ing directly into the Ganga is a sin, many defecate just beside the river. 10 They do so despite the obvious fact that, in a very short time, rains, ero-sion, and the workers who clean the ghats will inevitably sweep the wastea few feet down into water anyway. Here, the responsibility for pollu-tion does not rest upon the polluter, but rather its nal recipient. In spe-cial cases in which the act of polluting is considered a sin in itself, onlythe person who performs the deed directly acquires its karma. As such,the people who clean the mud from the ghats with high-pressure hosesat the end of monsoon season are the ones who acquire the karma ofdefecating in the river.The Cosmic Sink 43On a larger scale, transportive models play out in the waste-manage- ment practices of the city as a whole. Although Banaras's dense urban-ization and poor infrastructure have left few options for waste disposal,these constraints are not sufcient to explain the behaviors that takeplace before waste is flushed into an open sewer or swept into the streetfor professional sweepers, who pick it up by hand and cart it away toneighborhood holding areas. 11Until then, people treat waste like a hot potato. They handle it as little as possible and quickly pass it to the mostavailable person with the lowest status: a female or servant within ahousehold, a peon within an ofce, or, in many cases, a child laborerworking in a small shop or factory. 12Trash receptacles are rare, so waste material is either burned or left for someone (or no one) to sweep up.Trash is thrown over a wall or out of a window; dumped in a pile justoutside the home or workplace; or thrown on the street, into an emptylot, or into a space between two buildings. Trash is typically dumpedin the closest available outside space (that is, a liminal space apart from the polluter's network of social relations) beyond the handler's zone ofattribution. From the householder to the servant, the sweeper, and then the sewer, pollut ed substances travel down a gradient of inauspiciousness, with little or no change to the relative (in)auspiciousness of the sub-stances themselves. This conservation or immutability of attribution isanother fundamental characteristic of the transportive schema of puri-cation: the negative attribution is intrinsic to the pollution itself. If onecannot destroy or change pollution, then one must somehow transportit to another location. The transportive schema also informs the daily dumping of untreated sewage into the river. Because of the near absence of water treatment,disposing of waste in sewers is little different from disposing of it directlyin the Ganga herself. But conceptually, a distinction does exist, for thesewers are the elements that perform the nal deed. Even those ofcialswho may have pocketed money earmarked for water treatment can washtheir hands of whatever happens to the water after their negligence. Thesewers of Banaras are small rivers in themselves, carrying away the city'spollution from \"self\" to other. 13 The dynamics of transportive purication beg further questions about the Ganga's role in pollution and the attribution of blame. The sewers ofBanaras are not auspicious, even if they do act as little rivers. The sameis true of the professional sweepers who tend the sewers and clean thestreets. In both cases, the close association with pollution is very stigma-44 The Cosmic Sinktizing. Dirt and sin are inseparable entities that flow downhill. The far- ther down the transport chain that the pollution passes, the more tingedits handlers become, not because they passed it along, but because theyreceived it in the rst place. Likewise, the Ganga herself could not main-tain her purity simply by \"passing the buck,\" especially if she were thelast recipient of pollution and sin in all of Banaras. One explanation reinforces the idea that the Ganga is as immutably pure as sin and dirt are immutably polluted. Nuckolls ( 1996 ) describes a situation in which one of his American students presented a paper toa professor at Banaras Hindu University (BHU) on pollution in theGanga. The professor rejected the paper on the grounds that MotherGanga is ever pure and therefore can never become polluted. The studentsubsequently revised her argument to state that \"the Ganga is indeedmost pure . . . intoher under- standably accepted this revision. Transportive purication entails theconservation (i.e., the indestructibility) of pollution, such that the insultitself never becomes purified; it only transfers from one location toanother. This model also entails the possibility that an intrinsically puresolvent can never become contaminated but can merely be shifted aboutor displaced by the polluted solute. Within this model, the mixing of theimmutably inauspicious with the immutably auspicious literally resultsin a suspension of opposites, in line with O'Flaherty's characterization(1976 ). Pollution in the Ganga is like oil in water. Another explanation for the Ganga's persistent auspiciousness is a schema of purication in which pollution and purity are not immutablebut interchangeable states dependent on their contexts. This transfor-mative schema emphasizes the re-creative power, or shaktm,of certain substances as agents of change, which either transform negatively codedsubstances into those with neutral or positive attributes or eliminate thesubstances altogether. In contrast to the transportive schema, in whichthe vector of purication is externally oriented, from inside to outside,transformative purication involves the internalization of a change agent,from outside to within (gure 6). An interesting application of this schema is the recurring explanation that the Ganga is puried by the pious just as she is contaminated by theimmersion of sinners in her waters. A Brahmin pan.d.amsitting beneath an umbrella beside the river told me that \"this lth that is dumped [ d.amlnam] in Gangaji\u2014not just from today, from a long time\u2014just see: [when] somesadhus/mahatmas die then they are immersed in Gangaji. By that, Gangawater does not become polluted.\" An outspoken elderly woman sittingThe Cosmic Sink 45beside him\u2014the one who said that the Ganga washes away even the sins of the gods\u2014made the same case in the following tale: \"When Gangawas brought to Haridwar, then all the Gods 'We wash all sins,but who will wash us?' Ganga said this to Lord Vishnu: 'Lord VishnuBhagwan, tell us, what should we do?' Then the Lord said: 'As manysadhus and saints are living in this world, every time they will bathe in Ganga, all your sins will be washed [automatically].'\" The proportion of sadhus (renunciates) who bathe in the Ganga is much smaller than the rest of the population, and the sincerity of eventhis small fraction is often regarded with skepticism. As such, a few greatsouls must go a long way toward keeping the Ganga on the auspiciousside of the balance sheet. Such asymmetry is consistent with transfor-mative models of purication, even among the much greater set of expla-nations that view the Ganga as intrinsically pure. By and large, bothtransportive and transformative models laud the Ganga's unlimitedpowers of purication. However, they do so with inverted proportionsof the purier and puried. When the Ganga puries by transport, shefunctions as a vast solvent receiving a relatively small amount of pol-luted solute. When she puries by transformation, she is a minute solutetransmitted into a much larger quantity of polluted solvent.46 The Cosmic Sink Purified or neutralized substanceZone of attribution (Internalized) transformative agent Internal vector of purification Polluted substance Figure 6. The transformative schema of purication.A popular story in Banaras tells of a scientic study in which \"a single drop of water from the Ganga\" puries gallons of brackish water, leav-ing (usually Western) scientists scratching their heads in puzzlement. Somepeople state that anyone can perform these experiments. A third of myinformants in the ghats told me that one could place Ganga water andordinary water in containers and compare their qualities over time. \"Ithas been observed that if you store Ganga water [over some time] . . . a middle-aged renunciate. \"[But] ifyou store ordinary water in a bottle, then after a few days it will startgiving off a bad smell.\" There is a common saying that \"even a single adroplet of Ganges water carried one's way by the breeze will erase thesins of many lifetimes in an instant\" (Eck 1983 : 217). Given this per- spective, some resident bathers carry Ganga water back to their homesin brass pots to purify their family altars, not just by bathing the lingamsand idols but also by combining the water with food and other watersin the household. Likewise, nonresident pilgrims collect Ganga water insealed containers to take back to their friends and family in their homecommunities. According to the pan.d.amunder the umbrella, \"Place Ganga water in a bottle [and] suppose you go to the village or countryside. Ifyou do pumjam-path [ritual worship] [and] do not nd there, then you have already kept [Ganga water] in a bottle. So mix it [with plainwater] and then it becomes Ganga water.\" People can also purchaseGanga water in sealed pots and packages from local shops. Unlike the transportively informed, externally oriented models of excretion, in which polluted substances (often plural) are taken out andaway, transformative models usually involve the deep internalization of apurifying substance (often singular). Whereas transportive models oftenentail purication by excretion, transformative models typically entailacts of ingestion or digestion. For example, in the achmamnirite, the cel- ebrant sips a small portion of water to purify himself or herself beforeperforming a sacred rite, such as a pumjamor ritual bath. During the achmamni,the participant cradles water in the palm of the right hand in a particular posture (mudram)and sips the water just after pran.ava,voiced recitation of a simple mantra such as Aum Tat Sat. The mantra charges the water with sacred power before ingestion. Yet although the achmamni is common in Banaras, I have been told that the mantra is more for thebenet of the recipient than for the substance when the water is fromGanga Ma, because that water comes preloaded. People often link thispreloaded quality of the Ganga, the independent variable of her auspi-ciousness, to her intrinsic creative power, or shaktm. 14The Cosmic Sink 47Eck describes the creative power of the Ganga as \"liquid shaktm,\" evi- denced by the fertility of elds along her banks and her position as a sec-ond consort and active principle of Shiva. Citing the Ga mn.gamMamhamtmya of the Ka mshmKhan.d.a, she states that \"one should not be amazed at the notion that the Ganges is really power, for is she not the Supreme Shaktiof the Eternal Shiva, taken the form of water?\" ( 1983 : 219). The idea that shaktmis within the Ganga is consistent with all the models that I have heard of and observed, regardless of the degree of transportiveor transformative influences. Shaktmis present in the dynamism of the Ganga's currents as well as in the heat of her creativity. This power isclosely associated with her procreative status as the Holy Mother. It isalso linked to her maternal attitude of nondiscrimination toward whomand what she meets. An elderly woman sitting beside a Brahmin pan.d.am said it best: \"The mother keeps the baby in the stomach for nine monthsand then gives birth. She cleans his excreta and urine, and the child is[always] in this when he is small. Then that is [how] the mother takescare of the baby, doesn't she? So she is Ganga Ma. All this trash, goodthings, bad things, everything, is in her. So she will never be impure. Themother is never impure.\" In discussing the unlimited grace of the Ganga, Eck cites a common Indian saying that \"no child is too dirty to be embraced by its mother\"(1983 : 216). Indeed, Mother Ganga embraces everyone and everything that is put into her (or that she enters). The same is said of the Aghorguru. A prominent sign in the Kina Ram Ashram states that \"the guru isalways in the form of a complete mother. The physical mother raises thechild by nurturing the physical body. The guru, through his motherlylove and secret methods, nurtures the mind and soul.\" 15Ironically, this maternal message hangs above one of the giant skulls under a peepal treein the Kina Ram Ashram. Aghor may be nurturing, but one must over-come major aversions to partake of it, especially those aversions to mortality. MAHAMSHMASHA MN Banaras for the liberating function of allsacred spaces in Banaras. Just as the Ganga is a prototype for purica-tion by ablution in Krim Kund, so are these shmasha mnsprototypes for the flame that burns in Baba Kina Ram's akhand dhuni (perpetual re).48 The Cosmic SinkBut whereas the shmasha mnscarry the hope of liberation after death, this diminutive pyre holds the promise of jmvanmukti, spiritual liberation within one's own lifetime, and the promise of healing that this kind of liberation entails. The akhand dhuni burns within an enclosure on the eastern side of the courtyard flanking Krim Kund, just before the seat of the lineage. Every day, scores of Aghor devotees pay their respects and offer mantrasto this sacred re. Hundreds of nondevotees also visit in hopes of heal- ing or nding solutions to socioeconomic problems. All seek the graceof the sacred re through its darshan (auspicious sight) and the vibhuti (blessing) of its ash, which they use for a variety of ritual and healingpurposes. 16 In a general sense, the dhuni is not unique to the Aghori. Dhunis are common features among guru-based traditions, and traveling renunci- ates will often use them to establish their presence in a particular place, whether temporarily or permanently (Gross 1992 : 357-69 ). Indeed, one can see millions of these res burning though the night during the Kumbha Mela, a great religious festival held in one of four sacred citiesalong the Ganga every four years (Rai 1993 ).The Cosmic Sink 49 Figure 7. Kamleshwar Baba worshipping at the akhand dhuni, 2000 . Photograph by Victor Balaban.[To view this image, refer to the print version of this title.] The dhuni is a gathering point for disciples and pilgrims who seek the reunciate's blessings and advice. Visitors may use it for cooking, warmth,and illumination; but always with the understanding that the benets ofthe re are the prasamd(sacred remnants) of the guru and his or her pre- siding deity by way of the havan, or re ceremony. Derived from the Vedic yaj\u00f1a (re sacrice), the havan, or homa, is a ritualized sequence of offerings to the gods through the medium of Agni,the deity of re, via Svaha, his consort. Its Vedic predecessor, the yaj\u00f1a, was the prototypical rite of ancient Hinduism. The elaborate ritual pre-scriptions and proscriptions of the yaj\u00f1a were outlined in an oral tradi- tion of hymns that eventually formed the corpus of the Vedas. As thegreater mirror of humanity, the gods themselves perform the yaj\u00f1a in the Epic and Puranic literature (Vesci 1985 ). Indeed, the Vedic myth of human origins and even the origin of the sacricial act itself is describedin the self-sacrice of Purusha, the Cosmic Man (RV X: 90). In ancient times, the yaj\u00f1a was an extensive series of rites conducted by a team of ritual specialists over several days. The rites took place in atemporary temple that was destroyed upon their conclusion (Staal 1983 ). The yaj\u00f1a mandated that its celebrants be of the highest ritual purity, a requirement that has often been invoked to justify social segregation andpollution/purity taboos, particularly among the upper castes of ortho-dox Hindu communities (see Dumont 1966 ). Moreover, the consider- able human and material costs of this rite restricted its sponsorship tothe wealthy and powerful. In strictly Vedic terms, the yaj\u00f1a was supposed to be the primary means of communication between the human and the divine. Yet com-mon people did not have the knowledge and resources to conduct orsponsor a yaj\u00f1a themselves. They had to rely on the ritual patronage of the powerful within their own communities, who performed the rite ontheir behalf in exchange for essential but labor-intensive and sometimesritually polluting services. Following the rise of Hindu devotional movements, the havan arose as an inexpensive and simpler alternative to the yaj\u00f1a. Henceforth, people of all classes and backgrounds could perform the rite, with onlyminor preparations. Even when led by a guru or priest, the havan allowed as many people to make their own offerings as could t aroundthe fire. This approach was in the spirit of many tantric and Bhakt m devotional movements, which encouraged a direct relationship with thedivine without the need for hereditary ritual specialists (see Urban 2003 ; Lorenzen 1995 ).50 The Cosmic SinkInstead of having to master complex formulas, havan celebrants typ- ically offer a series of praises and mantras through the medium of grainor seed mixtures and a liberal amount of ghee. These offerings are trans-mitted to Agni, the re god, through Svaha, his consort. Agni may thenpass on these offerings to designated saints, ancestors, or other deities.The spirits who receive them imbibe the ethereal qualities of the offer-ings, leaving behind the material remnants for the benet of their humanhosts. Because the divine exist on a much higher plane, this \"backwashof the gods\" is prasamdfor humans, a blessed return for their sacrices. In this manner, the human and the divine exchange power through themedia of language, food, and re. As we will see, this schema of exchange,modeled in the prototype of the re sacrice, also informs exchangesbetween patients and healers in Aghor medicine. Like other dhunis, the akhand dhuni of Baba Kina Ram provides a medium for divine exchange and the occasional havan. Its special rela- tionship to the shmasha mn,however, adds signicance to these roles. Since its establishment three centuries ago, the akhand dhuni has been fueled by leftover wood from the cremation pyres of the nearby HarischandraGhat, purchased for a token sum according to an old agreement withhereditary funerary attendants of the Dom community. These days, trucksdeliver most of the wood, but Aghor devotees occasionally carry a fewlogs to the ashram as a ritual duty. The ash from this re is the mainprasamddistributed from this ashram, a substance that would ordinarily be considered untouchable because it carries the pollution of death. Yetin this case, both devotees and non-Aghor pilgrims consider it to be ablessing imbued with tremendous power for healing and salvation. During my time in Banaras, Aghor disciples often spoke of the dhuni and the shmasha mninterchangeably when discussing Baba Kina Ram's sacred re. This conflation was usually deliberate, just as it was for thekund and the Ganga. Prem, an unmarried resident of the Kina Ram Ashram in his early twenties, stated that, while meditating in front of thedhuni, he felt that his body was like a corpse with the real power burn- ing in front of it. \"It seems that everything that is here is a corpse. Mean-ing, just before you it is burning,\" he said. Prem believed that this powerderived not only from the confrontation with death but also from con-frontation with the entire cycle of human existence. \"There is also a formof shaktmover there. Everything is coming to an end there. It notes the whole time as well. Another time is coming to an end and increasing. So,in other words, it is a complete form of culture there. People come andgo\u2014one complete life cycle; it is a life cycle. People come . . [are] bornThe Cosmic Sink 51. . young and then dead, then again [they are] born. In this way [we] visit a complete life cycle there.\" The shmasha mnspeaks to the power of death as a universal human experience that equalizes social differences. Lakshmi, a young collegestudent and resident of the ashram, asserted that everyone burns thesame way in the shmasha mn.She stated that \"there is . . . no poor. There is equality. No difference there. In society we have difference between he[and me] . . . I am poor. He is medium class. We have a lot of categorieshere. But in that fact place, the reality place, we don't have any differ-ence. That is the point,\" she laughed. Prem spoke similarly of the powerof the dhuni/shmasha mn: What is the reason that [the wood for the dhuni ] comes from the shmasha mn? . . . Our relation is that we people connect our life with that place. So thatshmasha mnis also a very big part of our life. The meaning of shmasha mnis \"sam asan,\" \"equal position\" [ sic], where everything is given equal posi- tion. This is my thinking. The meaning of shmasha mnis that it is a place where everybody is given equal position. So that is a holy ground whereone . . . in a havan kund, we burn our whole body. So we call it the biggest pumjam.In the other havans, we offer everything. But in that havan kund, we dump our whole body. The funeral pyre is the prototype for Baba Kina Ram's dhuni. It marks the establishment of the Aghor lineage and marks Aghor itself as a spir-itual state of nondiscrimination that one achieves through confrontationwith mortality. In Hindu life-crisis rituals ( sam.skamras) the rite of crema- tion is often seen as the ultimate re sacrice. We can therefore under-stand why the ultimate sacrice in the cremation pyre extends into themore diminutive offerings of the akhand dhuni. The funerary rites, or antyesht .i sam.skamras,are the last in a sequence of life-crisis rituals that take place from conception to death in Hindureligious traditions. Although the Hindu sam.skamrasshare with each other elements derived from the Vedic re sacrice, particularly those of there itself (Pandey 1969 ), the rites of cremation are unique in that the re is more than a witness to the worldly development of the person. In cre-mation, the re is the active participant, the deceased is the sacricer,and his or her body is the chief offering to Agni. Many authors havedescribed this powerful cultural model of cremation as the ultimate sac-rice in which the body becomes the material element of sacricial foodto be consumed by re, whereas the ethereal soul is released as the vitalbreath, or prana, from the top of the skull (Filippi 1996 ; Parry 1994 ; Pandey 1969 ). Indeed, the meaning of the Sanskrit word antyesht .iis52 The Cosmic Sink\"final sacrifice.\" The ritual elements of the antyesht .i sam.skamrasare modeled upon the death of the extended family's patriarch and the suc-cession of his eldest son. When the patriarch dies, his adult male kinwrap the body in a shroud and carry it to the shmasha mnon a wooden litter, chanting \"Ram nam satya hain\" name is truth). Upon arriv-ing at the shmasha mn\u2014which is ideally next to a riverbank\u2014the relatives place the corpse feet rst in the river and give it a bath while placing cam-phor in the mouth. Family members negotiate for the wood and the serv-ices of the professional funeral attendants. They place the body upon thepyre and give offerings of wood, incense, ghee, and parched grains, muchas they would during a havan, except that the family members make the offerings before the ignition of the re. Once the offerings are made, anyaccompanying women and children return home while the adult malesretreat to the sidelines\u2014all, that is, except for the eldest son, who remainsbehind in his role as chief mourner and cremator. The eldest son usually has the task of cremating his father's body, and he assumes the role of family head at the conclusion of the rite. Simi-larly, when the guru of a religious lineage or school of traditional knowl-edge dies, his successor (again, usually a man) is often designated tocremate his teacher. 17If the head of a family or teaching lineage wants to change the line of succession, he designates someone else to crematehis body. In these prototypical instances, the cremation is as much a riteof succession as one of death, and it is fraught with social and spiritualhazards. Thus, the circumstances surrounding death and cremation mustbe as auspicious as possible. In preparation for the cremation, the eldest son has his head shaved (except for a small lock in back) and dresses in a white cotton shawl. Inthis manner, the son undergoes a kind of temporary ritual death notunlike that of the religious renunciate who marks his death to the worldby tonsure and the wearing of a funeral shroud. Parry discusses how theson undergoes a temporary symbolic death concurrent with his father's,entailing a process of regeneration within these funerary rites. In this patri-archal prototype, \"the father repays his debt to the ancestors by siring ason; the son repays his debt to his father by giving him birth on a new andhigher plane, and this newly created ancestor in turn confers fertility andmaterial prosperity on his descendants\" ( 1982 : 151). Death marks the turning of the wheel of sam.samra,of regeneration and rebirth. Once the family retreats to the sidelines, the son circumambulates the pyre while carrying embers in a sheaf of grass. When the grass is aflame,he ignites the pyre and stands by to attend the re for the duration ofThe Cosmic Sink 53the cremation. For this task, he usually receives more than a little assis- tance from the professional funeral attendant.18The cremation usually lasts between three and four hours. At a key moment in this process, theson breaks open his father's skull with a bamboo staff to release his pramn.a (vital energy) from the chakra (energy center) at the top of his head.Once the soul has separated from the body, the latter burns into a smallremnant about the size of two sts. The attendant picks up the remnantwith a pair of tongs and throws it into the river. The remaining ashes aregathered into a clay pot. The chief mourner holds this pot on one shoul-der, turns his back to the river, throws the ashes over his shoulder andinto the water, and then walks away without looking back. This act con-cludes the cremation rite. As with ablution in the Ganga, the nal sacrice of cremation is an opportunity for ritual purication for the living as well as the dead.However, purication by re has distinctive attributes, not the least ofwhich is that cremation confers a temporary but signicant degree of rit-ual pollution on its living participants. Mechanisms exist for removingthis pollution, which, like the Ganga, are informed by transportive andtransformative schema of purication. Two major aspects of the antyesht.i sam.skamraslend themselves to trans- portive purication. The rst is a cultural model of re as the reducer ofboth pure and impure substances to their primary constituents. The pro-totype for this kind of reduction is the immolation of the corpse. Despitehaving been ritually bathed and decorated, the corpse remains a highlypolluted vessel of the human soul and becomes a tting offering to thedivine only after its somatic attachments to worldly existence (and thesins therein) have burned away. Prem spoke earlier of offering one's wholebody as sacrice to the funeral pyre. He also extended the dhuni' s puri- cation function to the removal of sin. \"My concept about the dhuni is [that] . . . here, our bad deeds are destroyed. . . . It can even be seen in asmall form.\" Here, the dhuni is the \"small form\" of the shmasha mnthat removes (i.e., transports) the pollution of human sin in the way that cre-mation separates out the polluted remains of the human body. The antyesht.i sam.skamraalso provides opportunities for the transportive purication of the surviving family. Family members usually undergo aperiod of death pollution (often twelve days) in which they must abstainfrom many ordinary social functions. Parry ( 1994 ) describes this period as a ritually hazardous time for the family, one that determines whetherthe soul of the dead person departs the world as a friendly ancestor orremains a malevolent ghost to impede the fortunes of his/her descendants.54 The Cosmic SinkThis period can also be hazardous in a structural sense, in that the death of the family patriarch entails the succession and reorganization of roleswithin the lineage (cf. Douglas 1966 ). The structural hazards of this transition are evident in cultural models of auspicious and inauspiciousdeaths, with the ideal of the former being the natural demise of a long-lived, nancially successful, pious, and prolic patriarch (see Justice 1997 ). Such ideals are rarely achieved in reality, so families must nd other waysto make the transition of death as auspicious as possible. The rites of theantyesht .i sam.skamracan compensate for any shortcomings by ensuring that a bad death does not linger around the family. They do so by pro-viding for a temporary period of asceticism involving ritual ablutions,tonsure, and postmortem offerings to ensure proper transport of thedead away from the living (Parry 1994 ). The transformative schema of purication exists within the shaktmof the re itself. For some, this heat has the power to destroy negativelycoded substances, but only when the shaktmof the transformative agent exceeds that of the ritually polluting entity. The shmasha mnmust there- fore be associated with the most powerful manifestations of this contra-negative destruction: Shiva the Destroyer and erce goddesses such asKali and Tara. Signicantly, the power of these deities is internalized inthe res of digestive transformation. 19For example, Shiva, the lord of cosmic destruction, becomes the lord of worldly medicine by ingestingdeadly poison and transforming it into a life-sustaining substance withinhis esophagus (Eck 1983 ). This latter myth is important to Aghor medicine, and we will see in later chapters that those who take the most transformative approach tocremation as purication, the Aghori themselves, make a conceptual linkbetween res of the dhuni and shmasha mn,and the res of their own digestion. The use of cremation wood in Aghor dhunis is symbolic of this connection between death and digestion, with not only the Aghori butalso their patients ingesting the products of ritual sacrice\u2014offerings offood and even the ash from the wood (see Parry 1982 ). Along these lines, Prem spoke of imbibing ash as a blessing: \"It is like this. . . .We apply[the ash]; that is for the peace of our heart; for our own mental peace,and that which has burned itself. From that, I feel something differentin myself. For instance, we are very cruel. With that dhuni . . . because that is burning outside, that is a different process. One is burning inside.They [these two res] have the same relation.\" Such acts of ritual ingestion represent a kind of \"tantric homeopathy,\" purication and healing by confronting the source of the pollution. WhenThe Cosmic Sink 55the pollution involves death, this digestive transformation represents an intimate confrontation with mortality. We will further examine thesedynamics in the next chapter through a popular ritual-healing sequencethat contains key elements of the antyesht.i sam.skamra,and we will see how these models of purication inform the ways that patients and healersapproach Aghor medicine.56 The Cosmic Sink "}
