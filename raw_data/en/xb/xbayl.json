And in recent years, the centers' inclusion of dubious treatments has only grown, [according to a new article in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute Monographs](https://academic.oup.com/jncimono/article/2017/52/lgx004/4617819). While the data may alarm evidence-based physicians and health experts, [an accompanying article on the semantics of \"integrative medicine\"](https://academic.oup.com/jncimono/article/2017/52/lgx012/4617827) may be of more concern. In it, advocates of \"integrative medicine\" try to define what \"integrative medicine\" is, exactly. But rather than a clear definition, they create a vague and broad one that includes \"mind and body practices.\" It involves everything from the \"medicalized\" components of a healthy lifestyle (such as simple exercise) to what can charitably be described as magic. Such a large range of treatments\u2014some reasonable, some not\u2014may add legitimacy to the idea of integrative medicine while concealing quackery. As critic David Gorski, a blogger and oncology professor and surgeon at Wayne State University, [puts it](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-integration-of-mysticism-and-pseudoscience-with-oncology-continues-apace-in-nci-designated-comprehensive-cancer-centers/): Basically, if you've ever had a massage or done art or music while being treated for cancer, by definition you've used integrative medicine. If you've ever meditated or prayed while being treated for cancer, you've used integrative medicine. If you've done Tai Chi, yoga, or Qi Gong (or even just exercise) while being treated for cancer, you've used integrative medicine. But, as Dr. Gorski continues, advocates of integrative medicine aren't just into [harmless](https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/02/tragic-fda-reports-of-sick-babies-reveal-toll-of-homeopathic-products/) endeavors like art, meditation, and exercise. They're also into and, by extension, homeopaths. The SIO also advocates for the inclusion of \"alternative\" or \"complementary\" treatments in cancer care, alongside conventional methods. An easier pill to swallow Dr. Mao and his colleagues argue that as conventional treatments get better and better at keeping cancer patients alive, there's more need for \"natural\" approaches to improve quality of life\u2014particularly when dealing with the side effects of potent cancer drugs. This is an [\"unmet\" need](https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/07/defense-of-gwyneth-paltrows-goop-offers-case-study-on-how-to-sell-snake-oil/), they write. While neither of the articles co-authored by Mao even mention the terms \"naturopathy\" or \"homeopathy,\" the SIO considers naturopaths on equal footing with trained and licensed physicians. [Naturopaths can be members of SIO](https://integrativeonc.org/join-sio), and several past presidents of the organization have been licensed naturopaths. Naturopaths rely on a variety of \"alternative\" medicines and debunked pseudosciences while eschewing evidence-based medicine. Many naturopaths oppose vaccination, for instance. They also embrace homeopathy, which is based on the erroneous idea that \"like cures like.\" That is, [heavy dilutions](https://arstechnica.com/science/2007/09/the-pseudoscience-behind-homeopathy/) of a substance that creates symptoms similar to a particular disease can cure that disease. Most homeopathic remedies are simply water, which has led many to consider homeopaths charlatans over the years. Yet, a reader might not pick up on the connection between homeopathy and naturopathy from the SIO's description and discussion of \"integrative oncology.\" This, Dr. Gorski speculates, is on purpose. He writes: I really can't help but suspect that, in its effort to persuade medical academia that integrative oncology is rigorously science- and evidence-based, whether intentionally or not, the SIO leadership is focusing all its attention on promoting the evidence-based modalities that have been \"rebranded\" as \"integrative,\" such as diet, exercise, and the like, and the patient-support modalities that have been medicalized into \"integrative medicine,\" such as massage, art therapy, music therapy, and the like. Pay no attention to the quackery that integrative oncology and medicine lump together with the diet, exercise, and the like, the SIO seems to be saying by the absence of focus on naturopathy (and the homeopathy that nearly all naturopaths practice). Whether on purpose or not, the pitch for integrative medicine seems to be working. As Mao and colleagues report in their article of NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers, [more doctors seem to be including alternative therapies](https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/09/homeopathic-detox-med-school-quietly-flushes-quack-science-after-criticism/). Meanwhile, Mao and his colleagues have their sights set on expanding integrative medicine's use further. The authors conclude: As these centers lead the way in cancer research and clinical innovation, we need to ensure that integrative medicine can be cohesively incorporated into the continuum of cancer treatment and survivorship care using a financially sustainable structure. In addition, evidence-informed integrative medicine needs to expand beyond the walls of academic medical centers into community cancer centers and clinics to benefit patients from diverse "}
