Do you feel sad, unloved, disappointed, worthless. Hopeless, isolated or alone? If you suffer from depression, a common mental disorder, and have a lack of interest in life and activities that you previously enjoyed, then know you can beat your depression naturally, using homeopathy. Steps to naturally beat depression Exercise Regular exercise can be a great natural way to treat your depression. It can improve your mood, concentration, memory and help you manage strong emotions. Exercise can also help you sleep better. Try to exercise at lest 3 - 4 x a week and do what you enjoy walking, running, yoga, dancing, the gym or classes. If you have a tight schedule start with even 10 minutes, there are plenty of workouts on the internet that can guide you if you want inspiration. Sleep When you don't sleep well this can really affect your mood and concentration. Poor sleep can increase depressive symptoms and depression can lead to poor sleep. Quality sleep helps, so establish a habit of having an hour before bedtime to wind down, without screens. Have a bed time routine, wear lighter, soft clothes like pyjamas, dim the lights, curl up and read with a warm drink like chamomile tea. Outdoors Whether you choose to exercise outside or garden, spending time outside especially with purpose, like walking, planting, watering or digging can help alleviate depression, anxiety, stress and low mood. Mindfulness Mindfulness has its roots in meditation, which in itself can be hugely beneficial for anyone suffering from depression. Simply put, Mindfulness is deliberately focusing attention on the present moment. You can focus on your senses e.g. listening, smelling or you can practice breath work. A really easy mindfulness breath exercise is to focus on your breath and to slow it down, breath in for 4 seconds and then out for 4 seconds repeating this breath work a few times, it will help lower blood pressure and improve your mood. Meditation Particularly when practiced regularly Meditation can be a great way to help you deal with your depression. Meditation improves your mood, concentration, memory and your ability to regulate emotions. You may like to try a guided meditation on YouTube to help you develop your practice. Company The company of an animal or connecting with another person is a great way to reduce depression and gives you a sense of belonging. When you are kind and help others, whether it's volunteering or supporting friends or family, connecting with other people and helping gives a sense of reward and self-worth.

Research indicates that the Mediterranean diet can be particularly beneficial - - Vegetables, especially green leafy veggies - Fruit, especially berries - Nuts, especially almonds - Seeds, especially pumpkin - Oily fish - Eggs - Whole grains - Beans - Not a food but very important - plenty of water Cut out cigarettes - they make people feel restless and anxious.
