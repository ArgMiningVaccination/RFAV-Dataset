Plant Magic Author | Christine Buckley \"There is nothing I desire to understand more deeply than the plants that make it possible for me to breathe,\" writes author Christine Buckley in her book \"Plant Magic.\" An introduction to herbalism, the book first answers common questions about the field of study (\"Who can do herbalism?\" \"Can I still go to my doctor?\"), and then highlights 21 plants, like rosemary, nettle, and lemon balm. Buckley details how to respectfully interact with these plants in nature, how to dry and store them, and how to use them to make medicines at home. Whether brewed into a tea or crafted into a topical balm, you'll learn how these plants can be used to strengthen your immune system, calm stomach cramps, or tend to your sexual health. Review | \"Plant Magic is a crash course, a field guide, and a reference primer sure to delight those who are already curious about the healing properties of plants...Buckley lays the groundwork for an at-home herbalism practice, explaining what it is (a system of healing supported by plants and food), what it is not (a new thing invented by white people with blogs), and how it can coexist with Western medicine (drink your red clover tea and get a flu shot).\" \u2014Healthyish Price | $25, or find [secondhand](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7880526/type/dlg/https://www.betterworldbooks.com/product/detail/Plant-Magic--Herbalism-in-Real-Life-9781611806557) 5. Iw\u00edgara Author | Enrique Salm\u00f3n Author and ethnobotanist Enrique Salm\u00f3n belongs to the Rar\u00e1muri tribe who believe in iw\u00edgara, or that all life-forms are interconnected. In his book of the same name, Salm\u00f3n highlights 80 plants that are revered by North America's indigenous people\u2014from beans to black cohosh\u2014and how we can use them as food and medicine. Using botanical illustrations and photographs, and listed in easy-to-read alphabetical order, Salm\u00f3n breaks down each plant's family, season, region, uses, health benefits, and more. He also acknowledges that \"American Indian knowledge is often transmitted through story,\" so Salm\u00f3n also includes myths and narratives about each plant for readers to get better acquainted. Review | \"A beautifully illustrated and philosophically uplifting guide to indigenous North American plant use...this lovely compendium will strike a chord with many a nature-loving reader.\" \u2014Publishers Weekly Price | $35 6. A Handbook of Native American Herbs Author | Alma R. Hutchens The oldest and most timeless natural remedy book on our list, we adore Alma R. Hutchens' pocket-book, \"A Handbook of Native American Herbs: The Pocket Guide to 125 Medicinal Plants and Their Uses.\" Focusing solely on herbs found in North America, this book explores everything from folk medicine to common kitchen herbs. While not as modern as some of the other books on our list (it was published in 1992), Hutchens is an expert in her field, and her authoritative guide is a classic when it comes to natural remedy literature. A must-read to learn more about the herbs native to our country. Review | \"This is the ultimate reference to native American herbs. I've used this book for 15+ years and am buying another copy for a friend. Whether for personal or professional use, get this book!\" \u2014Kit Wynkoop, Amazon Review Price | $19, or find [secondhand](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7880526/type/dlg/https://www.betterworldbooks.com/product/detail/A-Handbook-of-Native-American-Herbs-9780877736998) 7.

More plainly put, she wants to show you how to heal your body with foods and ingredients you already have in your kitchen cupboard. Including both recipes and the history of herbs, this book is an essential read to begin your journey of making and using your own natural remedies. Review | \"I love the simplicity of introducing herbs through food and cooking. Food should always be our first medicine...I like that [the recipes] are all very doable: no specialized equipment, no huge orders of exotic herbs and spices and no tricky culinary skills required. The author has done a remarkable job of making herbal support both legitimate to the doubtful and accessible to the open-minded.\" \u2014Sue Kusch, Amazon Review Price | $25, or [find secondhand](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7880526/type/dlg/https://www.betterworldbooks.com/product/detail/Alchemy-of-Herbs--Transform-Everyday-Ingredients-into-Foods-and-Remedies-That-Heal-9781401950064) 8. Herbs Author | Jennie Harding A comprehensive and stunning guide that includes 130 of the most useful healing herbs, we love Jennie Harding's paperback book, \"Herbs: A Color Guide to Herbs and Herbal Healing\" for learning about herbs in their various and natural forms. Harding's book is useful for readers who are looking to explore herb cultivation, as well as readers who wish to learn about their properties, uses, availability, and safety. The charming illustrations and images are a delightful bonus. Review | \"This sits by my bed. Or it's tucked in my purse or backpack. Hell, this thing even finds its way into my beach bag. Basically, I love this little book...The pictures are very pretty and help in identifying the herbs. It has a great collection of herbs, including common and not-so-common ones.\" \u2014Clarissa, Goodreads Review Price | $15, or find [secondhand](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7880526/type/dlg/https://www.betterworldbooks.com/product/detail/Herbs--A-color-guide-to-herbs-and-herbal-healing-9780785835684) The Good Trade editors endorse products we genuinely love.
