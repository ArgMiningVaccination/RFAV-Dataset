This makes interpretation of results and comparison across trials challenging. Outcome measures i n pediatric anaphylaxis tri als have never previously been systematically assessed. This systematic review (SR) id entified and assessed outcome measures used in RCTs of anaphylaxis treatment in children. A s a secondary objective, this SR assesse d the evidence for current treatment modalities for anaphylaxis in the pediatric population. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and CINAHL from 2001 until December 2012. W e also searched websites listing ongoing trials. We included randomized and controlled trial s of anaphylaxis treatment in patients 0 -18 years of age. Two authors independently assessed articles for inclusion. Results: No published studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Conclusions: There is an alarming absence of RCTs evaluating th e treatments for anaphylaxis in children. High quality studies are needed and are po ssible to design, despite the severe and acute nature of this condition. Consensus about the selection and validation of appro priate outcome measures will enhance the quality of research and improve the care o fc h i l d r e nw i t ha n a p h y l a x i s . Trial registration: CRD42012002685 Background RCTs are the gold standard for clinical treatment effi- cacy, and allow for evidence-based practice. Many pediatric RCTs are published annually in high impact journals, however, outcome measures in these trialsmay not be valid or consistently reported [1-3]. If the outcome measures used in clinical trials are not valid, the results of the trials themselves are questionable.Indeed, much heterogeneity in outcome selection and reporting has been observed amongst clinical trials of specific diseases [4,5]. In an effort to address the issue of outcomes report- ing in pediatric trials, an interdisciplinary team of researchers at the University of Alberta developed thePORTal (Primary Outcomes Reporting in Trials) initia- tive. In collaboration with COMET and StaRChildHealth, PORTal plans to develop a database of vali- dated pediatric outcome measures that can be accessedby child health researchers. Outcomes that should be measured and reported in all clinical trials of a specific condition, regardless of statistical significance, wouldalso help reduce the problem of outcome reporting bias [6]. Uniform selection of outcomes would make interpretation of results and comparison across trialssimpler, making meta-analyses more feasible [4]. According to a 2011 systematic review by Sinha et al., very few studies have addressed the appropriate selectionof outcomes for clinical research involving children [7]. This review also identified 13 conditions for which some work has already been done to determine which out-comes should be measured in pediatric clinical trials. Since anaphylaxis was not amongst those conditions, an assessment of the heterogeneity and quality of reportingof outcome measures was considered useful. Anaphylaxis is a serious and potentially fatal allergic reaction with a rapid onset [8].

BMC Pediatrics 2014, 14:158 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2431/14/158 brought to you by CORE View metadata, citation and similar papers at core.ac.uk provided by Springer - Publisher Connectorpublished a set of three crit eria defining anaphylaxis [8]. The three criteria are: 1. Acute onset of illness with involvement of skin, mucosal tissue, or both, AND atleast one other system involved (respiratory compromise, OR cardiovascular compromise/associated end-organ d y s f u n c t i o n ) ;2 .T w oo rm o r eo f :s k i n - m u c o s a l ,r e s p i r a -tory, reduced BP/associated end-organ dysfunction, gastrointestinal symptoms, occurring rapidly after ex- posure to a likely allergen for that patient; 3. Reducedblood pressure minutes to hours after exposure to a known allergen for that patient. According to their consensus, anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one ofthese three criteria is fulfilled. Anaphylaxis can be triggered by food, insect venom, medication, latex, exercise, or unknown causes [9-16].Regardless of the inciting cause, the final common path- way is release of histamine and other mediators from mast cells and basophils. Anaphylaxis may be fatal withinminutes, usually through cardiovascular or respiratory compromise, or both [17-23]. Biphasic reactions, de- fined as a recurrence of anaphylactic symptoms afterinitial resolution, can occur 1 h to 72 h after the initial onset of symptoms [24]. In addition to epinephrine, H1 -receptor antagonists and H2-receptor (i.e. a as cetiri- zine and ranitidine, respectively), and corticosteroids are often used in acute therapy and after discharge. Mostexperts recommend these additional therapies despite limited data to support their use since these drugs are thought to be unlikely to cause harm and theoretically havesome added benefit in the resolution of symptoms [23]. The most recent systematic reviews of anaphylaxis treatment, published in the Cochrane database, indicatean alarming paucity of high quality evidence supporting currently accepted treatments, including epinephrine, glucocorticoids, antihistamines and supportive care (e.g.oxygen, fluid resuscitation, raising legs above the head, inhaled bronchodilators) [25-27]. The present systematic review was planned to iden- tify and assess the outcome measures used in RCTs of anaphylaxis treatment in children. As a secondary objective, this systematic review would assess the evi- dence for current treatment modalities for pediatric anaphylaxis. Methods Data sources The search strategy was developed in conjunction witha clinical librarian. The following electronic biblio- graphic databases were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Cochrane Central Registerof Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and CINAHL. The search strategy included all terms relating to the condition (anaphylaxis). The terms were combined withthe Cochrane MEDLINE filter for controlled trials of interventions, and pediatrics (ch ildren/infants/adolescents). The search strategy for MEDLINE is available in theAppendix. The search terms were adapted for use with other bibliographic databases in combination with database-specific filters, where these were available.The search was limited to English-language studies, and studies published between January 2001 and December 31, 2012, in order to assess for improved quality ofoutcome reporting in studies published post-CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guide- lines [28]. The following websites were searched for ongoing/regis- on the topic: https://portal.nihr.ac.uk/ Pages/NRRArchive.aspx; http://clinicaltrials.gov/; www.controlled-trials.com; http://www.anzctr.org.au/. Study selection Two reviewers (TR, JC) independently screened titlesand abstracts of identified references. Both reviewersalso independently searched the websites for ongoing trials. Studies were included if they were a. RCTs; b. involved pediatric patients (0-18 years of age inclusive);c. investigated anaphylactic reactions from any triggering cause (including food, insect venom, medication, bio- logic, diagnostic agent, vaccinations, latex, exercise, oridiopathic cause) and; d. compared any acute treatment of anaphylaxis (pharmacologic, supportive measures) with any control treatment (including, but not limited toplacebo). Any modality studied for the acute treatment of anaphylaxis was considered, including: epinephrine of any dose, timing and mode of administration; glucocorti-coids of any dose, timing and mode of administration; beta-2 agonists; and sup-portive care by skilled professionals in a healthcare set- ting. Studies focusing on the prevention of anaphylaxis (e.g. by immunotherapy) were excluded. Any and all out-come measures used in current research of pediatric anaphylaxis were included. Results In total, our combined searches yielded 1996 citations (see Figure 1). After screening, no studies were identifiedthat met all inclusion criteria. The vast majority of refer- ences were not articles primarily relating to anaphylaxis, or anaphylaxis treatment. References relating to specif-ically to anaphylaxis treatment were reviews, system- atic reviews, case reports, case series, and other types of observational (usually retrospective) studies. Therewere a number of controlled trials relating to anaphyl- axis prevention, but none about treatment of pediatric anaphylaxis.Rubin et al. BMC Pediatrics 2014, 14:158 Page 2 of 8 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2431/14/158The search of the UK National Research Register, Current Controlled Trials, and Clinical Trials using anaphylaxis as a keyword identified no useful proposed, ongoing, or completed studies. One study registered in the Australia/New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry in March 2011 met inclusion criteria. This was an RCT of intravenous versus intra-muscular (control) epinephrine treatment of acute anaphylaxis in an emergency department in patients 15 years of age and older. The status of the trial in thedatabase indicated that the investigators were not yet recruiting as of April 2011. Attempts to contact the primary investigator via em ail were unsuccessful [29]. One additional study identified through the search was an RCT comparing the sedative properties of cetirizine versus diphenhydramine in the treatment of acute food- induced allergic reactions in children [30]. The full text of this article was extracted and reviewed and, ultim-ately, excluded because the condition being studied was not anaphylaxis, but rather all allergic reactions. Discussion This review failed to uncover any completed randomizedor controlled trials of pediatric anaphylaxis treatments despite a broad search strategy. Therefore, the primaryobjective could not be determined. In the one planned RCT of IV versus IM epinephrine, the two main out- comes proposed were resolution of the main clinicalfeatures of anaphylaxis (defined according to consensus definition), [29], or improvement on an ordinal sever- ity scale at 15 minutes. The planned secondary outcome was adverse effects at 15 and 60 minutes. The definition ofanaphylaxis and its resolution were current, and the out- come measures proposed are appropriate. Clinical implications Epinephrine remains the treatment of choice for ana- phylaxis although there are no RCTs supporting its use.Epinephrine has been relatively well investigated in both children and adults in observational studies [31], RCTs involving non-anaphylactic patients [32-35], epi-demiologic studies [9,36,37], fatality studies [18,19,38], and in vitro and animal studies [22,39]. Many of these studies have identified that delays in instituting treat-ment with epinephrine are associated with risks of mortality [40-42]. On the basis of this evidence, an expert panel pub- lished the 2011 National Institute of Allergy and Infec- tious Diseases (NIAID) guidelines for acute treatment of anaphylaxis. They recommended immediate use ofintramuscular epinephrine, concluding that the benefits far outweigh the risks [43]. They concluded that the quality of evidence is moderate, although the contribu-tion of expert opinion is still significant. NIAID dosing recommendations for Epinephrine 1:1000 solution for children and adults is based o n pharmacologic studies. Figure 1 Search flow diagram.Rubin et al. BMC Pediatrics 2014, 14:158 Page 3 of 8 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2431/14/158They recommend 0.15 mg for children weighing 10-25 kg, a n d0 . 3m gf o rc h i l d r e no v e r2 5k g .T h e ya l s os u g g e s t repeat dosing every 5-15 minutes as needed. While second line medications such as corticoste- roids and antihistamines are still recommended as adjunctive treatments, the expert panel did note thelack of evidence for these modalities. Possible reasons for continuing poorly investigated interventions in pediatrics include: \"biological plausibility \"of the inter- vention, extrapolation o fd t af r o ma d u l ts t u d i e s , acceptance of lower quality research, lack of known significant harm of the intervention, and a need to do\"something \"rather than nothing in acute situations. Perceived concerns about medico-legal liability may also contribute to provision of treatments with noknown benefits and lack of perceived harm. In their report, NIAID identified several knowledge gaps, in- cluding the role of adjuncti ve treatments for anaphyl- axis (steroids, antihistamines and others), appropriate treatment of biphasic or protracted reactions, and the benefits and risks of alternative routes of epinephrinedosing (e.g. sublingual). Studies have found that, despite epinephrine being the only anaphylaxis treatment with demonstrated efficacyin preventing mortality, it is not used consistently, and second-line or adjunctive medications are more often administered, sometimes before epinephrine. For ex-ample, a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients seen in a pediatric emergency department over a 5-year period with a final diagnosis of anaphylaxis showed arate of epinephrine administration of only 54%. This was less than the rate of corticosteroids (78%) and H1 and/or H2 receptor antagonists (92%) [44]. The administration of adjunctive medications can potentially delay the use of other, perhaps more effect- ive treatment modalities and therefore might contrib-ute to morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, both antihistamines and steroids have adverse effects and costs, and may theoretically mask important markersof ongoing anaphylaxis risk. Recurrent dosing of both epinephrine and steroids in the emergency department also carries risks of systemic side effects. These factors need to be weighed against the potential benefit of these treatments. Limitations A limitation of the current systematic review is that itwas limited to studies done in the last twelve years.This time frame was considered acceptable as there are recent systematic reviews investigating anaphylaxis treatments that found no RCTs in databases extendingup to thirty years into the past. Further limitations include the exclusion of non-English and non-registered trials.Research implications There are a number of possibilities to explain the currentgap in research. Firstly, there are clearly ethical issuesinvolved in obtaining informed consent (or deferring consent) in emergency situations. Secondly, current anaphylaxis treatments are us ually life saving, generally safe, and well established, contributing to the perceived lack of relevance of specific questions regarding phar- macotherapy. Thirdly, due to the clinical nature ofanaphylaxis diagnosis, lack of accepted standards for determining degree of severity [45,46] and lack of object- ive point of care testing, study design can be challenging.Fourthly, a large number of patients is required for an adequately powered study assessing an uncommon condition such as pediatric anaphylaxis, and wouldrequire considerable resources over a long period of time. Additionally, prospectively collected data is essential and more valid in establishing accurate rates of adverse effectsof pharmacotherapy and other interventions, but is also costly. Finally, pediatric research is associated with additional challenges, including a vulnerable and smallerpopulation, the challenge of obtaining informed consent/ assent from children, and the need to address family- centered outcomes in both treatment and investigation. Institutional review boards serve to protect the pub- lic from the harms of unethical research, but must balance this responsibility against the imperative ofadvancing medical care through high quality investiga- tion. Emergency situations, when consent cannot be obtained readily without compromising patient care,pose a particular challenge for researchers. Neverthe- less, resuscitation research, which by its nature must be studied in emergency situations, is absolutely neces-sary, and ultimately benefits patient care. Multiple organizations around the world have recog- nized the importance of resuscitation research, and thechallenges of obtaining individual informed consent in this context. Therefore, guidelines for ethical research involving institutional (or deferred) consent have beendeveloped. For example, a research ethics board may allow research that involves medical emergencies to be carried out without the consent of participants, or of their authorized third party, if a number of conditions are met [47-49]. For example, a waiver of consent maybe obtained if: a. the research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects; b. the waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of thesubjects; c. the research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver; d. whenever appropriate, the subjects are provided with additional pertinent informa-tion after participation [49]. Although rare, placebo-controlled trials done in emer- gency situations exist [50,51]. It is certainly possible todesign trials studying anaphylaxis in children that meetRubin et al. BMC Pediatrics 2014, 14:158 Page 4 of 8 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2431/14/158our criteria. For example, while withholding a known lifesaving treatment, such as epinephrine, would clearly be unethical, conducting a trial to determine the optimaldosing interval or route of administration, would be un- likely to involve greater risk to the patient if the control is the standard of care (intramuscular epinephrine). Inthis situation, the research also offers a possibility of direct benefit to the participant. A placebo-controlled trial of antihistamines, on the other hand, could be bothethical and feasible. There are numerous potential outcome measures that should be used and reported in all future research ofanaphylaxis treatment in children. Selecting valid and clinically relevant outcomes is of paramount importance. Potential outcome measures include: mortality rate; inci-dence of biphasic reaction and prolonged anaphylaxis; rates of interventions other than study drug (e.g. beta agonists, steroids, antihistamines, non-epinephrine vaso-active drugs); hospitalization rate; length of emergency department visit; length of hospital stay; rate of re- presentation to hospital; pediatric specific measures(e.g. pediatric health/mental health scales); and inci- dence of any adverse events reported for any treatment delivered. The design and validation of a universal ana-phylaxis severity rating scale could be of potential benefit, and may offer a useful outcome measure. Future research in anaphylaxis should also collect infor- mation regarding discharge practices for cases of anaphyl- axis, including prescriptions for injectable epinephrine devices, advice for optimization of asthma if relevant,referral to allergists, and anaphylaxis education. Conclusions There is an alarming absence of RCTs evaluating the treatments for anaphylaxis in children. High quality studies are needed and are possible to design despite thesevere and acute nature of this condition. Future trials should ensure appropriate comparator therapy that sat- isfies the ethical constraints inherent in resuscitationresearch and studies involving children, and the selec- tion of appropriate outcome measures. Research designs other than RCTs are still useful and can enhance the evidence for anaphylaxis treatment. Practice surveys in different settings, observational stud- ies, and qualitative patient/family-centered studies arefeasible and easy to design. Based on the results of this systematic review, it is impossible to make conclusive recommendations regarding optimal dosing, timing, ormode of administration of epinephrine for anaphylaxis. Furthermore, there is no evidence from RCTs supporting or refuting the use of common adjunctive treatments,such as corticosteroids and antihistamines, in the acute treatment of anaphylaxis, in preventing biphasic reac- tions, or after discharge from the ER. Until high-qualitystudies are designed and executed, current practices and guidelines on the management of anaphylaxis will con- tinue to be based on lower quality evidence and on theconsensus opinions of experts. The careful selection and validation of outcome mea- sures for future studies on pediatric anaphylaxis will sup-port meaningful research and better treatment of children with this condition. Consistent universal reporting of these outcomes will protect against outcome reporting bias. Appendix Cochrane SR 1. anaphylaxis.mp.
