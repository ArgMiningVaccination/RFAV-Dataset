Since dendritic cells (DCs) were discovered and demonstrated to be the key inducers and regulators of immune responses, DCs became attractive tools for vaccine and immunotherapy [ [3](#B3), [4](#B4), [5](#B5)]. Use of DCs for vaccination gave rise to the possibility of inducing strong T cell immunity to fight against cancer and infection, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and thus overcoming the limitation of conventional vaccines which rely largely on the induction of protective antibody responses [ [6](#B6)]. [2](#B2), [5](#B5), [6](#B6), [7](#B7)]. Especially, the late Ralph Steinman and his colleagues have pioneered the method of targeting antigen proteins to the endocytic receptors on DCs in vivo and thus efficiently exploiting the function of DCs as immunologically versatile regulators [ [2](#B2)]. [7](#B7)]. In homeostatic settings, immature DCs can actively induce T cell tolerance through induction of selection, anergy, or deletion of T cells including regulatory T (Treg) cells during development in thymus and periphery. Upon activation via signals from various receptors for antigens, cytokines, pathogen-associated molecular patterns, or damage-associated molecular patterns, DCs become mature by changing into an immunogenic phenotype and capable of inducing the activation of T cells [ [1](#B1), [2](#B2), [3](#B3)]. Vaccination with Ex Vivo-Generated DCs [8](#B8)]. Clinical trials of various DC vaccines generated ex vivo and pulsed with cancer cells or antigens have proved safe and immunogenic against the cancers but only resulted in limited success [ [9](#B9)]. There exist significant problems in current vaccines utilizing ex vivo-derived DCs, such as the practical difficulties of logistics and organization and the optimization of methods to overcome the limited efficacy likely due to their inefficiency in migration and antigen presentation following reinfusion to the body. C-type Lectin Receptors on DCs Targeting vaccine proteins to CD205 on DCs in vivo [10](#B10)], and the cDNA encoding the protein reactive to NLDC145 was cloned and named DEC205 [ [11](#B11)]. Studies revealed that, when bound with surrogate ligands, CD205 could function as an efficient endocytic receptor that delivered the ligands to antigen processing pathways for the presentation on both class I and II MHC molecules [ [11](#B11), [12](#B12), [13](#B13)]. Recently, a class of oligonucleotides with nonmethylated cytosine-guanosine (CpG) motifs were identified as ligands of CD205 [ [14](#B14)], which implies that CD205 might be an endocytic receptor for both antigen and maturation stimulus in DCs. [15](#B15), [16](#B16)], resulting in tolerance of antigen-specific T cells. This proves that DCs in vivo actively establish T cell tolerance by presenting antigens from self and environment during the steady state. In contrast, antigen-conjugated anti-CD205 mAb co-injected with anti-CD40 antibody induced strong and lasting T cell immunity against the antigen [ [13](#B13), [15](#B15), [17](#B17)]. Therefore, CD205 could also become a target on DCs in vivo exploited for antibody-based vaccine delivery. [17](#B17)]. agonist, anti-CD205 mAb-conjugated antigens could generate antigen-specific T cell responses with much higher efficiency, i.e., at least 100 to 1,000 fold more than unconjugated and control mAb-conjugated antigens [ [6](#B6), [17](#B17)]. Likewise, animals with demonstrated that vaccines targeted to DCs in vivo produced the strong and long-lived memory responses of antigen-specific T cells [ [17](#B17), [18](#B18)]. In addition to the improved intensity and durable memory, targeting antigen to CD205 on DCs was able to generate the response of diverse T cell repertoires against various peptides from the antigen, efficiently presented by the MHC molecules of different haplotypes and individuals [ [18](#B18), [19](#B19)]. [18](#B18), [20](#B20)]. In those mice, the protective immunity generated by DC-targeted vaccine antigen was attributed to the efficient induction of antigen-specific helper T cells, accompanied by strong humoral immunity, i.e., high antibody titers against the antigen. Although the conventional, non-targeted vaccines immunized with alum adjuvant also induced high titers of antibodies and exhibited effective protection, only the DC-targeted vaccines were able to generate strong and durable T cell responses, implying that DC-targeted vaccines might be superior in the long run. Development of Clinical Vaccine Targeted to Human CD205 [6](#B6)]. The p41 fragment of Gag p55 was engineered to fuse with the C-terminus of heavy chain in anti-CD205 or control mAbs. The recombinant proteins of unconjugated and mAb-conjugated p41 were expressed in mammalian cell-lines such as HEK293T or CHO cells, secreted into culture media, and purified. Because the purified Gag p41 protein appeared to form aggregation, the p24 fragment of Gag p41 was also generated, expressed, purified, and then compared with p41. As shown in [Fig. 1](#F1), the majority of p41 protein, even in cell culture media prior to purification, was aggregated and in complex with other molecules. However, the p24 protein was in a monomeric, soluble form when expressed from mammalian cells ( [Fig. 1](#F1)). Therefore, to optimize the delivery of antigen to DCs and to rule out the artifact from aggregation, p24 was chosen as the Gag antigen for HIV vaccine. [21](#B21), [22](#B22)]. In humans, the treatment of poly ICLC induced the various pathways of innate immune responses broadly and efficiently, i.e., quite similarly to the highly effective yellow fever vaccine [ [23](#B23)]. Therefore, poly ICLC was chosen for the adjuvant in clinical studies of the first vaccine targeted to DCs in vivo [ [6](#B6)]. [24](#B24), [25](#B25)]. Therefore, a new effort was pursued to generate a large number of mAbs against the diverse epitopes in human CD205, for the selection of an anti-human CD205 mAb used in clinical studies. To this end, the extracellar domain of full-length CD205 protein was produced and used to immunize two different kinds of mice: mice carrying not mouse but human immunoglobulin genes [ [26](#B26)] and mice deficient of CD205 gene, i.e., CD205 knockout mice [ [27](#B27)]. Especially, from a single hybridoma fusion, the latter produced a large number, i.e., over 400 of anti-human CD205 mAbs, many of which were verified to bind not only human CD205 but also CD205 of mouse and other mammals [ [27](#B27)]. This cross-species reactivity of anti-human CD205 mAbs has advantage that those mAbs can deliver the vaccines to DCs in humans as well as in mice and other animals. This will solve a need to generate animal models that express human CD205 in their DCs. However, fully human anti-human CD205 mAbs can be produced from the former mice [ [26](#B26)], not requiring the further process to humanize mouse anti-human CD205 mAbs generated in the case of the latter mice. [26](#B26)]. For this job, a transgenic (Tg) mouse was generated to carry a full-length human CD205 cDNA under CD11c promoter, thus expressing the on mouse DCs. Then, anti-human CD205 mAb named 3G9 was determined most efficient to induce immune responses in the human CD205 Tg mice as well as in human peripheral blood cell cultures [ [26](#B26)]. Therefore, mAb 3G9 was chosen to conjugate HIV Gag p24 and put forward to the first clinical trial of DC-targeting vaccines [ [6](#B6)]. Targeting Vaccine Proteins to Other CLRs on DCs In Vivo [28](#B28)]. The difference of ability between those subsets of DCs was attributed to the differential expression of genes involved in the different pathways of antigen processing and presentation. When the protective immunity to an infection relied heavily on antibody response, the vaccine protein targeted to DCIR2, compared to CD205, on DCs in vivo induced higher antibody titers and thus achieved better protection [ [20](#B20)]. [29](#B29)]. Upon administration of Gram-negative bacteria or TLR4 agonist like LPS, monocytes were mobilized to the T cell area of lymph nodes and fully differentiated to functional DCs expressing CD209a. Due to the newly generated mAbs with high affinities to CD209a [ [30](#B30)], monocyte-derived inflammatory DCs could be TLR4 agonist, targeting CD209a-positive DCs antigen-specific T cell responses than targeting CD205-positive DCs, which implies that monocyte-derived inflammatory DCs might be better targets of vaccine delivery for the induction of protective immunity against microbial pathogens. Future of Targeting Vaccines to DCs In Vivo [31](#B31)], yet to be found and targeted with vaccines in the future. Following characterization of the differences in the function of each vaccine targeted to a different subset of DCs in vivo, the differentially targeted vaccines could be combined to boost their activities or to generate a novel effect. In addition, the DC-targeted vaccine with combination of another vaccine in different platforms may intensify the immunogenicity of both vaccines, as shown in the combination of DC-targeting and attenuated "}
