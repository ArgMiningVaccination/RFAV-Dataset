Integrative, complementary or alternative medicine (ICAM) are therapies outside of standard medical care. Integrative medicine is a coordinated approach using both conventional and complementary medicine for treatment. This is done through the same treatment center or system. To be considered integrative medicine, the approach must have shown significant effectiveness and safety when combined with conventional medicine. An example is a patient who gets acupuncture to lessen nausea and pain from chemotherapy. Complementary medicine is used with conventional medicine. An example is a patient who gets massage from a professional familiar working with cancer patients. Alternative medicine is used in place of conventional medicine. An example is a patient who uses a certain diet to try to treat the cancer instead of having surgery, chemotherapy or radiation. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate ICAM therapies. Though not a proven treatment, evidence suggests that some of these approaches may help [control symptoms and side effects](/facing-pancreatic-cancer/living-with-pancreatic-cancer/managing-side-effects-palliative-care/). Approaches doctors often use with conventional medicine for pancreatic cancer patients include: - Acupuncture has been shown in some studies to relieve chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. - Exercise has been shown to have several beneficial effects for cancer survivors, including maintaining quality of life and weight. Some ICAM therapies, such as meditation and yoga, can also be helpful for caregivers. Types of ICAM Therapies - Dietary supplements - Special teas - Vitamins - Massage therapy - Acupuncture - Spiritual healing - Meditation - Chiropractic - Yoga - Medical cannabis Though some of these therapies are widely available, it is important for patients to look for providers who have experience working with people with cancer.

How Do I Get ICAM? Many institutions offer integrative and complementary medicine resources. Ask your [healthcare team](/facing-pancreatic-cancer/diagnosis/choosing-your-healthcare-team/members-of-the-healthcare-team/) if your treating center has these resources or can help you find them. There may also be clinical trials studying integrative or complementary medicine. How Much Does ICAM Cost? As with any treatment, costs may be different from person to person. Check with the service provider and your insurance company to understand costs. ICAM therapies at a patient's treating institution are often free or covered by insurance.
