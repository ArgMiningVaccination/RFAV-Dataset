She is a profound listener, which is evident in her individualized and acutely specific approach to treatment. Since coming to Dina for treatment a few years ago, the overall quality of my immune system and response to stress has improved 100 times over. Dina not only provides stellar treatment during my sessions, but sends me on my way with strategies I can employ each day that promote wellness and health in all aspects. I highly recommend her to anyone, whether they are interested in beginning an acupuncture treatment or have been using it for years - she is a fit for everyone. - 2/11/2018First to Review Dina is amazing! I have been a patient of hers for many years and have referred many people to her. She is caring and talented and invested in the well being of every person who enters her treatment room. Regular acupuncture sessions with Dina have been a part of my self care routine and I am very thankful. You Might Also Consider [read "}
