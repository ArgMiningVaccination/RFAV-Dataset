Percepta Professional is a unique proprietary formulation of polyphenol-containing PTI-00703\u00ae cat's claw (Uncaria tomentosa), a specific oolong tea extract (MemorTea) and a specific European black currant. These natural ingredients underwent rigorous scientific testing as part of the development of Percepta Professional, the world's first nootropic targeting the real reason we lose memory as we age and available only through physicians and health care practitioners. \"The concept of plant-based memory support may be difficult for many people to understand,\" stated Dr. Alan Snow, Cognitive Clarity founder and CEO. \"As a nation, we are accustomed to looking to pharmaceutical companies to solve our health concerns and in doing so we have lost sight of the many intricate and effective solutions offered to us by nature itself.\" Dr. Snow continued, \"Decades of scientific research has enabled us to unlock the biological reasons why we lose memory as we age. At Cognitive Clarity Inc., we are working very hard to bring this critical information to the public as we are committed to brain health and to providing natural memory support options to individuals of all ages.\" Percepta Professional will be available at the company's booth #135 in the Exhibit Hall during the A4M Spring Congress and Dr. Snow, also a world-renowned Alzheimer's disease researcher and expert in the aging brain and memory loss, will be at the booth to answer product and science questions.
