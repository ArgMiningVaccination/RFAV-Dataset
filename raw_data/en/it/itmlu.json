When they came for ministry, we witnessed a gentle touch of the Holy Spirit's healing power for these children. The first mama held onto her little girl, and this one responded in typical manner as one would expect, crying and refusal to look my way. I placed my hand upon her back as she hung on tightly with her arms wrapped around her mother's neck. I renounced this autistic spirit that was torturing her. I no sooner spoke these words aloud than she stopped the intense crying, looked me in the eye, reached out to me and climbed into my arms, hung on tightly with her head on my shoulders. It was clearly not a normal behavior for her. For those not accustomed to working with a person suffering from autism, one classic symptom of autism is they cannot look someone in the eye; they turn from visual contact. So this was a giant step for this little girl to instantly look me in the eye, not once, but continual looking me in the eye. And the second major step in the right direction was her reaching out to me, climbing into my arms, laying her head down and holding on tightly to me. Those who are familiar with autism know that these are two amazing steps towards this little girl's complete freedom from this demonic attack against her life. To help you understand, let me explain to you what takes place in this type of deliverance. I am accustomed to anyone plagued with a demon spirit (and yes, autism is both spiritual and physical), how the demon within them can't handle the presence of the Holy Spirit and will cause the person suffering to scream, convulse and fight being in this place. The tactics of the spirit of fear are to frighten and cause the parents or others in authority over the child, regardless of age, to back off from the process and to enter into doubt and unbelief. But if you, their caregiver and protector will not falter in your spiritual authority during this process, their deliverance and healing will manifest. And how the Spirit of God taught me years ago with our own son's deliverance and healing was to first take my authority over a severe autistic spirit that plagued him. I did as He said, and right then and there, the demonic fit stopped and never returned. After a few minutes of holding this little girl and releasing the love of the Holy Spirit over her by holding onto her tightly and praying in the Spirit over her, I handed her to someone else to continue on. The second mom stood in front of me with her little son who suffered from autism and many other issues, one being unable to walk without help. He basically did not leave his stroller due to all the autistic symptoms of suffering. As this mother held her son who could not look people in the eye, I renounced the autistic spirit and released the healing power of the Holy Spirit into him. He too started to look each of us in the eye, and began to walk. He walked all around holding onto his mom's hand, and the next afternoon, the mother returned with him and said he was walking with her all day. What's happening here? According to the words of Jesus, it is our faith that heals and makes us whole. \"Then He said to him, \"Rise, go your way. Your faith has made you well\" (Luke 17:19). And I know that the Spirit of God meets us wherever our faith is. Faith calls out to the Spirit of God. It pleases Him. And as these mothers continue to release their faith, and learn to release it completely, the full manifestation of these healings, which are many, will manifest completely. I pray this helps you in your journey with Jesus in your deliverance and healing process. {eoa} Becky Dvorak is a prophetic healing evangelist and the author of [ DARE to Believe, Greater Than Magic and, soon to be released, The Healing Creed.](http://authorbeckydvorak.com/shop/) Visit her at [authorbeckydvorak.com](http://authorbeckydvorak.com/).
