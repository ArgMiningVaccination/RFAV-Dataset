KP says it is making every effort to staff up but has been hampered by a labor shortage. The therapists \u2014 and the National Union of Healthcare Workers, which represents them \u2014 counter that the managed-care giant has difficulty attracting clinicians because its mental health services have a poor reputation.

It's a phenomenon known by the forbidding name of original antigenic sin, and, in the case of the coronavirus, it prompts a constellation of questions. Are our immune systems stuck still revving up defenses against a version of the virus that has vanished? Will updated booster shots that are designed to thwart variants be much better than the original vaccine? How often will we be reinfected? Is there a better way to broaden immunity?
