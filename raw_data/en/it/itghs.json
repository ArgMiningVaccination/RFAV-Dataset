Each week is a 2 hour gathering, the first being a presentation as well as experiential exercises which will be recorded and available for your future reference. The second hour will be for questions to assist in deepening the meditations in a living way. We encourage you to attend live as the question hour will not be recorded to create a held space for the group gathered. The 4 part course is $80 (the fee is waived for those enrolled in the year-long [EduCareDo Inner Development for World Development course](https://www.educaredo.org/inner-development-for-world-development)) For more information please visit the EduCareDo website "}
