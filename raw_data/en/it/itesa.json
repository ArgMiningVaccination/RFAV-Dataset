Dave Krabbenhoft, Director of Finance and Administration, Department of Corrections, distributed a hard copy of his PowerPoint presentation (Attachment A). Mr. Krabbenhoft reviewed each slide. The Executive Recommendation for 2007-09 is $199.5 million compared to $129.1 million for 2005-07. Mr. Krabbenhoft describes DOCR's two divisions, Juvenile and Adult (Ref. 3:58), and the services within each. The Youth Correctional Center (YCC) provides Plant, Food, Medical, Treatment, Education, Security/Supervision, Work Programs, and Training Services. He also reviews the total budget recommendation and significant budget changes. Mr. Krabbenhoft: This biennium, the budget was put together to end with zero special funds for a beginning balance in the 07-09 biennium. We have to make up for that money somehow if we're going to continue the level of services we have. We are also losing some federal money that is expiring, the grants aren't being renewed, and those types of things. Chm. Svedjan: How much of that is lost federal dollars? Mr. Krabbenhoft: I don't have that with me; I'm guessing $150, 000 -$200,000 . Chm. Svedjan: fund,\" you're really talking \"special funds.\" Page 2 House Appropriations Committee Bill/Resolution No. HB 1015 DOCR Budget Overview Hearing Date: January 5, 2007 Mr. Krabbenhoft: No, special funds, we get kids who come from detention and we charge them a rate and that is special funds. Rep. Aarsvold: Do you get tuition from the school districts? Mr. Krabbenhoft: No. Mr. Krabbenhoft proceeds with a similar review of Juvenile Services Community (JCS) (Ref. 22:17). Rep. Carlson: Re: Inflation/Workload of $100,000, what number was used for inflation and how much of that is spread throughout the budget where you add and inflator in? (Ref. 25:43) Mr. Krabbenhoft: I don't have that specifically, but we can get you the breakdown on that. Rep. Carlson: The reason I ask is we always ask what does it cost if we don't change a thing to open the doors the next biennium compared to what new programs are being added? I have a hard time figuring out what that number is. (Ref. 27:16) Mr. Krabbenhoft: For the overview I didn't want to get too specific. We will break that down further when we get into subcommittee. It's not an across the board number. Mr. Krabbenhoft continued with a review of Adult Services Field Services (FSD) (Ref. 28:49). Mr. Krabbenhoft explained that DOCR created a fee to counties for offenders who leave ($150). We use that money to get offenders if they violate the tenns. We have enough money in that account and would like to suspend this. DOCR is looking to expand female transition/community placement program as the number of female inmates increases. The treatment services are key to managing the inmate population. Mr. Krabbenhoft reviewed the Executive Recommendation and significant budget changes. Rep. Klein: On average, how many people does each parole officer supervise? -Warren Emmer: Depends on who they are supervising. Page 3 House Appropriations Committee Bill/Resolution No. HB 1015 DOCR Budget Overview Hearing Date: January 5, 2007 Mr. Krabbenhoft continued with a review of the Prisons Division (PD) including the different correctional facilities in North Dakota, the executive Recommendation and the significant budget changes. (Ref. 40:52). Mr. Krabbenhoft: DOCR is proposing a change on how payments are made to New England (Ref. 49:34). New England will be full all biennium so we would like to make equal payments every month rather than per diem. This would help avoid spikes that we are seeing in the budget now. Rep. Wald: What do you pay the people who work at Roughrider Industries (RRI)? Mr. Krabbenhoft: They're paid $1.00 -$1.40 per hour. Rep. Wleland: Earlier you said there were no costs for RRI, now you say there are work programs at $12.8 million (Ref. 52:38) -Mr. Krabbenhoft: All the money RRI spends is money they generate from selling products. The only way they will spend $12.8 million is if they generate $12.8 million. There are no general funds in the RRI line at all. It's all other funds. Dave Krabbenhoft pointed out the summary of DOCR budget by request (Attachment B) and reviewed the \"2007-2009 Estimated DOCR Inmate Population\" handout (Attachment C) broken down by male and female inmates (Ref. 68:29). Mr. Krabbenhoft reviewed the itemized costs for building and new construction and projects. (Attachment D) (Ref. 73:31 ). Chm. Svedjan: On new construction side, to what extent does that include facilities other than the existing prison? Mr. Krabbenhoft: It does include costs for a complete complex. -Chm. Svedjan: But it wouldn't include MRCC? Page 4 House Appropriations Committee Bill/Resolution No. HB 1015 DOCR Budget Overview Hearing Date: January 5, 2007 Mr. Krabbenhoft: No, it would. It doesn't have land acquisition costs and utility establishment costs. Rep. Carlson: Regarding the remodeling project, how many total beds would we have? (Ref. 75:39). Mr. Krabbenhoft: 792. Rep. Carlson: How many with new construction? Mr. Krabbenhoft: 950. Rep. Carlson: So there is a difference in the number of beds between the two when you compare the numbers? Mr. Krabbenhoft: Yes. The reason is that the remodeling project keeps MRCC in tact. That's 150 beds. Rep. Carlson: If there was some remodeling money for MRCC, it would have to be added to this if you want to compare apples to apples, because you're putting money in down there, as well as your remodeling project, correct? Mr. Krabbenhoft: We asked in our request for $2.2 million for a multipurpose building and that didn't make the cut. Rep. Wald: Any new plans on releasing low risk prisoners to decrease the prison population? Leann Bertsch, Department of Corrections: We are doing that the maximum now. The number of inmates released has increased. We have probably already released those that meet our criteria. There is not much more room for release without risking public safety. Rep. Skarphol: Can we get a list of the types of inmates in our prisons? Ms. Bertsch: We are working on a profile of our inmate population now. Rep. Wald: Do you work with judges on short sentenced offenders? Page 5 House Appropriations Committee Bill/Resolution No. HB 1015 DOCR Budget Overview Hearing Date: January 5, 2007 Ms. Bertsch: We have an ongoing relationship. Meet with justices on a regular basis. A good dialog exists. Rep. Skarphol: How effective are suspended sentences? Ms. Bertsch: Out of my realm. Chm.

Svedjan called the House Appropriations Committee to order. There are two sets of amendments -.0106 and .0107 . Rep. Wieland motioned Wieland described amendment .0106 (Ref. 0:45). Rep. Kempenlch: What's the time frame for the $85 million? (Ref. 11 :14). What could they do with the interest if they didn't expend it? Rep. Wieland: I believe the majority would not be spent in this biennium, although I would hope that some would start. Before we can get into the actual construction, there needs to be plans, bidding, specifications, etc. Rep. Kempenlch: Wondering if we should have language to roll any proceeds from the $85 million? Rep. Carlson: Wouldn't that money stay in the general fund until the money was requested so the interest would automatically roll back into the general fund? Chm. Svedjan: I think it does. 11 Page 2 House Appropriations Committee Bill/Resolution No. HB 1015 Hearing Date: February 13, 2007 Rep. Kerzman: I hope we can resist these amendments. The problem I have with these amendments is there are a few areas -I think we should put more equity into the corrections officers. Also, the actual facility. I have amendments to offer. (Ref. 15:20) Chm. Svedjan: It sounds like you may request a minority report. We'll take a roll call vote on .0106 to help us identify who signs the majority and minority reports. Then we'll ask you to offer your amendment. Rep. Glassheim: Could you outline what you would get for the additional $43 million? Rep. Wieland: You would get something completely different, not just an addition to what is on the $42 million renovation (Ref. 18:14). The $85 million includes: new DOCR Administration building, administration outside the fence, facility operations and visiting, new medical facility, 960 beds, new programs building, recreation area, food services, observation tower, new warehouse, training building, and armory. Not replaced: Roughrider, maintenance and motor pool buildings, energy plant. Rep. Glassheim: How many beds would be newly constructed? Rep. Wieland: None of the existing area will remain. There are a total of 950 beds that will be put in. This has to do with a security, safety and efficiency issue. The pod design is easier to add to and maintain. Rep. Glassheim: So what' left will remain? Rep. Wieland: That the intent (Section 7 of Amendment .0106). Rep. Carlson: In discussions with the Governor's office, the $43 million was for demolishing the east cell block and the medical thing -but were quick to admit that they would put $6 million into adding a minimum security wing onto that $42 million and then closing the MRCC -(Ref. 24:09). When I look at the numbers, I'm assuming that they were really going to do that Page3 House Appropriations Committee Bill/Resolution No. HB 1015 Hearing Date: February 13, 2007 -so this $43 million was really $49 million because the new prison is going to include beds for that minimum security and MRCC closing, is it not? Chm. Svedjan: No, it's not in there now. I think we have an amendment coming. Rep. Carlson: So the 950 beds doesn't include MRCC or it does? Rep. Wleland: There is space in there, yes, for MRCC if we wanted to do that, within the 950. Rep. Carlson: So the $42 million should really be $49 million compared to the $85 million, would house the same number of people. Chm. Svedjan: That's right. Rep. Ekstrom: The life span of these buildings is between 75 and 100 years. Does your $85 million have the cost of the $6 mllllon of removing the 1908 bullding? Rep. Wieland: The cost of tearing that building down was $1.5 million, not $6 million. Rep. Ekstrom: Over the next ten years, DOCR has allocated $6 million for extraordinary repairs on existing buildings. So, for a smaller amount of money, we can maintain the buildings. The question here is which one of these buildings is coming down. That ought to be evaluated. I'm most concerned that we have no drawings, no plans, no specs -we don't know what this looks like or how it will be accomplished. Rep. Metcalf: There needs to be a separate and segregated rehabilitation portion in this new prison. I hope the final plans include this. I may change my stance on this bill if it is not. Rep. Ekstrom: What is the estimate of what we would gain from the sale of MRCC? Rep. Wieland: I believe $7.8 million. Rep. Wald: Where would I find New England in this amendment? Rep. Pollert: There was discussion of dropping the funding at $7.9, but you will not see it in any of these amendments because there wasn't enough support to drop the funding. Rep. Wald: So there's $7.9 million still in the budget? Page4 House Appropriations Committee Bill/Resolution No. HB 1015 Hearing Date: February 13, 2007 \u00b7 Rep. Pollart: Yes. Rep. Glassheim: Re: beds -what does a bed cost under the pod method? Rep. Wieland: DOC architect to construct the beds alone: 28,000 ff is $4.41 million ($155 per ff). Costs are higher for maximum security. Rep. Gulleson: I will resist the recommendation for a new prison. This has suddenly become a priority and should be near the bottom. (Ref. 36:38) Rep. Carlisle: The Governor's proposal tearing down the east cell house and remodeling goes to 2014. Now if that's forward planning somebody's going to have to re-explain it to me. That's why we got involved with the new prison. Rep. Kempenlch: The warden didn't agree when they built the last time that they should be doing something different. The core of that system was old when they put those new buildings -up twenty years ago. We keep surrounding old stuff with a new system and at some point we need to address this and I'd like to see something that would last a while. Rep. Wieland: DOCR architect said we are going to rebuild this prison. You can do it now or wait and do it later. Rep. Metcalf: I'm concerned about the Field Service people -we've dropped three people out of there system. I resist taking these officers out. Rep. Ekstrom expressed her concern with the cutting of three officers. It is a safety issue. Rep. Glasshelm expressed his amazement that this bill is going forward. You are going to take $43 million from the general fund that you don't need to spend now or for several years. We heard Rep. Weisz say we need money for transportation. We don't have unlimited funds as much as we're doing well. This is $43 million for this purpose, then there's some other -purpose you're not using It for. You're getting no net gain. You're emptying buildings that have twenty or thirty years of life left. This is not a high priority. It's not a necessity. Page 5 House Appropriations Committee Bill/Resolution No. HB 1015 Hearing Date: February 13, 2007 -Rep. Skarphol: We spent $31 million patching up this facility over the past years and there comes to be a point when patching no longer pays. Some of us do feel it is necessary for the protection of the guards. Rep. Kerzman reviewed the ages of the buildings currently on the prison grounds and the people out there are more interested in salaries than a new facility. Rep. Ekstrom: The $31 million we put into the buildings were for normal maintenance. There's always going to be necessary repairs. Rep. Polle rt: There were discussions in section about lowering some of the salaries. That did not happen. Rep. Carlson: From a contractor's point of view, I look at what's going to cost more money - tearing down the east cell block and adding something on to old facility -where are we going -to be with the taxpayers ten years from now? In my analysis, we're going to spend as much money or more money continually remodeling that facility than we are to redo the concept. Ten years from now, remodeling will cost more money because of the value of the dollar. I'm convinced that when you spend the taxpayer's money, it prudent to look at the big picture over a long period of time and what this Committee came up with is the right decision. Rep. Kroeber: Re: public policy, all of us are making cuts at agencies at home. Spending $43 million for the same number of prisoners to be housed, I think the public policy will speak well at staying at the executive recommendation. Rep. Kerzman: I wouldn't call tearing down the east cell block a remodeling project. That will be a new facility. Rep. Carlson: I would wager that when you bid that out (referring to the $43 million) that number will not be right. They are assuming their number is right and our number is wrong. Page 6 House Appropriations Committee Bill/Resolution No. HB 1015 Healing Date: February 13, 2007 Rep. Glassheim: Re: $42 million -worst thing would be tom down, about\u00bc of the beds would be completely new, wasn't that the plan by DOCR? It wasn't to rehab the east cell block. It was to tear it down and build a net gain of a couple of hundred beds, built new. (Ref. 53:00) Rep. Carlson: If we do not do something about getting lid of the two facilities in Bismarck, we're making a mistake. If we build or remodel and still have MRCC it's wrong. If we're going to spend the money and remodel, then let's make sure we can move all those prisoners, get lid of that piece of land and put all that money into the project and move the prisoners to the pen where they belong. The motion to adopt amendment .0106 to HB 1015 carried by a roll call vote of 15 ayes, 8 nays and 1 absent and not voting and the amendment was adopted . Rep. Pollart motioned to adopt amendment .0107. Rep. Kempenlch seconded the motion. Rep. Ekstrom: Are these beds for MRCC included in the $85 million? (Ref. 56:25) Rep. Wieland: They are included. Rep. Kroeber: If those 100+ beds are included in that, then how many beds are in the new proposed facility? Rep. Wieland: 960 Rep. Kroeber: How many are there now? Rep. Wieland: 550, and they are going to be adding 200+, so they'd end up with 794. -Rep. Pollart: Then you add the 150 beds in and you'll get to the 940/950. Rep. Wald: How is the land zoned? Page 7 House Appropriations Committee Bill/Resolution No. HB 1015 Hearing Date: February 13, 2007 Rep. Wieland: I believe the intended zoning is residential. Rep. Ekstrom asked if any land could be used for residential or is it wetlands. Rep. Pollart: There are 985 acres of land at MRCC. Of that $7.85 million comes from the sale of 785 acres but there are some wetlands and that's not included in the 785 acres. Rep. Metcalf: Is there a law in place that ensures that when land is sold the money stays in the state coffers? Rep. Wald: The state of North Dakota sold some land for a fairground and at that time the law said we had to have two appraisals from two registered appraisers and it could not be sold for less than the appraised price. Rep. Metcalf: I'm concerned with the language concerning the sale of the land. Rep. Skarphol: Rep. Metcalf may have a legitimate concern and the language may need to be cleaned up. Rep. Glassheim: Was there any discussion of selling a good deal of the land but leaving the buildings and shrinking down the amount which would make land available for commercial development? Rep. Pollart: There was discussion in section about selling the land south of the road -500+ acres. It raised questions as to what it would do to the value of the remaining land. The motion to adopt .0107 to HB 1015 carried by a roll call vote of 15 ayes, 8 nays and 1 absent and not voting and the amendment was adopted. Rep. Kerzman distributed and reviewed amendment .0108 (Ref. 69:47). Page 8 House Appropriations Committee Bill/Resolution No. HB 1015 Hearing Date: February 13, 2007 motioned to adopt amendment .0108. Rep. Ekstrom seconded the motion. The motion failed by a roll call vote of 8 ayes, 15 nays and 1 absent and not voting. The amendment was not adopted. Rep. Kerzman motioned to request a minority report. Rep. Ekstrom seconded the motion. A roll call vote was taken to determine the names for the minority report. Rep. Wieland motioned a Do Pass as Amended. Rep. Kempenich seconded the motion. The motion carried by a roll call vote of 15 ayes, 8 nays and 0 absent and not voting. The amendments were adopted. Rep. Wieland was designated to carry the bill. 78015.0102 Title.

LeAnn Bertsch, Director, ND Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. testified indicating the executive recommendations have been well thought out through the Dept of Corrections. She reviewed the changes made by the house appropriations committee. She indicated there were a couple of major issues of concern. She utilized a diagram showing how adult services work. This demonstrated how individuals come into the Dept of Corrections through sentencing court, showing how each piece of the Dept of Corrections has a critical balance. She then discussed the capital project evaluating what is critically needed to carry out the program which is in the Governor's budget. The House put an additional amount to the budget to carry out the building project further. The most important part of the program is the staff who carry out the program. A second critical change in the house is the parole officers that were cut out of the field services division and the Dept of Corrections wants those restored. She then reviewed the case loads of offenders in the communities. She then expressed the reasons for the appropriation and what would be done with those funds. Senator Mathern asked why there is a reduction on 3A. The response was that they try to reduce the risk the prisoner poses to society and to reoffend. Page 2 Senate Appropriations Committee Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: 03-05-07 -Senator Seymour asked if there are people to take the parole and probation jobs if those positions are restored. The response was yes. Senator Grindberg indicated after the tour, he preferred to do nothing because it appears there has been no cost benefit analysis, no professional cost analysis. In a few years there will be a need for a new kitchen. Is the money being requested really showing a long term savings. The response was he will be provided with all of the information he needs. Dave Krabberhoft, Director of Finance and Administration, Dept of Corrections, distributed a copy of his slide presentation and discussed the juvenile services, adult services, financial needs, and overall budget. He discussed the YCC facility and the executive recommendations. He reviewed all of his slides, including the programs at both facilities, the specific budget requests, the FTE's requested, the transition programs, the medical programs, the governor's recommendation, the house changes, and the requests for changes or reinstatements of the cuts. Senator Krauter wondered if we are growing beyond the control of the Department. The response was the Dept is making a difference, they have no control over what comes to them, but they manage people and redirect them. Senator Krauter asked what we can do to make it in someone's control. The response was we are not able to select who comes into the program. Senator Grindberg asked what the extraordinary repairs are and if the committee could be provided with a list of those at all facilities as well as a list of the deficiency appropriations. The response was yes. Chairman Holmberg asked if there is a state funded chaplain. The response was yes but it is a temporary position. Page 3 Senate Appropriations Committee Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: 03-05-07 Senator Krauter asked that the committee be provided with the dollars involved, the number of individuals and the recidivism information. The response was this will be provided. Senator Krebsbach asked about the average length of stay at YCC. The response is 75 days. Senator Krauter asked to have documentation provided on the treatment services with more detail, where the money is spent, where the providers are, etc. He also asked to have more detail provided on new inmate population with the problem violations. The response was that would be provided. Lisa Brergard, Director, Division of Juvenile Services, presented written testimony (2) as well as a juvenile fact sheet, statewide custody analysis, calendar year 2005 statistics and the Division of Juvenile Services Treatment/service continuum. She indicated that some of the -questions can be answered through her testimony. The presentation is for both the juvenile correction center and juvenile field services. She discussed the recidivism rate, the number of kids going into the adult system, the correctional center, day treatment program. The critical issue is the federal movement to remove the medicaid payment for targeted case management. Senator Christmann asked if everything is now in the budget. The response was yes. Senator Fischer asked about the cost effectiveness of the in-home care, whether outcomes are tracked to see what is working and what isn't. The response was I can get you the specific data on that. Senator Robinson asked abut the 75.3 FTE's and how many were in each area. The response was eight FTE's are not handling caseloads, the rest are. Senator Krauter asked that the committee be provided with a list of the contracted programs. Senator Robinson asked what their initial request for FTE's. Page 4 Senate Appropriations Committee Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: 03-05-07 Senator Krauter asked for information on the number of individuals that have gone through recidivism. Senator Christmann asked where the new male transition center is. The response was it will be in the eastern part of the state. Senator Grindberg asked what started the idea of looking at the county jails and if you get the counties to accept these prisoners, is there a financial upside to the jail. Warren Emmer, Director, Dept of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Field Services Division, presented written testimony (4) and presented testimony in support of HB 1015. He reviewed prison population charts, parole population in different sections, the field services division and connection to the prison system, the caseloads involved. He requested to reinstate the 3 FTE's, reinstate the general fund that went with the operating for those three FTE's and also ask to return to the budget request the $244,782 that was removed and replaced with special fund authority. In addition he requested charging offenders $45 and allow the Field Services to have special fund authority of the $244,782. With that money, off duty police officers across the state would be hired to help make home visits. Warren distributed written testimony from Presiding Judge Donovan Foughty, District Judge Robert Wefald, and discussed conversations with Judge VandeWalle who shared his concerns. Request were made to have various information provided to the sub committee: A strategic plan, a per capita data for ND and SD as far as the cost on the recidivism rate, the average inmate populate by year beginning in 1997, the parole activities and probation activities, the number of FTE'S by division, in addition since 2001, what FTE's have been added, the budget -per biennium since 1997, the extraordinary repairs, and the deficiency appropriations done in each year Page 5 Senate Appropriations Committee Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: 03-05-07 , -Lynn Bergman, Grand Forks native now in Bismarck, presented written testimony (3) testified in opposition to HB 1015, complimented the prison system for the work they are doing. However, indicated that from the DOC website and the structures he had looked at, they are an average age of 30 years old and about 2/3 of the structures are newer then that. Drug and sex offenses, diseases such as hepatitis B, C and aids and sex offenders have become a real problem in our state. The solution is where we disagree. We believe a prison hospital is the solution. Believe for\u00bd the 42 million you could go to Jamestown, make it a multi-level facility least risk to high risk and cover all medical problems there. No more studies, get the job done for much less cost. Chairman Holmberg indicated in a few weeks three members of house and three members of senate will be discussing this issue. Duane Sand, State Director, North and South Dakota for Americans for Posterity, testified in opposition to HB 1015, stressing that the Dept of Corrections is the best person to speak to their needs to operate the correctional system. However, the $42 million does not make sense. We recommend an amendment to HB 1015 with maybe $1 O million more then the original budget submitted to have more money toward prevention and education and therapy. Senator Holmberg indicated that what the Governor added to the budget had to do with wages. The response was the disparity is with the capital construction. Senator Tracy Potter, District 35, Bismarck, provided two alternative amendments on the land ownership of the Missouri River Correctional Facility, removed the entire section 8, the second amendment calls for preserving the ownership of the land of Missouri River -Correctional Facility. He stressed the opinion and position on the sale of the land should Page 6 Senate Appropriations Committee Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: 03-05-07 -remain public land. My position is \"Not Now, Not Ever\" never sell that land. In some way it should always remain public land in one fonn or another. Representative Todd Porter testified as a stand in for Senator Dwight Cook, District 34, Mandan, presenting a proposed amendment .0201. (6) Dennis Fracassi, Director, Rough Rider Industries, presented written testimony (7) together with a brochure from Rough Rider Industries, testifying in support of SB 1015 with the request to reinstate the original request for 4 FTE's be restored. He stressed the importance of not selling the land for MRCC. Chainnan Holmberg closed the hearing on HB 1015 . 2007 SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE MINUTES Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Senate Appropriations Committee D Check here for Conference Committee Hearing Date: 03-05-07 Recorder Job Number: 4383 Committee Clerk Signature Minutes: Holmberg opened the hearing on HB 1015. Tim Schuetzle, Director, Prisons Division, presented written testimony (1 ), a land appraisal report done by Joe Ibach together with a one page summary report (2) testifying on behalf of HB 1015. He discussed capital improvements; the infirmary plan, the addition of more beds, changes to the south tower, the laundry, the warehouse buildings and staff. The request for $42 million will include four additional buildings. He discussed the plans for a new prison and he feels it does not pay to tear down the existing buildings. He discussed the MRCC discussions of selling those lands and his projections of getting the value out of the land and at least maintaining this facility for another 20 years. Chairman Holmberg asked about the state selling 780 acres, the state does not subdivide it and sell partials of land which would have a different value. The response was that is correct. Senator Krauter questioned the appraisal of the 80 acres and the railroad easement and whether that was included in the appraisal. The response was the governor has signed the papers for the easement. Senator Lindaas asked if the 80 acre appraisal is on cleared land. The response was no. Page 2 Senate Appropriations Committee Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: 03-05-07 Senator Robinson questioned the east cell block, the governors proposal, what the footage would be of the new cells compared to the old. The response was there are standards for cell sizes and those in the east cell block are about half the size. Senator Bowman discussed the retention of staff and whether the new building structures relate to the retention and safety of staff. The response was that right now it is the need for dollars to help retention. Senator Bowman asked what the minimum requirement for new staff. The response was an AA degree, two years work experience in criminal justice. However if he looked at the biggest problems at the penitentiary are the first is more and more inmates coming in and not enough room and the second would there is a problem hiring and retaining staff. Senator Bowman asked if thee cell block were funded, the environment being worked in is safer does that make it easier to retain staff. The response was that cannot be quantified, it would be nicer environment to work in, I don't know. Most of the employees are looking at dollars. Senator Grindberg who determines the feasibility of the capital improvements from a financial perspective, on a spread sheet, factoring in all of the plant holdings with normal wear and tear and what those schedules would be. What is the best financial long term plan. The response was this has been looked at Representative Ekstrom tried to quantify the capital improvements. We will supply that information to you. Senator Krauter asked for a review of extraordinary repairs on page 7. This was done and he indicated a document would be provided showing this information. Senator Robinson asked questions of Warren Emmer on restoring the three FTE's for field -services, providing an additional $244,000 and the reconciliation of where we are and what our Page 3 Senate Appropriations Committee Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: 03-05-07 needs are, what the industry standard is on case loads. Mr. Emmer responded to this. He reviewed the chart of prison population. Senator Lindaas asked about the case load and what it should be ideally. The response was 94. Senator Krauter indicated that if his caseload is at 125 the paper work and load becomes a management problem. How do you manage it. The response was we use objective tools to assist us because we don't have the time. Then decisions are made based on the risk and needs. Timothy Faller, Chairman, Prison Industries Advisory Board, presented testimony in support of HB 1015 discussing the Board, its purpose and Roughriders Industries and its ability to maintain solvency. He indicated the Roughriders Industries provides prisoners with useful skills when they are discharged, the industries does not unfairly compete with local businesses. Elaine Little, Administrator, NCCRC, presesnted written testimony. Chairman Holmberg closed the hearing on HB 1015. 2007 SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE MINUTES Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Senate Appropriations Committee D Check here for Conference Committee Hearing Date: 03-23-07 Recorder Job Number: 5517 Committee Clerk Signature Minutes: Chairman Holmberg opened the hearing on HB 1015. Senator Fischer distributed amendments for HB 1015. Senator Krauter discussed amendment 0210 removing the construction funding at the penitentiary. There is deferred maintenance that must be done and restoring the parole and probation officers the house removed. When look at the success of field services and rehabilitation we need to keep officers visiting people on parole. The process is working, they are doing good job. Other states look at what happens in ND. In addition, the OAR the dept had. If they don't build, they need to contract with other facilities in the field services area. The addition of funding for field services; the issue is when corrections has 120 cases they don't get to visit parolees as much as they should. We need those three positions. We need to provide for prevention measures and providing those types of dollars, to provide better rehab. Another issue is to look at the retirement issue for correction officers. Senator Krauter moved a do pass on amendment 0210, Senator Grindberg seconded. Discussion followed. Senator Christman indicated he felt it was a mistake to not venture into the building project; by waiting we will not avoid building as they will be dilapidated. Senator Bowman agreed. He indicated that after touring the facility and looking at the worst situations, it is not conducive for those working there Senator Kilzer indicated he also does not care for the amendment. He stated as he read through the various categories every one of the things has the assumption that the population will decrease and we have an overcrowded situation. I don't see long term planning Senator Grindberg indicated he was not impressed with the tour, as to convincing me that we need to do something. I believe we need to do something, but the information presented didn't give a compelling enough statement that the cost benefit analysis has been thought through enough. No one said we have a crisis at the State Penetentiary. I am still not convinced the right plan has been presented for long term best interest of the state. To me this should have been all numbers. Page 2 Senate Appropriations Committee Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: 03-23-07 Senator Krauter idicated Warren Emmer discussed the success in field services and the warden showed charts demonstrating how the population has leveled out. The people coming into the system are drug related. The male population is stabilizing, the female population is increasing. The purpose is to build lives that are what we are trying to do. The reality is the prison is secure and being a correction officer is not pretty or nice. Senator Christman discussed platoing in male pop. The testimony I have shows 90 inmate growth for next two years. Senator Mathern indicated this presumes the prison population is going down. Let's work on trying to reduce this prison population instead of increasing the population. The potential work that can be done for manufacturing companies in ND; we could take this money and put it in rough rider industries. if pop leaves prison with marketable skill chance of return goes down dramatically. Senator Krauter discussed his source of the prison population. An oral vote was taken resulting in a do pass of the amendment. Senator Krauter moved a do pass as amend, Senator Grindberg seconded. No discussion. A roll call vote was taken resulting in 11 yes 3 no and 0 absent. The bill passed and Senator Krauter will carry the bill. -Chairman Holmberg closed the hearing on HB 1015. 2007 SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE MINUTES Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Senate Appropriations Committee D Check here for Conference Committee Hearing Date: 04-03-07 Recorder Job Number: 5684 i Committee Clerk Signature Minutes: Chairman Holmberg stated he was proposing an amendment on HB /1015 that is not completed at this time It is regarding construction and that amendment would put some money into the prison construction fund, the Penitentiary Land Fund, and then pass the bill so we can be in a position for negotiation with the House on what we are going to do. At this time it appears there is not complete consensus. Senator Krauter stated he also has some amendments for 1015 that relates to that issue. I brought to your attention regarding what we had done last session in the Drug Abuse assessment that was done in Pembina and Grand Forks County on that title project up there and it didn't actually materialize because of the federal funds, there is some of that language that gives some of that flexibility and I can pass that out so everyone can see it. Chairman Holmberg asked if he wanted to wait for the other amendment and Senator Krauter said that was no problem. Senator Mathern said we know some changes about the building, seems to me our present amendments serve as to giving considerable work for the conference committee. Chairman Holmberg stated in the end we might have some kind of construction out there . Further comments were made concerning construction and the dollar amounts involved. Discussion ended concerning HB 1015. 2007 SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE MINUTES Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Senate Appropriations Committee D Check here for Conference Committee Hearing Date: 04-05-07 Recorder Job Number: 5779 IOI 5. Chairman Holmberg explained the amendment Senator Krauter suggested regarding mandatory drug assessment tax pro6,,-am. Senator Robinson indicated pass a bill from Senate and House to provide a project to address meth treatment and would have provided flexibility away from corrections and away from tax department but judiciary laws needed to be looked at. This is a bill promoted by the Attorney General. This is to allow judiciary to do exactly what we intended to do in that pilot project. We are hoping to come out of the legislative assembly with additional funds to teen challenge program and additional funds into the share house program. What we are trying to do is put more emphasis on treatment. There is no money in the amendment. Senator Krauter indicated it gives the court flexibility to use probation. Senator Fischer indicated there is one item he likes and that is if they don't behave and follow rules they will wind up in jail and the time in treatment does not count against the sentence. Chairman Holmberg indicated that is one of the three changes over and above what happened in the other amendments we had. Secondly there is an additional appropriation for teen challenge which was added. The third thing is there had been lots of discussion as to what to do at the prison. What are we going to do? A consensus was reached among some that we should make sure to count the dollars in the Page 2 Senate Appropriations Committee Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: 04-5-07 Governor's recommendation and to provide a transfer from the general fund of$42 million to the state penitentiary land fund. That is a fund that has been there for a while. The money would go there and we can get it out of here and to conference committee. Senator Grindberg moved rescind the action on BB 1015, Senator Krebsbach seconded. An oral vote was taken resulting in the motion passing. Discussion took place. Senator Grindberg moved a do pass on the amendment 0201, Senator Bowman seconded. Discussion too place. Senator Mathern asked if on section IO any of that money could be spent during the next biennium with the passage of the amendment. Alan Knudson answered indicating yes and it needs separate appropriations. Senator Mathern so this could happen in some other bill. It is important to accept $42 million in the Governor's budget. Chairman Holmberg indicated the balance in this land fund is $64,000 as of July I. $151,000 will be at the end of the next biennium. Joe Morrisette responded that it is money in the general fund from mineral revenue that is generated from a gravel pit by Youth Correctional Center. There is no appropriation in the 07-09 biennium but in past biennium they have included in their request for certain extra ordinary repairs or capital projects and it has had an appropriation. -Senator Mathern distributed a handout indicating he had made a request of the university system as to what are deferred maintenance and deferred issues related health and safety not funded that we still need Page 3 Senate Appropriations Committee Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: 04-5-07 to address this in the university system. This list is given for review and it reflects where we as a committee need to look at. We ought to stay with our amendments, add the other amendments regarding the probation and not do section 10. Chairman Holmberg remembers from communication from l,,'llards and other employees that there are health and safety issues there too. That is one of the reasons for replacing the block house and infirmary. Senator Mathern in amend we have about $1 million in there for repairs and building issues outside of the $42 million. In terms of the block house I have no doubt there are problems there. My vision would be to tear it down so that someday it would not be a health and safety issue, but we would not replace it because we are putting programs in place to keep people out of prison and we would make better use of other facilities. Chairman Holmberg stated not to be argumentative but we will not build anything until the end of the session after conference committees. The subcommittee was skeptical of construction and I think you would agree to that and you would also agree the subcommittee did put a.number of enhancements in that budget to deal with some of the philosophical points. Senator Robinson asked Alan Knudson to give an analysis of money in this budget as compared to the current biennium. Alan Knudson indicated on the green sheet you have the 05-07 appropriation of $101.1 million and after the senate amendments you are at $ I 80 million. Senator Krauter why does it not show on the amendments on page 3 which is $138 million, where do you account for the $42 million? Alan Knudson said to look at the$ 138 million has a footnote and it says $42 million is not an appropriation. Page 4 Senate Appropriations Committee Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: 04-5-07 Chairman Holmberg indicated we have been skating around the prison construction. One suggestion was made to put $42 million in and it will show up as something the legislature will look at. At the end of session the conference committee may have several options which were indicated. The decision was made to move forward and get this in Conference Committee. Senator Krauter asked on the budget analysis that we track, how will it show up on there. Alan Knudson it will be general fund expenditure. Senator Bowman indicated he has mixed feelings about the rehab program you want as it will work to a point that something critical happens. Chairman Holmberg indicated the legislature has been supportive of treatment programs and programs to reduce recidivism and if you recall, the numbers we always compare with is SD. We do more on treatment and rehabilitation. They have more people in prison and they have a much higher recidivism rate then ND. The legislature has been supportive of both and the mood amongst many is the bad dude should be locked up. Senator Krauter indicated we are not changing laws as far as sentencing. If you look at the inmate management plan the department has been working with those types of criminals are not being put into probation. This is research based scientific data that will them to get into these types of programs. It is what we have been noted for in the nation is our recidivism rate. Senator Bowman indicated he doesn't dispute what was said but if just one time someone gets killed, it will be pretty hard to explain our reasoning. Chairman Holmberg indicated the pendulum swings back and forth, you have five years of focusing on rehabilitation and al I of a sudden something really gross happens and all of a sudden we are locking them up and throwing away the key. -Senator Tallackson stated he would agree with this scenario. Page 5 Senate Appropriations Committee Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: 04-5-07 Senator Mathern stated we have an opportunity here to make it more difficult for that to happen. We are in here adding officers on the street that will have a greater ability to make sure that does not happen. We are bringing case loads down with these amendments. It is bringing it to an optimal stand so the Drew Jadine case has less chance of happening. An oral vote was taken on the amendments. The motion carried. Senator Grindberg moved do pass on the bill as amended, Senator Wardner seconded. A roll call vote was taken resulting 12 yes, I no, I absent. The motion carried and Senator Krauter will carry the bill. Chairman Holmberg closed the hearing on HB 1015 . 78015.0201 Title.

Chet Pollert, Chairman opened the Conference Committee hearing on HB 1015, a Bill for an Act to provide an appropriation for defraying the expenses of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation; and to amend and reenact Subsection 1 of Section 12-65-08 of the North Dakota Century Code, relating to fees for the interstate transfer or travel of probationers. Present were: Representatives Wieland and Metcalf and Senators Fischer, Grindberg, and Krauter. Senator Krauter: Referred to the amendments and explained. On page 1, an amendment relating to Section 6, Sen. Krauter stated last session there was a potential pilot project we were going to do in Walsh, Pembina and Grand Forks counties relating to meth treatment where the courts be able to put the person on probation. We added this in from the standpoint that we still want to have the opportunity where the courts can use that as one of their tools to put a person into treatment right away. In Sections 8, 9, and 10, are some dollars that were added. -In Section 15, wording was added relating to a Legislative Council Study studying the retirement system for correctional officers. 'Page2 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: April 12, 2007 Page 4, two million dollars were added for prevention grants. Explanation given. Refer: 05:25 Representative Wieland: Questioned the 5 million dollars for FTEs. Senator Krauter: Not necessarily FTEs, but enhancing the programs that are currently there. We did not add any FTEs. Current programs that we are looking at are the addiction treatment programs, the sex offender treatment programs, working with the mentally ill, behavioral management, anger management, and the alternatives to violence type of classes. Some of the faith based opportunities are starting to show some success. Also, the area of vocational training ... look at what Rough rider Industries is doing -we need to find more opportunities for individuals to get those skills. Next item is the removing of the funding for the new building and demolition projects . Explanation given. Refer: 09:33 Next item adds three FTEs in the special offender workload and this was an optional adjustment request. Explanation given. The addition of 20 more additional male beds is an optional adjustment request. Explanation given. Chairman Pollert: Question about whether 20 beds added on were in the budget. Senator Krauter: Correct. Number seven restores the three FTEs -a parole officer, a probation officer including all their operations expense. Explanation given. Refer: 12: 1 0 Restored some of the deferred maintenance that was recently removed by the House. If not going to building anything, have some things and projects that need to be done to keep the structure sound. \u00b7Page 3 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: April 12, 2007 Last item is we added another 100,000 dollars into Teen Challenge to bring it to a total of $500,000. Need to discuss. Referred to Green Sheets. Emergency Clause discussion. Refer: 14: 10 -17:00 Chairman Pollart: Stated the only other section would be the transfer of 42 million dollars to the state penitentiary land fund. Senator Krauter: Right. A quick review ... it's a fund within the DOCR where they receive income for the sale of minerals such as gravel ... particularly the land southwest of Mandan. Appropriated money out of that fund. Continued explanation and discussion. Refer: 17:40 Chairman Polle rt: Is my impression that the way the bill is coming out of the Senate, you don't want to look at construction, but you might want to look at construction. You are putting in place 7 million dollars worth of treatment programs between Field Services and the Prisons Division. But, then you're thinking we are going to do a $42 million. I see a conflict. Senator Krauter: Is now the right time to do that? Are we starting to see these types of positive changes happening? Are at that time now or should we wait two years? There are some things happening statistically that really make us stop and think. If we continue down that road, we can continue seeing improvements. If we stop and don't prison -build more facilities -more cells, are we going to stop that trend that we are on. Are we going to start to fill them versus doing rehabilitation treatment? We need to discuss now -is now the time to build it or should we put this money aside to save it so that we can then do it next biennium when we see that this trend isn't really happening. Or if the trend is happening, we don't need to do it. Maybe there is some plan we can look at. Chairman Pollart: Questioned the two treatment programs for the 2 and 5 million -were they OARs or were they suggestions from DOCR? On the House, we didn't change a program in ' \u00b7Page 4 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: April 12, 2007 the DOCR budget ... with the 40 beds and then there was halfway house and some quarter\u00ad way house. How did you come up with 2 and 5 million dollars figures? Senator Krauter: They were not OARs. As we're starting to see some of these positive things happening -maybe as a policy branch of government we need to say we see this happening and we want to support it and will give you some of the flexibility to make some of this stuff happen. Representative Wieland: Senator Krauter, are you basing these programs on something that you see as operational at the present time or is this something that we have to set up to become operational. In other words, are we looking at adding a new program that would enhance our rehabilitation? Where is the program now? Senator Krauter: The two areas -Prisons Division and Field Services, in Prisons Division as was presented, 4.9 million dollars is all that expended in treatment out of 100 million dollars. No new programs here, it is the existing programs that they have there at different levels and basically doubling that amount ... going from 4.9 to 9.9 dollars and giving them some flexibility to make those things work. In the area of Field Services, some of this is grant dollars that they can then contract with whoever is out there that can do some of these preventive things out front to get in front of the type of criminal activity that is happening. Not a new program in Prisons and in Field Services, it would be a contract type of environment. Representative Wieland: We don't know that these programs are the reason that our prison population has remained constant at this particular point. You talk about adding 5 million dollars -how would it be spent? Refer: 23:50 Chairman Pollart: When we come in for our next meeting, if you have an idea of what you're thinking about for the 2 million and the 5 million ... better clarification at that time. \u00b7Page 5 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: April 12, 2007 Representative Wieland: We have done enough studies ... maybe there is an opportunity to do a study on what is working. I want to know if the rehabilitation program is working and the prison population is not increasing, that is what we should be pursuing. Senator Krauter: We can all look at that and see new inmates are drug related or some type of combination of that and some type of property damage or those types of things. Continued explanation on enhancing treatment. Refer: 26:00 Representative Metcalf: I have always been in favor of treatment for rehabilitation. The necessity of basically either building a situation whereby the individual's needs these special treatments are separated from the rest of the prison inmates. Because, it has been proven that once they start mixing into the general population they start assimilating the problems that the other prisoners have. So, if there some way through this process we can develop a specific area where they can be completely separated from the rest of the prisoners and run through rehabilitation programs and put into probation and parole, I think we will lots farther ahead as far as getting our prisoners down now. We have to look at the safety of our staff and our prisoners. Do we really want to discard construction at this time? I am leaning to the fact that we need to have construction and preferably as soon as possible. Senator Grindberg: Discussion here has been good. I am looking at this from a bigger perspective. What's the population going to be? The pod plan is a 42 million dollar solution; it is only the first step. Refer: 28:50 Senator Krauter: For the next meeting, asking for information -Teen Challenge dollar amount and recap of history there. Chairman Pollart: Also, information about the grants -the 2 and 5 million, further information on 20 beds for male transition ... further discussion on that and FTEs. \u00b7Page 6 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: April 12, 2007 Senator Krauter: One more thing ... concern about civil commitment offenders that are at Jamestown and some additional resources that we need to discuss.

Present were: Representatives Wieland and Metcalf and Senators Fischer, Grindberg, and Krauter. Chairman Pollart: When left the last meeting, we were talking about the discussing the grant items from the Field Divisions. Senator Krauter: Handed out an attachments: Chart on Prisons Division and Field Services Dlvison, List of Programs within the Prisons Division, Reduction in Recidivism, and North Dakota Teen Challenge. Senator Krauter began reviewing the chart and explaining the programs. He also passed out an amendment to SB 2136 regarding interagency security training and explained. Being this was passed, there is nothing in the -budget for an FTE to actually do the training at the State Hospital. Refer: 03:15 -10:40 Page 2 \" House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: April 13, 2007 Chairman Polle rt: Questioned on the FTE ... the asking of 1.5 FTE through the Human Services budget ... if this is what it pertains to? Senator Krauter: This is separate. Continued with explanation on Teen Challenge ... increases from $300,000 to $500,000. Did we overfund that process? Becky Keller of the Legislative Council: The current level for Teen Challenge programming in the DOCR budget is $500,000. Chairman Pollart: Did we do $150,000 last biennium and then in the Governor's Executive Budget he threw in $150,000 to make it to the three, then the House side added $100,000 and the Senate added $100,000? Becky and Senator Krauter: Yes. Senator Krauter: Did we fund it properly? Rod Backman, with Teen Challenge: Stated in original testimony, it was based on 40 residents times $16 a day times 700 some days in the biennium comes to up $490,000. Based on reports from Corrections, he gave average figures. Refer: 14:50. -16:00 Senator Krauter: Continued with the review on \"Recidivism\" and explanation. Chairman Pollert: Question for Legislative Council or 0MB, on SB 2136 was there a fiscal note attached? Becky Keller: There is no fiscal note. Senator Krauter: It is my understanding that is why they brought it to my attention. We need to address it ... fell through the cracks. Becky Keller: DOCR said there was no fiscal impact. Leann Bertsch, Director of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation: Stated this bill looks a lot differently than it was introduced. The intent was the DOCR would assume the whole civic commitment unit at the State Hospital and we would take over all of the FTEs at Page 3 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: April 13, 2007 some point. No fiscal impact. As the bill traveled through the process, it became clear that there was some concerns with regards to constitutionality of the DOCR taking a civil commitment unit over. The Senate had concerns ... security and safety at the State Hospital. Wanted to have something in place that requires the DOCR to consult and train their staff at the State Hospital. Continued explanation. Refer: 21 :38 -22:47. Senator Fischer: Questioned the $120,000 amount. Senator Krauter: Explained on page 2 -the e-mail which gives the amount of the position. Chairman Pollert: You need to hire an FTE that is trained in sex offenders. Leann Bertsch: It would actually be an FTE supplement to our training force at JRCC. Discussion: Question asked if there was request for a fiscal note. Refer: 24:02 -26:41. Chairman Pollert: Referred to the amendments .0507 ... asked for explanation on the 2 million and 5 million dollars, increased funding for transitional services for 20 extra beds -when the bill was asking for 40 originally. Senator Krauter: Explanation given and discussion. Refer: 27:31 -28:20 Chairman Pollert: On the original bill, you were asking for 6 FTEs for the parole officers, on the House side we reduced that by 3 FTEs, and on the Senate side you added the 3 FTEs that we had taken out but you added 3 additional FTEs. Explanation requested. Senator Krauter: It was an OAR ... the attempt is to get the caseload down. Explained. Refer. 28:57 -29:56 Chairman Pollert: Questioned the restoration of deferred maintenance. Senator Krauter: Explained. Representative Wieland: Something was going to come out of one of these funds. Could you repeat that? Senator Krauter: The Emergency Clause ... the Crime Victims Compensation Fund. Page4 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: April 13, 2007 Dave Krabbenhoft: That is General Fund money. It is specific as to what we can use it for right now. But, if the amendment is changed, then we can use it for the Crime Victims Compensation ... with the Emergency Clause we can spend it right away. Chairman Pollart: The emergency measure came in on the Senate side, is that correct? Dave: Correct. Adjournment. 2007 HOUSE STANDING COMMITTEE MINUTES Bill/Resolution No. HB 1015 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division ~ Check here for Conference Committee Hearing Date: April 16, 2007 Recorder Job Number. 6059 ~ I[ Committee Clerk Signature 79 ~=d..)rZDD Minutes: Rep. Chet Pollart, Chairman opened the Conference Committee hearing on HB 1015, a Bill for an Act to provide an appropriation for defraying the expenses of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation; and to amend and reenact Subsection 1 of Section 12-65-08 of the North Dakota Century Code, relating to fees for the interstate transfer or travel of probationers. Present were: Representatives Wieland and Metcalf and Senators Fischer, Grlndberg, and Krauter. Chairman Pollert: The last time we were here we talking about the programs with Senator Krauter. Can explained a little about the 20 transition beds? Senator Krauter: That was an OAR. Explained. Senator Grindberg: You might want to ask about a new OAR. Dave Krabbenhoft: As of July 1st, in our inmate management plan, we projected 1,230 male inmates to house within the system and with our contract beds. As of April 15th, it looks like we'll be more than likely at 1,242. That is 12 over. The other issue is we had wanted to increase TRCC to a capacity of 72 inmates and the State Hospital isn't going to let us do that. Page 2 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: Apnri:3;::2007 They're going to make us keep it where we're at 48 inmates ... 60 beds. It is going to leave us 36 short of where we're at. Have to them in the county jail times $60 a day ... $1,576,800. Senator Grindberg: My perception was that we had these beds, how have some things has changed? Dave Krabbenhoft: Back when we putting together the master plan, the hospital told us that they wanted to move the TRCC over to the Nurses' Building. As a result of that, when we had original discussion with the Hospital, the TRCC was originally planned to go to the Nurses' Building. The Hospital said that 90 people are too many people and they don't have the staff to support 90 in the Nurses' Building, so we have been forced to go back to the 60. Hospital needs to follow JAYCO standards. Continued explanation and discussion. Refer: 05:30 - 07:15 Senator Krauter: With this change, would there be a reduction of costs? Dave Krabbenhoft: There would be no reduction in costs. Lump sum payment to the hospital for 90 beds. Senator Krauter: What was the lump sum payment? Dave Krabbenhoft: It is in the budget. Chainnan Pollert: We should not have to pay for the 90 beds. Dave Krabbenhoft: The department made the assumption that they could do 120 for the same costs as 90 and made the assumption that we could go to the Nurses' Building independent of the cost estimate that was given from the hospital. The cost of the budget to the hospital isn't going to change. Chairman Pollert: Well, it should change because they are going to take 12 less people. Dave Krabbenhoft: No, they are going to take 90 people into the program, 40 are going to be male inmates and the others from the community, and 30 women. They are going to take 90 ~age 3 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division 'vi\\ Bill/Resolution No. 1015 ~ Hearing Date:~ v.(\\ total. We thought we could put more men in there and the hospital said no, we gave you a price for 90 and that's where it is going to stay. Chairman Pollart: It is a question we could ask Alex. Dave Krabbenhoft: Continued explanation on costs of the program. Representative Wieland: Another million ... explain. Dave Krabbenhoft: Instead of having 72 male inmates at the TRCC program, we're going to end up with 48 inmates. Those 48, instead of getting into a treatment program at TRCC, they're going to have to go somewhere else in the system. We have to have a contract bed for them -it goes out to the county. I'm sorry, 24 additional, not 48. Continued discussion and explanation on standards and budget. Refer: 14:17 -19:50 Chairman Pollart: What we need to do, can you have this on a piece of paper? Dave Krabbenhoft: Will prepare sheet. Continued discussion on number of beds and projections. Refer: 21 :00 -23:20 Senator Krauter: Questioned Legislative Council as to why the numbers did not match the Green Sheets? Becky Keller of Legislative Council: They were Legislative estimates. The numbers started changing down the road and Dave had to redo the estimates. Senator Krauter: Questioned whether these estimates were what the budget was built on. Numbers do not add up. Continued discussion on numbers. Refer: 24:20 Chairman Pollart: Requested handout from Dave on optional OAR and more explanation from Becky. Also suggested Alex Schweitzer or Terry Wicks to come before the committee. Senator Krauter: My question is if we do not have the expense in the TRCC, but we do have expense going to the county. One should offset the other to some amount. Adjournment. 2007 HOUSE STANDING COMMITTEE MINUTES Bill/Resolution No. HB 1015 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division ~ Check here for Conference Committee Hearing Date: April 17, 2007 ~me, Job N,mbe\" 608~ cl<' 1 I Committee Clerk Signature ~&0' Minutes: Rep. Chet Pollert, Chairman, opened the Conference Committee hearing on HB 1015, a Bill for an Act to provide an appropriation for defraying the expenses of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation; and to amend and reenact Subsection 1 of Section 12-65-08 of -the North Dakota Century Code, relating to fees for the interstate transfer or travel of probationers. Rep. Chet Pollert, Chairman noted that all present: Representatives Wieland and Metcalf and Senators Fischer, Grlndberg, and Krauter. Rep. Chet Pollart, Chairman, stated we would continue with an explanation of the numbers that were discussed yesterday and questions for the State Hospital. Dave Krabbenhoft, of the DOCR, stated he apologized for the confusion yesterday. Secondly, he did not want to imply that this was a State Hospital problem. We made an incorrect assumption in our budget when we prepared the budget. Not specifically asking for any money. Just wanted to make you aware of that if things continue to go as they are, that we could have problems in the next biennium. When you add all those numbers together, for -36 beds and 1.5 million dollars. But, having said that, our whole budget is built on an estimate. When we get a point. we hope the averages will work out. Dave handed out a sheet showing , Page 2 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: April 17, 2007 the program capacity at the TRCC. (Attachment A) We are not asking or we don't want the State Hospital to increase the TRCC to 90 beds. We believe that female and male proportion of it is a good 90-bed facility and we don't want that capacity increased. Explanation of the sheet given. (Refer: 02:59) Chairman Pollert: Stated \"you have the flexibility to move items from the prison division amongst the prison division, but you can't flex between the field division and the prison division. You have to ask Emergency Commission for that authority and the Budget Section. Right?\" Dave Krabbenhoft: That is correct. Peak in April, drop during the summer months, then we go back up higher than we in April. It's an estimate. Chairman Pollert: When you look at 1 \u00bd million dollars, how many months in this program is that in the biennium? Dave Krabbenhoft: If there was a problem, it wouldn't happen until the 20th month. You would be in session by then. Alex C. Schweitzer, Superintendent of the North Dakota State Hospital and Developmental Center of the Department of Human Services: Came to the podium and asked the committee wanted history. Senator Krauter: Questioned that if there was success in the Tompkins Rehabilitation Program, why wouldn't we want to make more of those beds available? Alex C. Schweitzer stated with the current location of the building there is ability to expand there. Life safety issue -beyond 60 beds -overcrowded. No plans to expand. The way the current bill sets with the Senate amendments, we've added some dollars for the department to use. It would an opportunity for the State Hospital and the DOCR to provide. Refer: 09:45 , Page 3 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: April 17, 2007 Alex C. Schweitzer: We have worked very effectively with the DOCR over the years in treating people. Chairman Pollart: If I am correct then, do you have to remodel other buildings in order to accept more people or expand the program? Alex C. Schweitzer: We have an option now that we didn't have last year. We have some space where the women's program is to do some expansion. Senator Krauter: Referred to an amendment he had handed out concerning funding of an FTE of the training of individuals of the DOCR for State Hospital and one of the programs, SB 2136 for $100,000. Alex C. Schweitzer: FTE explained. That bill was amended. (Refer: 11 :30) Discussion on the FTE in the budget. Chairman Pollart: Questioned whether the amendment for $120,000 was the right amount. Alex C. Schweitzer: That is correct. Chairman Pollart: Asked for discussion on amendment .0507. Representative Wieland: Stated he had written down a series of motions that would relate to .0507. He said he had 9 that he was prepared to bring up. Made a motion to remove under Section 8 of amendments grant programs the amount of 2 million dollars for Field Services Division for Research Based Programs. Senator Grindberg: Second the motion for discussion. Roll Call Motion passed. , Page 4 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: April 17, 2007 Representative Wieland: Made a motion to remove under Section 9 of amendments General Fund appropriations of $5 million dollars for the Prisons Division for treatment and programming. Senator Grlndberg: Seconded the motion. Senator Krauter: We heard this a few minutes ago. This is a situation in the Prisons Division where they can use some of these dollars in enhancing treatment, availability of services at the Tompkins Rehabilitation. Look at the success, we've got to give them the dollars to do that. Representative Wieland: We also heard they weren't prepared to do that. With the possibility of the changes that are going to be made in the building program one way or the another, this would not be the time to advance that program until such time it's in a more stable condition. Representative Metcalf: Questioned whether these programs could be offered in the second year of the biennium. Good programs. Chairman Pollert: Gave his personal viewpoint that some of the programs work and some will be continuing. I would like to see what the success of them is going to be before we throw in another 5 million dollars. Representative Metcalf: Under the assumption, these programs are ones that going to be offered within the prison itself. Roll Call Vote: passed. Representative Wieland: Motion for a DOCR Space Operational and Staffing Report for the JRCC and the State Penitentiary. Did not believe it was in the bill ... would like to have it done in writing. , Page 5 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: April 17, 2007 Senator Grindberg: Seconded the motion. When would we expect that report back? Representative Wieland: Did not discuss ... suggest that by the end of 2007. Will add date. Representative Metcalf: What is the anticipated cost? Representative Wieland: There would be no cost ... have a staffing report of sorts already. Continued discussion regarding the kind of report ... whether the DOCR has language in writing. Motion rescinded until Representative Wieland can get amendment rewritten. Refer: 24:07 -26:44 Representative Wieland: Moved to remove funding for three additional FTE's for special offender workloads for $471,411 -Number 5 on Page 4. Chairman Pollart: Do you have further amendments coming forward about the funding for the chaplains? The House version, there were three parole officers that were taken out of the requested budget and Senate put back in the three which is $423,447 and also the chaplain for $64,000. Are you looking at that? Representative Wieland: My plans were not include the chaplains or the line item regarding the three FTEs that were removed from the original request. Chairman Pollart: You're comfortable with the Senate putting the chaplains as full time and also comfortable with the putting back the 3 that we had taken out on the House side for 6 parole officers. So your motion is just FTEs ... taking out the OAR #38. Representative Wieland: That is correct. Senator Fischer: Seconded the Keeping in #4 and #7. --\u00b7-------------------------------------- , f!'age 6 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: April 17, 2007 Discussion on whether changes should be made since no decision on new prison ... DOCR still needing resources. Continued discussion regarding number of the beds in projects -not making much of a difference. Representative Wieland: Responded that remodeling or the new prison would not be completed for two years and the changes in staffing would not be necessary. This is one of the reasons why we need to look at a staffing plan. Refer: 31 :20 -33:49 Representative Metcalf: Stated they were looking at outside of the prison staffing. We are not able to provide the services that are necessary ... have eliminated supervision ... how do you have rehabilitation without supervision? Oppose motion. Chairman Pollart: Stated that we were not back to the Governor's proposed budget of the 6 parole officers that are currently in here. No need to go any further. Representative Metcalf: Disagree with you. How can we continue without social workers? Senator Krauter: Stated 50% come out on parole ... this is good stuff to do. We're policy branch of the government. Representative Metcalf: The Governor's budget reflects more on the budget itself and what is necessary to balance the budget out -not what is necessary to eliminate the problem. The Field Services Division asked for 40 officers. Refer: 39:50 Chairman Pollart: I remember the manager of the Fields Services Division advocating for the six which we are back to. Senator Krauter: This is good economics. Refer: House Human Resources Division Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: April 17, 2007 Motion passed. Representative Wieland: Motion to remove Paragraph 5 of Section 6, page 2, regarding DOCR paying for court ordered drug treatment assessments. This creates problems for the DOCR. Senator Grindberg: Seconded the motion. Senator Krauter: Asked for clarification of the sentences? Referred to second sentence - that the person pays. Representative Wieland: Probably true, if they have the money. Leann Bertsch, Director of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation: Stated this amendment was based on a pilot program that was in our budget last time. It never got funded based on a Federal grant. The paragraph 5 does not need to be in there. Do not have money for any treatment program or any assessment. We have the OHS, the regional Human Service Centers ... various drug centers around the state. She asked that this be removed. Refer: 46:00 Representative Metcalf: Reluctantly support that. Should have a study. Senator Krauter: Suggested removing just the first sentence ... to remove the whole thing just a blank ... leave it in gives the court a handle. Leann Bertsch stated the whole paragraph needs to be removed. Would be dipping into the budget ... when a court orders -it takes Adjournment. -------------- ----- 2007 HOUSE STANDING COMMITTEE MINUTES House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill No. HB 1015 ~ Check here for Conference Committee Hearing Date: April 18, 2007 Recorder Job Number: 6127 Committee Clerk Signature Minutes: Chairman Pollert opened the conference committee hearing on HB 1015. Record shows all conference committee members are here. Is there anything simple we can work on? Rep. Wieland: I was asked to get some space operational and staffing plan amendments -ready and I have prepared those. (see attached form). This is really more of a guide for the operation itself and that includes the staffing part of it. This is asking for on the state penitentiary and James River correctional center because they can be in the same document and the DOCR can do it themselves. Mr. Krabbenhoft was with me when we prepared this and so we went through this thing and they have no problem with doing this. We did set it up so it would be presented at the first budget section meeting after March 1. It does not require any additional funding and it is something they can do themselves. I would move to add this amendment to the DOCR 1050. Seconded By Senator Fischer. Discussion: Senator Grindberg: Is this including MRCC? Rep. Wieland: No it does not include MRCC at this particular time. In time it would if we -move MRCC it should be part of that plan. In its current site no. Keep in mind primarily because it is so small. It could if we wanted to add it into it we could do that. There is not a Page 2 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill No. HB 1015 Hearing Date: April 18, 2007 real large staff down there and you can keep tabs on it a lot better. When it becomes a part and it becomes a part of the penitentiary or right outside the penitentiary or how ever we decide it should be done, then it can be included. Senator Krauter: The plans should be based upon state penitentiary building projects authorized by the 60th Legislative Assembly and the current facilities had James River, why not the current facilities at MRCC, I don't understand that? Rep. Wieland: If MRCC were to remain we would add it it could be included. If you want to add it into the amendment I do not care. At this particular time we discussed the idea that MRCC would be moved and if they are going to be moved, after they are moved it should be included. But at this particular time ii kind of moot to do it because it is not a very big facility at this time. Motion Made By Rep. Wieland to further amend and add this into the 0508 and add the MRCC to the plan. Seconded By Senator Krauter. Discussion: Vote: 6 Yes 0 No 0 Absent Carried. Discussion on amendment: Senator Krauter: Give me an idea of what you mean by the words space operational and staffing? Rep. Wieland: I happen to have a space operational and staffing program up at the Cass County jail. This was done at the time we built our new facility and I know you are familiar with ii. As we went through this thing; the one we would have here probably would be done a little bit differently, but it has been reviewed and ii is a plan and inside of the plan there are just various aspects of the operation in terms of the staff and how and where they should be in Page 3 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill No. HB 1015 Hearing Date: April 18, 2007 terms of the operation. It deals with security and lots of other things. It is an outline of the operation of the facility. Chairman Pollart: Basically it is a policy handbook. Rep. Krauters: Can you should me where it talks about rehabilitation? Rep. Wieland: I can't in this one because we don't do rehabilitation in the Case County jail. Rep. Krauters: We need to have that. We need to have some structure relating to any type of rehabilitation particularly in staffing and operations. If we leave that void in there we are going down a wrong path to what we have been doing in the last three biennium's. I would like to further amend this so it says that the Department of Correction's Rehabilitations what prepare a staff operations and rehabilitation and staff plan. Seconded by Rep. Metcalf . Discussion: Rep. Wieland: Are you anticipating that there are some dollars attached to that? Chairman Pollart: No, you said that the department is going to be able to do this within their budget. Any other discussion? Senator Grindberg: I am not familiar with the Cass County report. Assuming that report is dated with staffing and population, I think we when the staffing report comes out it also compared to South Dakota or Midwestern border states so we would have something to benchmark against rather than just our own staff report. Here is what we think vs. a comparison. If that is covered in here I am fine. I am not sure it is. Rep. Wieland: No, this is only for the facility. This is not even a report; this is a plan that is not a report that compares this facility or our facility to Montana State or any other state. How many people does it take to operate a security area within that? That is a staffing plan. What you are talking about it a report that compares and that is different than what this is. Page 4 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill No. HB 1015 Hearing Date: April 18, 2007 Senator Fischer: When it says operational, does that include in a secure area, someone becomes ill what the procedure is for helping or removing them? When you did that one you would have looked at other plans from other institutions to come up with how that operation should be managed. Rep. Wieland: We have professional out there who have worked in that prison an awfully long time. They have a lot of knowledge. These plans should be written in cooperation with the people that are working there that know the function of the facility. Space is probably the floor plan and I don't need that. Want a booklet so that it would be complete for a new employee. Rep. Metcalfe: I guess this is basically goes back to my history if we are talking about the military. They prepared this thing continuously and they are called standard operating procedures and we had them for every unit where ever they happened to be. I think the rehabilitation was a good thing to add on to here and we should not expect a complete true plan at this time. It is going to be a plan that is going to be developed over the years. It is not going to take 6 years. It should be continuingly updated and ongoing. Senator Krauter: The department does have Standard Operating Procedures. If we would ask for a staffing plan and operating plan it is there. What Rep. Wieland is looking for here is we have to establish some assumptions; what are we assuming to be the inmate count on such and such a day to meet the staffing or operational needs of that. That is what I am hearing and we have not even talked about that. Chairman Pollart: I think now I am struggling and getting further and further in and I don't think that was the focus of the amendment, but I might be wrong about that.\\ Rep. Wieland: I would not have asked for this to be included here if one had been provided. did ask for one and was told they did not have that. I am only saying lets do what every body Page 5 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill No. HB 1015 Hearing Date: April 18, 2007 seems to know, but it is not written down. That is all this amendment does. I agree it is a fluid document and does not remain the same. You are gong to review it annually and keep it updated. Right now I don't see any document similar to this at the present time. Senator Grindberg: I am struggling with not having the data together. It would not take till March 2008 to do that. I think it is important to have regional and national comparisons to what we are doing. A comparison validates what we need to do and what we need to do for more support for field services. It is back to the rehabilitation issue so I am not sure as policy makers what additional information we are going to get. Unless we do some regional or statistically analysis with this it just seems that we could go that step and have a little more information. Chairman Pollert: We start to talk rehabilitation then you are getting into field services as well as a prison division and it is way overboard and those overlap and then you might as well add the whole DRCR budget and I am not making that a motion. Senator Krauter: right now we have a formula in our deficiency. Last session we had a deficiency; we have under funded them so when we start looking for a staffing plan which staffing plan do you want them to provide to you. The one that was appropriated or the one that was deficiency applied to it or the one was in the executive budget or the one they have asked for? Otherwise the department is gong to struggle on what report they need to prepare. Chairman Pollert: Other discussion. Vote: 3 Yes 3 No Motion failed to add rehabilitation. Anything else we want to discuss? Chairman Pollert: So now we have the plain amendment in front of us which is what is written plus the MRCC. Senator Grindberg made that motion, Seconded By Rep. Metcalf. Discussion: None Page6 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill No. HB 1015 Hearing Date: April 18, 2007 Roll: 6 Yes 0 No Amendment approved 508. 0 Absent Rep. Wieland: I you remember we talked about Senate Bill 2136, which was a bill to provide some training. We had a discussion on it where the DOCR would be training someone out of the State hospital. There was an estimated cost of about $120,000 in general funds which were not in the bill to pay for that. So I make a motion we add $120,000 of general funds to pay for that position in SB 2136. Chairman Pollert: I would ask legislative counsel if that is an accurate fiscal on that. Where did the number come from? Senator Krauter: It is $118,500; one FTE position. Operating of $6800. Rep. Wieland: I would make a correction on my motion to make it $18,500. Seconded by Senator Fischer. Motion for the one FTE, $111,650 salary; $6850 operating expense. Roll call: 6 Yes 0 No 0 Absent Carried. Rep. Wieland: We passed a bill that required the DOTR to put $100,000 in general funds into a fund to pay for community supervision and service. That is SB 2243. Again that was a bill that required the DOCR to do something, but there was no funding in there for it. Chairman Pollert: Legislative Counsel can you give me a draft of 2243 so we have something to look at it. Rep Wieland: When 2243 original came before appropriations committee it asked for $380,000. The DOCR had been in the past funding that, but in the last year or so had not been doing that so that was the reason the bill came forward. We had a subcommittee that looked into increasing the fines and fees for the felon to $50 and there were about 5,000 of these cases the Supreme Court estimated that only half of them would probably pay so we Page 7 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill No. HB 1015 Hearing Date: April 18, 2007 took 2500 of these and that would have been over a two year time frame and raised $125,000 at $50 each. Then we made a statement for legislative intent that required the DOCR to add an additional $100,000 so there would be $225,000 that could be used for community supervision and it would be put into a fund and the participating counties and cities would participate of $1 for every $2 they would get back and that is the basis for the bill and the $100,000 was not funded for the DOCR. Chairman Polle rt: We will wait until we get the copies of the bill so we have something to look at so you have a chance to read it. Recess . 2007 HOUSE STANDING COMMITTEE MINUTES House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill No. HB 1015 ~ Check here for Conference Committee Hearing Date: April 19, 2007 Recorder Job called the conference committee on HB 1015 to order. All the conference committee members are present. Chairman Pollert: What we handed out is in the amendments which the senate put in on the house side. On the house side we had reduced the extra ordinary repairs by $667,500 and the Senate side had restored them. We were asking if you knew what the $667,500 was? Sen. Krauter: We were restoring the Governor's request, who cares. There were no numbers thrown around. Chairman Pollert: Do you know what specific items were in the $660,500? Senator Krauters: Extra ordinary repairs listed by the department. Rep. Wieland: Under MRCC that range and foot have been replaced so we don't need to even include that anymore. Chairman Pollert: We are bringing this forward is that some of the discussion deals with $440,000 that deals with the state pen that would deal with construction. If we did some construction; there is about $450,000 or less maybe, that wouldn't have to be in the $667,500 -list. That is why we are brining that out. We are not asking for any action on it. As an example, the $385,000 is a ramp and an elevator to the administrative building for ADA Page 2 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill No. HB 1015 Hearing Date: April 19, 2007 reasons. If we decide to construction something, whether it is two or four years from now, we would think why would be spend $380,000 that we might tear down. Same thing with the energy audit; why would we do the energy audit for $15,000 if we might do some construction so that is why we just handed out the list. Went over the list. It is more for discussion purposes so you have it for the future. Senator Krauter: You are saying the MICC; the road and parking lot maintenance for $13,000 has been completed? Chairman Pollert: No, just the range hood replacement had. When we first talked about moving the MRCC; that is why the road and parking lot maintenance for $13,000 was pulled off as well. Some of these things we should not fund if we talk about construction. Did everyone get a copy of Senate Bill 2243? Did you want to go through that Rep. Wieland? Rep. Wieland: The final bill with these amendments were adopted and approved by conference committee about a week or so. It covers two issues: sentence fee of $50 and it would be 50% collectible and should provide $125,000 and $100,000 from the DOCR giving the total of $225,000. Would be made available case per case basis and require local match of $1 per each $2 provided by the department. I have made a motion to add the $100,000 to pay for that in this budget. Seconded by Senator Grindberg. Discussion: Senator Krauter: So the appropriation that is in this bill of $125,000 this is in addition of this to make it up to $225,000. Rep. Wieland: There is a total of $225,000 in the supervision over the biennium. We are asking for the $100,000. The other is coming in from the miscellaneous . Vote: 6 Yes 0 No 0 Absent Carried. 2007 HOUSE STANDING COMMITTEE MINUTES House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill No. HB 1015 ~ Check here for Conference Committee Hearing Date: April 21, 2007 Recorder Job Number: 6241 !CommitteeClerkSignature/4, \u00a3~ ~Z,_t:,,J Minutes: committee hearing on HB 1015. All members are present. Rep. Metcalf: I have a need for field services. We have to have all the FTE's in there we can -get. Motion Made by Rep. Metcalf to add $250,000 into Human Services for use in supervision and this money me authorized to spend if they can find it within their budget. Seconded by Senator Krauter. Discussion: Rep. Metcalf: I think these field service people need the additional help that they can possibly get. This would give them off duty police officers, whoever they can find who are legally certified to use as supervise people out on parole and probation to help keep them out of prison. I am talking part time people and they estimate they can bring part time people in with a salary of about $17/-$18.50/hour. They could bring in less than 3 part time people. That is the purpose of ii. We are only contributing to their social security. There are no retirement funds or anything like that built in here. -Chairman Pollert: Do they have part time or temporary salaries in their field services division already that they could have excess to now? Page 2 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill No. HB 1015 Hearing Date: April 21, 2007 Rep. Metcalf: Mainly they don't have enough. We are definitely short in that particular area. They show they have about 120 probationers per officer and basically the thought is there that it should be in the 60-70 range or in that area somewhere. So they are definitely overworked. If they can see one of these people once in four weeks is not near enough that it really basically a waste of time and money for doing any of it. Senator Krauter: I just need some clarification from Rep. Metcalf the funding of the $250,000? Rep. Metcalf: The funding would be it they could find it within their supervision and budget they have right? Senator Krauter: I am curious if the committee things by reducing the caseload of a correctional officer in field services is good or bad? Chairman Pollart: Over the years we have learned that there is really no standard because every person out there is at a different level of the severity of the crime or punishment. So it is hard to say the caseloads would all be the same. When you look at it, if we can do anything we can to reduce that number of caseloads so that correctional officer can work on each individual case more often that would be positive. Senator Krauter: How do you determine the caseload of any one when doing a plan for employees, how would you determine what any one caseload should be? That where the department should make a management plan and all that as detailed that way. I road around with a field person in a car and we went around and did about 10 visits and caught 3 people during that time. Hard to work with this people so it is not an easy thing to work with these people . Chairman Pollert: Dave please come forward. This sheet shows the offenders on community supervision. If you remember Rep. Metcalf that is where we had our discussions as far as the Page 3 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill No. HB 1015 Hearing Date: April 21, 2007 number of FTE or patrol probation officers. In 05 you had 4923 supervision types and this sheet shows 47.75 FTE's so we took that and divided it down to so it 103.1 caseloads average per patrol probation officers and in 06 it went to 5344 on the 47.75 so then I went and figured out after they took out the 3 on the house side and I used that 5344 and show it being divided by 53.78 and the number of patrol officers. Is that a correct number? This is adding 6 new FTE's. Senator Krauter: As you built this budget and presented it to the governor and as he made his recommendations is my thought process different their theirs? Discussing need to be seeing the clients more frequently. LeAnn: No you are not wrong. More employees' means more assistance out in the field and that should help see people more and assist them better. Rep. Metcalf: You referred to the 2006 level of with the patrol officers that we have it brings it back to the 2005-06 level. I accept that but it does not make it the right amount of people that we need. We have a decision to make here. Do we want our parolees supervised that we have a better chance to ensure they will not return to prison. How do we know we have the right number? We are only seeing the most severe cases and hoping they will not re offend. I think it is what needs to be done and I would hope that we can approve this amendment. Chairman Pollart: Let us look at this chart. 5344 in 2006 we had 112 probation officers; with the 53 patrol probation officers that comes out to 100.8. In 2003 that number was 101.7 so with the 53 that are currently in the budget that is 108 per and 2003 was 101.7 so we would actually be there. Rep. Metcalf: I understand what you are trying to do; justify this by numbers. By people coming out of our prisons into the civilian world. I don't care about numbers, but I do care about what is happening to these people. If they get back into prison it is going to cost us Page 4 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill No. HB 1015 Hearing Date: April 21, 2007 more money. The people that have studies this know that if we have more supervision there is a better chance that those people will not offend again. Senator Krauter: For your numbers, based upon the information that was given to us, as those caseloads increase over 9% annually we will be up to 5,264 divided by the case workers we are 129. This is just keeping to go like that. Vote: 5 Yes 1 No 0 Absent Carried Discussions: Rep. Wieland: Motion to remove the 8 items that total $440,200 from the one time repairs for the penitentiary and MRCT. Energy audit #32 for $15,000; ABA Excess #41 $385,000; and cooling cooling tower #31 $10,000; hood at MRCC $2200 and the road for $13,000 that is done. Whatever that totals; should be $440,200. That would leave $227,300 in the one time in deferred maintenance. Seconded by Senator Grindberg. Discussion: None Vote: 5 Yes 1 No 0 Absent Carried Senator Wieland: Motion to remove the funding for 20 beds for transitional care which had a cost in it of $448,950. OAR65. Seconded By Rep. Poller!. Discussion: Chairman Pollart: It just shows as an OAR65 on this sheet. Senator Krauter: Why are we removing them. Are we anticipating not having any growth in transitional? We have already added $28 million a 28% increase in this budget. It was a motion to try and get this budget balanced. Page 5 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill No. HB 1015 Hearing Date: April 21, 2007 Chairman Pollert: In the OCR budget there is not a rehabilitation or treatment program that the house side reduced in 1015. In that there is 40 transition beds that are in the budget; we did not touch that. We went by what the DOCR came in. Senator Krauter: How do you explain the inconsistency of taking an OAR that is way in the bottom of the list and adding money to faith based programming? I am talking about the bottom of page 2 and this is on the bottom of page 5. We have to have flexibility out there so that as we transition people into community out of parole or probation, which ever one, that the department has those beds available.

Chet Pollert, Chairman, opened the Conference Committee hearing on HB 1015, a Bill for an Act to provide an appropriation for defraying the expenses of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation; and to amend and reenact Subsection 1 of Section 12-65-08 of the North Dakota Century Code, relating to fees for the interstate transfer or travel of probationers. Rep. Chet Pollert, Chairman noted that all present: Representatives Wieland and Metcalf and Senators Fischer, Grindberg, and Krauter. Rep. Chet Pollert, Chairman, asked for any discussion. Senator Grindberg: Made a motion amendment .0509 be adopted with a revision on Section 14 -transfer of land fund ... insert $41 million Instead of $57 million. In Section 15, a quarter of million dollars to the Legislative Council for prison facility ... preliminary design development Senator Fischer: Seconded Page 2 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: April 21, 2007 Senator Krauter: Stated there were currently four line items within the DOCR. You have your Field Services and Prisons Division. Would like to have those combined as basically Adult Services. The third and fourth line is Juvenile Community Services. The fifth line is the Youth Correctional Center. Would like to have that combined as one line so that we have basically two areas of operating within the department. You have your \"Adult Services\" and then you have \"Youth Services.\" The reason for this is that then gives the department some flexibility. You talk about Prisons and Field Services -it is all adult. Continued explanation. Motion to combine those four llne items into two line items. Refer: 03:40 Senator Grindberg: Seconded the motion. Representative Wieland: No problem with the amendment but would like to put a sunset on that for 2 years to see if it works . Senator Krauter: I will further amend to put a \"Sunset\" on it. Senator Grindberg: Agreed. Chairman Pollart: Next time, will we still be able to segregate it out between the Field Services division and the Prison Division? Senator Krauter: I don't any problem with it. It's coded that way. This gives them the flexibility and tools in management. Roll Call Vote: Another amendment to give DOCR the flexibility ... concern is to reduce recidivism ... the whole issue of our caseload is pretty strong to me ... need to give them the opportunity to get these caseload numbers down. Next session, we should be able to go and track it. Would llke to increase the adult services llne to 5 FTEs for $465,550. Those . Page 3 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: April 21, 2007 dollars to be used for the intention of bringing the caseloads down. Presently, temporary FTEs at JRCC and this will help to get through some of the issues. Medical situations at JRCC, the transition goes back to Corrections because of the cost of those situations. Increase of $100,000 in the transitional medical care. Total $565,550. Intent for two In adult services. Representative Metcalf: Seconded Grindberg: Can we wrap it up ... do we need a grand motion? Chairman Pollart: Unless there are so more amendments? Representative Wieland: We can make a motion. Chairman Pollert: It's the Senate's bill. Discussion on the procedure. Senator Grindberg: Made a motion the Senate recede from the amendments and amend. Senator Fischer: Seconded the HOUSE STANDING COMMITTEE MINUTES Bill/Resolution No. HB 1015 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division [] Check here for Conference Committee Hearing Date: April 24, 2007 Recorder Job Number: 6319 II Committee Clerk Signature Minutes: Rep. Chet Pollart, Chairman, opened the Conference Committee hearing on HB 1015, a Bill for an Act to provide an appropriation for defraying the expenses of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation; and to amend and reenact Subsection 1 of Section 12-65-08 of -the North Dakota Century Code, relating to fees for the interstate transfer or travel of probationers. Rep. Chet Pollart, Chairman noted that all present: Representatives Wieland and Metcalf and Senators Fischer, Grindberg, and Krauter. Rep. Chet Pollart, Chairman: We have amendments. Senator Grindberg: Reviewed amendments .0512 and referred to page 3. Originally, the Senate had put some language into Senate Bill 2260 which has navigated to HB 1015, which talks about the facility review committee and membership duties and recommendations. Noted on Item 1, under Section 10, first paragraph ... words are new. Referred to \"correctional facility review committee to address the immediate and future needs of the state penitentiary\" ... the new words are ''to address the immediate.\" So, that it was clear that the immediate -needs were part of this process. Continuing on page 4, the language adopted in conference committee that failed on the floor changed. Continued with the changes. Page 2 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: April 24, 2007 Refer: 02:00 -04:35 Senator Grindberg: Made a motion to move Amendment .0512. Senator Fischer: Seconded the motion. Senator Krauter: Questions on Page 5, Section 19 -Emergency, what is 11? Representative Wieland: Section 11 makes reference to some money. Explanation. Senator Krauter: The way I understand this study now. The $41 million dollars that is set aside here would be then available upon the budget section finally approving an Emergency Commission recommendation. Is that the way it is intended? Senator Grindberg: The 41 million in the State Penitentiary Land Fund would be available to be used for one of these three projects -once the committee of six makes a recommendation to the Emergency Commission which makes a recommendation to the Budget Section. And the Budget Section approves it. What if one of those three plans exceeds 41 million dollars? That is an excellent question. I would envision that whatever the plan that would come out of either three options would be a phased approach where, if it is was a new facility offsite or onsite, clearly it's going to be more than 41 million. The hypothesis would be work around a budget of $41 million dollars and to start that new option ... continued to be an issue. Refer: 07:16 -07:33 Senator Krauter: Question of Item number 7 on page 4 ... time line. To make this process happen quicker -shouldn't we have that date of March 1, 2008 -to move it up so that we aren't setting ourselves too far down the construction type of season in 2008? Senator Grindberg: Can look at two different ways. Intent of Emergency Clause is to get started right away . Page 3 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: April 24, 2007 Representative Wieland: It says before June 1, I would agree with you. I would hope the committee would take action sooner than June 1. With the help of having the Emergency Clause in there, that does afford an opportunity. Senator Krauter: No need to change? Senator Grlndberg: June 1st would give us 6 months. Suggest we leave as drafted. Senator Krauter: On Page 4, Item 5, questioned number of inmates. It locks us in to presumed assumption that the male inmate population would be 900 -1000 ... a defined number of beds. Senator Grind berg: Do not know the exact origin of the 900 or 1000. Not necessarily locked into 900 or 1000. It is just as a concept -based on a population. If the recommendation came back and the cost benefit said 1100, that route could be chosen . Representative Wieland: The options for expansion ... beyond that. We chose the 900 range because of a pod could be somewhere in the neighborhood of 88 ... 1 O pods or bigger pods. Continued explanation on pod sizes. Refer: 13:07 -13:50 Chairman Polle rt: Wasn't one of the around 950 -960 beds ... on the original plan? Senator Krauter: Referred to the language \"must be based upon the population between 900-1000 inmates. Locked in -pretty tight. Senator Grlndberg: Doesn't mean that the committee couldn't say what the options are at 500 -600 -1200 as well. It just says \"at a minimum, it must have 900-1000.\" Senator Krauter: Made a motion to strike that Section b on page 4. Senator Grlndberg: Requested that the committee act on the motion and then further amend. Chairman Pollart: Walt with the motion. Page 4 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Bill/Resolution No. 1015 Hearing Date: April 24, 2007 Roll Call Vote on Amendment on .0512: Chairman Pollert-yes, Rep. Wieland Grindberg -yes, Sen. Krauter -no. Motion passed 5 to 1. Senator Krauter: Move that we further amend so that it says \"be based upon a housing population of approximately 900-1000 inmates.\" Pretty tight there. Senator Grlndberg: Seconded the motion. Pollert: Any Krauter -yes. Senator Krauter: Ask intent of amendments. This committee will be organized and be given the charge of analyzing these three types of options and it says \"We shall forward three concepts along with a recommendation for one of the three concepts to the Emergency Commission.\" So, with these amendments, there will be construction of a facility during the biennium. Is that correct? Senator Grindberg: I would answer it this way. It is pretty clear that the intent is to move forward on one of the options, but the possibility certainly does still exist that nothing could happen. Because the Emergency Commission could say no and the Budget Section. Chairman Pollert: Have to this make this official? Senator Grindberg: Already have voted.

Bertsch, Director Presenting Testimony Concerning: HOUSE BILL 1015 The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (DOCR) is committed to public safety, staff safety, and the safe, secure and humane supervision of offenders who are committed to it care and custody. Our staff of nearly 700 dedicated men and women, representing a broad range of professional disciplines, takes great pride in the performance of its duties and the protection of the public. In North Dakota, very few inmates die in prison and so almost every one of them will eventually return to a local community. An important question revolves around how that offender will behave once he or she returns. In an ideal world we would have unlimited resources and provide every conceivable resource to each offender given to us. When reality shows its face we realize the importance of an offender management plan. We understand the need to place each offender in the least restrictive environment -an environment that is safe and cost effective. We must have a strategy that helps reduce risk and manage that risk we can't reduce. The Department utilizes a re-entry model, the Transition From Prison To Community Initiative (TPCI}, a national re-entry initiative spearheaded by the National Institute of Corrections (NIC). TPCI is a way of doing business that emphasizes the use of evidence-based practices in the way we interact with offenders as well as our management practices. It is reflected in our Offender Management Plan. It also emphasizes the need for collaboration with our partners to achieve the results we need to be successful. Under this model, the DOCR strives from the first day of incarceration, to prepare offenders for successful reintegration into the community. Recognizing that more than 97% of offenders will return to the community after a period of incarceration, the goal is to enhance public safety by reducing recidivism. The Offender Management Plan is crucial in this regard as each phase builds toward re-entry and successful community adjustment. The department has very little control over the numbers of offenders the courts send to us. We manage what is given to us and try to reduce the numbers by using effective, evidence- based practices. The diagram and chart depict the re\u00ad entry model the DOCR utilizes and upon which the offender management plan and budget is built. Institutional Phase The diagram illustrates the progression of offenders through the DOCR system, beginning with the admissions process within the Prisons Division. Orientation/Classification: We received 1100 new arrivals into the prison system in calendar year 2005, and each one of them spends their first 30 days in an orientation program. During orientation, inmates receive a battery of assessment tests to identify the problem areas (risk domains) that must be addressed if they are to stay out of prison in the future. Some of these risk domains we assess include problems with chemical addiction, poor education, lack of work skills, anger problems, mental health issues, family problems, and financial problems. Development of Case Plan: Once an offender's needs and risks are identified, a case plan is developed for each offender, outlining the type of programs the staff recommend he participate in during his prison sentence that will most greatly reduce his risk of re-offending . Our goal is to try to have the inmate completed with these programs at about the halfway point in his sentence, so we can get him in front of the Parole Board, and hopefully have him safely transitioned back into the community. Risk Reduction -Programs & Treatment -Addiction Treatment: Between 80 and 85% of our offenders have a serious problem with alcohol and drug abuse, with the drug of choice being methamphetamine. elapsed while on community supervision. -Sex Offender Treatment: Approximately 16% of our inmates that have a history of committing sex offenses. These offenders are screened and assessed for the type of sex offender therapy they require. Intensive Sex Offender Group Low-intensity Sex Offender Group. Sex Offender Anonymous Individual therapy for special needs sex offenders (those who cannot function in a group setting due to behavioral, mental health, or intellectual deficiencies). -Mental Health Treatment: Approximately 37% of the inmate population have an Axis 1 mental illness diagnosis, and require psychotropic medication for daily functioning. Individual counseling with mental health professionals. Special Assistance Unit at the JRCC, a 24-bed mental health unit designed to help the inmate through the crisis, and get stabilized back on the prescribed medication. Special Needs Mental Health group. -Anger Management: Nearly 21 % of the new arrivals are incarcerated for a violent crime, and most of these are assessed as needing some form of anger management therapy . Anger Management Intensive Anger Management Administrative Segregation Anger Management pre-group, for those inmates locked in our most secure unit. Alternatives to Violence class, which takes place over 6 weekends annually and is led by volunteers. -Religious Services. -Education. -Vocation Inmates leaving prison without job skills or vocational training are at a high risk to return. Restaurant Management Class Auto Mechanics program at the MRCC. Rough Rider Industries is an excellent program we offer at all three facilities that can help teach inmates a trade in woodworking, silk screening, upholstery, cut and sew operations, and welding, but there are only enough Industry jobs for about 20% of the male population . Work release program Starting a new HVAC program through BSC Re-entry phase or Transition: The re-entry process is a critical component in helping an offender successfully transition back into their community. Proper transitioning reduces the risk that offenders will commit new crimes. Effective transition programming is a \"pre\u00ad requisite\" for the Parole Board to authorize the release of an offender to parole. It is also cost effective. The Division of Field Services manages that transition by consolidating treatment gains the offender has made during his or her period of incarceration, providing linkages to community-based services, and placing the offender into appropriate community release programs. These transition programs include: Tompkins Rehabilitation and Corrections Center (TRCC): 1 Bismarck Transition Center (BTC): Centre Halfway House Program: Centre Quarter-way House Program: Female Transition Program: Parole Relapse: North Central Corrections & Rehabilitation Center (NCCRC -Rugby). As the diagram depicts, offenders may be sentenced directly to probation supervision by the DOCR Just as in the institutional phase, assessments are done to determine the risk and needs of the probationer to determine the most effective supervision strategy . Assessment Center: The Assessment Center opened in June 2006. This allows the Department to place an offender in the Assessment center for up to 30 days to evaluate the most appropriate placement for that offender, whether it be a residential treatment program, return to court for revocation & perhaps incarceration, return to a community-based treatment program, etc. Just as is done if an offender enters the correctional system through the prison system, a case plan is developed for each offender. Case Planning is the \"roadmap\" that guides the corrections system as the offender moves through the correctional continuum. This re-entry case plan not only insures that each offender is managed and transitioned in a manner that is most effective for that offender but also that correctional resources are aligned where and when offenders most require them . Risk Reduction -Program Treatment: The DOCR Field Services Division insures that a continuum of expectations are presented to the offender for the entire period of supervision. Support for reintegration is provided through a number of programs. Risk Management: Just as in the institutional phase, risk that cannot be reduced is managed. Each piece of this Offender Management Plan is critical and interdependent and is designed as a systemic approach to ensuring that the DOCR meets its goals of public safety, staff safety and maintaining safe, secure and humane supervision of offenders both in the facilities and the community.

NDSP Building Project 28 To: Members of House Appropriations Human Resources Sub Committee From: Tim Schuetzle, Prisons Division Director (V/~:..r~~~ Date: 1/24/2007 Re: Answers to Committee Questions During my testimony to you on January 10, 2007 you requested the following additional information. 1) Lists of acronyms commonly used by the DOCR in their daily operations. See attachment #1 2) What is the projected growth of the female population, and is there a certain age group that is contributing to this growth? Dave Krabbenhoff has a sheet he will present to the committee that shows the projected population growth for both male and female inmates for the next 1 0 years. The age group of most female offenders coming into prison is the 24 to 29 year olds. The age group that represents the highest number of new arrivals for the male prisoners is the 18 to 25 year old range. The average age of female offenders entering the system was 29, and the average age of male offenders was also 29, but these averages are skewed by some older than average inmate arrivals in bot.h categories. 3) Statistical data related to recidivism and methamphetamine treatment for females and males, as well as other statistical data on recidivism and treatment. It's not possible for us to identify the recidivism rate specifically for meth users, as most addicted inmates in treatment are addicted to many type of substances, not just meth. We do not collect data specifically on meth users versus alcohol users. The recidivism rate for all our offenders for 2004 was 22%. The calculations are not yet completed for 2005. 4) Has the additional treatment staff approved by the last legislature had any positive effect on the recidivism rate? --, 1 January 24, 2007 It is too early to determine if the additional counselors we added this biennium has had any impact on our recidivism rate. The definition of recidivism is the percentage of inmates that return to prison on a new crime before 3 years have passed from their release date. Therefore, any recidivism reduction from these additional staff likely won't be known for at least 5 years. However, I can say that the additional staff {when we have been able to retain them) have helped by increasing the number of inmates that have an opportunity to attend treatment during their incarceration. 5) Where did the treatment staff (particularly sex offender counselors) that left employment with the DOCR go? In state? Out of state? See attachment #2 6) Do we have any data or information relating to staff turnover in regards to new facilities (new construction). Do new/modern facilities have any direct affect on staff turnover? I researched the National Institute of Corrections Library about this topic, and there have been no studies that address this issue. My personal and professional opinion is that a new prison or new work environment would have no impact on staff turnover rates. In exit interviews that I have completed with staff, not one has ever mentioned that they are leaving their job at the prison because they didn't like working in the older buildings. The vast majority said the reason for leaving is better pay at their new job. A few mentioned that \"they did not like being around inmates\" as a reason for leaving employment, but those feelings would exist in both a new, or old facility. 7) What is the county jail correctional officer pay rates around the state as compared to the pay of our correctional staff? See attachment #3. 8) Can we show that the one million dollars approved for equity pay last legislature strictly for correctional officers go to that targeted group? Yes. Dave Krabbenhoft has this information, and can share it with the committee. 2 January 24, 2007 9) What are the turnover rates for correctional staff in the bordering states (Minnesota, South Dakota, Montana, etc)? We are still waiting for this information from Minnesota and Montana. The South Dakota DOC reported a turnover rate in 2006 of 22%. This is very similar to ours, when we add the full lime and temporary officers together. South Dakota pay for starting Correctional Officers is lower than ours, but they commented that they give a large pay increase at the employees 2 year anniversary date, and usually, if they keep the staff the first two years, they will keep them for their entire career. 10) How long has the existing staff filling the six temporary positions (in the executive budget) been with the DOCR? From pages 5 and 6 of my testimony, both of the chaplains have more than 4 years experience. The employee filling the full time temporary administrative assistant in the treatment department has been with the department for 6 months, but this has been a temporary position for 6 years. The other .25 administrative assistant has been employed for over a year, but this also has been a temporary position for over 6 years. The half time temporary Office Assistant I in the medical department had been filled for over 14 years by the same employee, but she left this fall because we could not get her full benefits. Her replacement has been with us for about 5 months. The full time Office Assistant 111 has been a temporary position for about 20 months, and has been filled by the same employee during this time frame. The RN temporary position was hired about 18 months ago, and the same employee has been in that position since it became open, and the .25 Instructor position has been a temporary position for 6 years, and it has been filled by an employee who has been with us for 14 years. 11) Why the RN Nurse position request for medical Is not an LPN level position? We already have two LPN positions among the 7 nurses at NDSP/MRCC, which comes to a little over one nurse per shift. LPN nurses must be supervised by an RN, which is a difficult requirement to meet when there is usually only one nurse on shift at a time. Since LPN's cannot work a shift by themselves, an RN is requested to allow us more flexibility in scheduling. 3 January 24, 2007 12) Can we get a full budget breakdown for DWCRC? Dave K. is going to present this when you get into this part of the budget detail. 13) Why was the request for renovation in the last biennium $29 million, but the request this biennium is $42 million? The original request was computed using 2004 construction costs, and did not include 125 more beds that was added to the plan during the interim session. 14) Are bonding payments still due on any of our current buildings? Dave K. is covering this with you. 15) What is the inmate population projections for 10 years, 15 years and if possible, 20 years? Dave Krabbenhoft has a spreadsheet where we projected the male and female populations through 2017 (ten years). Data accuracy further out than ten years becomes suspect. 16) What is the breakdown of the $31 million in capital improvements at the NDSP and MRCC that were spent over the last 20 years? See Attachment #4 17) What is the breakdown of the same capital improvements completed at JRCC since the opening of that DOCR facility? See attachment #5 4 January 24, 2007 18) What is the posted salary range for the RN level nurses at NDSP and JRCC? We're advertising for an RN II position at JRCC, which is a grade 11 position with a salary grade range of $2557 to $3409/month. The posted salary range starts at $2800/month, and we area also offering a $1400.00 sign on bonus. 19)The history of all the FfE's attached to the Central Office since 1998, what was requested, when they were requested and when they were granted. Dave Krabbenhoff will present this information to you when he discusses the Central Office detail. 20) What are the projected repair expenses for the 3 prisons through 2017?

Memorandum To: Prison Division File From: Michael Froemke, Dir. Treatment Dept. Date: January 16th, 2007 Re: Response to Legislative Committee The question that I was assigned to answer concerned the treatment staff that had left employment and if known the reasons for their departure. The focus is on the LAC and the Sex Offender HRC positions. Substance programs: 1) Of the most recent three Licensed Addiction Counselor that left employment: Two left for more money and one left due to disabilities. Of the two that left for more money one went to work in state for Human Service Center and one left state to work at a public funded treatment center. 2) We also lost one Licensed Social Worker recently that worked in the Substance Abuse program to the ND State Hospital for more money. 3) When we look what has happened since 2005 we have lost 7 LA Cs. Four out of the 7 left for higher paying jobs. Two took positions with the Dept. of Human Services. One left the state. And one took a position with a private treatment facility for considerably more money. One left due to disability issues. One was let go for performance issues. One went back to college to complete a graduate degree. She indicated that she wanted to earn more money in her career. Sex Offender Programs: 1) Of the three Human Relations Counselors that left the Sex Offender program: Two of the three left for more money. The third was let go for performance issues. One of the two that left went to work at a Human Service Center while the other left because of a career changing opportunity . 1 January 18, 2007 In Summary: With the Licensed Addiction Counselors about 57% leave for more money and in those cases 50% leave for more money with a position at a Human Service Center. With the Sex Offender Counselors 2/3 leave for more money and out of that number 50% leave for more pay with a Human Service Center. 2 SALARY SURVEY 2007 EMPLOYER Dakota Womens CC(New England) Bismarck Transition Center Barnes County NDSP and JRCC Stutsman County Southwest County(Dickinson) Cass County Grand was based on a 173.3 hour work month as the state requires. #.3, Capitol Projects Prisons Division 1982-2003 Warden and D.

This valuation premise or assuming that the\u00b7 subject property is encumbered with the proposed riverbank stabilization easement in place is a \"hypothetical condition\", or by USPAP \u00b7definition: \"that which is contrary to what exists but is supposed for the purpose of analysis. This hypothetical condition is clearly required for purposes of reasonable analysis within the appraisal's objective(s) and intended use. Use of this hypothetjcal condition still results in a credible analysis. The appraisal's intended use is to \"aid the 2005 Legislative Assembly in considering the future use of the property. The appraisal is not intended for any other use or user. The description of the subject property, the data and detailed analyses of all factors pertinent to the appraisal's specific objective, and all definitions, assumptions, and limiting conditions are presented in the enclosed appraisal report. In particular, your attention is directed to the following important limiting conditions: 1. This letter of transmittal does\u00b7 not represent the fully documented appraisal of the subject real estate. Sole reliance on the contents of this letter without considering the entire contents of the appraisal report (starts with this letter of transmittal and concludes with page 53) could lead to erroneous conclusions. Therefore, this letter must not be used in place of nor represented as the complete appraisal report. 2. The appraisal was prepared according to the 2005 edition of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) adopted by the Appraisal Standards Board of the Appraisal Foundation and the Appraisal lnstitute's Code of Professional Ethics and Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, 3. In the absence of a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, the appraisal was developed assuming that no environmental hazards exist and that the subject property is \"environmentally clean with respect to all federal, state, and local laws. The appraisal inspection revealed no environmental concerns. A complete environmental s1te assessment should be secured in the event that more detailed and accurate information is needed concerning the property's environmental status. The appraisal is subject to revision by and at the discretion of the undersigned in the event that pertinent environmental information is disclosed indicating that such a revision is warranted. I I I I Mr. Dennis Fracassi -2- Febnuary 28, 2005 4. No responsibility is assumed for matters which are legal in nature nor is any opinion rendered on the property's title. Fee simple ownership is implied which assumes that the property would have marketable title. Also, all infonmation relative to the proposed penmanent easement was supplied by the client. This appraisal and its results are based on the supply of materials' accuracy and reliability. 5. The subject property is improved with the Missouri River Correctional Center. The improvements were considered in the following appraisal but it was concluded that they have no contributory value. Also, the equipment and any other personal property used in the operation of the Missouri River Correctional Center are specifically excluded. 6. The appraisal assignment is made based on an impartial or unbiased perspective; it is not made for the purpose of favoring a specific cause of any particular party. The undersigned has no present or contemplated Mure interest in the real estate that is the subject of this analysis and all opinions were developed through the course of accepted analytical procedures. Therefore, neither the employment to make the analysis nor the compensation is contingent on the outcome of the analysis. 7. 8. The subject property's concluded market values are based on a reasonable exposure time (the time needed to market the subject property preceding the appraisal's effective date) of one year. The market value is a nominal or gross value; no adjustment has been made for carrying costs or the time value of money which may be incurred over time if the real estate is marketed. \u00b7 , The assistance of Mr. Wade A. Becker, an employee of Dakota Appraisal & Consulting, LTD, and an Apprentice Real Estate Appraiser _in the State of North Dakota, must be acknowledged in completing this appraisal. Mr. Becker was present during the inspection, assisted in gathering the information about the subject property and area market, assembled and verified portions of the sale data infonmation, and provided input into the valuation process. However, the undersigned inspected the subject property, is the appraisal's author, and assumes full responsibility of the enclosed appraisal report. Careful consideration has been made to the valuation methods employed and to an accurate analysis of. the subject property and its related market. Based on the results of the appraisal investigation and analysis, it is my opinion that the subject property's appropriate fee simple values, as of Febnuary 2, 2005, are: Objective #1: Objective #2: As-ls Market Value or without the Riverbank Stabilization Easement: 785 \u00b1 net usable acres x $10,000/acre = Market Value with Pennanent Riverbank Stabilization Easement: \u00b7 727.50 \u00b1 net usable acres x $2,500/acre = $7,850,000 $1,818,750 It has been a privilege to be of service.

State Penitentiary Land Part of Section 2, Township 138N, Range 80W City of Bismarck, Burleigh County, ND Owner: State of North Dakota Dear Mr. Frohlich: This Summary Appraisal Raport was prepared in accordan~ with your request to develop \"A complete appraisal of approximately 80 acres, more or less of state property, including the site of the North Dakota State Penitentiary, to determine As-ls Market Value. It was also verbally instructed that the building improvements (North Dakota State Penitentiary) be disregarded. The appraisal objective is then to develop an opinion of only underlying land's market value. Disregarding the existing improvements is then based on a \"hypothetical condition\" or by the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) definition: \"that which is contrary to what exists but is supposed for the purpose of analysis. This hypothetical condition is clearly required for purposes of reasonable analysis in the appraisal's objective(s) and intended use. The use of this hypothetical condition would not affect the assignment results, and therefore, still results in a credible analysis. The appraisal's intended use is to assist you and the State Legislature in determining the State's equity position as it relates to the feasibility of developing a new state penitentiary. The appraisal is not intended for any other use or user. The subject property's description, the data and detailed analyses of all factors pertinent to the appraisal objective, and fill definitions, assumptions, and limiting conditions are summarized in the following report. In particular, your attention is directed to the following important limiting conditions: 1. This letter of transmittal does not represent the fully documented appraisal of the subject real estate.

The appraisal was prepared to conform to the Appraisal lnstitute's Code of Professional Ethics and Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice and the most recent edition of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) adopted by the Appraisal Standards Board of the Appraisal Foundation Compliance to the reporting requirements set forth under Standards Rule 2-2(b) of USPAP was intended in completing this summary appraisal report. As such, supporting documentation concerning the data, reasoning, and analyses that were used in the appraisal process to develop the opinion of market value is an integral part of the appraisal and is incorporated into the analysis through reference. The appraisal report's depth of discussion is specific to your needs and to your intended use of the appraisal. 3. The appraisal was developed assuming that no environment hazards exist and that the subject parcel is \"environmentally clean\" with respect to all federal, state, and local laws. The appraisal is subject to revision by and at the discretion of the undersigned in the event that pertinent environment information is disclosed indicating that such a revision is warranted. All other assumptions are detailed in the appraisal report. 4. The appraisal assignment is made based on an impartial or unbiased perspective; it is not made for the purpose of favoring a specific cause of any particular party. The undersigned have no present or contemplated future interest in the real estate that is the subject of this analysis and all opinions were developed through the course of accepted analytical procedures. Therefore, neither the employment to make the analysis nor the compensation is contingent on the analysis's outcome. 5. The subject parcel's concluded market value is based on a reasonable exposure time (time needed to market the subject parcel preceding the appraisal's effective date) of about one year. The concluded market value is a nominal or gross value; no adjustment has been made for carrying costs or the time value of money which may~ incurred over time if the real estate is marketed. 6. The assistance of Mr. Wade A.

K\\Filell2006\\00T-Certif Rev. 7-7--06 6 \u00b7 7 11. APPRAISAL PROCESS INTRODUCTION/SCOPE OF WORK (rev.7-1--06) This \u00b7 client or the State of North Dakota acting through its Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, as represented by Mr. Richard Frohlich, requested that an appraisal of only the 80\u00b1 acre North Dakota State Penitentiary parcel be prepared; the improvements are to be disregarded. An appraisal is defined as: The act or process of developing an opinion of value. (Appraisal Institute, The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, Fourth Edition: 15) An appraisal involves the selective research into appropriate market areas, the assemblage of pertinent data, the use of appropriate analytical valuation techniques, and the application of knowledge, experience, and professional judgment to develop and appropriate solution to an appraisal problem. The appraisal provides the client with the appraiser's opinion of real property value that reflects all pertinent market evidence. It is essential that the appraisal communicate accurate analyses and opinions in such a manner that it will be meaningful to the client and not be misleading in the marketplace. (The previous paragraph was paraphrased from The Appraisal of Real Estate, 12th Edition as published by the Appraisal Institute.) A concerted effort has been made to complete this appraisal so as to conform to the 2006 edition of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP). USPSP was developed in 1986/87 for the purpose of promoting and preserving public trust in the appraisal profession. Appraisal standards for the profession were created which specify the procedures to be followed in performing an appraisal; they are referenced throughout the following appraisal report. The appraisal procedures detail the process of assembling, classifyinp, analyzing, and interpreting the data used in developing an opinion of the subject property's val6e reflecting only the opinion(s) of the appraiser(s) involved in the analysis. In 2006, the \"Scope of Work Rule\" was added \"to emphasize the requirements for problem identification, determining the appropriate scope of work, and disclosure of the scope of work that was performed in an appraisal, appraisal review, and appraisal consulting assignments: On page 12 of the 2006 edition US PAP, the \"Scope of Work Rule\" is detailed as: For each appraisal, appraisal review, and appraisal consulting assignment, an appraiser must: 1. identify the problem to be solved; 2. determine end perform the scope of work necessary to develop credible assignment results; and 3. disclose the scope of work in the report. An appraiser must properly identify the problem to be solved in order to determine the appropriate scope of work. The appraiser must be prepared to demonstrate that the scope of work is sufficient to produce credible assignment results. Scope of work includes, but is not limited to, the following: the extent to which the property is identified; the extent to which tangible property is inspected; the type and extent of the data researched; and the type and extend of analysis applied to arrive at opinions or conclusions. I I J I \u00b7 1 8 The Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) details the process of \"developing\" a real property appraisal (Standard Rule 1) and \"reporting\" the appraisal (Standard Rule 2). Standard 1 states that \"In developing a real property appraisal, an appraiser must identify the problem to be solved, determine the scope of work necessary to solve a problem, and correctly complete research and analyses necessary to produce a credible appraisal.\" Standard 2 of USPAP states that each written real property appraisal must be reported using one of the following three options or (1) Self-Contained Report, (2) Summary Report, and (3) Restricted Use Report. Each appraisal option is dependent upon the level of detail required in the report. A comprehensive level of detail is presented in the Self-Contained Report; a less detailed, yet concise level of information is presented in the Summary Report; and a minimal level of detail is presented in the Restricted Use Report. USPAP contains specific guidelines that determine what constitutes a Self-Contained, Summary, and Restricted Use Report and when use of a particular option is appropriate. In this particular assignment, the client agreed that the appraisal be reported in a Summary format. Therefore, a Summary Appraisal Report will be developed and presented. As such, it presents sufficient information to enable the client and other intended users, as identified, to understand it properly. This Summary Appraisal Report requires that the undersigned: 1. 2. Define the appraisal problem: that is the identification of the real estate and property and accurately identifying the appraisal's client and any other intended users, the intended use of the appraiser's opinions and conclusions, type and definition of value(s), appraisal's effective date(s), the subject of the assignment and its relevant characteristics, and assignment conditions . Inspect the subject property to note the property's relevant valuation characteristics. The subject property's inspection was conducted only within the context of the appraisal process to uncover valuation issues. This \"appraisal inspection\" involved a visual inspection of only the subject land. The improvements are not of this assignment. Particular attention should be noted in that: a. No special expertise is implied as it relates to but not limited to sanitary sewer or water systems, drainage, soil conditions, or any other property component. b. No special expertise is implied relating to the existence of hazardous materials or detrimental environmental conditions to include but not limited to radon gas, lead based paint, mold, sexual predators, etc. Based on the preceding, the appraisal inspection, as it relates to the land addresses only the observed conditions that would likely impact its overall appeal and marketability. Any and all references to the inspection infers only to an \"appraisal inspection\". Qualified experts should be employed to inspect and address any area of concern. If negative conditions are discovered, the appraiser should be notified as the value conclusion may require modification. I I I I I I -1 I ' 3 . 4. 9 Investigate the real estate market for both general and detailed information using several of the following sources: a. Office files. b. Federal, state, and local agencies relating to general data and trade associations and private business enterprises relating to the specific property type. c. Market participants including brokers/real estate agents, buyers, sellers, lenders, property managers, landlords, and/or tenants. d. County Recorder's/Register of Deeds' records. e. County and/or City Assessor records. f. Multiple Listing Service records. g. City and/or County Planning and/or Engineering Offices. h. Building Inspector's Office. i. Information provided by the property owner, manager, and/or any other individual(s) involved in the property. Search parameters such as dates of sales, leases, locations, sizes, types of properties, and distances from the subject will start with relatively narrow constraints and, if necessary, be expanded until sufficient data has been retrieved (in the appraiser's opinion) to develop an opinion of the appropriate value or until the available pool of data has been reasonably exhausted. Researched sales data will be viewed when physically possible but, at a minimum, a photograph provided by a reputable source, and if found to be appropriate, efforts will be made to verify the data with persons directly involved in the transactions such as buyers, seller, brokers, or agents. At the appraiser's discretion, some data will be used without personal verification if, in the appraiser's opinion, the data appear to be correct. In addition, any appropriate listings or properties found through observations during the data collection process will be considered. Only the data deemed to be pertinent to the valuation process will be reported and, when conflicting information was provided, the source determined to be the most reliable was used. Data believed to be unreliable was not included nor used as a basis for the value conclusion. All supporting documentation will be included in the appraisal report and/or in-file depending on the type of reporting format. Investigate and analyze any pertinent easements or restrictions on the fee simple ownership of the subject property. If a title report is not available, a visual inspection and identification of readily apparent easements or restrictions will be relied upon. 5. Analyze the assembled data and reach conclusions regarding the subject property's market value, as defined in the report as of the date of value using the appropriate identified valuation technique(s) or the Cost, Sales Comparison, and/or Income Capitalization approaches. The entire appraisal process with further expansion of the scope of work when applicable is detailed in the following report, starting with a proper identification of the subject property and concluding with a concluded opinion of its market value(s). For ease of use, an outline format has been used in the following appraisal. ~--------------------------------------- 10 B. SUBJECT PROPERTY IDENTIFICATION: I I I I _ I \"I 1. Property Type: The real estate that is the subject of this appraisal consists of an 80\u00b1 acre parcel that is improved with the North Dakota State Penitentiary. At the client's request, the appraisal assignment will disregard the building improvements. Only the underlying land parcel's valuation will be addressed. 2. Address/Location: 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. No specific street address identifies the entire subject property. Generally, the parcel is located east of 26th Street, south of Main Avenue, and north and west of Bismarck Expressway. The street address of \"3100 Railroad Avenue, Bismarck, North Dakota\" identifies a portion of the subject property that is improved with the North Dakota State Penitentiary. This location places the property on the city's southeast peripheral edge. Metropolitan Area (MA): Census Tract#: City Parcel Numbers: Legal Description: 13900 (Bismarck, ND) State 38, County 015, Tract 0109.00 None assigned to entire tract. A survey or precise legal description identifying the subject parcel was not provided. Therefore, the following legal description was developed by the undersigned based upon client provided information. \"Part of Section 2, Township 138N, Range BOW, City of Bismarck, Burleigh County, North Dakota. This legal description is sufficiently accurate for purposes of this analysis but should not assumed to be correct but should not be relied upon for legal matters such as title transfers, mortgage, etc. The exhibit on page 12 aids in visualizing the location of the identified parcel. Ownership History: Detailing the subject property's ownership history is a mandatory element of a fully documented appraisal that conforms to the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP). Standards Rule 1-5 of USPAP requires that the appraisal \"must, if such information is available to the appraiser in the normal course of business: (a) analyze all agreements of sale, options, or listings of the subject property current as of the effective date of the appraisal; and (b) analyze all sales of the subject property that occurred within the three (3) years prior to the effective date of the appraisal.\u00b7 I I I I 11 The intent of this requirement is to encourage the research and analysis of prior sales of the subject; the time frames cited are minimums. A complete title search of the subject property has not been made nor is an opinion of the title intended to be rendered in the following discussion.

Additionally, every effort has been made to secure the information, knowledge, and applicable data needed to complete this assignment. It is the opinion of the undersigned that all necessary steps have been taken to ensure proper development of the appraisal. I ! \"'\" Ol.D~10 ''''\u00b0 DcLonnc. Street 1 16 D. MARKET AREA ANALYSIS: 1. Subject Market Area Delineation: Bismarck, North Dakota's metropolitan area (MA) had a 2000 population of 94,719 which includes Mandan, North Dakota. It is North Dakota's second largest MA with its population increasing 13% over the last decade or about 1.3% per year. Bismarck is the predominant community having a 2000 population of 55,532 as compared to its \"sister\" city or Mandan with a 2000 population of 16,718. The communities are separated only by the Missouri River. 2. Location and Transportation: The area's central state location and availability of transportation facilities are perceived as being beneficial to the local economy. The primary mode of area transportation is still via the highway system with Interstate 94 and U.S. Highway 83 intersecting in north Bismarck. The area is also served by a regional airport and freight rail service. 3. Economic Base: Bismarck's primary source of wage and salary employment closely follows the state's leading industries led by general services at about 40% of employment, government at more than 20%, and retail and wholesale trade at about 17.5%. Non-ag employment totaled 55,200 in 2005 as compared to 51,000 in 2001 or an increase of 1.65% annually. The community's annual unemployment rate has varied between 2.5% to 4.0% from 1995 through 2005 or rates historically less than the state and the nation. Much of the community growth can be tied to significant expansion in six major business sectors or: a. Medical -The largest segment of the general services employment consists of medical personnel. Bismarck offers two major hospitals or St. Alexius Medical Center employing about 2,129 and Medcenter One Health Systems employing about 1,954; these two hospitals are the community's major non-government employers. b. Government -Since Bismarck is the State Capitol of North Dakota and the county seat of Burleigh County, it is a foregone conclusion that, with a proliferation of government agencies and continued government involvement, government will continue to be one of the largest employers in the city. c. Retail/Wholesale Trade: The Bismarck-Mandan retail trade area serves approximately 200,000 people in a 100 mile radius. This large trade area and the resulting retail growth was the primary reason for the largest retail expansion in Bismarck's history in 2005-2006. Specifically, two 220,000 square foot Wal-Mart Supercenters, a 146,000 square foot Sam's Club, and several multi-tenant retail centers opened. d. Private Industries: Bismarck is fortunate in that it is the home or headquarters for several significant North Dakota companies. Also, in August of 2005, ground was broken for the Northern Plains Commerce Centre (NPCC) or an industrial, distribution, and technology park with about 220 acres. The NPCC will have the ability to accommodate manufacturers, distributors, and agricultural producers to compete in the global economy by improving opportunities for strategic sourcing, exporting, and access to markets through a transload facility. e. Energy Resources: The large reserves of lignite coal, natural gas, and oil in western North Dakota makes Bismarck the headquarters to several energy related companies to include Montana Dakota Utilities, Capital Electric, North American Coal, and The Coteau Properties. -I 4. 5. _J 1 6. 17 f. Higher Education: Bismarck is the home to Bismarck State College, University of Mary, United Tribes Technical College, and Medcenter One College of Nursing. These four institutions' enrollment exceeds 7,000 students. As a result, the combination of students and staff create a significant impact on the local economy. Real Estate Trends: Diversification in the employment base has also resulted in reasonable growth in most segments of the real estate market. The single family residential market, both in terms of new construction and sales of existing residences, has had sustainable growth. Multi-family development is moderate but reflects a favorable vacancy rate approximating 5%. New commercial development has been occurring in almost every market segment to include office, retail, medical facilities, and warehousing. The only segments somewhat absent from new construction market are those of lodging and manufacturing. Historically, Bismarck has had a comparatively small manufacturing base. Again, the expansion of the retail sector has been significant in recent years. The current supply of competitive commercial property of any type available for sale is limited. Few commercial or industrial properties are currently listed for sale and a limited amount of land exists. A somewhat limited supply of commercial properties has been the primary reason for the significant new construction. The predominant reason for the purchase of most area commercial properties still continues to be for owner occupancy or owner/user reasons. Mandan Overview: Mandan's economic base benefits from having several large employers to include one of the state's largest industrial operations or Tesoro Oil Refinery, Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad, Cloverdale Foods, and National Information Solutions Cooperative (NISC). In contrast to the late 1980's, Mandan has seen economic improvement in recent years. Some of the more significant economic development trends include: Over 765 acres of land has been annexed since 2001 for both commercial and residential development. 721 new residential units have been added to Mandan's market between 2000 to 2005. Single family residential permits have averaged more than 75 permits per year since 2002. The total value of all building permits has more than doubled from $16 million in 2002 to $35 million in 2005 and nearly $35 million through October of 2006. Sales tax collections reached a record of $1.2 million in 2005. Collections for the first nine months of 2006 are tracking at a 17% increase over the same period in 2005. Mandan's speculative commercial real estate market still has somewhat limited demand, especially in its ability to generate rent supporting new development costs, especially if not strategically located. Thus, a degree of external obsolescence in the form of a rental market not sufficient to support replacement cost may exist in select market segments. Conclusions-Relevance to Subject Property: The local metropolitan area possesses those value-impacting characteristics that should continue to create demand for most segments of the area real estate market. The diversity in the economic base provides for a favorable community business climate. In tum, the marketability of most area properties has been favorably impacted and continued growth is anticipated. ..J =l I ZONING/NEIGHBORHOOD LOCATION MAP 0 Highlights Neighborhood Traffic Arterial Corridors.

Identified Boundaries: The subject's broader neighborhood, a large commercial and/or industrial area, is located in the southeast part of Bismarck, exclusive of the manufactured housing parks. It is generally bordered on the north by Main Avenue and/or the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad tracks, on the west by 17th Street to Bismarck Expressway to University Drive, on the south by the public land used by the Bismarck Municipal Airport, and on the east by Bismarck's City limits and/or Yegen Road. These neighborhood boundaries were selected since they separate differing land uses. 2. Access: 3. By far, Bismarck Expressway is the neighborhood's major traffic arterial. Interstate 94 is the main interstate commerce route with Main Avenue and Bismarck Expressway then providing direct links to Bismarck's central, south, and east commercial districts. The neighborhood accessibility was greatly enhanced (1) in 1985 when a much needed, direct connecting link for South Bismarck to Mandan and Interstate 94 was opened or the Bismarck Expressway bridge and (2) in 2004 when the reconstruction of East Bismarck Expressway from a two lane to a four lane traffic carrier was completed. Reconstruction began at about the intersection of Divide Avenue and ex1ended south about one and one\u00ad half miles to its intersection with Main Avenue. This reconstruction project significantly enhanced traffic flow through the neighborhood. The major north-south intersecting traffic arterials are South 26th Street, Airport Road, and University Drive. Numerous other secondary intersecting streets provide for adequate internal neighborhood access. Collectively, good neighborhood accessibility is provided . DevelopmenULand Uses/Trends: Neighborhood development started in about 1970 or when the city's largest regional shopping center or Kirkwood Mall was constructed. Kirkwood Mall is located between 3rd and 7th Streets, north and adjacent to Bismarck Expressway. The neighborhood grew at a modest rate during most of the 1980s until a significant neighborhood development occurred. The Bismarck Expressway overpass opened in 1985 which provided a much needed, direct connecting link for south Bismarck to Mandan and Interstate #94. The broader neighborhood is now about 85% developed with the vast majority of the undeveloped \"transitional\" land located in the immediate subject area. Notable development in and around the subject area includes the MDU Service Center, United States Post Office, Slumberland Furniture, MAC's Hardware, Bismarck Public Works Department complex, North Dakota Game & Fish Department, and Valley Sport & Marine. More importantly however is that two of the communities more significant development projects have occurred in the immediate neighborhood area over the past one-two years. First, a large vacant land tract, located on the southeast comer of East Bismarck Expressway and South 26th Street, was developed with a Wal-Mart Supercenter and Sam's Club. This development has and will continue to spur a multitude of supportive retail/commercial development projects in the form of retail strip centers, restaurants, c\u00ad stores, sales and service facilities, etc. 4 20 Second, plans are evolving to develop a 220 acre parcel of the city owned Airport Industrial Park with a transportation hub and industrial park known as the Northern Plains Commerce Centre (NPCC). The first phase included a mainline rail spur, road grading, water and sewer installation, and the completion of Bobcat manufacturing facility in 2006. In August of 2006, the NPCC announced that an agreement was reached to build a 90,000 square foot agricultural processing facility for United Pulse Trading to be owned by a Canadian investor's group known as Saskcan Pulse Trading, Inc. Phase II of the facility includes bringing the mainline rail into the center, construction of the transload facility, and paving roads. This phase is expected to be operational by the spring of 2007. Additionally, a 150 acre parcel of privately owned land will be available for development adjacent to the transportation hub site. Neighborhood properties are predominantly owner-occupied w~ the percentage of tenant occupants being negligible. The general appearance and maintenance level of area properties is rated average to good. Collectively, this new development has and will continue to have a significant impact on this area's future growth. 4. Services: 5. All municipal utilities and services and general amenities competitive with other areas of Bismarck are provided. Conclusions-Relevance to the Subject Property: The subject neighborhood's market appeal has been greatly enhanced over the past one\u00ad two years by the recent developments and the general decline in available vacant commercial and/or industrial sites throughout the community. The subject property's locational characteristics are strategic to possible Mure area growth. ------ 21 F. PARCEL DESCRIPTION: 1 1. Introduction: The subject parcel was improved with the N.D. State Penitentiary facility as of the appraisal's inspection date or December 12, 2006. At the client's request, the appraisal will disregard the building improvements though all site preparation and installation of utilities would be complete. Likewise, all plats, surveys, zoning maps, etc. are assumed to be reliable; no warranty is implied as to their accuracy. Lastly, it will be assumed that the parcel is environmentally clean and no adverse soil conditions exist. 2. Identification: 3. 4. Again, a survey or precise legal description identifying the property was not provided. The legal description detailed on Page 1 O was developed by the undersigned based on client provided information. Additionally, the parcel size of 80\u00b1 acres was based on a reasonable estimation by the client. Any significant changes or deviations from this parcel size may require appraisal report modifications. The Bismarck City Assessor's office has not assigned a parcel number to this entire property as it is tax exempt. Location and Adjacent Land Users: No specific street address identifies the entire subject property. Generally, the parcel is located east of 26\"' Street, south of Main Avenue, and north and west of Bismarck Expressway in Section 2, Township 138N, Range BOW, Bismarck, ND. The street address of \"3100 Railroad Avenue, Bismarck, North Dakota\" identifies a portion of the subject parcel that is improved with the North Dakota State Penitentiary. This location places the land on the city's southeast peripheral edge or a favorable location as it has extensive frontage along two major traffic arterials or Bismarck Expressway and Main Avenue. Adjacent land users to the north and across Main Avenue include a multitude of commercial/retail development. The N.D. Game & Fish building and the Community Family Forrest land is located to the east. Predominantly vacant \"transitional\" agricultural land is located adjacent to the parcel's southeast side with the BNSF railroad right-of-way to the southwest transitioning to evolving retail/commercial development. Land use to the west includes the \"proposed\" railroad spur right-of-way transitioning to the State Lab facility. This rail spur is proposed as a convenient link between the Cana_dian Pacific Railroad line located north and adjacent to Main Avenue and the Northern Plains Commerce Center. Area land use consistency was apparent. Access and Visibility: Exceptionally good access to and from the area and to the subject property is provided by Bismarck Expressway, Main Avenue, and 26\u00b0' Street. Access onto the parcel is limited to the extension of Railroad Avenue along the parcel's southwest side and one egress/ingress point off Main Avenue near the center of the parcel's north boundary. No egress/ingress currently exists off Bismarck Expressway. If developed, optimum parcel access would have to be achieved by an extensive internal street network. The parcel areas located in proximity to the arterial corridors or Bismarck Expressway and Main Avenue afford good visibility. However, the parcel's significant depth lim~s the exposure to the areas beyond the immediate arterial corridors. 1 AERIAL PHOTO O Outlines Subject Parcel -80\u00b1 acres 0 Location of Proposed Railroad Track (Source: Google Earth) (Detailed boundaries are not exact -this is not a survey.) 22 NORTH 5 . 6. 7. 8. -I I 23 Physical Characteristics (Shape, Size, Use, Topography, Etc.): The previous aerial photo greatly assists in visualizing this parcel's physical characteristics. The following valuation process will demonstrate that the parcel's size of 80\u00b1 acres or 3,484,800 s.f. is comparatively large relative to other area land parcels purchased for commercial/light industrial development. It features approximately 1,700' of frontage along Main Avenue on the north, 1,200' along Bismarck Expressway on its southeast side, and 1,000' along Railroad Avenue on its southwest side_ Parcel depth ranges from 1,500'\u00b1 along its west side or along the proposed railroad spur right-of-way to 2,100' along its east boundary. The parcel has mostly level topography with an elevation below the adjacent street level. Generally, the parcel is low lying, especially in its northwest comer. These low lying areas, combined with the parcel's reported high water table, would require significant site preparation to ready it for development. In the absence of a soil test, it can only be assumed that the soils are sufficient to support development. Flood Plain Status, Easements, Environmental Concerns, and other Encumbrances: The flood map located in the Addenda details that the site is located in a Zone \"X\" flood plain or not in an identified flood hazard area. Zone X areas do not require flood insurance as a required contingency in obtaining lender financing. The visual site inspection did not reveal any environmental concerns. Likewise, a recorded plat detailing easements, encumbrances, or any other type of site encumbrances does not exist. Thus, it can only be assumed that no significant site encumbrances exist. The site is located in the corporate city limits of Bismarck and, therefore, it can only be assumed that all municipal services and public utilities have been provided to the parcel through proper easements . On-and Off-Site Improvements: The adjacent streets are concrete and/or asphalt surfaced but have not been improved with curbing, street lights, storm sewer, or sidewalks. All municipal services (electricity, natural gas, telephone, and water) are installed to the N.D. State Penitentiary but their current size and capacity would likely be insufficient to support development of the entire parcel. Even so, the on-site existence of the utilities would be perceived as a favorable market characteristic. Zoning: The subject parcel is zoned \"P\" -Public Use District. Section 14-04-16, page 144, of the City of Bismarck Zoning Ordinance details that \"The P public use district is established as a district in which the predominant use of land is for public use.\" Permitted uses include educational groups, public recreational groups, water treatment plants, buildings and necessary on-site facilities required for conduct of government, commercial recreation groups occupying public owned lands, sewer treatment plants, municipal landfills, parking lots, gift shops occupying pubic owned lands, food service establishments exclusive of drive-in restaurants, occupying public owned lands, and even special uses to include airports and cemeteries. Various lot size, setback requirements, and regulations exist depending on a particular use. This zoning is specific to all area publicly owned land. If the property were placed on the open market and sold, rezoning would then be required. 9. 10. I I 24 Conclusions: This 80\u00b1 acre land parcel has several favorable characteristics to include (a) extensive frontage along two major traffic arterials or Bismarck Expressway and Main Avenue, (b) ease of neighborhood access, (c) good visibility, and (d) availability of all municipal utilities. Limiting characteristics include (a) its comparatively large size and depth, (b) limited egress/ingress from the adjacent traffic arterials, and (c) low lying elevations and reported high water table requiring extensive site preparation if ever developed. The combination of these somewhat opposing characteristics creates a unique land parcel.

HIGHEST AND BEST USE ANALYSIS 1. Introduction: Highest and best use is a market driven concept or analysis that attempts to identify the most probable and proflfable, competitive use to which the market and property can support; key determinants in the concept of value. In essence, this analysis reconciles the previously assembled market information into the foundation on which the applicable value rests. Because of its importance, the definition of highest and best use is presented as: The reasonably probable and legal use of vacant land or an improved property which is physically possible, appropriately supported, financially feasible, and that results in the highest value. The four criteria the highest and best use must meet are legal permissibility, physical possibility, financial feasibility, and maximum profitability. (Appraisallnstoute, The Dictionary of Real Estala Appraisal, Fourth Edition: 135) Conclusions of highest and best use for real estate are normally made according to two premises. The first premise assumes that the site is vacant and available for development and the second premise addresses the highest and best use of the site as improved. The subject parcel's highest and best use conclusion is made according to only one premise or as vacant as the building improvements will be disregarded for the purpose of this analysis. 2. Highest and Best Use As-Vacant Analysis: The four criteria formulating the parcel's highest and best as vacant, are now applied: a. Legally Permissible: Typically, the most obvious legal consideration that affects development of a particular site is zoning. It was previously detailed that the subject parcel is zoned as \"P\" or Public Use District. This zoning is definitely restrictive as it relates to permitted uses. However, a distinct probability exists that the parcel would be rezoned if alternative uses were planned. Its location on the southeast peripheral edge of the Bismarck city limits creates a locational appeal factor that implies a land use transition beyond its current use. Reference to the previous zoning map (page 18) indicates that, by far, the predominant land to the north, south, and west is zoned \"MA\" or light industrial. The land east of Bismarck Expressway is zoned \"PUD\" or Planned Unit Development and is improved with the Missouri Valley Fairgounds. Therefore, re-zoning would not be a restricting characteristic relative to future development. No other legal considerations were noted that would restrict parcel development. b. Physically Possible: The test of physical possibility addresses the parcel's physical characteristics (location, size, topography, soil types, etc.) as to how they will impact its highest and best use. The two most significant characteristics that would readily impact this parcel's probable use(s) would be that of size and location. Most other physical characteristics or those relating to elevation, drainage, site preparation, etc. would not have a measurable impact on its probable use. The subject parcel's 80\u00b1 acres allows for considerable flexibility as to possible Mure uses. This size is comparatively large when compared to other land parcels purchased for commercial and/or light industrial development. (The sales referenced in the following valuation process have parcel sizes ranging from about 2 acres to 60 acres.) Subdividing the subject parcel into smaller tracts is a consideration but optimum utility would still results if viewed as one parcel. Specifically, the parcel's combination of access, shape, and potential uses precludes optimum value if subdivided into smaller development parcels. C. 29 The other significant characteristic that will impact its probable use is location. The subject parcel is located on the city's extreme southeast peripheral edge and features frontage along the two major traffic arterial servicing the neighborhood or Bismarck Expressway on the south and Main Avenue on the north. Again, the broader neighborhood is approximately 85% developed with the vast majority of the undeveloped \"transitional\" land located in the immediate area. Historically, most area land tracts were perceived as having a more commercial/light industrial appeal. However, the neighborhood's recent 'big box\" retail development of Wal\u00ad Mart and Sam's Club has and will continue to spur a multitude of surrounding retail/commercial development. This recent retail development has had a significant impact on the area's use potential and/or appeal. Another significant change occurred with the development of a neighborhood transportation hub and industrial park known as the Northern Plains Commerce Centre. It is located approximately one mile south of the subject parcel. This project's continued evolution has prompted the City of Bismarck to 'link\" it with the BNSF railroad tracks bordering the parcel's south boundary and the Canadian Pacific Railroad line located north and adjacent to Main Avenue. The proposed railroad spur, located adjacent to the parcel's west boundary, would provide the necessary link between the existing railways. Based on this analysis, it is probable that the subject parcel's land area located along Bismarck Expressway could support retail/commercial development similar to what has been evolving along this traffic arterial. Conversely, the Main Avenue corridor has far inferior appeal when compared to the Bismarck Expressway corridor and has experienced limited development over the last several years. Therefore, the area along Main Avenue and the parcel's interior or 'back\" locations most likely will be developed with general commercial/light industrial development or development supportive of the Northern Plain Commerce Centre such as transit/distribution warehouses, trucking terminals, service businesses, and/or storage facilities. Considered collectively, the subject parcel's locational and physical characteristics readily indicate that a mix of commercial/industrial development would be the parcel's predominant land use though intensive retail/commercial development would likely evolve along the Bismarck Expressway corridor. Financially Feasible: The preceding tests of legal permissibility and physically possible imply that the parcel's probable use includes a mix of commercial/light industrial development with more intensive retail/commercial uses probable along the Bismarck Expressway corridor. Prior to the recent 'big box\" retail development, neighborhood development consisted predominantly of general commercial and/or light industrial. The neighborhood's continued growth and its evolution has resulted from the city's natural growth progression and from the now limited supply of commercial sites with favorable locational attributes. The significant amount of development occurring in the immediate area and even at other peripheral areas of Bismarck suggests that this parcel's appeal now extends beyond it current use. A limited number of vacant sites exist along Bismarck Expressway and, for this reason, a market is and will continue to evolve for secondary or back locations. Additionally, the ongoing development and success of the nearby Northern Plains Commerce Centre could result in increased demand for secondary sites. Based on these market observations, development of the subject parcel with a mix of retail, commercial and light industrial development would be financially feasible. ----------------------------d . 30 Maximally Productive: The preceding three tests imply that the parcel's highest and best use would be a mix of retail, commercial, and/or light industrial uses. Selecting a particular mix of uses that would be financially feasible and result in maximum economic productivity would be dictated by the current balance of supply within each particular market segment. Again, a zoning change to light industrial zoning would be required. Re-zoning is a reasonable expectation as numerous sites with similar neighborhood locations are appropriately zoned. Generally, the demand for commercial and/or light industrial sites offering good characteristics is in reasonable balance though some exceptions exist where demand even exceeds the available supply, especially those sites containing optimum locational characteristics. Immediate development (within one year) of the entire 80\u00b1 acres parcel is not likely. Rather, it would develop as the market around the neighborhood's major land use evolves.\u00b7 Based on this market analysis, the subject 80\u00b1 acre parcel's highest and best use is concluded to be a mix of commercial/light industrial development with more intensive retail/commercial uses along the Bismarck Expressway corridor. The conclusion as the subject parcel's highest and best use is the basis for the following valuation analysis. H . 31 VALUATION PROCESS (rev. 2-1-05) The previous discussion and analysis outlined the appraisal problem, detailed the subject's area market, neighborhood, and the subject property, and concluded with a determination of the property's highest and best use. The next step or developing a reliable opinion of the property's applicable value normally involves the three traditional valuation techniques or the: (1) Cost Approach, (2) Sales Comparison Approach (also known as the Market Approach), and (3) Income Capitalization Approach. The reliability of these valuation techniques hinges on the proper assemblage and comparison of similar market data to include sufficient information to estimate the improvements' current reproduction or replacement cost (basis for the Cost Approach), sale and/or asking prices of similar improved properties (basis for the Sales Comparison Approach), and data needed to estimate and convert Mure anticipated benefrts (generally termed \"net income\") into a value indication (basis for the Income Capitalization Approach). And lastly, the subject property's market value is concluded by reconciling the three techniques' results. Each valuation technique is not an independent system of valuation unrelated to the other technique(s) or method(s). The entire valuation process is comprised of integrated, interrelated, and inseparable techniques and procedures that have the common objective of providing a convincing and reliable value indication. Each valuation technique normally references conclusions from the other technique(s). For these reasons, there is no predetermined sequence in the application of the applicable valuation techniques. In this particular assignment, the Cost Approach is not applicable as it based on the hypothetical condition that the improvements be disregarded. By far, only the Sales Comparison Approach is used in the appraisal of vacant sites. This valuation technique is the most recognized method of buying and selling similar land in the area market as it provides the most accurate reflection of actual market behavior. The Income Capitalization Approach is most applicable to properties purchased predominantly for their income-producing potential. The area market simply has not realized sufficient investment-only motivated purchases of similar sites to provide consistent, reliable trends for site capitalization and/or discount rates. Similar sites are most frequently purchased for owner occupancy/use. Thus, insufficient data is available for a reliable, conclusive market value indication by the Income Capitalization Approach. Again, the valuation analysis of vacant sites typically involves the Sales Comparison Approach. The methodology used in the Sales Comparison Approach is continued in the following report. 32 I. SALES COMPARISON APPROACH: I I - J 1. 2. Introduction: The Sales Comparison Approach is a method of developing an indication of a site's market value by assembling, analyzing, and comparing the subject site to recent and similar properties that have sold, are under contract, and/or current listings. If sufficient data is available and properly analyzed, the resulting pattern generally provides an indication of probable market value. Typically, the Sales Comparison Approach is the most reliable and easily understood method of providing a market value opinion, especially for properties that are bought and sold regularly. This valuation technique can normally be accomplished in two basic steps or: (1) research the market for the applicable market data and analyze the market data to determine a relevant unit(s) of comparison and (2) reconcile the data to the subject parcel resulting in a single value indication or a range of values. Market Data Assemblage: Application of the Sales Comparison valuation technique starts by assembling \"recent and similar\" market data, preferably comparable sales or, if necessary and available, competitive listings. This market data should be similar to the subject parcel in property rights conveyed, locational characteristics, physical characteristics, and use or potential use. Again, the subject parcel consists of an 80\u00b1 acre transitional use parcel located on the southeast peripheral edge of Bismarck. The highest and best use analysis concluded that the subject parcel would be perceived as having a mix of commercial/light industrial development with more intensive retail/commercial uses along the Bismarck Expressway corridor. In researching the market, eight sales were assembled affording reasonably similar characteristics. The primary sources used in researching this market included the local multiple listing service (MLS), Burleigh County Recorder's and Tax Director's office, Bismarck City Assessor's office, commercial real estate brokers, and in-file data. All parcels were personally inspected. Price per square foot, extracted by dividing the sales price (excluding special assessments as all were buyer assumed) by each site's total size, was selected as the common unit of comparison. This unit of comparison was chosen for analytical purposes since it is the most widely recognized and most easily understood comparative unit in the local market. This assembled market data is tabulated on the following chart. The sales are arrayed by price per square foot, lowest to highest. The adjoining map depicts the location of the site sales in relation to the subject parcel. - I I I COMPARABLE PARCEL SALES Seller/ Sale Price/ Buyer Location Date Zoning Parcel Size Sq.Ft 1.

The sales have then been analyzed through use of the relative comparison analysis, as opposed to qualitative analysis using specified adjustments. (The local market precludes the ability to quantify accurate adjustments.) This relative comparison analysis or \"parcel-to-parcel\" comparison is more reflective of typical market behavior and tends to provide a more accurate market value range. The application of the qualitative analysis in the comparable sales indicated reasonably good similarity in most elements of consideration or property rights conveyed, financing terms, and condition of sale. All eight sales involved the transfer of fee simple ownership. Thus, no adjustments for ownership rights are required. All were sold on the basis of cash or cash-equivalent term and all listed prices reflect cash or cash equivalent terms; thus, no adjustments are necessary for special financing. Individual motivations for each sale are apt to be as diverse as the market and, consequently, it simply is impossible to adjust each sale for individual sale and/or purchasing motivations. The eight sales sold from December of 2003 to January of 2006. It is unlikely that this particular market segment has had a measurable change over the last three years. Even so, an attempt will be made to reflect current market conditions. The remaining factors requiring analytical consideration are differences in physical characteristics to include location and parcel size. The eight sales indicate an overall price/value range of $0.91 to $4.06/square foot When applied to the subject parcel's size of 3,484,800 s.f. or 80\u00b1 3,171,168 $14,148,288 This comparatively wide price/value range undoubtedly brackets the subject parcel's anticipated market value. However, this price range can be narrowed when observing some noted property characteristics. Three sales or Sales #6 through #8, selling between $2.14/square foot and $4.06/square foot, are perceived as the upper limit price indictors. Specifically, these three sales (1) afford locations in more established neighborhoods having superior development appeal and (2) they feature comparatively smaller parcels sizes ranging from 9.26 acres to 17.09 acres. Generally, smaller parcels sell for more on a price per square foot basis that large parcels, all other things considered equal. The remaining five sales or Sale #1 through Sale #5 indicate a price/probable market value range of about $0.90/square foot to $2.00/square foot. Sale #1 is the most recent sale selling in January of 2006 for $0.91/square foot. The parcel offers good similarity in terms of size (nearly 60 acres) and features extensive street frontage and good Interstate 94 exposure. However, its Mandan market location is far inferior to the subject parcel's Bismarck location. Sale #5 or the \"Pinehurst Square\" parcel, selling for $2.04/square foot in September of 2004, also offers good similarity in terms of size (51.49 acres). This parcel is located on the northeast quadrant of Exit 157 and has exceptionally good access and visibility from Interstate 94. As such, this parcel is perceived as affording an excellent location in its developing neighborhood and the entire community. The parcel has since been developed with a retail power center or with development that extends beyond that of the subject parcel's development potential. 35 Most consideration is given to Sales #2, #3, and #4. Sales #2 and #3, selling for about $1.50/square feet, afford similar locational characteristics as they were located in an evolving commercial \"strip\" neighborhood along a major traffic arterial or U.S. Highway 83. Both parcels are perceived as being slightly superior as their combined physical characteristics (location, size, and shape) resulted in an entire parcel supportive of retail development. It is important to note, however, that both parcels were located just beyond Bismarck's urbanized development and incurred significant development cost in terms of municipal improvements and site preparation. Sale #4, selling in January of 2005 for $1.82/s.f., is a comparatively large (58.81 acres) industrial zoned parcel located in the subject neighborhood with 1, 100\u00b1 feet of frontage along Bismarck Expressway. Parts have been resold and improved with Wal-Mart and Sam's Club. This parcel is superior in terms of its locational appeal as it affords a corner location with exceptionally good access and visibility from Bismarck Expressway. This parcel is comparatively large but, yet, its rectangular shape and comer location was entirely supportive of retail development. Comparatively, the previous highest and best use analysis detailed that only the subject parcel areas located in proximity to the Bismarck Expressway corridor would be supportive of intensive retail/commercial development. The final element of consideration required for a properly developed market value relates to reasonable exposure time (i.e., the length of time the subject property would have been exposed for sale in the market had it sold at the market value concluded in this analysis as of the date of this valuation). The information gathered through assemblage of the market data and conversations with various market participants indicated that, if competitively priced, an exposure time should not have exceeded on year. The preceding market analysis suggests a probable price/market value range of something more than Sale #1 at about $0.90/square foot or about $3,136,000 but considerably less than Sale #5 at about $2.00/square foot or $6,970,000 with most consideration afforded to Sales #2 through #4 ranging from about $1.50 or $5,227,000 to $1.80/square foot or $6,273,000. The simple lack of vacant competitive parcels located anywhere within the defined neighborhood, or for that matter in the entire community, definitively enhances the subject parcel's overall appeal and marketability. Even so, the market value conclusion must be tempered by its comparatively large size, less than ideal frontage along Bismarck Expressway, and elevation issues. Based on this analysis and considering the subject parcel's overall characteristics, its fee simple market value, as of December 12, 2006, based on the hypothetical condition that the existing improvements are disregarded, is concluded at: \"FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ($5,000,000 or $1.43\u00b1/s.f.) 36 -' ADDENDA j ' PERSONAL SERVJCE CONTRACT The parties to this contract are the State of North Dakota, acting through its Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (ST ATE), and Dakota Appraisal and Consulting, Ltd.

The purpose of these amendments is to maintain state ownership of the land occupied by the Missouri River Correctional Facility. The first amendment removes the entire Section regarding moving MRCC prisoners to the main penitentiary. The second amendment would permit moving the prisoners, but remove the language selling the land . The land is a more valuable asset than the money it will attract, particularly with the current budget surplus. As Bismarck-Mandan grows and Missouri River frontage becomes less available, the land will appreciate much faster than will money in the bank. Once sold, it leaves public ownership forever. The land could be a unit of Fort Abraham Lincoln State Park, it could be a Game and Fish Department site, and it could be part of a spectacular Missouri River Greenway at the south end of Washington Street. Or it could be sold. But that decision should not be made now. ,, \\,h ,; '.I, - Penitentiary Building Project Planning and Programming East Cell House Removal and Expansion of Specialized Facilities SECTION I -INTRODUCTION ...................................... 1.1-1.4 Purpose of Report Methodology for System Assessment Background of Corrections Facility Goals and Missions Existing Conditions and Observations SECTION 2 -SYSTEM ASSESSMENT AND EXISTING ...... 2.1-2.4 Bed Needs and Projections SECTION 3 -RECOMMENDED SOLUTION ............... 3.1-3.6 Site Constraints Program Strategy Ritterbush, Ellig, Hu~ing I HDR Architecture, Inc.

This has negatively affected the facilrty both financially and from a public safety standpoint In May 2004, the North Dakota Department of Corrections commissioned Ritterbush, Ellig, Hulsing Architects in conjunction with HDR Architecture, Inc., to review the North Dakota State Penitentiary's current facilities (starting with the East Cellhouse, project future needs, and identify potential solutions to address the overcrowding issue. The tangible goals of this effort include: Ritterbush, Elllg, Hulsing / HOR Archilecture, Inc. Address immediate overcrowding issues and project future need to optimize the Penitentiary's program options. Outline need for General Population Cell House. Close the East Cellhouse and redistribute inmates to either other existing areas of the prison or to new facilities within the prison. Assess the medical facilities onsrte and determine their ability to meet the needs of the facility. Assess the orientation facilities and their ability to meet the needs of the facility. Assess the segregation facilities and their ability to meet the needs of the facilrty. Assess other factors such as visitation, laundry and other services. Assess the facility's srte and the impacts of any new structures on it and the penitentiary's infrastructure. METHODOLOGY FOR SYSTEM ASSESSMENT It is necessary to have a clear understanding of the issues that are causing the prison's issues and specifically, the factors that are accelerating the problem. In order to have an understanding, REHi HDR examined the entire penitentiary system. It is important to recognize the interrelationship of each component as no one factor alone is responsible for the facility's issues, rather a component of a much larger issue. Issues Driving Bed Needs -REH/ HDR explored trends for population, crime rate, and other factors driving needs, including types of classification, age, health needs and orientation program needs. We also compared this data from the North Dakota Department of Corrections anecdotally with other jurisdictions. INTRODUCTION NORTH DAKOTA PENITENTlARY BUILDING PROJECT EAST CELL HOUSE REMOVAL AND EXPANSION OF SPECJAUZED F.,_CJUT1ES - Government: Law Enforcement & Courts -We examined overall crime rates and sentencing trends. REH/ HOR also considered system wide impacts that could affect inmate populations such as new laws, statutes, and current operating procedures and methods, induding those outside of the control of the North Dakota Department of Corrections. Corrections System -REH/ HOR reviewed admissions, average length of stay and daily population figures for the past few years. We also examined operating costs. REH/ HOR conducted an analysis of the penitentiary facility conditions and reviewed the CC>stiimpact of operating these facilities. Additional infrastructure capacities and conditions were evaluated for future need . After reviewing this data, REH/ HOR was able to draw condusions about probable future space needs for the North Dakota State Penitentiary' and: Projected inmate bed need trends. Reviewed projections and preliminary findings with facility staff. Developed alternative construction scenarios induding potential cost and staffing impacts. Prepared this document detailing our findings, projections and alternatives. Recommended a course of action to alleviate the current overcrowding and operational issues BACKGROUND OF THE CORRECTIONS FACILITY The North Dakota State Penitentiary is a facility within the North Dakota Department of Corrections, whose mission is the processing, management and reintroducton to the general population of the state's inmate population. The system is currenfly overseen by Leann Bertsch. The penitentiary is Schuetzle, warden, and Pat Branson, duty warden. This project was overseen by Dick Frohlich, director of plant services. Ritterbush, Ellig, Hulsing / HOR Architecture, loc. . , ~ 2 - The bed breakdown of the facility is indicated in Chapter Two of this study. GOALS AND MISSIONS Beyond the basic goal already indicated, it was determined that the specific mission of the report would be as follows: Produce a document by August 31, 2004 that identifies improvements required by the North Dakota State PenftenUary to meet fts needs over the next 10-20 years. Identify the relative costs of the improvements, including construction, staffing and other operations. ldenlify the ways and means of staging and/ or phasing the construction, taking into account security and economic concerns. Promote document to North Dakota state legislature and procure funding for future build-out of the identifiad facilities. Improve the ability of the facility to classify incoming inmates and disperse them to appropriate housing assignments. In any planning, meet all applicable all applicable ACA, NFPA, building code requirements. Improve and expand the facility's capabilfties in medical and dental service delivery, both at designated facilities and throughout the penftentiary. Improve the ability of the facility to provide segregation! protective custody and other special classification housing. Determine the ability of the facility's infrastructure to support the new improvements in terms of water distribulion, heating, ventilating, storm and sanftary sewer, electrical, fire safety, telecommunications, security electronics and others. Consider the penftenffary's future growth needs and fts ongoing mission wfthin the overall Department of Corrections system. Identify current and Mure security technology or operations needs. Be certain any additionslrenovaffons support Mure growth or do not hinder current operations in any way. Identify other issues of planning or design for Mure study by the NDDOC. ;1--:- EXISTING CONDITIONS & OBSERVATIONS As noted earlier, the current North Dakota State Penitentiary was first built in the early 1900's, and has been in operation ever since. There have been numerous expansions, renovations and remodels over the years as the facility has ccntinued to change to meet the needs of the facility's mission over time. There are too many issues to cover in the scope of this report, which is not meant to be a ccmprehensive inventory of issues. Therefore, included in this summary list are the issues that pertain to the portions of the facility we are addressing. Medical facilities were found deficient in the following manner. Space, total beds available, storage Privacy, especially in waiting and exam areas Disabled access, stretcher needs to be carried up stairs Space for long-term care Negative air-pressure rooms Pharmacy lacks work space, security Dental and X-ray are poorly located for security Records are poorly located Lack of facilfties requires many hospffal stays in Bismarck Segregation: Space, total beds available Meets no currently applicable standards Cells are poor for segregation DifflcuM to manage population No program or ancillary space Orientation: Modem design Lacks sufficient beds Unable to sp/ft inmates properly Lack of processing space General: .

Historically, whether crime rates rose or fell, rates of imprisonment continued to increase progressively. This phenomenon is usually explained by asserting that as the attitude of the public toward crime has become tougher, government officials have responded by escalating the severity of punishments and by enacting increasingly harsher policies. We have witnessed numerous efforts from increased law enforcement funding to mandatory sentencing requirements among many others. This has placed a burden on the detention _and correctional systems throughout the United States. From 1990 to 2006 the population in the prison division has tripled. ~. ~ - view of the East Cell house at the North Dakota State Penitentiary -. .... _ ~! ' - Ritterbush. rn~. Hulsing HOR Inc. SYSTEM ASSESSMENT ANO EXISTING \u00b7 . : -N~RTH DAKOTA PENITENTIARY BU/LDIN~R~CT. ' EAST CELL HOUSE REMOVAL AND EXPANSION OF SPECIALIZED F!',CIUTIES - Factors include: Methamphetamine use-The upper Midwest, in particular, the Dakotas, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska as well as other states, have a seen a sharp rise in the production, sale and use of 'homemade' methamphetamine, or meth, in recent years. Meth can be easily producec using readily available materials (such as anhydrous ammonia, commonly found on farms), and is often made in 'labs' in remote, agricultural areas. The recently depressed economy contributed to people using meth producuon as an alternauve means of income, and meth use is a increasingly common method of 'suspending reality' among it's users. Meth is a .., highly addicfive substance that takes a very heavy toll physically and ~ mentally on it's users, two other burdens that get transferred to the corrections system. ~) with addictions and acute medical needs are housed In medical rooms such as this, with poor ventilation and security systems. Older population- Partially due to stiffer sentences, and more focus on idenufying and arresung sex offenders, the department is faced with more geriatric and spacial neecs.inmates. As a result of that, the typas of bees and services requirec to serve this emerging population are not currently present or adequate. The requirements impact the infirmary, the clinic, the pharmacy, and other elements of inmate services. Additionally, the current location of the medical areas are very poor and need to be evaluatec. Areas like this stairway lie far short of being accessible. This stairway, in fact, serves as the pathway for bringing Inmates on stretchers Violent population- More and more, especially with tougher sentencing, there is more and more of population prone to violence, acting out, or other means of being uncooperative and difficult to manage. Therefore, the needs for special beds, both in terms of orientation and disciplinary ' . . -. Architecture, Inc. SYSTEM ASSESSMENT AND EX'.ISTING' 2 't:' ' ' NORTH DAKOTA\"PEN11ENT1ARY BUILDING PROJECT ! \"h EAST CELL HOUSE REMOVAL AND EXPANSJON Di= SPEClAlJZEf? FACILJTIE~ . - segregation are more and more in demand. Again, the current facility is not well set up to meet these increasing demands. Exported Inmates are 'easier Inmates'- The meaning of this is that the state is currently so over-capacity in it's inmate population that is sending a number of inmates to other facilities and paying a per diem for their incarceration. Unfortunately, based on the per diem agreements, the boarding facilities often invoke the right to 'send back' problem inmates, or inmates that have medical or psychological issues. The state, in turn, gets an 'at home' Inmate population with a higher percentage of special needs that it is, again, currently ill-equipped to manage. Through November 2006 there are 118 male inmates currently living outside the division facilities. Need for Improved medical facllltles -In addition to the amount indicated above, it is also estimated that over $1.3 million per year is spent at local Bismarck hospitals to accommodate medical needs of the state pen. While under the best circumstances there would remain a need to use local medical facilities for surgeries and other specialized acute care, the instance of this use would be far less with modem medical facilities onsile. In addition, the need for security escort and transportation would be \u00b7 dramatically reduced as well. Many cells do not meet standards- Especially the oldest active part of the facility, the East Cell house. These cells are too small, do not offer services and required daylight per current American Correctional Association standards. Further, significant poriions of the facilities do not meet American Disabilities Act standards, alarmingly including the medical facilities. This puts additional pressure on the system, demanding more beds that the system does not currently provide. 's ~ East Cell house cell fronts and corridor. Open bars and cramped cells do not meet current standards for noise, light and space. The total population on January 1, 2007 of 1,238 inmates compares with current systems overall rated capacity for male beds of 1,011 beds. (Rated capacity may be exceeded in a given institution by increased double-bunking and other strategies). In fact, current population levels are actually outpacing the department's projections. Based on these number projections, the following chart indicates the number of beds being modified, and their type: Rillllrtlush, E11\\g, Hulsing I HOR Ardillecture, loc. EXISTING. 3 _, . . .

In each case, the location of specific facilities was carefully considered in tenns of their ability to best serve the entire facility. Further, a plan was devised to actually detennine that certain construction elements needed to be built, their relative impact on the overall facility. It would be recommended to build out all of the identified elements at one time, saving time, money and overhead costs. . -:--\"t ..,,,. \u00b7\u00b7. Existing facility site plan The first element of reconfiguring the beds is to build out the new orientation building and move the inmates from the existing 66-bed (North) unit into the new one. The North unij then becomes a general housing unit, providing space for 66 new general housing beds. The new orientation building provides 75 orientation beds, and 225 new general housing beds. In addition, the proposed of the project would include new infinnary beds, allowing the closing of existing medical beds, which are terribly inadequate. The construction of the new segregation building allows for the demolition of the east cell house. This demolition would make room for new housing, or other centrally '\u00b7~ located inmate service building. D .er~ ,1 ( As indicated earlier, the east Cell house was built in the early 1900's and is no longer considered adequate for its purpose. It contains 167 beds that need to be relocated within the facility, either in new or existing buildings. The first move would be the relocation of the south guard tower, and demolition of the existing warehouse. This would allow a consolidated south vehicle entrance, eliminating the need for others, with the exception of the kitchen loading dock entrance. All other vehicle access, including law enforcement, fire and ambulance service will enter in the new south sallyport Construct new orientation housing, processing and transfer services adjacent to the south vehicle sallyport. This will provide new beds to be utilized in the facility. The new orientation housing will be maximum security in its construction, and will be arranged in four separate pods, each having it's own purpose at the facility. Also included will be the Orientation processing center. All entry, exit and transfer activities for the entire facility will be centered in this facility, with emphasis on prescreening of inmates for medical and psychological special needs. The orientation processing facility will include staging, showers, property exchange, identification, health and mental health screening and initial information regarding rules and regulations at the facility. The transfer area includes waiting and storage of handcuffs and leg irons for transport of inmates. -- Orientation Housing Building, includes 2 pods dedicated to orientation at 50 and 25 beds each (on a pod double-bunked, one pod single-bunked), and 2 pods that would be general housing in their first configuration, housing 100 beds. They would be converted to orientation beds in the future as capacity increased. Additionally, during the winter of 2006 the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation entered a strategic planning process to proactively address the needs and requirements anticipated to occur over the next ten years and develop a plan to meet the identified needs. During the planning session it became evident that additional cells space would be necessary if long range population growth estimates would become a reality, Plans and estimates for an additional 125 beds were prepared using the same design and space formulas detailed throughout this report The medical clinic will be at the center of facility where all inmate activity crosses, and where response time is kept to a minimum throughout the entire facility. AND EXPANSION OF SPECIALIZED FACIUDES clinic will house medical staff, medical records and a pharmacy where a service window for pill distribution will be located off of a main corridor. The new clinic will indude staff offices, medical records, trauma rooms and exam rooms, x-ray facilities, physical rehabilitation facilities and other needed functions. The facilities will indude state-of-the-art equipment and finish materials. Zoning takes place within the unit to maximize separation of inmates from staff, and keeps records and pharmaceuticals at maximum security. Inmate privacy is stric\"y maintained in this unit with secure walls and doors. The infirmary should be located adjacent to the dinic, to maximize efficiency of medical staff. The infirmary is also close to orientation and orientation processing, linked by a corridor that connects this area to the\u00b7 south entrance into the facility. This makes the infirmary adjacent to ambulance access. The infirmary includes 10 acute care beds, 10 long-term care beds and special needs beds, including psychiatric observation. The beds are arranged in a way that they can swing where if there are more of one kind required than another, they can be accommodated. Segregation is arranged to be remote from the rest of the inmate population, and close to the facility vehide sallyport. Required natural light to cells is provided by security windows into each cell through semi-opaque glass, not allowing any view to the outside for segregation inmates. Segregation inmates are further isolated by having no electrical or television in their cells, and their shower privileges are unescorted and timed. Ritterbush, Elig, Hulslng / HDR Archttecture, Inc. ., ~ 3 Segregation will house 90 single-bed cells. Each unit will have its own showers and its own link to outdoor exercise. A new visitor's center is being recommended to alleviate activity at central control and to simplify the entry sequence into facility for visitors and staff. This new element would include video visiting technology, which would further save staff time used for processing visitors into the facility. The new laundry facility would be located near the kitchen loading dock area, and be more isolated than the existing laundry setup. This would take laundry out of the center of the facility, where a lot of activity takes place, and allow other, more important functions to take place at the center of the facility. The footprint required to build proposed square footage will necessitate the removal of the existing OCR Purchasing and Receiving building. The replacement building will be located on site in an area easily accessible to delivery vehide and will increase storage space by adding additional square footage to allow for commodity store outside the secure perimeter. Improved security design to limit contraband from entering the facilities will solve existing warehouse shortcomings. The final phase would be demolition and removal of the existing east Cell house. The following page indicates a suggested conceptual layout for the facility. RECOMMENDED SOLUTION .

NDSP Building NDSP Building House Project / Relocate new infirmary, east cell-house replacement and administrative segregation unit, and cost to demolish existing east cell-house NOTE: Transportation costs are not estimated in the above schedule due to the uncertainty regarding housing options. Transportation costs and staff levels are highly dependent upon the location of available prison beds. Under the Status Quo scenario noted above, transportation costs are likely to involve a material increase In staffing and costs. I I ... ~ousing- For the purpose of this schedule, It is assumed that ty jails would have a maximum capacity of 100 beds available umbers in excess of 100 would be housed in a private prison fac11 . No facility has been identified. Estimated daily rates are noted In attached supporting documents. I Medical -For the purpose of this schedule, It Is assumed that Inmates housed in private prison faciltties would access necessary health care through the facility in which they are located. This assumption only affects the Status Quo scenario. Medical costs under this scenario are included in the estimated dally rate. It is important to note, the amount estimated for medical Is based on DOCR history. It is likely that the costs to provide medical services to these inmates will be much higher than the estimate. Parole Rates-For the purpose of this schedule, it is assumed that parole rates will be negatively affected under the Status Quo scenario. Under this scenario a large number of Inmates are projected to be housed out-Of-state In a private prison facility. As a result those inmates will not be able to access programming that is key to obtaining parole. Est. Average# of Est.

I am here today to testify in support of HB1015, and in particular to emphasize the critical interface of treatment services between the Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation (DOCR) and the DHS. History of Service Collaboration Each of the 8 Regional Human Service Centers (HSCs) in North Dakota provides identified core services in the community for individuals whose illness, addiction, disability or conditions place them at risk of harm or institutional placement. They provide a safety net function for our vulnerable citizens. As a part of this role, DHS provides assessment and treatment services to those individuals living in the community who are under the supervision of DOCR Field Services on probation or parole status. Mental health and/or substance abuse services have been provided upon referral and are based on client need. , Growth in Service Demand - Changes in sentencing guidelines, particularly for drug-related offenses, have impacted the DOCR caseload. As you are aware, the percentage of incarcerated individuals with substance abuse and/or mental health problems has increased. In conjunction with this, the need for treatment services during and after incarceration has increased. The request for a Treatment Director position in the DOCR budget request will help to strengthen the treatment continuum and the joint planning of both agencies. In addition, overcrowding of correctional facilities has led to an increased focus on best practices and strategies for community intervention, including exploration of alternatives to incarceration and an increase in the number of individuals being paroled. For those individuals, it has become increasingly important that the appropriate level of aftercare -\u00b7 services be available to improve success rates. Historically, these services have been sought at the Human Service Centers. These factors contribute to an increasing number of referrals to the HSCs for treatment services. In SFY2006, 10% of referrals to the HSCs came from Probation & Parole; when courts are added, that percentage increases to 24%. These increases have come at the same time that HSC budgets have remained relatively flat. As a result, capacity to add a large number of new referrals has been limited, and DOCR experiences difficulty in accessing the levels of community treatment they may be seeking for optimal client success. 2 , Current Areas of Collaboration In addition to the 90-bed residential substance abuse treatment program at the State Hospital (Tompkins program) and traditional services through the HSCs as capacity allows, DHS partners with DOCR staff in the drug court efforts in ND, the community sex offender treatment program, and in assessment/transition activities. Attempt is made to match services with individual needs at the appropriate time. Staff of both agencies have ongoing communication in this effort. Electronic data systems allow us to better identify our shared clients and estimate unmet need. A \"snapshot\" look at HSC clients in March of 2006 identified that Probation & Parole referred 51 % of substance abuse clients being served by the centers; this was true of 8% of mental health clients. In total, DHS served 1,241 clients under community supervision in SFY2006, yet we recognize that gaps in the service continuum and - capacity level continue to exist. DOCR staff have identified the need for significant increases in community treatment services. Future Direction Most recently, we have convened a joint work group to focus on long\u00ad range needs assessment and prioritization. North Dakota Is a small state, and both agencies recognize the need for joint planning, problem solving, and reduction of duplication in providing services. Key areas needing attention at this time include: mental health needs of women transitioning from prison; complex treatment and community support needs of individuals dually diagnosed with both mental illness and substance abuse; expansion of drug court efforts; and ongoing capacity challenges. 3 , We are committed to working together to establish a continuum of treatment services that are both effective and efficient. The Department of Human Services supports the request of the DOCR for resources needed to further those efforts. Thank you for hearing my testimony; I will be glad to answer any questions. 4 House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Representative Chet Pollert, Chairman January 10, 2007 House Bill 1015 Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation Central Office Dave Krabbenhoft, Director of Administration Objective -Provide leadership, structure, and a coordinated delivery of correctional services within a \"what works\" philosophy o Administration o Human Resources o Financial Services/ Business Operations Accounting Budgeting Purchasing/ Procurement Inmate Accounts o Information Technology Hardware Support Software/ Application Support Communications o Training State and local correctional staff o Jail Inspections o Research Ongoing Reorganization (as resources permit) o Department Think vs. Division Think Finance/ Business Information Technology Treatment -dependent on requested treatment director position Allocated Budget o 07-09 Total Recommendation $4.6 million (I 00% general fund) 20 FTE (3.5 new fie) 75% Salary and Fringe Dept position reclass $'s New Positions o Treatment Director o JRCC Business Manager o 1.5 Temp to FTE (acct. tech) 25% Operating 13% IT costs o Management t Program: DEPARTMENT EXPLANATION OF PROGRAM COSTS The central office ( department administration) provides administrative, financial and technology services to all DOCR divisions.

HOUSE APPROPRIATIONS SUB-COMMITTEE REPRESENTATIVE CHET POLLERT, CHAIRMAN ROUGH RIDER INDUSTRIES DENNIS FRACASSI, DIRECTOR JANUARY 10, 2007 Included in my handout is a brochure we developed and use as a public relations tool to provide an overview of the Rough Rider Industries program. It basically speaks to why we exist, what we are trying to accomplish, how we go about it, and how our eligible customers have a stake in our success. When you look at Rough Rider Industries, I think it's important to point out that we don't hire inmates to build products -we build products to hire inmates. In other words, our primary focus is to provide inmates an incentive to be productive with their time of incarceration. The products we produce and sell to our eligible customers is simply a mechanism to fund our program without having to further burden ND taxpayers with the cost of incarceration. The fact that we take about 160 inmates off the hands of penitentiary staff and put them to productive work saves North Dakota taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars each year. Our mission can be summed up by saying \"our goal is to prepare inmates to become taxpayers instead of tax burdens\". Last session you granted us the authority to construct a new building at the Missouri River Correctional Center. We obtained a loan from the Bank of North Dakota, built a 9,000 sq. ft. building and formed a partnership with SturD Manufacturing of Carson, ND to produce agricultural implement products. Our agreement calls for RRl to supply the building and labor pool, and to provide for the training and security. SturD supplies the equipment, raw materials and handles all the sales and marketing of the products. We employ between 15 -20 inmates in skill areas that significantly increase their chances of obtaining employment upon their release. In fact, we are aware of several inmates who have found meaningful employment with ND businesses around the state since their release from prison. Another noteworthy project we started a little over a year ago is developing products for the child care industry. We have just recently signed a contract with Lakes & Prairies Community Action Partnership, Inc. of Fargo/Moorhead to handle the entire sales and marketing of the products we develop. Included on the last page of your handout are pictures of some of the products we have developed thus far. Nobody in the region is making products like this. In fact similar products found in catalogs are primarily made in China and distributed through national chains mostly located on the east coast. Most of these products will be made in Jamestown. This is a great opportunity to replace work we lost in Jamestown after Global Electric Motorcars was purchased by Damlier\u00ad Chrysler and began making seats in Detroit. Our Jamestown operation has struggled since losing the GEM business and has lost nearly a quarter of a million dollars in each of the past two years. If RRI was a private sector company, it would have shut down the Jamestown operation a long time ago. But we are not a private sector company and not having jobs for nearly 400 inmates housed at the JRCC is simply not an option. To address this concern, we relocated the upholstery business from Bismarck to Jamestown. That gives Jamestown a steady stream of business while we continue to build on the child care industry. It also helped us gain some efficiency for our furniture shop by moving drawer box assembly and final assembly into the vacated upholstery area. Our $14.8 million budget request for the 2007 -2009 biennium represents $8.3 million to meet our existing needs, $3 million targeted for a general issue of license plates, and $3.5 million targeted for growth. In the event we are successful in forming new partnerships in the national economy through the PIE program, it is imperative that we have adequate spending authority and the authority to hire additional staff to acconunodate any growth. Obviously, as a self-funded agency, we must be in a position to generate enough income before hiring additional staff or making expenditures beyond our present means. I have been granted permission by Bill Goetz, Pam Sharpe and LeAnn Bertsch to deviate a little from the governor's proposed budget to ask that our original request for four FTE's be restored. These are not general funded positions and would only be filled if appropriate revenue streams were made available to pay for them. We are always working on developing new business opportunities with the private sector, and it would be a shame to have to tum away any such opportunity for lack of available staff. It was the intent of our budget analyst to include these positions in our budget, but as you can imagine how difficult it is to prepare these budgets, it's easy to understand how this could have been overlooked. The four positions we are requesting to have restored are currently listed as an optional request on our budget. In closing, I ask for your continued support in granting this budget request with the flexibility to enable us to grow in a prudent and responsible fashion. We in tum, will continue to work hard in turning inmates from being tax burdens into taxpayers .

PRISON Does this word conjure up any positive thoughts? Probably not. Most of us have little sympathy for people who don't play by the rules. Today, over 1 ADO men and women are behind bars and razor wire 1n North Dakota's prisons. It is not a pretty place, nor should it be. Prison should be a place no one wants to go, yet it must not be a place entirely without. .. H-OP6 For many of these men and women behind bars, there is an opportunity to be productive with their time of \u00b7 incarceration. Inmates who are compliant with treatment, education, and avoid behavioral problems may earn a chance to work at Rough Rider Industries. Those who apply and are accepted into our program learn some of life's most valuable lessons. Lessons such as ... R6SPONSl'BILIT'( A regular work schedule, accountability for what they produce, teamwork, and managing money are foreign concepts to many inmates. Inmates learn skills, work ethics, and must use their earnings to pay fines, restitution, child support and provide for their own sundry items while incarcerated. Twenty-five percent of their earnings are also set aside in a savings account for when they are released. With over 97 percent of inmates returning to the streets from which they came, it is to your advantage and mine that we give them some legitimate way to survive 1n the modern American economy. Additionally, productive work helps prison management maintain ... t>ISCIPLINEi Our prisons are a small yet complex society; one that is difficult and sometimes dangerous to control. Real work has proven to be one of the most effective ways to manage prisons. Over the years we have learned that productive work reduces assaults and disciplinary problems and improves attitudes and positive interactions between inmates and staff. But, no matter how positive the results, we must pursue our mission prudently and responsibly with a sense of ... rAIRN6SS No one wants to take jobs from honest, hard working citizens. And we don't. To the contrary, we actually employ over 30 North Dakotans to run the program. And because we buy many of our raw materials, supplies and services from North Dakota businesses, we contribute to the North Dakota economy just like any other small business . Additionally, we have discovered ways to work in partnership with some North Dakota private sector businesses that would otherwise look for out-of - state companies to fulfill their needs. It Is truly a win\u00ad win proposition. Yet many people we talk to find it hard to believe that Rough Rider Industries is also.:. 6CONDMICAL The truth is, we pay our own way. No tax dollars are used In our program, All salaries, equipment, capital improvements, and operating expenses are paid from revenues generated from the sale of our products and services. You and I along with every other North Dakotan profits because what we do helps defray the huge tax bite required to run the prison system. And as you can Imagine, because we must be self-sufficient, the only way we can employ more inmates is to earn your business. And to do that, we must provide products and services of the highest. .. G2J.-lA LI TY,\u00b7' Many states throughout the country mandate that state agencies buy their products from prison industries. Rough Rider Industries does not support nor endorse those practices. We want the chance to earn your business. We believe the quality of our products speaks for itself as evidenced by the years of repeat business from many of our eligible customers. We have no formal warranty policy because we have never needed one. On rare occasions when our customers discover a problem with our products, they know we will address their concern to meet their satisfaction. Our products, our services, and our commitment to our mission create an atmosphere of ... SUCCEiSS Whether or not we reach our goal is in the hands of you, our eligible customers. Without your support, we are limited in the resources and methods available to Instill responsibility, discipline, and a sense of accomplishment in those who need It most. Their success is your success. Tomorrow morning, like every other morning of the year, inmates will be released from the penitentiary to join us side-by-side on the streets of North Dakota. Your purchasing power can improve the odds that they won't return. ' TESTIMONY ON HB 1015 SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE SENATOR RAY HOLMBERG, CHAIRMAN ROUGH RIDER INDUSTRIES DENNIS FRACASSI, DIRECTOR MARCH 5, 2007 Included with this handout is a brochure we developed for use as a public relations tool to provide an overview of the Rough Rider Industries program. It basically speaks to why we exist, what we are trying to accomplish, how we go about it, and how our eligible customers have a stake in our success. Our mission can be summed up by saying \"our goal is to help prepare inmates to become taxpayers instead of tax burdens\". Our $14.6 million budget request for the 2007 -2009 biennium represents $8.1 million to meet our existing needs, $3 million targeted for a general issue of license plates, and $3.5 million targeted for growth. In the event we are successful in forming private sector partnerships through the PIE program, it is imperative that we have adequate spending authority and the authority to hire additional staff to accommodate that growth. Obviously, as a self-funded agency, we must be in a position to generate enough income before hiring additional staff or making expenditures beyond our present means. I have been granted permission by Bill Goetz, Pam Sharpe and LeAnn Bertsch to deviate a little from the governor's proposed budget to ask that our original request for four FTE's be restored. It was not the intent to exclude these positions from the executive budget. These are not general funded positions and would only be filled if appropriate revenue streams were made available to pay for them. We are always working on developing new business opportunities with the private sector, and it would be shame to have to turn away any such opportunity for lack of available staff The four positions we are requesting to have restored are currently listed as an optional request on our budget. The House did not restore these requested positions. Our Budget Analyst Mr. 1 Joe Morrisette, informed me last Friday that the House felt if additional positions were needed throughout the biennium, I could go to the emergency comm1ss10n. Unfortunately, I don't believe that is an option for a special funded agency. Accordingly, I ask this committee to restore those non-general funded positions. The House did remove the $3 million from our budget request targeted for a general issue of license plates because, quite simply, it's not going to happen. Accordingly, our budget request is revised as follows: Salary and Fringe Operating Equipment General Issue Tags 4 NewFTE's Revised Total General Funds Special Funds $3,475,032 $10,548,282 $ 555,500 ($ 3,000,000) $ 294,342 $11,873,156 0 $11,873,156 Last session you granted us the authority to construct a new building at the Missouri River Correctional Center. We obtained a loan from the Bank of North Dakota, built a 9,000 sq. ft. building and have developed a small welding operation. We are currently building agricultural products for SturD Manufacturing of Carson ND, doing welding and assembly for DuraTech of Jamestown and we are exploring additional opportunities with several other local businesses. We employ between 15 -20 inmates in skill areas that significantly increase their chances of obtaining employment upon their release. In fact, several inmates have found meaningful employment in metal work with ND businesses around the state since their release from prison. Two years ago we started a sandbagging operation at the MRCC. We currently provide all the sandbagging needs for Dakota Fence Co. of Bismarck and Fargo as well as all the 2 sandbags used by Newman Signs of Jamestown. The sandbag operation is just one of many examples of synergies that exist between RRI and the private sector. It's a cost effective way for the private sector to address a need they don't like doing for themselves. This provides short term inmates something to do and a way to generate some income before their release. This also provides RRI with a revenue stream to help defray the rising costs of doing business in a restricted market. Another synergy we have been involved in for years is our work with the NDSU Hettinger Research Station. If you saw the MRCC properties about 12 or IS years ago, it would have looked like a sea of yellow. That's because the entire 900 plus acres ofland was covered with leafy spurge. Hettinger had a need for summer grazing of their sheep and we had to find a solution to combat the leafy spurge without using toxic chemicals along the river, wetlands and wooded areas. Since sheep will include leafy spurge in their diet, this became a viable solution that provided benefit to both agencies. Every spring we set up a crew of inmates to repair fences caused by winter damage in the seven containment pastures we built. Hettinger brings over 500 ewes to the property each spring. We in turn rotate the sheep from one pasture to another to mow down the spurge. Again, this provides work and income for inmates, a revenue stream for RRI, and a solution to Hettinger' s grazing needs. The last thing I want to make you aware of in regards to the MRCC is the work RRI has been involved in with the Missouri River Joint Board, the ND Water Education Foundation and the U.S. Corps of Engineers. These groups along with several other secondary interest groups are in the middle of a $250,000 federal grant being used to determine the feasibility of using all 9,000 lineal feet of prison riverbank for a Bank Stabilization and Aquatic Restoration Demonstration/Study. Some of the focus areas for this study include but are not limited to water quality, fishery food web, bank and bed stability, impact to islands and sandbars, above bank wildlife habitat, backwater areas, threatened and endangered species habitat, and the Oahe Reservoir delta. There is no better place along the entire Missouri River corridor than the MRCC to conduct this study. Much of this work to determine the feasibility of this project has already been 3 completed. Any remammg work will be completed in time to present to the 6 I st legislative assembly. Contingent of course, that a decision to sell the MRCC property is not made this session, in which case the project will come to an immediate halt. The knowledge derived from such a study has the potential to provide benefit to all North Dakota citizens, rather than the few who stand to gain if this land is sold for development. My point for elaborating on the RRI activities at the MRCC is to make you aware that the land is being worked and utilized in such a way that provides benefits to not only RRl and the penitentiary, but to private sector and other public agencies as well. With 401 years of collective correctional experience, those of us on the NDSP management team of which I am a part, see the merits this property brings to the big picture of corrections. That is why, when we submitted our budget to the governor for the $42 million plan, it did not include relocating the MRCC. Last year alone, RRl provided over 27,000 inmate man hours of work at the MRCC. That is significant considering our new building didn't open until July 2006. In addition to the work RRl provides, the MRCC has what it refers to as the general yard crew. These inmates clear deadfall from the woods, mow ditches and other areas around the facilities and provide all the firewood for the Native American Sweat Lodges at both the NDSP and MRCC. I don't know how many inmate man hours this activity provides, but my guess is that it may approach or exceed the 27,000 inmate man hours RRI provides. My greatest fear as to the outcome ofHB 1015 is that needs ofRRl is being overlooked in the complexity of the decision you are faced with to add prison beds. In 1997 we were given an unfunded mandate to establish a prison industry in Jamestown. A few years later we were given an unfunded mandate to help establish a prison industry for the women housed at New England. Please don't misunderstand me. Both mandates were absolutely the right thing to do and we were happy accomplish both mandates without having to ask for general fund assistance. But both mandates required a significant investment in time and dollars of which we have not yet recovered . 4 Unfortunately, whichever new building plan you choose, if we are asked once again in such a short time span to create new buildings and industries for an additional 255 -405 inmates at the current prison site, or on a new site, RRl will not have the resources to do so on our own. This will be especially true if the MRCC is relocated and we are not compensated for the hundreds of thousands of dollars we have invested in that property over the years. Even with general fund assistance, it will be difficult to replace the inmate man hours and revenue streams we have developed that play such an integral role in the way we operate today. In closing, I thank you for this opportunity to express my concerns as they relate to RRl and I ask that you not lose sight of the significance and important role RRl plays in the \"big picture\" of corrections .

The clientele we manage are high risk; they are all prison eligible. II is our intent that all offender supervision and release strategies utilized by the division be geared towards protecting the public as well as the interests of crime victims. We are achieving our goal. We are protecting the public and our crime victims as we effectively manage our offender population and reduce their recidivism rates. Our parole revocation rates remain incredibly low-21% versus 55% for the national average. Our parole population is growing dramatically! We may have stabilized the population of men going to prison for the first time in over a decade! -1 - 111) Let's review some charts. (Copies of data are also in your packet.) Key things to consider include: 1. Impact of parole -growing rapidly 2. Impact of our assessment center program -reducing the number of offenders going to prison 3. Court's increased use of felony probation sentences North Dakota offender demographics (as of December 31, 2006) A. We serve 4,813 offenders*. 4,233 are on probation (court jurisdiction) 372 are on parole (Parole Board jurisdiction) 589 are interstate transfer cases (Interstate Compact jurisdiction) B.

The total number of supervision types may be greater than the total number of offenders served. C. Staff testimonials. Written officer reports Parole Officer Ill Jennifer College Program Manager/Officer Barb Breiland Parole Officer Ill Corey Schlinger -2- IV) The building blocks of our success! A. Effective assessment strategies (that provide the court, the Parole and Pardon Advisory Boards, as well as the department, prompt information concerning offender criminal records and future criminal behavior risk factors): 1. Use of risk predicting assessment tools such as: LSI-R (all offenders) MnSOST-R, Static 99, Acute 2000, Stable 2000 (sex offenders) 2. Use of sentencing reports prepared between January 1, 2005 - December 31, 2006: 2,191 Parole/Pardon Advisory Board sentencing reports 1,092 pre-sentence reports 3. Department of Corrections Case Planning Committee \"We provide decision makers with the information they need in order to make good decisions!\" B. Evidence-based treatment and transition programming (that effectively reduces offender future risk): 1. Tompkins Rehabilitation and Corrections Center (Kerry Wicks) 2. Transition programming for men (BTC) 3. Transition programming for women (Centre, Inc.) 4. Re-entry programming 5. \u00bd way and \u00bc house placement 6. Department of Human Services programming (Nancy McKenzie) 7. In-patient treatment (North Central Correctional Rehab Center) 8. Teen Challenge .9. Assessment center programming 10. Proposed transition program to be sited in the Red River Valley C. Thoughtful Parole Board interventions that effectively assist the department in managing its inmate population (supported by our Institutional Offender Services Program -IOSP): 1. The Institutional Offender Services Program (IOSP) develops sentencing reports. The reports are utilized by the Parole and Pardon Advisory Boards, as well as the department. 2. IOSP is the administrative arm of the Pardon Advisory Board and the Parole Board. North Dakota was second in the nation with a 17% increase in the number of people on parole in 2005. Parole revocation -21 % in 2005 compared to a national average of 55%. (Parole Chairman John Olson to present) \"We are making more people attractive for release on parole; they are succeeding!\" -3 - D. Aggressive supervision/security measures (that reduce recidivism and protects the public): 1. Goal orientated/outcome based case planning 2. Drug Court program 3. Drug and alcohol testing 4. Surveillance program 5. GPS and traditional electronic monitoring 6. Home visits 7. Project Safe Neighborhood program 8. Polygraph 9. Operation Falcon/UVAP warrants 10. Sex-offender Specialist program E. Empathetic victim programming (that ensures that victim issues are met): 1. Manage VOCA/CVA programs. 2. Manage Crime Victims Compensation program. 3. Maintain a victim coordinator on staff to assist victims, the department, and the parole and pardon process. This reflects the victim coordinator's activity for the period January 1, 2005 -December 31, 2006. 1. Served 1,971 victims ii. Provided 3, 162 separate victim services 4. Holding offenders fiscally responsible. For court-ordered fiscal obligations. This reflects collections from cases terminated during January 1, 2005 -December\u00b7 31,2006. i. $2,924,176 restitution ii. $221,972 court costs iii. $454,060 fines iv. $678,328 fees v. $4,278,536 total For direct fiscal payments to the division. This reflects collections from January 1, 2005 -December 31, 2006. 1. $2,252,753 supervision fees ii. $114,402 interstate compact return fund iii. $2,367,155 total F. Serious consideration of future concerns for corrections in North Dakota: \u00b7 1. Caseload and delivery systems are heavily burdened and they may fail in the future. 2. Revocation rates for those under supervision will rise if workload issues are not addressed. 3. Less people will be attractive for parole release if workloads are not stabilized. -4- V) We are proud of what we do! A. Our staff is making a difference; they do a great job! Staff manages a large and risky population of offenders efficiently and effectively. B. Victims of crime, and the public at large, are well served by the Field Services Division. C. Our work is nationally recognized. We consult with other states on \"outcome based\" corrections program designs. We are also leaders on matters concerning the federal Interstate Compact for the Supervision of Adult Offenders. D. Our programming has reduced the growth of the cost of North Dakota corrections this biennium. The proposed budget for '07-'09 will accelerate our favorable impact on the department's budget!

DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS & REHABILITATION DIVISION OF FIELD SERVICES 05-07 Community Corrections Supervision and Treatment Programs The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation Field Services Adult Offender programs will follow the universal_ goal stated below. individual programs may state additional goals, objectives, and pe_rforrnance indicators-specific to the program. Goal: TO PROVIDE COST EFFECTIVE AND RESPONSIBLE ADULT OFFENDER POPULATION MANAGEMENT THROUGH A COORDINATED CORRECTIONS TREATMENT DELIVERY SYSTEM. COGNITIVE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMMING Cognitive Restructuring is a theoretical approach designed to reduce risk and increase public safety. This is accomplished by reducing risk through affecting change in an offender's attitude and beliefs resulting in criminal conduct. This approach is used in conjunction with our corrections treatment programming to ~nhanc~ the treatment outcomes and reduce risk behaviors. \u00b7 The principles of effective programming using the cognitive behavioral approach include using a validated assessment instrument to assess the offenders risk to re-offend and identifying criminogenic needs contributing to the offender's anti-social behavior. The Responsivity principle is referring-the offender to the specific program with the services to match with the offender's specific area of risk or need. This also considers the skills and specialized training for staff to deliver programs as designed to target high-risk offender populations. BISMARCK TRANSITION CENTER The BiSmarck Transtt:ion C-enter provides transitional treatment, eduCational and employment services to assist offenders/participants in achieving meaningful stability and lasting sobriety in their lives. This assistance is provided through program services that are cogn~ive behavioral in nature. Continuation of follow,up\u00b7 services and programs throughout the state are arranged_upon compl_etion of this program. The intent of transitional center programming is to design, develop and Implement innovative programs and strategies and deliver coordinated corrections treatment programming to enhance supervision of offenders in the community while reducing risk. This assists adult services with the enhancement of the infrastructure and aids in the management and transition of offenders in the community. FEMALE INMATE TRANSITION PROGRAM (FITP) Centre, Inc., a non-profit organization, with the DOCR, implemented the Female Inmate Transition Program in 2004. The Centre facility staff, in cooperation with the DOCR, manages the program delivery. The goal of the Transition Program is to diagnose and provide a continuum of community treatment and program services for females. The emphasis of treatment is on initiating and maintaining the recovery process. AH approaches are gender-responsive and consistent with a cognitive behavioral approach. The intent is to return the individual through a support system to assure success after receiving programming in this setting. TOMPKINS REHABILITATION AND CORRECTIONS CENTER (TRCC) The Tompkins Rehabilitation and Correction Center (TRCC) is a treatment center .for male and female inmates/offenders. The TRCC program is managed in cooperation between the DOCR and the ND State Hospital. There are 3 wards that require a minimum 100 days up to 150 days treatment, followed by community supervision. All wards consist of diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment planning. Family involvement, group and individual therapy, cognitive restructuring, education, A.A. meetings, therapeutic recreation therapy, structured social environment therapy are all utilized. Interdisciplinary invotvement, multiple treatment modalities and aftercare planning are ail accomplished. Specialized programs are available such as specific skills based approaches, and involvement from DOCR case manager. A solid foundation for discharge placement and aftercare is based on community placement criteria as determined by the DOCR. Appointments for aftercare are completed for every resltjent prior to discharge. NORTH CENTRAL CORRECTIONAL REHABILITATION CENTER (NCCRC) The North Central Correctional Rehabilitation Center (NCCRC) is a regional jail facility located in Rugby, North Dakota. A jail-based addiction treatment' center for male offenders is annexed to the traditional jail facility. The offender has a DSM-IV diagnosis of alcohol and/or other drug dependence and has legal difficulties that are exacerbated by alcohol and/or other drug abuse. A program requirement also provides for discharge placement and aftercare based on community placement criteria as determined by the DOCR. REENTRY PROGRAM The Re-entry program was started in 2002 as a Federal initiative supporting the cooperation of multiple service agencies to return youthful and higher risk offenders from prison to their community on parole. Offenders are identified upon admission to prison that meet the criteria for the Re-entry Program. It is mandatory offenders participate and complete recommended services. The program requires entering lnto a program agreement, which includes goals and objectives that focus on reducing risk\u00b7 by addressing criminogenic risk. The Re-entry program includes institutional and community treatment, participation in AA/NA, education and vocational training, employment, and community services. The program identifies the importance of faith-based relations. The second phase is the continuation of the program after release from prison to the community. The duration of an offender in Re-Entry in the community should be 1 year. DRUG COURT The Bismarck and Fargo Drug Court Program are court-supervised programs that target non\u00ad violent participants whose major problems stem from substance abuse. National statistics show the numerous benefits drug courts have on communities. Some of the benefits include alleviating pressure. of court dockets, reducing the revolving-door syndrome, quick access to chemical treatment, cost effective chemical treatment vs. $20,000 to $50,000 for one year of incarce_ration, and reduced recidivism rates. The drug court team consists of a district judge, probation officer/program coordinator, state's attorney, and contractual treatment provider. The district judge is responsible for judicial interaction. The program coordinator serves many areas including prpgram development and implementation. They are responsible for case management and probation supervision. The states attorney is responsible for the initial screening of applicants and is the conduit for program entry. The contractual treatment provider provides addictions assessments and recommendations for all defendants referred to the drug court program. Proposed for 07-09 are drug court programs in Grand Forks, Minot, and an additional drug court in Fargo. HALFWAY HOUSE The DOCR in cooperation with Centre, Inc. works toward the further development and implementation of correctional treatment services based on evidence-based practices. Centre, Inc. is a North Dakota nonprofit correctional agency that was formed in the mid 1970s to establish halfway houses as a cost-effective intermediate sanction as well as an adjunct to parole and probation supervision. Halfway houses assist Field Services, the courts, and mainstream public agencies in providing community-based offender services. The role of Centre Inc. has been to provide for the public safety by offering specialized programs in the state that can effectively monitor and house offenders outside the institutions and jails . 2 QUARTER HOUSE The DOCR in cooperation with Centre, Inc. entered into a contractual arrangement for the Quarter House facility in Fargo, ND. The strategy is to better manage resources and effectively provide timely and appropriate housing with levels of services and accountability in a most cost effective manner. The population served is probation and parole offenders completing or enrolled in corrections treatment programming to support their recovery and/or continued reduction in risk. Offenders should demonstrate the knowledge and skills to support their functioning in this less restrictive facility. Offenders requiring a higher level of services in transition, such as the halfway house, may be phased toward the Quarter House facility. This strategy provides staff a better opportunity to monitor an offender's progress and activities in the community with the offender assuming greater responsibilities. TEEN CHALLENGE North Dakota Teen Challenge is a faith-based, non-profit, thirteen to nineteen month residential inpatient recovery program for adult men and women struggling with life controlling problems such as drug addictions and viqlence. Teen Challenge is a rigidly structured environment with each day filled with ,classes, counseling, work detail, chapel, and recreation. Students are not allowed to work while in this program. North Dakota Teen Challenge was awarded the pilot project on September 1, 2005. North Dakota Teen Challenge was originally located in Williston, North Dakota. In September of 2005, due to the growth and need for a larger facility, North Dakota Teen Challenge moved to Mandan, North Dakota. In June of 2006 North Dakota Teen Challenge opened a women's facility In Bismarck, North Dakota. SEX OFFENDER SUPERVISION Sex Offender Specialists (SOS) supervise sex offender-specific caseloads in Bismarck, Mandan, Minot, Jamestown, Grand Forks, and Fargo. The SOSs are highly trained in the dynamics of sexual offending and work closely with IC>Cal Task Forces, law enforcement and other agencies to provide critical monitoring and supervision of sex offenders. Specialists are responsible for writing all sex offender presentence reports in the state. Sex Offender Specialist Liaisons (SOSL) are located in Wahpeton, Dickinson, Williston, Rolla, Grafton, and Devils Lake. They, too, have been trained to provide appropriate supervision to the sex offenders they supervise. Community safety is a priority for all officers supervising sex offenders. Assessment of risk is an important job duty of all officers supervising sex offenders. Assessment tools include the Minnesota Sex Offender Screening Tool-Revised (MnSOST-R), Static 99, Level of Services Inventory-Revised (LSI-R), Stable, and Acute. Officers understand they must always be cognizant of risk and potential risk factors since undeterred or with no intervention, sex offenders can reoffend. Sex\u00b7 Offender Containment Task Forces assist in determining which offenders will be placed on Global Positioning System (GPS) and the length of that placement. GPS is a tool that assists in monitoring the physical locations of offenders and can provide \"real time\" or historical data. It should \u00b7be noted that placement on a GPS unit does not prohibit offenders from committing further criminal offenses. Sharing Intelligence is critical to the local law enforcement, treatment providers, victims' advocates, local prosecutors, polygraph operators, and parole/probation officers in sustaining community safety and, as such, Field Services is an advocate of the Containment Model of supervising sex offenders. ELECTRONIC MONITORING/ GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) Electronic monitoring and global positioning systems are tools that can assist parole/probation officers to monitor and supervise offenders. Electronic Monitoring uses technology and equipment to provide the capability to monitor an Offender's compliance with curfew, house arrest, or home detention conditions of supervision. Active monitoring provides a confirmation of the offender's complian\u00b7ce within a pre-established range in their 3 residence. Schedules may be approved to allow work release or other activity beyond the established residence within restricted times. New technology integrates Global Posifioning Systems (GPS) with electronic monitoring to include mapping an offender's travel within the community. This technology allows identifying zones or restricted areas that will provide an alert via e-mail, or cell phone text message when the offender enters an exclusionary or restricted zone. There are two types of GPS monitoring -active and passive. An active system gives the user a real-time report of an offender's movements and provides real-time alerts, including restricted-zone violations. The passive system provides a history of the movements of the offender during the past day. The information on a passive system is downloaded in the evening and a report given to the parole/probation officer the next day. JAIL PAROLE VIOLATOR A parole violator awaiting further disposition and their return to prison may be held in jail pending further outcome. Elevated risk to re-offend warrants an offenders return to Incarceration. 3-DAY HOLD PAROLE HOLD A parole violator experiencing relapse in their recovery or other technical violations may require detention as an intervention to reestablish the offenders treatment in the community. Author~y is provided Field Officers to use this time to further evaluate and implement the services recommended for the offender in the community. Evaluation of the offender's risk to re-offend determines if the risk can be effectively reduced with community corrections treatment intervention and supervision. ASSESSMENT CENTER PROGRAM . . ,,\u00b7 Best practices to manage and treat offenders in the Interest of public safety and to reduce risk to re-offend requires knowledge of the offender's risk and needs. Validated assessment and evaluation is most often needed to determine the level of treatment to make the referral to a DOCR or Court approved treatment program. The assessment phase requires no less than ten days and up to sixty days. During this time an assessment team conducts a thorough evaluation and recommend treatment programming. The Assessment Center Program is\u00b7 a cooperative effort between the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and another private or public agency to provide further assessment and evaluation of offenders. It is a program that can be up to 60 days and provides for a thorough assessment for offenders requiring evaluation and stabilization in a controlled environment. Each offender referred has a corrections treatment plan written to include addressing the risk domains of the Levels of Services\u00b7 Inventory-Revised and state the recommended treatment programming targeting the criminogenic needs and risk. RAPID TREATMENT INTERVENTION PROGRAM (RIP) Relapse Programming targeted for an offender provides intervention and an alternative for offenders under parole supervision in the community who demonstrate relapse after successfully completing primary treatment and aftercare. Often the appropriate and timely response will intervene on what often results in a rapid decline in an offender's risk behaviors. Parolees are returned to the North Dakota Parole Board with the. recommendation to complete the Rapid Intervention Program. They are placed at the Missouri River Correctional Center or the Tompkins Rehabil_itation and Correction.al Center (TRCC) to complete the program and be returned to the community on parole status. LOW RISK OFFENDER SUPERVISION The ND DOC&R Division of Field Services uses the Levels of Services Inventory-Revised (LSI-R) to assess an offenders level of risk, and targets specific high-risk offenders to be managed by the most skilled and trained staff. When offenders are placed on supervision, their cases are scored by a shortened \"proxy'' version of the LSI-R, and they may be placed immediately into a Low Risk Supervision Program. Cases are also reassessed every six months on the LSI-R, which may also refer them into the Low Risk Program. The Low 4 ) ) ... Risk Offender Supervision Program allows lower risk offenders to be managed with less intensity and supervision. Most offenders in the low-risk program are supervised by Community Corrections Agents employed by the DOCR, but some ane monitoned by contracted agencies outside the Division. Low-risk offenders are generally those that are felt to offer less risk in the community, and have fewer issues to address on their cases supervision plans. Some offenders are not deemed appropriate for low-risk supervision based on their current or past offenses, and will not be allowed in the program regardless of their risk score. Offenders that comply with the conditions of probation may remain in the low-risk program throughout the period of their supervision, while those that do not comply will be placed on the caseloads of a Parole/Probation Officer for more intensive supervision. RED RtVER VALLEY MALE INMATE TRANSITION PROGRAM (PROPOSED FOR 07-09) The Bismarck Transition Center and the Female Inmate Transition Program are models to implement the services to meet the need for a male inmate population in transition to eastern North Dakota, primarily in the southeast. JAIL or OTHER COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT (PROPOSED FOR 07-09) The offender has a DSM-IV diagnosis of alcohol and/or other drug dependence, has legal difficulties that are exacerbated by alcohol and/or other drug abuse and is willing to be involved in this diversionary program and comply with treatment recommendations and requirements of a DOCR approved treatment program . 5 Offenders on Community Supen\u00b7ision ND DOCR Field Services Division One Day Counts on December 31 of Each Year @ ___ Supervision Typ~ __ , 1993 1994 1995 1996 _ 1997_ 1998 ,,n, Parole 91 95 112 100 117 175 152 115 117 148 228 239 287 366 Inmates in Commun_ity_Program_s_:_ _ __ __ _ __ h offenders may be on multiple types of supervision at the same time.

From: Keller, Becky J. Sent: Tuesday, March 06, 2007 4:24 PM To: Pollert, Chet A Cc: Smith, Jim W Subject: community services Representative Pollert, This email is in response to your question relating to the 2005-07 biennium funding for community services grants within the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The department had requested, for the 2005-07 biennium, a total of $380,000 from the general fund for community services grants. Although the Legislative Assembly did not specifically reduce this funding, it did remove $226,748 from the general fund added by the Governor to replace a number of federal fund reductions in the adult services division. After the session, the department reprioritized its funding available and made the decision to reduce the funding for community services grants from $380,000 to $180,000 and as a result is providing the grants to these community services organizations for the first year of the biennium only. Please contactlhis office if you have questions or need additional information. Becky Keller Fiscal Analyst ND Legislative Council Staff 328-2916 3/6/2007 NORTH DAKOTA COUNCIL ON ABUSED WOMEN'S SERVICES COALITION AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT IN NORTH DAKOTA 418 ~ast ndcaws@ndcaws.org House Budget Committee Human Resources Subcommittee Chet Poller!, Chair January 17, 2007 Testimony on HB 1015 Re: Crime Victims Compensation Fund Chair Poller! and Members of the Committee: My name is Bonnie Palecek and I am speaking on behalf of the ND Council on Abused Women's Services/Coalition Against Sexual Assault in ND. I need to express grave concerns about the viability of the ND Crime Victims Compensation Fund. As you know, the Crime Victims Compensation Fund is a Fund which compensates victims of violent crime for damages they have experienced as the result of that crime. For example, it would reimburse medial expenses for victims of domestic violence, funeral expenses for a victim of homicide, forensic and medical expenses for a child sexual abuse victim. The Fund is a payer oflast resort. Insurance must be billed first. Funds to any individual are capped at $25,000 per violent crime. Funeral expenses are capped at $3,000. In addition to compensating for physical damages, the Fund can also reimburse for counseling services. The intent is to'hlake the victim whole;'at least insofar as monetary reimbursement can do that. The funding mechanism is such that the federal government portion is based on what the state has spent in the previous year. The state is compensated at a rate of 60% of the previous years expenditures. + The Fund has been a godsend to victims of violent crime in North Dakota and in 49 other states. Claims are considered in a timely manner, and there seems to be an efficient and effective base of collaboration between law enforcement, the advocacy network, and the Department of Correction's Crime Victims' Compensation administrator. Here is the problem, however. The Fund has not been operating is the black for at least the last four bienniums, and things are getting worse. Right now, CVCF is almost a year behind in reimbursing service providers and victims. Rates to providers are already reimbursed at 80% of the going rate (for example to hospitals or therapists). In addition to that contribution, however, providers now have to wait nearly a year for their 80% reimbursement. Some small private providers such as private practice therapists, are being stretched thin and may not be able to carry bills for an extended period of time much longer . 683-5061 642-2115 572-0757 We have been told that for this biennium money has again been \"fuund' on a one time basis, to cover the additional costs this biennium. We need a more solid fix. Applications for the Fund have grown from 142 applications for assistance in 1997 to 224 in 2005 to 302 in 2006. No additional funding has been added, with the result that the Fund goes deeper and deeper into deficit spending each biennium. This is no way to do business, and it is doing a real disservice to victims. Claims for domestic violence assaults account for 6.34% of the total; domestic violence homicides, 1.90%, and sexual assault, 5.23%. The others,?% of claims are paid for victims of other violent crimes. They truly have no one to speak for them, and they are among our most vulnerable citizens, victims of drunk drivers, hit and run crimes and physically and sexually abused children. We had hoped that this would be the year to establish solvency for the Fund, but have since learned that no additional funds are included in the Department of Corrections budget. This is very disturbing to us. At minimum, we felt that you should be made aware of the sorry state of this important financial resource for victims of violent crime. We would urge you to do what you can to stabilize this funding. Thank you.

From: Foughty, Donovan [DFoughty@ndcourts.gov) Sent: Wednesday, Emmer, Warren R. Subject: HB 1015-Support Governors Executive Budget for 10.2 FTE's Warren please submit this email as my comment in support for more field probation officers. There is a need for more probation officers in the northeast quarter of the state. My experience is that because of the heavy case loads probationers are less likely to succeed on probation. I seem to be revoking a lot of probationers within six months of probation placement. In our part of the state probation officers are even more critical in that we do not have services such as halfway houses to assist in supervision. There is a philosophy that if probationers foul up they should go to prison. For the most part I agree with that position. However the possibility for success increases when there are more contacts and tighter supervision by probation officers. In the long run we are all better off if we can keep the nonviolent offenders out of jail, working and receiving services outside the pen. Probationers are not only obligated not to commit crimes but to be employed, follow through with treatment, aftercare and pay child support along with numerous other standard and unique conditions that may be put in place based on the circumstances. Probation officers are needed to insure that probationers are following through. Often revocations take place not because of new crimes but rather failure to follow through with conditions set out in the appendix A. I ask that Warren attach an Appendix A for your review. Probation officers with case loads over 100 cannot provide adequate supervision. Please look favorably on the request of DOC&R. Donovan Foughty Presiding Judge Northeast Judicial District 02/28/2007 ------ ----- --------------~ WRITTEN TESTIMONY FROM DISTRICT JUDGE, ROBERTWEFALD It was good talking with you Page 1 of2 Emmer, Warren R . From: Wefald, Robert [RWefald@ndcourts.gov] February 22, It was good talking with you Dear Representative Metcalf: It was good talking with you this morning in our chance encounter. Thank you for remembering our time in the service of our country! As you enjoyed your 41 years in the Guard I enjoyed my 3 years of active duty in the Navy and my 24 years in the Naval Reserve. You asked me what could be done to help us judges in sentencing, and I replied that nothing needs to be done as what we as judges do in sentencing works quite well. The real question is what happens when a defendant gets in the system. First of all I should tell you that no one wants anyone to go to jail or prison. As a society we would all be happy if everyone obeyed the rules and stayed out of trouble. But with some people that just isn't going to happen. Most people who do get in trouble with the law are essentially self correcting and once they have been in court and their cases have been resolved society will never have any real problem with them again. For some it takes a couple of experiences before they get control of their lives. And there are some who never get the message. You should know that first time offenders seldom go to jail or prison unless they really commit a really serious crime. We try to get their attention through a suspended sentence or a deferred imposition of sentence which for many defendants works very well. Basically a defendant has to work pretty hard to get sent to prison, but we will certainly allow them to go to prison as they continue to fail to follow the rules. I tell people that I don't sentence anyone to prison. People sentence themselves to the maximum time in prison allowed for the crime they have committed. All I do when they are convicted is limit the time they get to be in prison and sometimes I don't let them go to prison or jail at all and sometimes I let them go for the maximum time for their crime. We have all the authority we need to properly sentence defendants convicted of crimes. All of us judges simply sentence a convicted defendant to the custody of the sheriff or the Department of Corrections. It's up to the sheriff or warden to decide how the prisoner is to be handled while doing the time to which the prisoner was sentenced. We frequently require evaluations or recommend treatment at the TRCC, but it is not our job to tell the warden or the sheriff how to do their jobs. At the end of my one and only term as Attorney General on December 31, 1984, there were 434 inmates in the system. That was up from 326 when I took office. Today there are over 1200 inmates in the system which means the inmate population tripled in just over 22 years. The population of our state has stayed the same or decreased a little since 1984. I suspect most of that increase is due to drugs or crimes related to drugs. I have often thought that for the truly drug addicted prisoners we need a separate secure treatment facility, but that would take a substantial increase in treatment staff. You suggested that you were considering 02/28/2007 lt was good talking with you Page 2 of2 a separate treatment unit within a new or remodeled prison. But whatever is done, the major cost in success will not be bricks and mortar, but treatment staff and appropriate treatment programs. My perception of the reality of the situation right now is that effectively whenever I sentence someone to the custody of the ND DOC they have to parole some other prisoner. In other words it's sort of like pushing marbles into a pipe full of marbles. Every time one.goes in one has to come out. I'm sure that an exaggeration, but I believe there is a lot of truth in that statement. Personally I believe that once a prisoner gets a good taste of prison and has settled down, that placing more prisoners on parole or probation in the first instance is a good idea. The only problem is the number of probation officers as you must have enough probation officers to successfully handle and monitor all of the prisoners on parole or probation. And I think ii is cheaper to hire probation officers than ii is to pay for more bricks and mortar, and additional prison staff. And in the long run I think it will be better for the prisoners and for society. I think these people should be working for a living, supporting their families and paying taxes. I think they need to know how society expects them to act and function. I believe more of them can get that message when they are more closely supervised or parole or probation. Having said that, I am amazed at the number of probationers who cannot follow the simplest rules such as don't use drugs, stay in touch with your probation officer, etc. But a lot of them successfully make it on probation or parole, and that success is ultimately better for society. There may be a few bumps along the way, but in the long run I believe more probation officers is cheaper and more effective. I am going to share this with my colleagues as I know they also have many interesting insights and opinions on prison, jail, parole and probation. If you would like to do so, please fell free to share my comments with your colleagues in the Legislature. It was great to visit with you!

Dave 328-6135 Reduction in Recidivism April 2007 Transitional Jobs Program (TJP) Is a practical workforce strategy that uses time-limited, wage-paying jobs that combine real work, skill development, and supportive services, to transition participants rapidly and successfully in the labor market; and This strategy offers a model of employment where participants learn through experience the customs and routines of work, acquire work-task skills, establish an employment record, and generate employer references to enhance their competitiveness in private sector employment. Population Served Populations served are typically limited to people with multiple employment obstacles or limited work experience. This includes individuals with criminal records. Why do persons with criminal records benefit from Transitional Jobs? Increases stability during the immediate transition from incarceration into the community by providing cash income to help cover living expenses and by fostering a positive routine and realistic hope for moving into permanent employment; Allows time to get reestablished as productive members of the workforce while building a work history for their resumes; Provides an opportunity to prove key facets of employability such as reliability and trustworthiness, leading to strong references that are instrumental when seeking unsubsidized employment; and Offers linkages to community supports and help with managing time for competing demands, such as parole officer meetings and finding housing. Recidivism in North Dakota ND has relatively the same rate of recidivism as the national average of 50% In 2006, 1071 individuals were released from state and federal prisons within the stateofND It costs approximately $29,000 per year for an individual to be incarcerated in the ND prison system Statistically, 535 of the 1071 released will re-offend and cost ND approximately $15.5 million per year to be re-incarcerated I Based on the above statistics, if the released individuals had access to a Transitional Jobs Program in ND the following would occur based on statistics of other Transitional Jobs Programs across the country: Enrolled in TJP for 3 months -of the 535 people who will statistically re-offend that number will decrease to 428 (20% decrease). Enrolled in TJP for 6 months -of the 535 people who will statistically re-offend that number will decrease to 69 (87% decrease). Savings to North Dakota Example: If the 535 people released from the ND prison system were enrolled for 6 months into a Transitional Jobs Program that would mean 466 of those people would be employed. This would save ND approximately $13.S million by assuring that re\u00ad incarceration does not occur. This statistic does not include the cost of court fees. The economic impact of these individuals working and contributing to the ND economy is in the millions of dollars. Transitional Jobs Programs Work and Reduce the Rate of Recidivism! T JPs provide an opportunity for employment, income for individuals transitioned from the prison system, stability, a positive economic impact to ND and safer communities. If you would like any additional information please feel free to contact me.

I can think of two cases right off top of my head that my life was in imminent danger. The first was as a police officer and I was attacked by a subject with a knife while he was under the influence and the second was with P and P and I was in the Sherman house just a couple days prior to the shoot out. These things don't typically happen with other cases. I have been with Parole and Probation for 4 years. The first two I supervised mosUy Meth cases. There was always a sense of danger and I had to draw my weapon several times. Over the last two years I have not been supervising meth cases and I feel much safer during my home visits and my day to day operations. In summery, meth is dangerous. --Original Message---~ -Grp-DOCR Parole & Probation from Bertsch Hello Everyone, Director Leann Bertsch is asking everyone's assistance in getting some information.

Hoornaert, Chad FW: Request from Leann Bertsch Obviously now that I am working in the TRCC program I am seeing it in the treatment aspect of things, and am starting to see the effects it has on the \"system\" ie, medical, financial etc. But my thoughts return to the field. I think that in this line of work we should obviously always be prepared for the unexpected, but I think with the meth, the rules change. It makes for acitivities in the field that should be \"everyday\" type of bussiness, something where you never know what you will encounter. Mothers leaving there kids in cars for hours in the middle of winter while they are in someone's residence or bar getting high; cooking meth in the house with the kids right there. I've witnessed social services taking screaming kids from a meth home, I knew it was the best thing for them but it's still hard to see especially when I knew the mother loved them, but was letting meth control her life. One case that I always think of regarding meth is, I supervised a young gal who lived on her grandparents farm near Ardoch, ND. Grandparents were not around anymore, her parents lived on the neighboring farm. We were able to take down a meth lab at this residence; numerous arrests from that residence, siezed property, etc. Days later this gals father stopped at the house to check on things while his daughter was in jail. He encountered 3 young males in their 20's, who were strung out on meth, and destroying the inside of the house looking for\u00ad either their meth or money that was given for ii. When he tried to stop them they nearly beat him to death. That man knew that his daughters meth addiction would affect his family, but not in that way.

If you could respond by to Leann by next Monday it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your help! Barney Leann K. FW: Request from Leann Bertsch I guess I would not be the best to describe how meth has changed my job, since I am fairly new. Meth-has been around longer than I have. I can provide insight on how it impacts my job. To sum it up, issues related to meth are my job. I supervise a diverse range of cases from drug cases, property crim_e cases, bad checks, violent offense; and driving offenses. It seems no matter what the offense someone is on probation for, meth seems to play a part in many of the underlying offenses. Meth a/so plays a part in violations or new offenses while on probation. Of all the violations I see, those related to meth are always the most severe. It seems those who are involved in the use of meth lose control so quickly, by the time I catch up with them it is too late (most have been charged with new felony offenses). Meth takes over their lives and it does not take long for things to fall apart. It is odd to watch someone's life fall apart in any and all ways possible and they are oblivious to it. Due to how quickly this happens, treatment is difficult. If I can catch someone using early on, it is still difficult, as it takes around a month or two just to get someone in for a Chemical Dependency Evaluation, and probably a few weeks longer to get into treatment Many find their way into further trouble prior to making it to treatment. I realize we have taken steps to remedy this, and the Assessment Center is working well to address the time it takes to get someone into treatment. The next issue is if treatment is working. I have only been around for two years and see the same people involved in meth over and over. I am not discounting the efforts or methods of treatment programs, but I do see a terribly high rate of relapse. In my short time here, meth seems to be the most difficult addiction to treat. Meth is something that is on my mind every time I go into an offenders home, confront an offender on the street, conduct a probation search, or even see an offender in my office. I have never been involved in a situation where I have had to use physical force as a Parole Officer, but am convinced it is just a matter of time. I have witnessed numerous offenders under e influence of meth and although now immune, was initially shocked at the erratic behavior. The unpredictability ofthosr der the influence definitely shapes how I conduct myself as a Parole Officer. Violence and unpredictability seem to be a -product of meth use. In my short tenure as a Parole Officer, I have seized many weapons ranging from knives to loaded handguns. Most of these were seized from meth users. Another concern is the impact I see meth having on children or others in the home. Recently during a probation search of one of my offenders, I arrested a 21 year old female who was about 4 months pregnant that admitted to using meth within the past two days. She had visible infected track marks on her arms. Seized were several syringes and other meth paraphernalia. She also had a 2 year old child in the home. II is astounding to see someone do something so horrible for a drug! Another concern is with the effectiveness of recent legislation on stopping local manufacture of meth, it has opened the market to larger out of state traffickers and dealers. I have personally seen an influx of out of state traffickers/dealers coming into the area to fill the void in supply. Many are gang members trying to comer the market. This is done by intimidation and violence. This is evident by recent arrests and seizures of large amounts of meth or money. My concern as a Parole Officer is the people trafficking meth are often very dangerous. Unfortunately, many of the traffickers recruit our local offenders to distribute meth for them. This puts me, as a Parole Officer, in direct contact with these people. If I do have a case that does not involve meth, the above concerns are lessened greatly. Relapses are not a severe, officer safety is not as heightened, and violence is not as prominent. Of course there are exceptions, but meth seems to be the least common denominator in all of these concerns. I could-probably go on for many more paragraphs, but won't. It seems no matter what the underlying crime, meth is involved in a large majority. Any cases involving meth usually result in the most serious violations (normally new felony convictions). Any case involving meth poses the greatest risk for officer safety. Any case involving meth also poses the greatest risk to those around the person involved with meth, specifically children. ,Ain Heidbreder ~Wiro!e Officer II - \u00b7--210 2nd Ave NW, 2:41 PM Bertsch, Leann K. Information on meth cases In the 25 years that I have been in this business, I ti ave never seen anything that has impacted our work like meth has. Not only has it lead to a significant increase in the number of offenders that we supervise, but it has changed the profile of the offender. Meth has proven itself to be highly addictive and very difficult to treat. Treatment programs have had to increase in length and intensity, and the success has decreased. It has put a tremendous burden on the treatment programs throughout the state, and the available services are lacking. I have seen meth tear apart good people and good families. It's impact isn't just with our department, but with society in general. As far as the offenders, we have seen more severe addictions, and often at a much earlier age. The offenders have little respect for authority and are often difficult people to deal with. We see more mental health problems than in the past and I attribute at feast part of that to the meth. My greatest concern is that our offenders are becoming increasingly violent and dangerous. I worry about our staff doing home visits much more than I had in the past Our staff spend counUess hours trying to get help and services for the _meth addicted offender, but far too often they continue to violate and get involved in the court system. Meth has strained resources statewide like nothing else I have ever seen! I wish there was a quick fix for the problem, but I know there isn't. It's scary looking at what the drug can do, and that it can affect almost any family. I worry about staff every day as we do our work in the field, as we never know for sure what we will walk into. If you would like anything else, please feel free to give me a calf. 1 Bertsch, Leann K. Bertsch, Leann K. Meth use/supervision of probation I have been working for DOC R for past 6 years in the Williston office. I think you know the Meth problem is prevelent all over the state but in Williams Co /AG office has had some programs to assist withe Meth production with one being placing locks on Andyrous Ammonia tanks. I feel that this has deterred on thefts of Ammonia but what varous LE has stated that some dealers go to Montana to steal their ammonia. In addition the legislature passing laws to deter the buying the sudafed in large quanities. But when I first started, the Meth labs were plentiful. Currently, the info that our office has heard from LE and offenders that the meth is being imported from larger metropolitan areas such as Billings/Denver. The changes in our duties would be: 1 ). Spending more time in the field monitoring conditions, ie drug searches, uas, checking offenders associations 2). We sps>nd time following up w/families/looking at alternative methods to cope with their addiction such as treatrnen~ daily reporting and varoius counseling. Many times we spend unlimtited time with high-risk addicts to meth. We as officers -feel that some other offenders are not getting the same focus/supervision. 3). Family issues are often affected. Mothers are using drugs resulting in their children placed in foster care/ alternative housing for the kids. This is the sades! effect that Meth has done which I can see . . With the higher case loads we just can not monitor every offender effectively. Our case loads have dramatically creased as you know /you have 21llowed for more staff but it seems that we still have issues w/proper supervision. It has been very challenging working with the meth addiction. Lloyd B Haagenson Probation Officer II ND Dept of Corrections Williston Office PM Bertsch, Leann K. Meth Afternoon - The largest change is to our caseload -- In October of 04 -the total caseload was 159 probationers for 2 PO's and 1 CCA. Today, I collected some statistics for probationers: 63 on probation for Methamphetamine Possession/Manufacturing charges; 67 on probation for Possession of Drug Paraphernalia (Both Meth and Mari) 24 on for Marijuana Possession or other Drug Charges 21 on Probation for Non-Drug Related Charges, but have used Meth since being on probation 243 Total probationers for 3 PO's and 1 CCA on November 1, 2006. And workload has gone up accordingly, with active meth users coming in to the office more often (soine every day, some three times a week) and needing to be UA'ed and monitored. When I first started in 2001, it didn't seem like we had so many families or couples on probation, but now it has changed -- ce 7 Married Couples 5 Parent & 1 Child 4 Siblings 4 Family with 3 or more members on probation -1 family has 5 members on probation. 1 Leann Bertsch People on meth are not the same person as they were before they started using it. It simply changes their brain functioning and personality, once used habitually, for a period of weeks or months. And not simply on the \"high\" as with alcohol or marijuana, but all the time. It used to be fairly simple to catch a marijuana user. The drug stays in their system for such a long period of time and usage can be caught 3 to 4 weeks down the road. Another reason it's easier to catch a pot head than a meth head is that pot users are pretty stationary when they are using. Get high and kick back and relax Meth users have been known to travel over a several county area to get their product or materials needs to produce the product. Instead of staying in one place and \"vegging out'' like a pot smoker, meth users may be literally awake for several days, even weeks, at a time and doing God-knows-what all hours of the day and night They will do steal from anybody and lie to anyone to make sure they get to their next high. Also, meth will only show up in a urine test 2-3 days, maybe 4, after usage. Often times, a person can clean up their act for a few days before seeing their PO and pass their UA. This can only go on until their addiction is so out of control that community resources (i.e. probation, community treatment) is no longer a viable option. Or usually, the person knows they are in trouble and absconds so they can continue feeding their addiction, and in the process commit more crimes while on the run. I'd highly recommend reviewing the Prisoner's of Meth interviews that aired on Community Access TV. Mark (i.--Orlglnal Message--v m: Tomanek, -Grp-DOCR Parole & Probation from Bertsch Hello Everyone, Director Leann Bertsch is asking everyone's assistance in getting some information.

Response to request for meth information I have a few things in mind about the meth issue. First, offenders using meth puts the probation officers safety in jeopardy more than prior. What I mean by that is that offenders under the influence of meth are volatile, hostile, and you don't know what they are going to do from one second to the next. Searching many residences of offenders on meth has shown me that they can live in an environment absolutely repulsive to the average person (and many times their children are living in that same environment). Garbage, food, \"stuff' all over the house, dirty needles, weapons (due to the paranoia they can experience) all adds to that \"meth environment\". I think PO's are dealing more and more with social services when they find these environments with children in them. Then take into account the danger of mobile meth labs and that whole issue. Officers never know what they are walking into when doing these home visits, especially the unscheduled home visits. Meth use also has social implications. I think the meth use has severe implications on the mental health of the users, which in tum the PO has to become educated on mental health issues. Attaching crime to substance abuse at the felony level makes some people ineligible for certain government programs. That affects the PO's ability to manage and help the person meet basic life needs, such as housing. Meth use has also clogged the court system. Felony level offenses mean more presentence investigations, which means more work for PO's (though, I think more \"tenured\" probation officers will say they had just as many rar's \"back then\" than we do now). I think the biggest impact regarding the legal system is when meth \\:-session and meth paraphernalia became a felony. All of those cases are put on probation if they are not sentenced to prison, which has increased the caseloads of officers and requires more POs. Finally, we've seen that traditional treatment may not be as effective for meth users as it has been for other substance abuse. I think this is due to the chemical effects the drug has on the brain, making it harder to \"kick\". Ineffectiveness of treatment, in tum, produces more relapse, more searches, more felony charges, more revocations, more weight on the system (you get the picture). Good luck with the TV interview. If you need any more information/help, let me know.

We run into more offenders that are hiding in residences, are non cooperative, and there appears to be more weapons out there. This makes it necessary to use more law enforcement oriented techniques when entering residences, doing P&P searches and serving warrants ... something I think some of the \"old timers\" struggle with. Meth officers do not repsond well to intermediate measures. They will agree to anything as long as they can stay out and continue using . .A Outpatient treatment programs are not effective with meth users. Many times the use of intermediate measures and l9 _outpatient treatment is just leading to more criminal offenses being committed. Its an uphill battle leaving meth users \u00b7-on the streets with their drug associates and expect them to get clean. Frankly, we all know how difficult it is to successfully treat meth addiction in an inpatient setting let alone outpatient There is much more concern about officers coming in contact with needles .... Hep C, HIV issues etc. Meth offenders as we all know have overloaded the criminal justice system making population control in the Prison's . system one of our biggest concerns .... that has dramatically changed how Parole and Probation does business. That's the main issues I see .... 1.am sure there are almost countless others. It makes you long for the days when marijuana was almost every offender's drug of choice. \u00b7 rs ---Original Message-- From: Tomanek, 2006 2:06 PM Bertsch, Leann K. Meth and the fall out I am a parole officer in the Grand Forks District Office. I have been working as a parole officer for ND DOCR since 1991. I need apologize ahead of time for the format of this letter, I have just a few minutes, but hope this helps. I feel meth has had an enomnous impact on our jobs and on our communities. The problem does not just lie with the meth user/addict...the fall out continues to effecUalter the lives of their children, marriages, employers, communities ... The fallout effects us by filing many more child abuse/neglect reports, attending Perm Plan mtgs with the offenders, now continually working with social services because of the offender and their children, learning and working the matrix of the meth offenders (they all seem to interact at some level), working even more with the narcotics task forces, and of course working even more with treatment staff of not just the human service centers, but also various half way houses, treatment centers, and assessment centers. Because meth addicts need to get the money from somewhere to buy their meth (and they do not care to work or are mentally unable to work due to meth), it seenis they are out much more at night...gaining the attention of law enforcement...which means more law enforcement contacts. The work we do now with psychological/psychiatric staff is inevitable and rising. The psychological damage meth offenders are doing to themselves is unbelievable ... even knowing mental health damage is possible with n;ieth use, the offenders still continue to try meth or go right back to meth. I have never seen so much change in the mental health of offenders since meth has been on the forefront. Anti-depressants, mood stabilizers, schizophrenic meds ... it is phenomenal I think the meth users are a very intensive part of my caseload. They use, eventually get caught, do treatment, they use, a~entually get caught, do treatment, use ... some just ask to do straight jail time, they don't want any more treatment It ms offenders have a better opportunity of staying clean if they have cannot access the drugs for long periods of time ar or more). Some offenders have come out of the penitentiary after a year or so and say that was the best thing for em. Some even express gratitude toward the judges for locking them up more than a few months. Meth users seem unwilling, but tolerate treatment programs rather than go back to jail. They do many treatment programs. When I ask offenders what they miss about meth ... various comments such as \"I miss the party life,\" \"I miss the people I hung out with,\" I miss the life\" seem fairly common. According to offender's I talk with, meth use is a big party. I hear very few statements such as \"I miss getting high.\" It seems the meth lifestyle ... aka: no cares lifestyle is a big proponent for going back to using. Offenders have told me that after a few uses they lose the ability to care. They don't care what happens to them, their children, their job, their homes, cars and etc. In essence ... meth has greatly increased our workload due to the contacts with the treatment staff, half way houses, assessment centers, employers, psychological/psychiatric/counseling staff, social services, task forces, law enforcement, and the state attorney's office/clerks office/courts. Meth offenders have greatly impacted our caseloads/case work, and not in a productive manner, they are very labor intensive.

Meth With the increase in meth use, it appears to have minimized the concern of the usage of marijuana. Courts, prosecutors seem to take a harder/firmer approach when there is meth use while on supervision. Also, offenders are more adamant in denying meth use, even when you have the lab report verifying the drug. Kara Carr 1 Bertsch, Leann K. rorn: ent: ' o: Subject: Sanders, Stacy Monday, 06, 2006 11 :45 AM Bertsch, Leann K. methamphetamine When I first started working with the DOCR in February ,q~lJ it was alcohol and marijuana that was prevalent. Of course, we still see the use of {hose drugs causing issues in a person's life but not to the extent that meth. does. A person on meth. can't think clearly, they act irrational and exhibit bizarre behavior, often violent behavior. It seems that the only thing they think of is the next time they can get high. When a person uses or relapses on meth. we more often than not, have already \"lost II them. It is hard to get them to successfully do treatment in the community as they benefit more from having some \"clean time\" prior to benefiting from treatment. I am seeing more mental health issues in our offenders. I believe this is a severe side effect of meth. Mental Health professionals (at least Southeast) will not medicate someone experiencing problems until they can be clean from meth. for two-three weeks. I understand that reasoning but yet at the\u00b7 same time, the depression that comes from meth. use also leads them back to meth. so they can \"feel normal\" again. Hope this helps some. This was just off the top of my head. If I think of more I will send you another email. Have a great day. Stacy Sanders ND Probation/Parole Officer III 115 N. University Fargo, ND 58102 Gourde, John AM Bertsch, Leann K. Subject: Meth Offenders Leann, One of the issues that I see that has emerged with the increase of meth is mental health issues. Now whether this is a direct result of an offender's meth usage is probably still up for debate, but_l think it plays a significant role. Treating these mental health issues has been a struggle in our rural areas. Officers have had to do there best in finding resources in areas that are lacking services. Due to the limited time meth can be detected in a UA, more frequent testing has been done by officers (compared with a marijuana user). Offenders know this as well, and some try their best to coordinate their visits with officers around their usage. We have seen an increase in offenders attempting to adulterate their UA as well. Also, more of an officers time is being spent coordinating treatmenUservices (chemical addiction, anger management, domestic violence, mental health, social services, employment services) in the community and within the division.

Dear Leann, Although I am not a tenured staff, I thought I should send a response about meth use and how it affects my job. I have been with the department full-time for over 2 years now and was part-time as a contract PSI writer for over 2 years prior to that. I am currently handling an all female case load that is pushing close to 90 offenders. For me, meth use makes every situation more dangerous whether it be my safety or my offenders safety. We need to be . more cautious than ever when doing home visits or confronting individuals under the influence of meth. For my caseload, it also appears that meth and other drugs, have increased the chances of violence/abuse in their relationships with significant others. There are also concerns with female offenders using meth while pregnant making it dangerous for the unborn child. The state's attorney's office has been good about pursing charges in these cases. Sentencing for probation revocations seems to be more lenient if meth is not involved and if meth is involved, incarceration seems more likely. Hopefully this infornnation is helpful for you. \u00b7 rector is asking everyone's assistance in getting some infornnation. She would like to know how the emergence of meth has changed our jobs.

FW: Bertsch Some observation from the \"old Dog\" of the division. I started my career with the Parole Department in 1973. At that time I don't believe I had but one offender or as we used to call them clients on probation for drugs. I would go years without ever having a parolee on my caseload. The majority of the offenders were burglars. Burglary or Criminal Trespass were the crimes of the day. Drugs were almost viewed as a moral crime. Very few sex offenders also. There appeared to be two ages of offenders, 18 to 22 were the majority and a subset of older over 40 year old burglars. Alcohol was the drug of choice when I started. It quickly turned to marijuana and alcohol. Overall, there was little treatment provided to offenders unless we sent them to the State Hospital. Offenders rarely left the supervising district in which they were sentenced. As compared to today there appears to be more movement of offenders, The total caseload statewide was approximately 600 offenders supervised in the community and I believe around 250 in the pen. I feel the entire rise in the caseload both in and out of the Pen can be attributed in one way or another in the explosion of the use of different drugs. The latest and most destructive drug, Meth, has created the explosion in caseloads and violence. Another big change has been the arming of Parole Officers and training them to protect themselves and others. Today, I believe Parole Officers are at greater safety risk than in the past when I started work. Believe it or not many of the Sheriffs I worked with never carried a gun. Today that would be unheard off within the law enforcement community. Violence and drug usage have grown together with staff needing to protect themselves and others. I have spoken often of the need to profile our offenders. I feel that if the DOCR had profiled offenders we could explain some of the reasons why our job has become harder of the last few decades. People understand differences once they ce explained.

Meth Due to meth, I have encountered the following: -more women sent to treatment as a result of their meth use; especially due to using during pregnancy -I have to be especially careful during my home visits as individuals on meth appear to be a lot more paranoid -more revocations, treatment is not as successful with this drug -increased caseload as a result of meth cases -having to utilize child protection services more, parents that use meth are unable to provide adequate care to their children Due to drugs, I expect my caseload to increase by 180 within the next year. We had a pawn shop in Dunseith, ND that was run by an undercover agent. Over 180 individuals are on camera making drug deals, etc. Arrests for these individuals have just begun. When I first started with the department in 1998, most of my offenders were on parole/probation for thefts, etc. The majority of my caseload is now dnug-related. Lila Thomas Parole/Probation Officer Bertsch, \u00b7Leann K. Meth's effects on Probation Officer's I have been employed with the Department for 14 years. Over those years our department has gone through several changes, both internally and externally influenced. Externally we have\u00b7been effected largely by current events (ie. sex offenders in the news) and the methamphetamine epidemic. When I started working for the department we had one officer in Fargo who supervised all the drug cases. That changed over time and the drug cases where spread out between all of the officers. Today, the majority of the cases are drug cases, namely meth, irregardless of the charge they are on probation for. My job, and how I do my job, have changed along with this upsurge in meth related cases and with my increased experience with meth addicts. Because meth is highly addictive I have had to change my approach to referring offenders for treatment because the majority of those abusing the drug won't/can't quit on their own.\u00b7 I also find that despite the fact that their entire lives may be in complete chaos, they don't see their usage as a problem and often choose to continue using. Inpatient treatment appears to be their best hope of getting and staying clean. There are three \u00b7 agencies that offer inpatient in Fargo but when they are no longer an option, or have no room, incarceration is the best alternative, and preferably through the DOCR so that treatment is available to them. Complicating the problem was the fact that we probation officers weren't aware of the extent of the problem until it had become this monster, effecting a large number of the people we supervise. It has changed the way we drug test offenders. Today we need to be more vigilant to ensure we are getting an unadulterated, non-dilute sample for testing. Because of the short time that meth is in someone's system we also need to see offenders more often for testing purposes. Officer safety has become a bigger concern because of the violent, unpredictable nature of the meth addict. I know that it has changed the way I approach or enter a residence because of the fear of what I might walk into. I have run into more offenders unwilling to answer the door when I knock, hiding or trying to flee whenfrf I do gain entrance, and situations where there are several people in the residence and all of them are under the influence of meth. I rarely go to a residence alone if there is any suspicion of meth use by the offender. I also noticed an increase in the caseload numbers with the upswing in meth use. Whenever someone asks me about my ~ and what I do the conversation ultimately leads to the meth epidemic because of the incredible impact it has had on my c4-and the way I perform it. Dave Birrenkott, Probation Officer Fargo, ND. 1 Bertsch, Leann K. 4:44 PM Bertsch, Leann K. How Meth has changed our jobs. Leann: I understand you wanted some info on this topic from all. Briefiy, Meth has made the job more dangerous and unpredictable. Violent behavior has increased. I have been in DOCR for 23 years now and a Police\u00b7Officer for 5 years before that. I have seen more broken lives than ever because of Meth and the jails and treatment centers have \u00b7 become overcrowded. It is a tough battle, because in spite of the consequences, people use it -abuse it -deal it, and the cost is high. Other substances and alcohol tie in with it though. I have had offenders tell me we, DOCR, need to be tougher and not be given so many chances. There are more drug searches, way more UAs, and dealing with people that destroy themselves with Meth, or any drug for that matter than years ago. Offenders are more unpredictable-crime and violence have increased. I have seen children be subjected to poor care by parents because of Meth. I have always believed Leann if we were tougher on the front end with offenders, we would have less crime-less amended petitions to revoke-and offenders would know the 1st violation or 2 are not as they say-free. The job is just overall tougher because of what is required to deal with these types of offenders, whether you go to revoke or get them into a treatment program\u00ad Paperworkl Finally, more offenders are in violation of their Probation at Intake by using Meth or any drug for that matter, than ever before. Thank you for taking the time to listen. Gary Masching ND Field Service Division 316 N 5th St. #104 Bismarck, ND 58501 1 DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS & REHABILITATION DIVISION OF FIELD SERVICES SEX OFFENDER PROGRAM Since the abduction and murder of Grand forks college student Dru Sjodin in November of 2003, ND DOCR, Division of Field Services has been on the fast track in providing appropriate supervision and services to sex offenders and safety to the community and their victims. A grant from the National Institute of Corrections enabled Field Services to hire consultants from the Center for Sex Offender Management (CSOM) to evaluate our resources and current practices. Recommendations were straight forward and direct: I) hire specialists lo supervise and monitor sex offender-specific caseloads, 2) have sex offender specialists write all sex offender presentence investigations, and 3) implement additional assessment tools to more appropriately assess sex offender risk. Recommendations in the report arc now evidenced by our current practices. Seven Sex Offender Specialists were promoted and trained to provide intensive and structured supervision and management for sex offenders located in Bismarck, Mandan, Minot, Jamestown, Grand Forks, and Fargo. As a rural state, Field Services has District Offices located in areas where the population does not allow for sex offender specific caseloads. In those Iocales--Wahpeton, Dickinson, Williston, Rolla, Grafton, and Devils Lake--Sex Offender Specific Liaisons have also been trained to supervise and monitor sex offenders. Presentence investigation reports are now written by Sex Offender Specialists whose training and expertise allows them lo write thorough and comprehensive reports for the Court.\u00b7 Criminal, fan1ily, and personal histories as well as statements from the victims assist judges in ordering informed and appropriate sentences and treatment. Field Services uses the LSI-R (Level of Service Inventory-Revised), MnSOST-R (Minnesota Sex Offender Screening Tool-Revised), Static 99, Stable, and the Acute to assess sex offender risk. When an offender scores in the high risk range on either the MnSOST-R or Static 99, officers are required to infom1 local prosecutors and request that a referral be made to review those offenders for the civil commitment process. To increase awareness and lo provide for a strong community base of support, Sex Offender Task Forces were established in Grand Forks, Fargo, Jamestown, Bismarck and Minot. Task Forces in Dickinson, Williston, and Devils Lake arc planned for the next year. Task Forces are comprised of local law enforcement, prosecutors, victims' advocates, treatment providers, and parole/probation officers. Cases are staffed by their supervising officer and the Task Force makes the decision to place offenders on OPS (Global Position Satellite System) and the duration of that placement. GPS is an effective tool in assisting the parole/probation officer to supervise offenders in the community and to monitor their whereabouts. It is important to understand tlmt placement on a GPS unit does not prevent an offender from committing crimes. OPS can provide information in \"real time\" or in daily reports to the officer. Field Services is a strong proponent of the Containment Model of supervising sex offenders. Only through the close affiliation and joint partnership of other agencies in the community can we adequately supervise and monitor sex offenders and provide for a more secure and safe community. . Sex \u00b7. Diswssed In t~is ~~~f: Results of '::;.. no-<ontact-with-- - victim provisions. continued. the Community-A Containment Approach by Kim English, Suzanne Pullen, and Linda Jones Of the many factors that underscore the critical importance of effectively manag\u00ad ing sex offenders on probation, parole, or under otheI' forms of community supervi\u00ad sion, none is more compelling than the devastating trauma1 visited on victims of sexual assault. Such trauma falls disproportionately on children under age 18 if data obtained in 1991 from sex offenders in State prisons are any indication: about two-thirds of them committed their crimes against chil\u00ad dren under age 18, with about 58 percent being under age 13.2 Less than 10 per\u00ad cent of the inmates incarcerated for sexual assault of children reported that victims had been strangers to them.3 Components of the trauma associated with sexual assault include shame, self\u00ad blame, fear, developmental crises, post\u00ad traumatic stress disorder, and the threat or actuality of physical violence, terror, and injury. Most profound in its traumatic implications is the violation of trust that occurs if, as in most sexual assault vic\u00ad timizations,1 offenders are known to vic\u00ad tims. Trauma and the length and level of recovery seem linked to tmst violation more than to many other foctors.5 Thus, what might be regarded by some as a relatively minor type of sexual assault (e.g., \"just fondling\") can be extremely traumatic to a victim who tmsted the perpetrator. The accelerating influx of sex .offenders into the criminal justice system further heightens the need for effective sex of\u00ad fender supervision and management practices, both in and out of prisons. The number of adults convicted annually of rape, child molestation, or other forms of sexual assault and sentenced to State prisons more than doubled between 1980 (8,000) and 1992 (19,100, almost 5 per\u00ad cent of all State prison admissions that year).\" State prisons held 20,500 sex offenders in 1980, 75,900 in 1992, 81,100 in 1993, and 88,100 in 1994.7 The majority w:ill return to the community, many under supervision by parole officers. In 1992, States paroled 7,382 prisoners convicted of sex offenses. 8 In addition, many-more in some States than others-of those convicted of sexual assault felonies are sentenced\u00b7 to proba\u00ad tion or to other continuous.ihip\u00b7rovement(c:\u00b7 in sex Offender. management \u00b7 \u00b7 Target audience::Probation and parole officers and supervisors, treatment providers, victim services -' personnel, law enforcement offi\u00ad cials, prosecutors, judges,.social A, se~ices personnel, State\u00b7and-local::j~-9' policymakers. . ,,:. supervision.9 For example, in Colorado in 1990, of those convicted of sexual assault (5 percent of all felony convictions), courts sentenced 60 percent to probation, 4 percent to halfway houses, and 36 per\u00ad cent to prison.10 In one notable area, Maricopa County, Arizona, about 500 of the 1,300 sex offenders on probation are serving lifetime probation sentences. ll Clinical practice and research, and data obtruned from probation and parole offic\u00ad ers nationwide, indicate that adults who commit sex crimes should be managed, treated, and supervised differently from other criminals. Although community safety is the central purpose of sex offender management, characteristics of the sex offenders them\u00ad selves dictate the form and style of treat\u00ad ment that will be most effective, Not all sex offenders share all the following char\u00ad acteristics, and the absence of a particu\u00ad lar chnrncteristic does not mean the individual is not a sex offender . Sex crimes flourish in secrecy. Sex of\u00ad fenders have secretive and manipulative lifestyles, and many of their sexual as\u00ad saults are so well planned that they ap\u00ad pear to occur without forethought.12 The skills used to manipulate victims have also bCen employed to manipulate crimi\u00ad nal justice officials.13 Many sex offenders are otherwise highly functioning people who use their social skills to commit their crimes.14 Sex offenders typically have developed complicated and persistent psychological and social systems constmcted to assist them in denying and minimizing the harm they inflict on others. and often they are very accomplished at presenting to others a facade designed to hide the truth about themsel ves.15 Mariy sex offenders commit a wide range and large number of sexually devi- 2 El D ant acts during their lives and show a continued propensity to reoffend. 16 In a study of 561 compulsive adult subjects, rapists reported a lifetime average of 7 incidents and exhibitionists more than 500. In this sample of 561 voluntary sub\u00ad jects, about 54 percent reported having at least two paraphilias; 20 percent partici\u00ad pated in deviant behavior without regard to victim gender; and 23.3 percent re\u00ad ported offending against both family and nonfamily victims.17 Knowledge of the actual dynamics of sex offending is not widespread, b_ut the public's awareness of sex offenders is in\u00ad creasing and is often manifested as out\u00ad rage at particularly heinous sexual assaults, especially those committed by offenders under community supervision. In many States, victim and family outrage is fueling legislation requiring registra\u00ad tion of convicted sex offenders with law ; enforcement agencies, and enactment of ~ community notification and\u00b7 sexual preda\u00ad tor laws . What is being done to manage sex offend\u00ad ers in the community to contain them and thereby protect victims and the public? Research sponsored by the National In\u00ad stitute of Justice (NU) and conducted by the Colorado Division of Criminal Justice addressed those questions through (1) a national telephone survey of 732 proba\u00ad tion and parole supervisors and (2) field research in six States (see \"R~search Methods\"), The telephone survey focused on identi\u00ad fying how probation and parole agencies managed adult sex offenders (see ''Tele\u00ad phone Survey: Selected Findings\"). Field research uncovered specific, targeted methods for managing sex offenders and led to insights that culminated in a de\u00ad tailed proposal-a model containment process-for the management of adult sex offenders serving community sen\u00ad tences. ,-.

A con\u00ad tainment approach requires the inte\u00ad gration of a collection of attitudes, expectations, laws, policies, proce\u00ad dures, and practices that have clearly been designed to work together. This approach is implemented through.in\u00ad teragency and interdisciplinary team\u00ad work. Consistent with the clinical treatment literature and with dozens qflocal pro\u00ad tocols developed for managing cases of /' --\u00b7 sexual assault, the model process con\u00ad Asists Of five components, discussed be\u00ad W,1ow: an overall philosophy and goal of community and victim safety, sex of\u00ad fender-specific containment strategies, interagenc)' and interdisciplinary col\u00ad laboration, consistent public policies, and quality control. 1. Ove~nll philosophy and goal: community and victim safety. At the heart of the model process is a phi\u00ad losophy that values public safety, vic\u00ad tim protection, and reparation for victims aS the paramount objectives of sex offender management. Protection and recovery of the victim and the well-being of the community are con\u00ad cerns that guide policy development, program i.mplementation, and actions of professionals working with sexual assault victims and perpetrators. In this approach to sex offender man\u00ad agement, the client is the community. . \u00b7 Under this philosophy, treatment and supervision modalities give priority to ----:\"\u00b7t<:, ~-- ,\u00b7 r ,,.,,- I , ~f\\s.r~r~_~!-'.~,0,,1-'.~l;n-~~i?n9!/~l_ep,~,9n~ ;l.J.rvey,;. and pi3roleoffiaers, used to address that\u00b7question. defense and prosecuting attorneys, law enforcement personnel, social service Encompassing 49 States (South Dakota w'orkers, sex offender treatment providers, was n?t inc!uded) and the-District of Co-sexual assault victim treatment s,;s- ment and other-court' orders,\u00b7 staff train- tematic document review (manuals, proto- ing, and interagency collaboration. cols, policies, etc.). community protection and victim safety. Orders for no contact with the victim are sought at the earliest oppor\u00ad tunity. Whenever possible, the perpe\u00ad trator rather than the victim is removed from the home in cases of in\u00ad cest. Confidentiality is limited, and in\u00ad formation is shared freely among the management team. And the impor\u00ad tance of employment for sex offenders yields to public safety considerations when prospective jobs are high-risk because of the access they give offend\u00ad ers to potential victims-as would em\u00ad ployment as a school bus driver or as apartment-complex superintendent with keys to each unit. The energy and commitment ofthe probation and pa\u00ad role officer is thereby devoted to as\u00ad sisting the sex offender to remain safely in the community. 2. Sex offender-specific contain\u00ad ment: individualized case manage\u00ad ment system. This component of the l'.l Ci! El 3 model process focuses on a contain\u00ad ment approach to case processing and case management that can be tailored to the individual sex offender and his or her deviant sexual history. This ap\u00ad proach rests on the dual premise that sex offenders are 100 percent respon\u00ad sible for the damage they inflict and that they must constantly and consis\u00ad tently be held accountable for the in\u00ad appropriate thoughts and feelings that precede their crimes as well as for their illegal actions. Three elements work together to contain the sex of\u00ad fender: Sex offender-specific treatment to help offenders learn to develop in\u00ad ternal control. Trained and skilled therapists treat sex offenders in cogni\u00ad tive-behavioral group therapy to help them achieve personal control of their deviant sexual impulses, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Sex offenders are expected to understand and lean1 r D D t'a!ti'i'41fWW-i-1WkhJRMM,h'/fhlA,W4w.WWl\\iWi#Ai\u00a5J-/tt\\1H . ~ D to intenupt their individual offense cycles. The effort to promote and monitor internal control with an ap\u00ad proach that overtly identifies danger\u00ad ous thoughts, fantasies, and feelings as critical treatment filld management issues is an important departure from traditional criminal justice interven\u00ad tion with sex offenders. Official supervision and monitoring to exert external control over offend- . ers. Probation and parole agencies apply pressure-through clear expec\u00ad tations and through use oI' threatened use of sanctions-to ensure that the offender complies with specialized treatme~t and supervision conditions. This pressure to participate in sex of\u00ad fender-specific treatment for purposes of public safety inextricably links the mental health community and criminal justice system. Polygraph examinations to obtain complete sexual history information and to monitor the offender's deviant fantasies and external behaviors\u00ad particularly access to victims. Data obtained during the polygraph exami\u00ad nation provide vital management and compliance feedback to the treatment provider and probation/parole officer. Maintaining close communication and acting as a team, the treatment pro\u00ad vider, probation/parole officer, and polygraph examiner form a triangle of supervision, with the offender con\u00ad tained in the middle {se~ \"Containing the Sex Offender in the Supervision Triangle\"). Sex offenders must waive confidentiality of the information they divulge because containment depends on the constant sharing of information by and among team members, other criminal justice professionals, family members, and others, such as employ\u00ad ers and church officials. 4 sion of criminal'Justice, Department of :pu_blic Safety, 1996. D D t~iU11Wiiii\u00a31\u00a5&i\u00a5tfMilili\u00abfflMfflhttJ/IM#J&iij,%i\\Ji...Siiii#/'1~1 ~ D In pursuing safe and \u00b7effective treat\u00ad ment of sex offenders in the commu\u00ad nity, therapists must obtain full disclosure of offenders' sexual histo\u00ad ries. Sex offenders must examine care\u00ad fully their lives and recogruze as dysfunctional the situations, relation\u00ad ships, emotional states, attitudes, and behaviors that they may be consider\u00ad ing as \"normal.\" Use of the polygraph helps ensure that offenders fully reveal their sexual histories-information that is essential to the development of effective treatment progrnms.18 To the observatiqn that polygraph results may not always be accurate, the rejoinder is that they have been found to be sig\u00ad nificantly. more reliable, on average, than offenders' self-reported histories. In jurisdictions identified by field re\u00ad search as e!!lploying the containment \u00b7-approach, the treatment intervention was group therapy, for which offenders were nearly always required to pay at least a portion of the cost. Individual therapy may occur for spe~ific issues and in limited contexts but provides too much opportunity for image man\u00ad agement. Only in group therapy are offenders exposed to the type of valu\u00ad able, perceptive, and corroborating confrontation that occurs with fellow sex offenders. A \"cure\" for sex offending is no more available than is a cure for epilepsy or high blood pressure. But use of a vari\u00ad ety of interventions can help manage these disorders. A realistic objective of treatment is to provide sex offenders with the tools to manage their inappro\u00ad priate sexual arousal and behavior, A therapist can, in many cases, teach of\u00ad fenders self-management by develop\u00ad ing skills for avoiding high-risk situations through identification of de- I . . cisions and events that precede them and through correction of their thought distortions. Treatment focuses on rec\u00ad ognizing and managing deviant sexual behavior and offenders' thoughts and attitudes that promote it. Research reveals that deviant thoughts and fantasies by sex offenders are pre\u00ad cursors to sexual assault and, there\u00ad fore, are an integral part of the assault pattern.19 By instilling in offenders the dictum that deviant attitudes and fantasies re\u00ad inforce deviant behavior and are not acceptable, treatment providers and supervising officers are prep\u00b7ared to in\u00ad tervene-set limits-at the incipient stages of reoffending patterns. Al\u00ad though such thoughts and feelings are not crimes, they are signals that con\u00ad stitute good reasons-based on em\u00ad pirical research and clinical experience-to increase supervision ~ and \"tighten the reins\" on an offender.\" This increased surveillance often re\u00ad sults in detecting preassault behaviors that can be interrupted or, conversely, lead to revocation. Using thoughts and feelings-the stuff of therapy-as a starting point for risk management is a marked departure from traditional criminnl justice super\u00ad vision. Once a sex offender reveals thoughts and feelings that are part of the assault pattern, criminal justice of\u00ad ficials can use that information to de\u00ad velop and, if necessary, continuously update an individualized treatment, \u00b7supervision, and surveillance plan. The top priority of such a plan is to eliminate opportunities for reoffense\u00ad to protect victims and the general public. In that regard, sex offender\u00ad specific probation or parole condi\u00ad tions, such as those that follow, play a crucial role: DD D 5 D Cl Your employment must be approved by the probation/parole agency. You shall participate in treatment with a therapist approved by the pro\u00ad bation/parole department. You shall participate in periodic polygraph examinations. You shall not have contact with chil\u00ad dren under age 18. You shall not frequent places where children congregate, such as schoolyards, parks, playgrounds, and arcades. You shall maintain a driving log {mileage; time of departure, arrival, re\u00ad turn; routes traveled and with whom; etc.). You shall not drive a motor vehicle alone without prior permission of your supervising officer. You shall not possess any porno\u00ad graphic, sexually oriented, or sexually stimulating visual, auditory, tele\u00ad phonic, or electronic media and com\u00ad puter programs or services that are relevant to your deviant behavior pat\u00ad tern. You shall reside at a place approved by the supervising officer, including supervised living quarters. You shall abide by a curfew imposed by the supervising officer and comply with electronic monitoring, if so or\u00ad dered. You shall not have contact, directly or through third parties, with your vic\u00ad tims. You shall abstain from alcoholic Leverages and participate in periodic drug testing. You shall not have a post office box number without the approval of your supervising officer. You shall not use fictitious names. Specialized surveillance officers can also help determine compliance with conditions by monitoring offenders through intensive field work. Duties of surveillance officers may include searching the residences and vehicles of offenders, monitoring their activi\u00ad ties, making arrests, attending therapy groups, and discussing high-risk is\u00ad sues with offenders and assessing their mental states.20 The goal of the polygraph exnminn\u00ad tion is to obtain information neCessary for risk management and treatment, and to reduce the sex offender's denial mechanisms. The examiner evaluates .,.-' answers to carefully developed ques\u00ad tions as truthful, deceptive, or incon\u00ad clusive. Deceptive results flag areas of concern that the treatment provider and supen1ising officer need to investi\u00ad gate further. Every effort is made to as\u00ad sist the offender in obtaining a positive evaluation so that treatment can be informed and relevant. To this end, polygraph data should be used in con\u00ad junction with other information when making decisions about case manage\u00ad ment of sex offenders.21 Use of the polygraph raises questions about granting limited immunity from prosecution to offenders who disclose new crimes. Jurisdictions vary regard\u00ad ing immunity policies. Some jurisdic\u00ad Lions, like Colorado, do not offer limited immunity, but prosecutors make thoughtful decisions about fur\u00ad ther prosecution on a case-by-case ba\u00ad sis. Decisionmakers in one jurisdiction visited during the field research con- eluded that to prosecute all reported offenses would infringe on Fifth Amendment rights and thus prohibit therapeutic use of the polygraph.22 An\u00ad other study site grants limited immu\u00ad nity for similar past offenses if the offender meets several containment conditions, including actively partici\u00ad pating in an approved treatment pro\u00ad gram, pleading guilty, and gaining employment that meets the approval of the probation or parole officer.2.1 Ultimately, success of the containment system depends on the caliber of the last three elements of the model pro\u00ad cess: collaborative implementation strategies, consistent public policies, and quality control. 3. Collaboration: a multidisci\u00ad plinary approach. The creation of intra-agency, interagency, and inter\u00ad disciplinary teams to develop, imple\u00ad ment, and monitor policies, procedures, i! and protocols forges a unified and .; comprehensive approach to sex of\u00ad fender management. Examples of such teams include the following: Intemgency policy and protocol committees. Law enforcement/child protection partnerships. Case management supervision teams of probation/parole officers, treatment providers, and polygraph examiners, among others. Intra-agency networks of specialized probation and parole officers. Members of interagency teams, for ex\u00ad ample, may include law enforcement officers, child protection personnel, rape crisis center counselors, pros\u00ad ecuting attorneys, probation _and parole officers, medical doctors, treat\u00ad ment providers, polygraph operators, D !:II 6 and prison officials. In some cases, members may also include school counselors, crime victim advocates, and medical staff specializing in child sex abuse. Through systematic cooperation and collaboration, such teams are an antidote to traditionally fragmented intervention efforts. Teams improve interagency communication, facilitate case-specific information sharing, pro\u00ad mote the exchange of expertise and ideas, help break down traditional turf barriers, minimize d_uplication of ef\u00ad fort, maximize resources, and often reduce staff burnout. Some intra-agency teams consist of probation and parole officers who spe\u00ad cialize in the management ';)f sex of\u00ad fenders. Teams such as these are facilitated by job specialization-the assignment of one or more persons to deal solely with sex off~nder cases. Specialization may occur at the organi\u00ad zational level by formally creating a unit to manage sexual assault cases, at the line level by specializing work as\u00ad signments of identified staff, or at both levels by a combination of those ap\u00ad proaches. Specialization enhances skills, increases communication, and tends to improve consistency at all stages of sex offender management, and is a fundamental component of the col1aboration process. 4. Consistent public policies. No matter how good the design and imple\u00ad mentation of sex offender-specific con\u00ad tainment practices, these cannot fonction at peak effectiveness without the support of informed, cl~ar, and consistent public policies-the fourth element of the model process. Ideally, local criminal justice practi\u00ad tioners should work \u00ae\"\" MW'bi\u00a3\u00aeWifflll!~\u00beW tu from State judicial and corrections depart\u00ad ments to develop policies reflecting the latest thinking about the manage\u00ad ment of sex offenders. Whenever pos\u00ad sible, practitioners should .help shape legislative mandates, executive orders, and agency policies and protocols that support and advance the public safety priority of sex offender management. Clear and consistent policie.s define agency responsibilities and reinforce practices that, when operating effec\u00ad tively, will interrupt any attempt by sex offenders to manipulate the man\u00ad agement plan. Particulaily important is the develop\u00ad ment of policies that prohibit pleas or dispositions that reinforce sex offend\u00ad ers' frequent refusal to admit.their crimes, to acknowledge the serious- ess of their actions, or to take respon\u00ad ibility for the harm they have caused. he greater such denial, the more the offender resists (or even escapes) treatment and the more difficult the task of establishing appropriate exter\u00ad nal controls. Continued denial on the part of the offender is also uniquely disempowering to the victim. The fol\u00ad lowing are pleas and dispositions that contribute to and reinforce a sex offender's denial or minimization of the sexual assault: Alford and no contest pleas. These pleas allow sex offenders to avoid a di\u00ad rect admission of guilt. An Alford plea is a guilty plea that permits a sex of\u00ad fender to verbally maintain his or her innocence at conviction. A no contest plea is a guilty plea in which an of\u00ad fender neither admits nor denies the charges. Such pleas grant sex offend\u00ad ers official justification to continue denying their offending behavior after '\u00b7-conviction. ---\u00b7~ > ' . \" ' ; C:ontaining the Sex Offender in the \u00b7 ; 1 Supervision Triangle ',, ; ' , \\:;~i,~~-:'y-ia_ngl_e,o~-probation officer, Jhera- orders \u00b7to_prohibit Jim from attending was. polygraph ex- :.:-_ Wobatioii added the question \u00b7\"Have ;. -JriiJh'e:7~,Yeai-,)ld:daughter of a. woman you gone to any church or religious ser- : \u00b7R~\\v~sdating.;l'le had metthe mother of ' ' ' ' -' ', ' _.\\ ' ' -..

Pleas to nonsex of\u00ad fenses minimize what the offender did \u00b7 and reinforce denial. Further, if the of\u00ad ficial record does not reflect that the original charge was a sex offense, this critical information is lost to those who subsequently make public safety deci\u00ad sions about the offender. Deferred judgments and sentences. Such dispositions are important op\u00ad tions but are inappropriate for most sex offenders. Such dispositions imply that the offense was not that important, a one-time mistake, and if the offender behaves for a couple of years, the court will forget about it and dismiss the case, leaving an incomplete official record. Also, public safety may be jeopardized: in some jurisdictions, de\u00ad ferred judgments for sex offenses are 7 not counted as convictions for the statewide sex offender registry. Referrals to diversion programs. Ap\u00ad plied to sex offenders, this alternative to filing a criminal charge further di\u00ad lutes the seriousness of the crime, re\u00ad inforces offender denial, and may distort the criminal history record. Development of consistent interagency policies on family reunification is also very important-especially between probation/parole agencies and agen\u00ad cies whose mission is generally keep\u00ad ing the family intact or reunifying it at the earliest opportunity. For example, family reunification in incest cases should not occur prior to the disposi\u00ad tion of the criminal case. Subsequent decisions on family reunification should be made only after consultation ~-0 with the victim's therapist, the offender's therapist, and the supervis\u00ad ing officer. The well-being of the victim-and the potential for other children and adults to become victimized-should be the fundamerital criterion applied by all agencies to family unification deci\u00ad sions. The rigorous use of clear protocols for family reunification\u00ad protocols that fully explore the offender's risk to other children in the household-may be the most impor\u00ad tant way the criminal justice system can intervene to protect children from sexual assaults by known sex offend\u00ad ers. Additional Critical policies on which to obtain jurisdictionwi.de agreement are, among others: selection criteria for r\"\u00b7 treatment providers; prevention of of- (.enders from changing therapists ut pennission of supervising officers (i.e., \"treatment shopping\"); third\u00ad party liability (e.g., the duty to of polygraph nity notification. 5. Quality control. As the final component of the model containment process, quality control encompasses (1) monitoring to determine whether the prescribed implementation strate\u00ad gies and interagency policies and practices are in place and functioning as intended and (2) evaluating to as\u00ad sess whether what is in place is pro\u00ad ducing an impact and, if so~ its magnitude. Quality control. therefore, can provide an objective means of documenting program success, identi\u00ad fying implementation and operational problems, and guiding program refine\u00ad ments. (. Because the sex offender containment approach requires a long-term, consis\u00ad tent, systemwide response to sexual assault, a model process for managing sex offenders is one that continuously improves. Such improvement is highly unlikely to occur without implementa\u00ad tion of quality control measures. When systematic monitoring and evaluation are accorded appropriate priority, pro\u00ad gram staff and administrators are con\u00ad tinuously prepared with objective data to demoflstrate the value of their work and to modify the program, when nec\u00ad essary, according to empirical feed\u00ad back. Secondary trauma Management of adult sex offenders in community settings often exacts a sig\u00ad nificant toll on those charged with managing cases, including probation and parole officers and their supervi- sors. Secondary trnuma refers to the emotional and psychological experi\u00ad ence of professionals who expose themselves to a world of unthinkable acts. Effective case management re\u00ad quires that these professionals under\u00ad stand each Victim's trauma and the specific types of sex offender manipu\u00ad lation leading to that trauma. They also generally experience a variety of manipulative behavior during interac\u00ad tions with offenders. To offset the experience of secondary trauma, sex offender management must be conducted in an environment where the dynamics of sex offending and secondary trauma are understood by coworkers and managers. That un\u00ad derstanding will provide vital profes\u00ad sional support. Managers and staff must create an emotionally safe environment for per\u00ad sonal discussion of all aspects of El 8 / sexual assault and offender. manage\u00ad ment. Specifically, working together and discussing feelings and problems as a team can provide the empathy and validation so vital to reducing isolation. and burnout among sex offender prac\u00ad titioners. Agencies should make every effort to provide counseling and other resources to help relieve officer stress. Data from field interviews suggest that interagency collaboration and net\u00ad working may help prevent burnout. Part of t.J:ie remedy for burnout is train\u00ad ing. According to a Texas parole su\u00ad pervisor interviewed, \"Being pulled into an offender's manipulation is the biggest problem. Because offenders are so manipulative, officers need con\u00ad stant training. \"24 Training The complex nature of sex-Offending behavior and the potential dangerous\u00ad ness of offenders mandaie frequent training (such as annually) for proba\u00ad tion and parole officers-both special\u00ad topics among others, the following: Dynamics of victimization-trauma, shame, self-blame, and fear. Dynamics of impulsiveness, and denial. llisk assessment--secrets, manipu\u00ad lation, grooming, and conscious and unconscious assault planning. Issues about family reunification. Offender lifestyle issues, such as lei\u00ad sure time and access to victims. Relevant laws. Safety of field officers. ~\u00b7 D D El f ,,,-<!di~;,,#J~.iftj$jffltatiJ 5~2-44 iiiifu.a::trfil~ffl-ffi!

Among them are the following: Make training, including cross-train\u00ad ing, in sex offender management a pri\u00ad ority at the Federal26 and local levels. Design individualized supervision ! to their particular risk factors. plans for adult sex offenders according Implement special supervision con\u00ad ditions for adult sex offenders that re- strict specified activities, including barring employment that facilitates ac\u00ad cess to victims. Develop a variety of immediate, short-term, prerevocation sanctions for adult sex offenders who place them\u00ad selves in high-risk situations. Those sanctions include 72-hour mental health holds, short-term jail confine\u00ad ment, additional counseling sessions, day fines, and halfway-house confine\u00ad ment. Create within criminal justice agen\u00ad cies specialized sex offender crime units. Facilitate collaboration across disci\u00ad plines and across agencies, including victim advocate agencies . Require sex offenders under super- d' vision of the criminal justice system td participate fully in treatment programs that are approved by probation and pa\u00ad role agencies and that include cogni\u00ad tive-behavioral therapy, group therapy, polygraph monitoring, and waiver of confidentiality. Consider imposition oflong-term, even lifetime, supervision sentences. Research needs also are apparent, in\u00ad cluding the need to conduct process and outcome evaluations of contain\u00ad ment strategics implemented in a vari\u00ad ety of communities. Not only should the model process and its constituent parts be evaluated but research ques\u00ad tions such as the following should be addressed as well: What types of sex offenders are best suited to the containment approach'? Do different subgroups of sex offend\u00ad ers respond differently to different af\u00ad tercare programs? 9 How can community notification pro\u00ad cedures be designed to enhance public safety? What are the best assessment tools to classify sex offenders into categories that are meaningful for supervision purposes? What jurisdiction-specific actuarial risk assessment tools can predict sex offender dangerousness? What would a carefully conducted cost-benefit analysis of a containment approach tell us? Conclusion The five-part model process to contain adult sex offenders establishes a framework within which agencies and communities can develop specific practices to better promote public safety and victim protection and assis\u00ad tance. Just as the stringency of the su\u00ad pervision triangle should be tailored to the individual characteristics of each sex offender, so should the method of implementing the model process vary according to the needs of each commu\u00ad nity.

Sex offender policies_ -must avoid knee-jerk reactions and move toward rational evidence- . l:>c1.Se_c;I practices to most effecti,vely protect our communities against se?(~riilated crimes. \u00b7 \u00b7 - By Matthew DeMichele, Brian Payne and Deeanna Button ---, 26 state news \u00b7 ianuarv 2007 A Sex offenders have some of the lowest recidivism rates ~ong all felons, according to 2003 figures from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. But government officials at all levels are arguing for increased sentences, longer parole and probation periods, additional supervision conditions, civil commitment and numerous other strategies to punish Sex offenders. There bas been a recent flood of legislation targeting sex of\u00ad fenders, the most significant of which is the federal Adam Walsh Act This act, and several at the state level, require community Corrections agencies to develop and evaluate electronic monitor\u00ad ing device~ for sex offenders. While 28 states have provisions stipulating that electronic moniioring can be used for sex of\u00ad fenders~following the lead of the Adam Walsh Act-several states have passed or are proposing legislation calling for sex offenders to wear electronic monitoring bracelets or anklets for the rest of their lives. Missing from this legislative push to ex\u00ad pand electronic monitoring for sex offenders is discussion about potential unintended policy consequences and costs. Sex Offender Supervision: An Emotional Environment Crime control policies often have unintended negative cop\u00ad sequences. Few policy areas are gen~rating more excitement, media coverage and political concern than those related to . me and justice. Whether it is newscasters displaying images brutal homicides or discussing chemical castration for sex enders, it seems the old journalistic adage of \"if it bleeds it leads\" holds true. This media attention fosters a sensational- ized perception of sex offender issues, which\u00b7 potentially fos\u00ad ters an emotionally laden policymaking environment. There aie few who will argue on behalf of sex offenders. To be sure, these crimes violate social and cultural sensibili\u00ad ties-especially when perpetrated upon the young-and cause long-term pain and harm to their victims. This moral outrage aga.inst sex offenders necessitates cautious policy development and thoughtful, not knee-jerk, reactions. Just as one would not advocate fighting fires with untested and unproven liquids or devices, one should not wholeheartedly endorse untested strat\u00ad egies to control sex offenders. Sex Offenders: Put on This Bracelet Although labeled a registration and notification bill, the Adam Walsh Act contains several provisions that shift expectations for probation, parole and pretrial agencies that supervise offenders and defendants convicted or charged with a sex crime. Cumulatively, this legislation may fail to consider the\u00b7 cir\u00ad cumstances sllrrounding behaviors that constitute sexual of\u00ad fenses and realistic expectations for electronic monitoring. Sex offending is not something that takes place solely among -angers. Estimates from the Office of Juvenile Justice and linquency Prevention in 2000 suggest that 96 percent of sex crimes targeting children are committed by someone the victim knows. Half the offenders are family members who presumably commit the offense in their home. If this is the case, what can electronic monitoring do to protect potential victims? Before instituting such sweeping mandates for elec-\u00b7\u00b7 tronic monitoring-or other interventions-research is needed\u00b7 an expensive and time-consuming inter\u00ad vention is effective at reducing sex offenses. Experts estimate that the recently passed Proposition 83 would cost Californians up to $160,000 a day. This translates into an annual cost of more than $57 million, with the annual cost expected to grow to $100 million within 10 years. The cost of monitoring sex offenders in Wisconsin is estimated at up to a half billion dollars over a 20-year titneframe. The high CO$( stems partly from fees for the technology, but primarily from workload increases assigned to probation officers. Fed\u00ad eral guidelines suggest probation officers supervising sex of\u00ad fenders maintain caseloads of about 25 offenders, though their caseloads are often around 40 sex offenders. Probation de\u00ad partments expected to monitor sex offenders around the clock would se~ their workloads escalate but would need to reduce each officer's caseload substantially. Electronic monitoring began in the U.S. in 1984 when Judge Jack Love of New Mexico was inspired by a Spiderman comic to utilize radio frequency and landline telephone technology on offender populations. Initial electronic monitoring d\"evices \u00b7 required an offender to wear a bracelet or anklet emitting a ra\u00ad dio signal that is detected by a receiver connected to a landline telephone. The transmitter and receiver are to remain within a certain distance of one another, and the telephone connection allows for sending messages to a central monitoring agency or community corrections officer. These systems are commonly known as home detention or house arrest programs, and provide information on the times when an offender is away from home. They do not provide any information abotit what offenders are doing while at home or where they\" are when they leave. The technological community responded to the limitations of first generation devices and began incorporating cellular telephone technologies and global positioning satellites. Now, offenders are fitted with GPS devices-as mandated in the Adam Walsh Act-that can provide near real-time informa\u00ad tion regarding an offender's location. Knowing where a sex of\u00ad fender travels throughout the day provides \u00b7several advantages for community supervision. It is possible to reduce offending by preventing sex offenders from entering areas (exclusion zones) with heightened cri~nal opportunities, such as schools and playgrounds. Through analyzing the daily movements of an offender, a community supervision offi.Cer may uncover a pattern to an offender's behavior and discern times at which the likelih6od for re-offending escalates, and make case man\u00ad agement adjustments. There is no doubt that we live in an increasingly technologi\u00ad cal society, but we must avoid urges to hop on the latest tech\u00ad nological bandwagon. Technological gadgetry should not lead the development of programs using .electronic monitoring de\u00ad vices. Instituting any electronic monitoring conditions comes with numerous costs, considerations and potential pitfalls. There are equipment failures, damaged equipment, equipment maintenance, false alerts, dead zones (areas which a signal cannot be located), and several other everyday considerations the council of state governments www.csg.org 27 that policymakers must calculate into any electronic monitor- ing policy. \u00b7 Electronic Monitoring: Can It Reduce Crime? Contemporary crime control policies need to move away from mythical perspectives on sex offenders and electronic monitOring and toward the evidence. The correctional field has followed the medical and professional fields by institu\u00ad tibnali,zing processes rooted in effective illterventions. The National Institute of Corrections an~ its partners in 2004 de\u00ad veloped a set of principles known as evidence-based practices. The underlying philosophy is simple: Correctional practices and programs must be supported by rigorous applied research and evaluations; no longer can correctional administrators and policy-makers defend practices by simply claiming that is \"the way things have always been done.\" There are no more excuses for failing to locate and implement effective correctional prac~ tices and policies, and programs using ele.ctronic monitoring devices are no different. B\u00b7efore determining whether something works, we must -ne the expectations. Is electronic monitoring for sex of\u00ad ( ers being passed to punish, to track, to rehabilitate or for e other purpose? According to evidence-based practices, the community corrections field s.hould utilize a balanced ap- proach betWeen treatment, surveillance and accountability to . prevent farther abuse, hold offenders accountable and work . toward long-term behavior change. The ultimate outcome for 28 state news ianuary 2007 these agencies is measured through recidivism-the number of offenders re-arrested, reconvicted or revoked for a non\u00ad crime technical violation. What does the research community say about electronic monitoring? Do electronic monitoring de\u00ad vices improve case management and public safety? Do these devices bring about long-term behavior change? There is little scientific research documenting the effective\u00ad ness of electronic monitoring devices with sex offenders or other offenders. Mark Renzema and Evan Mayo-Wilson in 2005 con\u00ad ducted the most thorough review thus far of research literature \u00b7 on electronic monitoring effectiveness. They found only three research reports met all their inclusion criteria as methodologi\u00ad cally rigorous; one was from the United Kingdom. The overall assessment is that \"applications of electronic monitoring as a tool for reducing crime are not supported by existing data,\" according to their report in the Journal of Experimental Criminology. A 2000 investigation-by James Bonta, Suzanne Wal\u00ad lace-Capretta and Jennifer Rooney-found slightly lower re\u00ad cidivism for high-risk offenders in a program using electronic monitoring devices. Most interesting about these findings is that the electronic monitoring component was not what re\u00ad duced re-offending. Rather, high-\u00b7risk offenders supervised with an electronic monitoring device seem to have a greater likelihood of completing treatment, with those who completed treatment performing better overall. Therefore, the offend\u00ad ers in the electronic monitoring program were more likely to complete treatment, and the interaction between these two jnterventions-cognitive~behavioral treatment and electronic monitoring-reduced recidivism . J ' I \\ ,.he 2000 study tells us nothing, however, about how elec- ; ._ nic monitoring affects the behavior of violent or sex-related '' \u00b7 offenders because these groups were excluded from the study. A 2002 stucly by Mary Finn and Suzanne Muirhead-Steves, however, compared the likelihood a violent offender would re\u00ad turn to prison within four years of release. These researchers determined that electronic monitoring had little direct impact on reducing reincarceration or extension of offenders' time in the community. Sex offenders supervised with electronic mon\u00ad itoring devices performed better than similar (based on crim\u00ad inal history) sex offenders not in the program. The authors, however, do not call for increased use of electronic monitoring for sex offenders. Instead, they call for inore research on this topic-their sample was limited to :i5 monitored sex offend\u00ad ers-to understand how this group experiences the monitoring sanction and conclude that electronic monitoring \"does not ap\u00ad pear to ensure greater community protection.\" A recent evaluation of more than 75,000 offenders super\u00ad vised with electronic monitoring devices in Florida uncovered reduced revocations for new crimes, technical violations and absconding for sex offenders Supervised with electronic moni\u00ad toring devices. The findings need to be carefully accepted as the authors-Kathy Padgett, William Bales and Thomas Blomberg-acknowledge that sex offenders, regardless of be\u00ad ing supervised with an electronic monitoring device, were the t likely of all types of offenders to have their supervision ked due to a new crime or to abscond. Implicitly this calls question the need to aggressively monitor all sex offend\u00ad ers in the same way. Conclusion: Electronic Monitoring A Tool, Not The Solution What is reasonable to expect from community corrections? Commu\u00ad nity corrections, institutional cor\u00ad rections, the police and the entire justice system are not capable of ending all sex offending. This is not to say that nothing works with sex offenders. Rather, simply to point out that ending all of any type of offense may not be a realistic ( or fair) goal for the justice system. If we consider one of the most power\u00ad ful social institutio.ns, the medical field, success is not measured by the eradication of all diseases or ending all cancer or diabetes. Instead, more incremental goals-such as uncov- . -\u00b7ng new explanations for causes iseases and conti_nual research, elopment and implementation of new procedures, tools and strategies to lead to a more healthy society\u00ad are established. Crime control policy must originate from scientific, riot po,,' litical, procedures. Science, although not infalli),le,. has. the ) , potential to implement methodologically rigorous research to \u00b7 _. . test criminological and criminal justice theories to .uiide\"I'stanq\u00b7 . .c \"_ the causes of crime and the most effective strategies to combat ' . criminality. This is not to say that the public should not be . outraged or that policymakers should not demand serious pun-/ \u00b7\u00b7: ishments for individuals committing sex crimes-especially \u00b7 those against society's most vulnerable citizens. Nor are we arguing that electronic monitoring and the legislative push to developing such devices to supervise sex offenders is inherent- ly erroneous. This article is intended to convey to.the policy\u00ad making community a glimpse of what the research community has uncovered on sex offenders and electronic monitoring-to offer evidence for evidence-based sex offender policy. Electronic monitoring technologies are only one possible su\u00ad pervision tool for sex offenders. These devices are not a pana\u00ad cea to se~ offending or any other form of criminal behavior. They come with certain advantages, but are also accompanied by a host of problems such as increasing officer workload, agency liability and large financial costs, Sex offender poli\u00ad cies must avoid knee-jerk reactions and move toward rational evidence-based practices to 11!.0st effectively protect our com\u00ad munities against sex-related crimes. -Matthew DeMichele is a research associate with the Ameri\u00ad can Probation & Parole Association; Brian Payne is a pro\u00ad fessO\u00b7, at 014 Dominion University; and Deeanna Button is a_ \u00b7graduate student at Old Dominion University. DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS & REHABILITATION DIVISION OF FIELD SERVICES NORTH DAKOTA TEEN CHALLENGE North Dakota Teen Challenge is a non-profit 13-19 month residential inpatient recovery program for adult men and women struggling with life controlling problems such as drng addictions and violence. Currently the men's program, located in Mandan, ND, has 44 students. Twenty-five of those students are on supervision with the ND Department of Corrections. The men's program has had 20 graduates since arriving in September of2005 to Mandan. Fourteen of those graduates were, and still are, under our supervision. Of those 14 graduates, six are employed in the community, two are interning with Teen Challenge, two are employed by Teen Challenge, t\\vo are attending college and two are incarcerated due to new charges and probation violations. The men's program can house up to 150 men. Four sh1dents are currently involved in the six-month Re-Entry Program where they are allowed to work outside of Teen Challenge. They do have a curfew and are required to pay $300 per month rent. The rent money is returned to them upon completion of the program to assist them in their re-entry into the community. The Teen Challenge can house 25 students in the Re-Entry Program. The women's program, located in Bismarck, ND, opened in June of 2006. Currently the women's program has 15 female students, nine of which are under the supervision of the ND Department of Corrections. The women's program has a daycare component and there arc currently seven children in the daycare. Four of those children are enrolled at Shiloh Christian School. The women's program expects their first female to graduate in July 2007. The women's program can house up to 80 students. In the fall of 2006, Teen Challenge did hire a Licensed Addiction Counselor and now has a Licensed Addiction Program in their facility. This program offers four beds for women and four beds for men. This program is only available to those who are able to self-pay or have insurnncc. This is a 90-day residential program offering the same curriculum as the Teen Challenge Program. Those completing the treatment program could enter into the 13-19 month program with approximately ten months of the program remaining. Currently there is one female in thf: Licensed Addiction Program. Teen Challenge is in the process of starting a Restoration Program. This program is designed for graduates who are struggling in the community. Students would return to the program for approximately 90 days in an attempt to get their life back on track. North Dakota Teen Challenge relics mainly on private funding for all of their programming . North Dakota Teen Challenge January 29, 2007 The current contract between Teen Challenge and DOCR calls for $16 per day to cover room & board The current biennium's $ I 50,000 appropriation was only sufficient to cover about 16 months of the biennium Even at the Gov .'s proposed budget of $300,000 the $ I 6 per day is not enough to cover the current number of residents that are there as a result of court orders Based on current residents and an average of 70% being court ordered it would take $490,000 to meet $16 per day for a whole biennium. (Based on actual count today, per DOCR it would take $468,000) While the $300,000 in the Governor's recommendation is double what was funded last session, the number of court ordered residents is four times what it was two years ago. DOCR officials have told me, if not for Teen Challenge these people would be in one of3 prison facilities with an average per day cost of $76 Thus, my sales pitch is, more funding for TC will save the State money. Rod Backman 400-2076 MEMO UPDATE 4-12-07 DOCR resident counts monthly day= $450,848 (Does not provide a growth factor or for inflation) House Appropriations Committee Human Resources Division Chairman Pollert HB 1015 Department of Corrections January 11, 2007 By Rod Backman, Lobbyist representing North Dakota Teen Challenge (NDTC). Mr. Chairman & members of the committee. My name is Rod Backman; I am appearing before you today on behalf of ND Teen Challenge. NDTC is a faith based residential recovery program for drug and alcohol addictions, the vast majority of the residents are being treated for methamphetamine addiction. I have assembled some general statistics on the Teen Challenge program to give you an idea of the cost and success of the program in North Dakota. In the 2005 Legislative session an appropriation of $150,000 was made for just such faith based programs. NDTC submitted a proposal to the Department of Corrections (DOCR) to provide room and board based on approximately $16 per day. At that time the facility was located in Williston and had a maximum capacity of 16 beds. The $150,000 of funding was sufficient to cover the $16 per day for about 16 months of the biennium. Based on the need and demand for such services the Williston facility was quickly outgrown. NDTC relocated to Mandan's former Heartview facility in September of 2005. This facility can accommo_date approximately 200 residents. The current resident count in Mandan is 45. NDTC has also recently opened a women's facility in Bismarck which can accommodate approximately 100 residents and 16 children. Current actual resident count is 15 women and 6 children. The Bismarck facility also operates a day care for the children and a benefactor is paying tuition for the school age children at a private Christian school. The program is a 13 month recovery with a 6 month transitional extended care program. They also operate a 90 day licensed treatment program. Approximately 70% of the residents are there as an alternative to incarceration. I have been told by DOCR officials, if not for Teen Challenge these residents would be in one of three DOCR facilities that have an average per day cost of $76. NDTC is providing a service to the state and the community at a substantial savings to the taxpaying public. In the three years of existence in North Dakota private donations of$3.5 million, a large portion from out of state, have contributed to that taxpayer savings. We recognize that NDTC may not be for every offender, however based on ongoing tracking of the graduates, a success rate in excess of 80%, with only 2 back in prison, makes the program not only a bargain financially but also a benefit to society as a whole. We are grateful to the Department of Corrections, the Legislature's recommendations from the Commission on Alternatives to Incarceration and to the Governor for the increased recommended appropriation. However, in light of the increase in number of residents and the anticipated further increases in residents, we would like to see the appropriation sufficient enough to fully fund the $16 per day contract. Mr. Chairman, I would be happy to attempt to answer any questions you or the committee may have. Thank You. Rod Backman Written Testimony House Appropriations Committee: Human Resources Division House Bill 1015 Representative Chet Pollert -Chair Submitted by: Anna M. (Andi) Johnson, LAC Director of Operations ShareHouse/Sister's Path/Robinson Recovery Center Fargo, N.D. Chairman Poller! and members of the House Appropriations Committee, my name is Andi Johnson and I am currently the Director of Operations for ShareHouse and all subsidiaries. I was able to provide brief verbal comments regarding the budget for DOCR Field Services but would like to follow up with written testimony . ShareHouse stands in support of House Bill 1015 secondary to its increase in funding for expansion of drug courts across the state of North Dakota. ShareHouse is privileged to provide treatment for the Cass County Drug Court. The success identified in the drug court experience is unequalled secondary to the amount of time within the treatment experience, ongoing drug testing, and cohesive relationship between the treatment provider and the court system including the probation officer. The expansion of drug court across the state of North Dakota would improve outcomes for treatment offenders and offer a true alternative to incarceration. ShareHouse also supports this bill to increase the number of probation officers in the field.

My name is Elaine Little, Administrator of the North Central Correctional and Rehabilitation Center (NCCRC) in Rugby, ND. I am here to testify in support of Section 6 of HS 1015. The NCCRC is a new 129 bed combined jail/treatment center that began operations in September 2006. The facility operates on the generation of revenue from housing of inmates for various entities, including the North Dakota Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (DOCR). The DOCR houses inmates at the NCCRC in both the jail and treatment unit. The treatment unit can house 30-35 inmates of which most are sent by the DOCR. The number of DOCR offenders in the treatment unit has ranged from 19 to 30 offenders. Since the NCCRC operates on its own revenues, monthly cash flow becomes very important to the facility. Section 6 of HS 1015 would assure equal monthly payments from the DOCR for the inmates housed in the Treatment Unit. This would help the NCCRC to stabilize its monthly cash flow. The NCCRC greatly appreciates the DOCR's support and urges the Senate Appropriations Committee to support Section 6 of HS 1015. Thank you. Submitted by Elaine Little Administrator, NCCRC March 5, 2007 \u00b7- ' I ' LEGISLATIVE TESTIMONY HUMAN RESOURCES SUBCOMMITTEE Chairman -Representative Pollert January 11, 2007 Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, my name is Kerry Wicks and I am the clinical director of residential services at the North Dakota State Hospital. I have been asked to comment on the partnership of the Department of Human Services (OHS) with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (DOCR) in developing and operating the Tompkins Rehabilitation and Corrections Center. I'll also be available to answer questions you may have. The Tompkins program has now been in operation since 1999. From the start, the leadership from both state departments have kept a vision of creating a program that does the best job possible to keep offenders from returning to prison. When Alex Schweitzer and I first met with Warren Emmer, Rick Hoekstra and Tracy Stein, it didn't take long to realize the unmet needs of the corrections populations and how the two organizations could combine resources and expertise. Alex gave immediate support and elicited the support from the Department of Human Services. It was this same willingness, flexibility and support from the Directors of both Departments, Carol Olson and Elaine Little, that allowed the Tompkins Center to go forward. That same commitment and support continues now with DOCR Director Leann Bertsch. ' t ' The strength of the program has been in the linking of resources from two of the largest departments in North Dakota to provide efficient and very effective treatment. The process is the key. From the initial evaluation of all inmates to the referral to appropriate interventions to the follow through in the community, both agencies have extensive expertise. The Tompkins program also has staff from the DOCR on sight as part of the every day operation of the program. The Tompkins program has been developed and is operated on the best practice research available. It is a structured therapeutic community with cognitive behavioral treatment approaches. The program is a residential facility with 24-hour a day, seven days a week service. Cognitive restructuring is used to reduce risks to re-offend and to support the management of the milieu. The program ties all components of treatment together in a unified approach. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospital Organizations (JCAHO) accredits the program and the Department of Human Services, Division of Mental Health and Substance Abuse, licenses the program through deemed status. This concludes my testimony, I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.

As a result of the NOSH action of moving the male TRCC program from the GM Building to the Nurse's Building, the DOCR incorrectly assumed that male capacity could be increased from 60 beds to 90 beds without additional programmatic or financial resources. After submission of the OOCR budget and prior to the start of the 2007 legislative session, the NOSH made the OOCR aware that the amount budgeted for the operation of the TRCC program ($4.5 million) was based on a total capacity of 90 and that a capacity increase of 30 additional male beds would not be feasible, financially or programmatically. As a result of not being able to increase the capacity of the TRCC program, the difference (24) between the male capacity inmate status numbers under the \"DOCR Assumed Program Capacity\" (72) and the \"NDSH Actual Program Capacity\" (48) must be accounted for under a different category in the \"2007-09 DOCR Inmate Management Plan\". Due to the fact all inmate housing options under the control of the OOCR are projected to be at 100% capacity for the entire 2007--09 biennium, the only remaining housing option for 24 male inmates is contract housing (county jails). ---------r LEGISLATIVE TESTIMONY HUMAN RESOURCES SUBCOMMITTEE Chairman -Representative Pollert January 26, 2007 Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, my name is Kerry Wicks and I am the clinical director of the Tompkins Rehabilitation and Corrections Center at the North State Hospital. I have been asked to present program evaluation data from the Tompkins Rehabilitation and Corrections Center that includes three longitudinal studies: 1. Perception of Care Survey -describes perception of the resident about the care received. 31 variables are measured. The report available is a 4-year study. See graphs attached . 2. Criminogenic Risk study -this study measures improvement in the reduction of criminogenic risk (those risks known to increase the likelihood of an offender returning to prison). The study measures improvement from the beginning of treatment to discharge from treatment. The study measures 15 variables that are known criminogenic risks. The report available is a 4-year study. See graphs attached. 3. Program evaluation -this study is an 18-24 month program evaluation post discharge from treatment at the Tompkins Rehabilitation and Corrections Center. The outcome scores are compared with severity scores at admission. The instrument used to measure results is the Addiction Severity Index; a nationally recognized, valid, reliable instrument used in the evaluation of addiction treatment programs. The Addiction Severity Index measures seven domains that are descriptive of life functioning. This study includes: 119 cases followed from discharge to 18-24 months post discharge 70% methamphetamine abuse in the women's sample 40% methamphetamine abuse in the men's sample All cases are high risk offenders (risk to re-offend) as measured on the Level of Services Inventory -Revised (LSI\u00ad R) Domains measured are: o Medical o Employment o Alcohol o Drug o Legal o Family/social o Psychiatric See graphs attached. There are three points I would like to make regarding outcome data and what are reported as success rates. The questions asked in determining outcome are extremely important. Using an instrument that has been validated and tested for reliability is a necessity for dependable information. Success needs to be measured in 'real life' ways such as improvement in Job, Family, etc. Methods used must include an adequate sample size, consistency in the process of gathering data, and the use of methodology that obtains accurate results. This concludes my testimony, I would be happy to answer any questions.

The JRCC opened in June of 1998 housing both male and female inmates. In November of 2003 the majority of the female inmates (minimum custody) . _were transferred to New England with the remaining being transferred in August of 2004 when the New England facility met the requirements for holding higher custodywomen. The JRCC has experienced significant growth and operational changes to help meet the demands created by the increase in our inmate population. In July of 2001, the fifth and sixth floors were remodeled and 112 beds were added to our facility capacity. We opened a much needed mental health unit for inmates called the Special Assistance Unit in November of 2002. This 25-bed unit provides special treatment and programming for the growing number of inmates identified with serious mental health or special \u00b7 needs that are sentenced to prison. Unfortunately we lost our Psychologist to the VA hospital in Fargo two years ago and despite a nationwide job posting to include a personal letter that was sent to every licensed Psychologist in the State of North Dakota, we have not been able to fill the position. I feel it is important to note that the DOC&R has a unique partnership with the North Dakota State Hospital that has generated significant cost benefits and a spirit of cooperation that we can be proud of. We work cooperatively with the State Hospital in the sharing of resources to minimize the need for additional staff and to reduce costs. The NOSH provides Psychiatric, lab, X\u00ad Ray, Pharmacy, and other needed services to the James River Correctional Center. We in tum provide emergency security services, and since July of 2003, when the food service and laundry operation was transferred from the NOSH, we have been providing laundry and food services for the Hospital. _J By utilizing inmate labor in the laundry and food services operations, we create meaningful work opportunities for the inmates as well as generating significant cost savings. I must recognize Alex Schweitzer for his efforts in working with us in making this process work effectively. CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAIRS The main housing unit of the James River Correctional Center is often referred to as the ET building. It was built in 1936 and was not being used to its full capability at the time we took possession. Many repairs and improvements have been required due to the age of the building and the need to change its purpose from a hospital to a prison. This legislature has been very supportive by investing in these buildings to correct problems and extend their operational life. In 2005 we were able to remodel the first floor of what is known as the Day Care building and move the administrative offices from inside the fence to provide more space needed inside. A visiting room was added as part of the project so members of the public are no longer forced to walk through Special Assistance Unit to visit in the facility gymnasium. This change has improved the quality of family visits and improved the safety to the public. During this past biennium we received $584,000 in funding to add an elevator and fire suppression to the 18A building to bring it into compliance with ADA and State Fire Codes. This work was completed this summer and the space is used for educational, treatment, and religious programming. An additional $980,000 was allocated for repairs to the ET building and included the remodeling of the old kitchenettes into additional beds. The remaining funds will be use for the addition of storm windows on floors one through four to stop the water damage currently being caused by water leaking through the existing windows. We hope to be able to replace the old drop ceiling with security ceiling panels with any funds remaining. Drop ceilings create a huge area for inmates to hide contraband and are often damaged. The security panels will solve both concerns. This work is scheduled to start this spring and continue through the summer. An additional $200,000 was approved for extraordinary repairs allowing us to repair the leaking roofs of the laundry and administration building and retrofit the elevator of the ET building. With the increasing number of inmates with disabilities, the elevators are critical to ensure compliance with the ADA. The new dorm project added 20 beds to the facility capacity bringing the total to 359 usable beds. The additional beds were completed in July of this year without adding staff and are generating significant savings by reducing the need to contract for those beds. Our average daily inmate count has been approximately 385 inmates. During this biennium we experienced significant growth in the number of inmates entering the system at the same time BTC was under construction and the Rugby facility was not ready to accept inmates. We added bunk beds to the dorms in an effort to manage the growth. The staff put forth a great effort in managing the additional workload during this period. \u00b7 STAFFING Our budget includes the addition of five lieutenant positions for JRCC. These positions are greatly needed to increase staff and inmate supervision and provide a trained supervisor in relief of the shift captain. Currently the captain is the only supervisor in charge of the facility on weekends and after normal business hours. Without a designated subordinate, we are forced to use line officers to fill in when the captain is on leave. Using less experienced staff who are unaccustomed to the position, increases liability and the risk to the security of the facility. Additionally the duties of this position have grown past the abilities of one person to perform them effectively. The captain not only runs the facility, but also must be able to respond to emergencies, conduct staff and inmate investigations, complete performance reviews of staff, and many other duties too legion to list. The expansion of JRCC has generated significant improvements but has also increased the workloads for the staff. We currently have 175 staff supervising an average of 385 inmates. This may not seem like a poor ratio but our physical plant is very staff intensive. The housing unit was a six\u00ad floor hospital not designed to be a prison. The facility is connected to the State Hospital by tunnels and the buildings are filled with blind spots demanding additional security. The industry standard is to have not more than two entrances through a secure perimeter but we have six. We make it work and it is functional, but the working conditions are more difficult and demanding to ensure the safety of the public. The stress levels are reflected in our staff sick leave and turnover. In 2006 we have used 4058 hours of overtime and 1705 hours of comp time to meet the staffing requirements of the facility. We often operate with as few as 21 officers during the day shifts and 11 officers at night. It is important to note that the facility is made up of mostly six man dorms that staff must enter at least hourly to perform security checks. As Warden Schuetzle stated in his testimony, we have had difficulty retaining temporary staff needed to fill the schedule. I respectfully ask that you support our request for the five lieutenant positions to provide some much needed relief for this position and improve the security of the facility. 10 million dollars has been placed in the budget to help address inequities of pay within state government and I ask that you support this effort along with the proposed salary increases and fully funded health care. This funding is essential if we are going to have any chance in recruiting and retaining staff. It is difficult to recruit people to work in a prison setting. We have been advertising for a psychologist to supervise the Special Assistance Unit for over two years and have not been able to fill the position. We also have two RN positions open but anyone with experience is required to take a reduction in pay. It is almost impossible to recruit and retain staff to work in an environment that demands more stress, asks that you risk your personal safety on a daily basis, and to do so for less money than the public sector is offering. We are now seeing staff with five and six years of experience leave for better paying jobs and sign on bonuses. The loss of any employee is difficult and expensive but the loss of veteran officers creates a significant void in our operations. JRCC has lost three shift commanders in the past two years alone. NEXT BIENNIUM Next biennium JRCC has requested $596,075 for additional extraordinary repairs. Some of the larger expenses are for projects such as asbestos abatement, electrical and plumbing repairs, fire suppression in the kitchen and laundry buildings, as well as heating and cooling repairs. I hope that you will continue to protect the investment you have made in these buildings and approve this needed funding. EQUIPMENT We are requesting $75,000 for the replacement of our X-Ray machine. The current unit is old and we can no longer get parts. If it should break down we would be forced to transport inmates to the community hospital for this service. This would increase medical costs and increase the risk to public safety. We are also requesting $15,000 to replace essential security cameras that have surpassed their life expectancy, $20,000 for a Line scan unit that will detect weapons and contraband in our incoming mail, $45,000 for a GE ion Track unit used for drug detection on persons and property entering the facility, $32,000 for recording equipment used with the security cameras, $10,000 for the addition of a video conferencing system and 59,000 for an articulating boom vehicle. The total equipment request is $256,000 I will close this testimony by thanking you for the support you have given and to say that the staff understands the importance of their role in protecting the public and providing inmates with the opportunity to change. I know you understand that role as well and will do what you can to demonstrate that support in our budget requests. I would be glad to answer any questions this committee may have. TESTIMONY ON HB 1015 HOUSE APPROPRIATIONS SUB-COMMITTEE REPRESENTATIVE CHET POLLERT, CHAIRMAN SOUTHWEST MULTI-COUNTY CORRECTION CENTER SUSAN A. RITTER, FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATOR JANUARY 26, 2007 For the record my name is Susan Ritter. I am the Financial Administrator for the SW Multi-County Correction Center located at Dickinson and New England, ND. The SW Multi-County Correction Center (SWMCCC) has been in operation for approximately 25 years. It provides correction services for the six owner counties of the SWMCCC as well as providing contractual correction services for the ND DOCR, federal agencies, and Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Dakota Women's Correction and Rehabilitation Center (DWCRC), a division of SWMCCC, at New England, ND has been operating for approximately two and one-half years. Contracts with the ND Dept. of Corrections (DOCR) are the only contracts that the facility has had during its existence. As we developed our estimates for operating DWCRC we approached the task with a complete team effort. Each department head has had input in the development of what we estimate to be the cost of operation for the next biennium. We believe strongly in the need to work as a team. DWCRC's successes are unlimited when all employees work together toward a common goal. The DWCRC budget is based primarily on providing services for inmate orientation t (assessment, testing, treatment needs, etc.), case planning (targets needs in areas such as chemical addiction, education, mental health, and medical, etc.), risk reduction (treatment and programming including cognitive restructuring, sex offender treatment, chemical addiction treatment, mental health treatment, anger management, religious programs, educational programs, vocational programs, parole planning, Industries, etc.), risk management (administrative segregation, drug testing, etc.), and transition (work release). The staff of DWCRC commits to provide rehabilitative environments that are physically and emotionally safe, being mindful of the obligation to the victims and public. DWCRC's primary responsibilities are public safety and the supervision of individuals placed in its care, custody and control. Costs associated with these responsibilities and commitments include: Payroll, Administrative Expenses, Debt Services, and Information Technology $5,516,266.00 Inmate Expenses, Security, and Food $982,650.00 ( u Treatment, Education, Case Mgmt., Medical, and Industries $706,893.00 Buildings (utilities, insurance, supplies, renovation, etc.) $750,068.00 Total estimated 2007-2009 budget $7,955,877.00 In closing, we ask for your continued support of our contractual agreement between SWMCCC and DOCR by granting this budget request. DWCRC is committed to doing \"what is right\" and in the best interest of the people we serve. Our standard for operation is to provide the highest quality services and products within available resources . DAKOTA WOMEN'S CORRECTIONAL REHAB CENTER A DIVISION OF THE SOUTHWEST MULTI-COUNTY CORRECTION CENTER 440 McKenzie Avenue Rehab Center DOCR -Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation January 26, 2007 Appropriations -Human Resources Division Chet Poller!, Chairman Southwest Multi-County Correction Center The Southwest Multi-County Correction Center (SWMCCC) was established in 1982. It is owned and operated by six counties including Billings, Bowman, Dunn, Hettinger, Slope and Stark. The SWMCCC Board is comprised of six county commissioners representing their respective county. Mr. Duane Wolf, Stark County Commissioner, is the Board Chairman. The Dakota Women's Correctional Rehab Center (DWCRC) was established in 2003. The DWCRC is one of three divisions of the SWMCCC. The Dakota Horizon Youth Center and the Dickinson Adult Detention Center are located in Dickinson. Ken Rooks is the Operations Administrator of the Dickinson facility and Susan Ritter is the Financial Administrator for the SWMCCC. DWCRC currently employs approximately 60 employees. Some of these employees are in a shared position with the Dickinson facility. Population and Capacity Statistics for DWCRC DWCRC's current capacity is 126 beds broken down as follows: Haven Hall -DWCRC has a 70 bed minimum security housing unit consisting of 5 dorm rooms with 10 bed cubicles and 4 dorm rooms with 5 bed cubicles. Horizon Hall -DWCRC has a 40 bed higher custody housing unit consisting of 4 dorm rooms with 1 O bed cubicles . \u00b7 Orientation -DWCRC constructed an orientation unit for female new arrivals in May 2006. This is a dormitory with 2 single bed cubicles and 7 double-bunked cubicles for a total capacity of 16 inmates. This dormitory is attached to Horizon Hall. Special Management Unit: DWCRC completed construction of the Special Management Unit in May 2006. This unit consists of 5 cells with a dayroom, shower and outside rec area. This unit is primarily used for Segregation or Disciplinary Detention. In 2006, DWCRC's average count was 120 inmates, with a low average of 112 inmates in May and a high average in November and December of 125 inmates. The count today is 117. Treatment Programming DWCRC is committed to provide a gender specific treatment program to the inmates in the facility. Our current programming list includes: Primary Addiction Group Cognitive Restructuring Hea~hy Relationships 'Codependency' Group Beyond Trauma Recovery and Healing 'women's mental health' Group Women's Empowerment 'survivors of violence' Group Anger Management Group Lecture Self Help Meetings 'AA, NA, SA, GA, ALANON, CoDA etc.' Houses of Healing 'trauma and loss' Group Sex Offender Counseling is offered on an individual and/or group basis to those inmates who are either required or show a need through an assessment with a qualified counselor . Education Programming: GED/ABE: In 2006, 44 women tested in 67 areas and seven women received their GED certificates. Some of these women did not test in any areas because of low ability. Parenting: A volunteer from Partners in Parenting leads the Turning Points program, which is designed for incarcerated parents. Welding: A partnership with New England Public School was developed to enhance the programming at DWCRC with the welding program. Social Skills: Is a weekly personal development group that meets to discuss subjects like self control, self concepts, communication skills, critical thinking skills, risk taking, and values clarification to name just a few. There are four phases of this program that inmates complete over a five month period. Computers: DWCRC currently has 10 computers in our computer lab. Classes are held once per week for two hours. Classes teach basic keyboarding and Microsoft Word. Inmates work at their own pace in a classroom supervised by a trained computer teacher . Pre-Release: The Pre-Release program has been enjoying great success this year and there is usually a waiting list to get into this three phase program. Inmates in Phase I learn about themselves and discover their strengths and weaknesses. They use this knowledge to compile an employment portfolio that they can take with them when they leave the facility. Phase II helps inmates develop a personal resume, cover letters and many job seeking skills. Inmates in Phase Ill work on uniting with their families, community resources, and finances. Healthy Lifestyles: A new ten week class will be starting in February that will address health, fitness, weight loss, and exercise. Participants in this group will receive a journal that will track their daily food intake, exercise patterns, weekly weights, a weekly diet recommendation, and a journaling section for psychological change as well as physical change. Currently there are 15 higher custody inmates and 12 minimum security inmates signed up for this class. College Correspondence: A partnership with Dickinson State University was developed in the Fall of 2006. Our first college class was held last semester using the ITV system with all 3 inmates enrolled completing the class. This spring term a new course entitled Cultural Communication has started. There are currently two participants in this three credit college course . Recycling: We developed a recycling program with assistance from the city of New England. We currently are only recycling cardboard, but hope to recycle cans, paper and etc. Future Programming: Animal Rescue: We are developing a contract with a local animal rescue program as a satellite center. Spiritual Programming: Baptism and Confirmation Class: Offered upon written request through the appropriate religious body Grief Counseling: Offered through Houses of Healing class, therapy department and one-on-one counseling with the Chaplain. Native American Ceremonies: Sweat Lodge, Smudge and Talking Circle (Indian 12-step) Muslim and Wicca Practices Bible Study Catholic Worship Services Protestant Worship Services Women's Spirituality Volunteers from the Community Over 140 community volunteers completed orientation training since 2004. We have quarterly trainings for all SWMCCC volunteers. 8 volunteers for Prairie Industries Advisory Committee 20 volunteers that come every 6 months for a weekend retreat for the inmates Technology DWCRC has Interactive Television (ITV) capabilities thanks to a grant from Rural Economic Area Partnership. Most of the situations listed below would either mean that staff or inmates would have to transport to and from a location. This creates less cost for staff and safer communities, because inmates stay on-site. The system has given DWCRC many opportunities. We utilize this system for NDSP training and DOCR medical quarterly meetings. During the Orientation phase DOCR Field Services conduct a class on the rules and regulations of probation and parole with each new arrival. Inmates can communicate directly with the field services staff utilizing the ITV. The DOCR Classification Chairman also holds a class on the classification system with all new arrivals utilizing this system. At the completion of the Orientation phase, approximately 28 days, the classification committee which consists of the DOCR Classification Chairman and the DWCRC multi-disciplinary committee, meet utilizing ITV to determine the custody level of all new arrivals. Inmates are present at the classification and communicate with the DOCR Classification Chairman via ITV. The ITV is also used for the Parole Board hearings. SWMCCC's Computer Services Director has developed our web page at www.swmccc.com. It is a great sight to learn more about our organization.

This will be accomplished through the development of a Treatment and Rehabilitation plan for each juvenile and through the provision of an array of services by a dedicated staff who will insure that the juvenile receives these services in the /east restrictive environment. -DJS Mission Statement The Division of Juvenile Services has two organizational structures. DJS Community Services (DJS) operates in each of eight regions across the state, and the Youth Correctional Center (YCC), which is located west of Mandan. The first attachment shows you a one-day count of our population as of January 1, 2007. Our recidivism is rate has been calculated for both 2004 and 2005. The 2004 rate was 14.7%, and 2005 was 14.9%. The Division has consistently reported to you that North Dakota has one of the lowest, if not the lowest, recidivism rates in the country. That continues to be true, although it has become increasingly difficult to find the comparative data for other jurisdictions because there is not a commonly agreed upon definition of recidivism or method of measurement. The Division of Juvenile Services includes in the measure of recidivism all youth who DJS Overview House Appropriations Committee Page 2 of 13 are recommitted to DJS, who are sentenced to prison or who are sentenced to probation with Field Services within one year of the end of their term of custody. The Council of Juvenile Correctional Administrators has surveyed all 50 state juvenile corrections agencies for the past several years in an attempt to shed some light on definitions, data sources and rates across the country. Here are some noteworthy findings taken from the 2004 and 2005 surveys: Only 14 states reported recidivism data to their legislators in 2004. In 2005, the number of states reporting to legislators increased to 23. However, 75% of jurisdictions have some mechanism for tracking recidivism. No single figure which represents a national average of juvenile offender recidivism can be offered, but a range of between 24% and 37% percent seems to be in the ballpark. COMMUNITY SERVICES North Dakota's regionalized case management system provides the foundation for achieving consistent, quality outcomes. The intensive, highly individualized case management process begins with a focus on assessing risk and need, which in tum drives the treatment case plan. The Corrections Specialists utilize resources throughout the continuum of care in order to implement the plan. This efficient, effective method of service delivery costs about $12.00 per day to support a youth in the community. The third attachment DJS Overview House Appropriations Committee Page 3 of 13 le provides a graphic which illustrates the continuum of care, as well as gives you a visual representation of how the case management process works. In addition to careful case management, achieving positive results requires effective programming. We only support a handful of programs, but they are proven interventions that have demonstrated excellent results with our population of youth and families. A back-bone of our community based supervision model is statewide Tracking Services. Trackers provide positive role modeling, mentoring and skill development for youth. Intensive trackers can administer urinalysis and utilize electronic monitoring devices. These are all important aspects of the community supervision process. The service costs about $16 per hour, and has been a mainstay program since 1987 . Another important program is Intensive In-Home. We have been able to sustain Intensive In-Home family therapy services in four regions of the state, and all continue to demonstrate overwhelmingly positive outcomes. The additional advantage of in-home is that it benefits not only to the identified client, but also assists younger children since the entire family unit is addressed in the process. This is a key results program in our system. Day treatment programs are funded in 7 sites around the state; sites operate in Grand Forks, Belcourt, Jamestown, Beach, Dickinson, Fort Yates, and Dunseith. This program is housed in the public school and is accessed as a prevention measure prior to out-of-home placement and as a transition program for students returning to their home district. DJS Overview House Appropriations Committee Page 4 of 13 All three of these central programs can be accessed by other child serving agencies. Tracking, Intensive-In-Home and Day Treatment has been used by court probation staff and county social service workers. Schools use Day Treatment as measure of intervention with behaviorally troubled students who do not meet the criteria for Special Education. Collaboration serves to maximize the usage of existing resources. There are two other programs that DJS supports with its share of Federal funds and grant dollars. These programs operate through contracts with Lutheran Social Services. The first program, Day Report, has been cut back to one site as a direct result of the cutbacks in Federal dollars that we continue to experience. The Day Report program is located in Grand Forks. Contrary to popular wisdom, research shows that most juvenile crime takes place between 3:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. The Day Report program begins at the end of the school day and can last until 9:00 p.m. The program provides structure and accountability for at risk youth during this critical period of the day. Day Report is a versatile program that provides tutoring, teaches positive recreation skills, teaches pro-social community involvement skills, and addresses issues relevant to adolescents. It can be used either as a front-end diversion program or as a transition program following placement. The program is utilized by juvenile court probation staff as well as DJS case managers, and costs an economical $11.50 per day to operate. Restorative Justice is the second \"program\" supported with Federal funds. Precisely stated, Restorative Justice can be described as a concept or DJS Overview House Appropriations Committee Page 5 of 13 philosophy, rather a program. DJS youth are able to take part in three different components of Restorative Justice services. Accountability conferences, victim empathy seminars, and restorative councils all provide avenues for the youth to repair the harm done to individuals as well as their communities. As you can see, we focus our dollars on providing intensive correctional case management and just a few key programs that are supported by data, have proven themselves in our system with our kids, and give us the results we demand. CRITICAL ISSUE: The Division continues to participate in a Medicaid program called Targeted Case Management. It's a complicated process, but essentially it has allowed DJS to access federal dollars for certain case management activities. Over the years, DJS has made every effort to maximize the amount of dollars claimed. Now, the federal Medicaid office has been very clear in their intent to eliminate this reimbursement. If this activity is disallowed at the federal level, this budget is projected to experience a short-fall of approximately $700,000 per year, or $1,400,000 over the course of the next biennium. YOUTH CORRECTIONAL CENTER The Youth Correctional Center (YCC) plays a critical role in the process of achieving positive outcomes for North Dakota's juvenile corrections system. YCC serves to protect our communities when delinquent youth cannot be safely DJS Overview House Appropriations Committee Page 6 of 13 ~------------------------ ------- managed in a less restrictive environment. YCC assumes responsibility for the detention, rehabilitation, instruction and safekeeping of juveniles committed to the institution. In addition to individual and group therapy, the institution provides academic and vocational training. Professional staff counsel and supervise students in all education, therapeutic, work and recreational activities. The operating philosophy within our system is that treatment efforts with youth are not effective until behavior is under control. So, our priority as an institution is to provide an environment that attends to safety while helping youth to develop behavioral control. This framework is pivotal to understanding how we make decisions. In order to help us insure that YCC provides a positive environment for achieving correctional outcomes in delinquent youth, we have participated in Performance-based Standards (PbS) since 1997. Developed and directed by the Council of Juvenile Correctional Administrators (CJCA), PbS sets national standards which focus on self-improvement and accountability. This allows us to measure ourselves against 152 juvenile correctional facilities across 31 states. Performance-based Standards measure the areas of programming, justice, safety, order, security, health, mental health, and reintegration across the facility twice per year. This program gets at the heart of what a juvenile correctional facility should accomplish and has improved the quality of life for youth and staff atYCC . DJS Overview House Appropriations Committee Page 7 of 13 RESIDENT CARE Demographics: The youth who are placed for long term treatment at YCC are 23% female, 77% male, 54% white, 40% Native American, 3% Black and 3% Other. About 42% have a serious mental health disorder diagnosis at intake, and another 14% have a mental health issue. 71% have a substance abuse problem, of these, 16.5% are identified as meth users. About 37% of these youth are struggling with both serious mental health and substance abuse (co-existing or co-morbid disorders). 71 % are identified as having experienced serious disruption or instability in their family life. Almost\u00be of them are identified has having academic problems. Behavioral Health Programming: It is the role of the Youth Correctional Center to develop behavioral control in youth so that they are able to safely step down to another level of care. We accomplish this through the use of our daily structure, a highly developed system of accountability, and our ability to establish relationships with youth. An important tool that becomes a common point of communication across our system is the cognitive restructuring program, EQUIP. The cognitive restructuring program (EQUIP) is delivered to all youth at the facility and is part of the counseling process in our community DJS offices as well. Staff continues to have great confidence in the effectiveness of the program. Mental Health and Substance Abuse: Many of the youth placed for long term treatment at the YCC have a mental health disorder diagnosis, substance abuse/dependency issues or both . OJS Overview House Approprlations Committee Page 8 of 13 --------~ Mental health services are a critical part of accomplishing positive outcomes. In order to focus on their mental health treatment issues, youth must have their behavior under control. While we working toward getting their behavior under control, we must provide mental health services. Psychological counseling services and psychiatric consultation services are provided on a very limited basis through a contract with Medcenter One. Addiction issues are present in a large percentage of the youth served. YCC is licensed to run three levels of programming to address this need, ranging in intensity from education to high intensity addiction treatment. Services are provided by two licensed addiction counselors to young offenders who have failed in less restrictive treatment environments. We approach these problems by combining competent addiction services with a good cognitive restructuring program, the EQUIP program mentioned previously. Earlier in the demographics section, you saw the breakdown of youth placed at YCC for treatment that have a serious emotional disorder. These youth are critically troubled, both emotionally and behaviorally. Perhaps the most critical aspect of our overall mental health services is the attention we pay to risk of self harm posed by the youth in our care. We begin the ongoing process of assessing this risk prior to intake and this is an area all staff are expected to monitor at all times. Within the Suicide Prevention Program, there are formal protocols in place, but the bottom line is that any staff member can place a youth onto observation status at any time. Strict protocol requiring the direct DJS Overview House Appropriations Committee Page 9 of 13 ' observation of a mental health professional governs any step-down in level of status. In addition to the carefully monitored suicide prevention protocol, we continue to strive to make the sleeping rooms as safe as possible. We will be replacing the remainder of our existing beds with security beds this biennium. During the 05-07 budget cycle we were able to replace 15 beds. Physical Health: Medical services are provided on-site through a contract with Medcenter One. Off-site services as well as pharmacy are now submitted through the Medical Management Information Services billing process. Dental services are provided on-site, and optical services will move on-site within the next year. EDUCATION YCC provides educational programming, career preparation and vocational counseling through Marmot Schools, which is fully accredited by the North Central Association Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement, the State Department of Public Instruction, and approved by the State Board of Career and Technical Education. Marmot is the only school in North Dakota that has earned a Transitions Endorsement from the North Central Association Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement. This is the highest level of endorsement and translates into the school being prepared to receive students at their present functioning level and committed to assist students to be prepared to perform in their next placement. This achievement is in direct relation to the quality performance of the YCC teachers and administration . DJS Overview House Appropriations Committee Page 10 of 13 ~-------- --------- In the effort to continue excellence in educational services to the youth who enter YCC, several studies that outline the needs of business and industry as well as the skills of ND workers have been considered. Students who enter YCC are likely to stay in ND as workers. With that said, identified deficiencies of in\u00ad coming workers for our state were the common communication skills of reading and writing. In an effort to meet these demands, we have implemented an intensive reading program, Read Right. The methodology of this program does not just \"better\" reading but eliminates reading symptoms that were causing the reading problems initially. To date, we have had 215 students enter the program with 100 of those students completing as excellent readers. Since inception, the program has shown an average gain of one grade level for every four hours of instruction. From our 100 graduates, 92% post-tested at a post high school range and 100% noted that they experienced an elevated image of themselves by going through the program. One student stated, \"Now, I speak up and volunteer to read out loud. I read more often and comprehend much better.\" The Teacher Composite Schedule for salaries/benefits has been built into the 2007-2009 biennial budget. This schedule was arrived at by comparisons with schools in Fargo, Devils Lake, Minot, Bismarck, and Mandan and was prepared by 0MB. PLANT SERVICES The water and heating systems across the campus are in good shape. There are some concerns about the sewer system, but we are doing repairs on an \"as needed\" basis. We have some roofs that will be replaced this biennium. DJS Overview House Appropriations Committee Page 11 o/13 We told you last session that we hoped the National Guard would be able to help us with the new south entrance project. Not only did they get the road built, but the Highway Department helped us put down black top. The construction of the new road is a good example of how North Dakota agencies cooperate, including the National Guard, Morton County, and the ND Highway Department. Our one capital improvements project will be to add lighting and security camera surveillance along the new road . DJS Overview House Appropriations Committee Page 12 of 13 o On average, 248 kids are committed to the Division of Juvenile Services (DJS) on an annual basis (21 % Female, 79% Male; 64% White, 31 % Native American, 1 % Black and 4% Other). The total number of juveniles committed to DJS over the last five years has decreased slightly; however, the number of juveniles committed per 1,000 of the youth population has remained fairly constant. o The average length of commitment is 19 months. On any given day, approximately 385 kids are under DJS custody, in the following placement locations: Home 28% Therapeutic Familv Foster Care detention and B'NOI. DJS uses a comprehensive risk/needs assessment process for juveniles committed to their custody. It is a standardized, research-based approach to assessment and case planning for juvenile offenders, linking risk/needs factors to proven treatment intervention strategies. Juveniles in the corrections system tend to have multiple treatment issues including mental health, substance abuse, academic, and family disorganization. Of the caseload: , Approximately 59% have a mental health issue, of which 35% have a serious emotional disorder; Approximately 66% have substance abuse issues; o Approximately 34% have a co-occurring mental health and substance abuse issue; Approximately 74% have academic problems; Approximately 66% have had serious disruption or instability in their family life. The average age of DJS commitment is 16 with 26% of kids being committed after the age of 17 . For these older youth who will soon reach the age of majority it is difficult to access treatment and/or find transitional services. There is a serious and critical gap for those who are aging out of youth services but not equipped emotionally, developmentally or financially to live independently. Specifically, there is a lack of services in the areas of housing, employment, intensive independent living training and case management. Of increasing concern is the treatment and management of substance abusing and addicted youth whose issues tend to be chronic and long tenm. Providers have difficulty in case managing the crisis and relapses that often occur, or behavioral management techniques focus on sanctioning the behavior, which eventually drives the youth deeper into the juvenile justice system. The problem is compounded for youth who have co-occurring mental health and substance abuse issues and are less able to manage their behaviors, leading them into the corrections system more quickly. Although corrections may be an appropriate short term intervention, the complex issues these youth face need long term resources and support. DJS has had a series of recidivism rate studies that have repeatedly registered rates lower than most states in the nation. The most recent two-year period analyzed (7/1/03-6/30/05) shows a combined average recidivism rate of 15%. Page 1 of 2 o Approximately 15% of the kids committed to DJS are placed for long-term treatment at the Youth Correctional Center (YCC), the state's secure juvenile correctional institution which operates within DJS, on an annual basis (23% Female, 77% Male; 54% 40% Native American, 3% Black and 3% Other). YCC operates specific treatment programs to assist youth that have been placed at the facility: Educating for Qua/lty by Understanding Interpersonal Potential (EQUIP} -a treatment approach focusing on cognitive restructuring, anger management, sccial skills, and scclal decision-making; Drug and Alcohol Programming -licensed addiction counselors provide counseling through a drug and alcohol program that has been licensed by the State Division of.Substance Abuse as an Intensive Outpatient and Low Intensive Outpatient Program; Psychiatric and Psychological Setvlces -the purchase of a service contract provides psychiatric evaluations, medication assessments, consultations, extensive Individual therapy and staff training; Pm-Treatment Program for Sex Offenders -juveniles identified as either sexual victims or perpetrators receive pre-treatment programming by a YCC counselor and qualified therapist from West Central Human Services to prepare them for more intensive therapy upon release; Spec/a/ Management Program (SMP)-a highly structured, therapeutic, secure living and education environment Is provided for those juveniles who have been assessed as needing Intensive behavioral programming, and for those high-risk juveniles who may be a danger to themselves or to others; Security lntetvenUon Group (SIG} -a zero-tolerance approach tq,gangs and gang activity Is maintained at the facility and this program provides Information, education and a!lematlves to gang activity and.affiliation. On average, 42% of the kids at YCC for treatment have a serious emotional disorder which requires specialized mental health treatment services. Each youth is screened for potential mental health issues using a standardized, reliable youth screening instrument that is being used by over 400 facilities nationwide. YCC staff are committed to addressing and monitoring the mental health needs of all youth placed at the institution. YCC also provides educational programming, career preparation and vocational counseling through Marmot Schools, which is fully accredited by North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, the State Department of Public Instruction, and the State Board of Career and Technical Education. In 2003, the North Central Association Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement recognized Marmot Schools as a \"Transitions School\" for achieving exemplary capacity for school improvement Marmot Schools operates a Read Right Program, which is an innovative methodology for teaching reading that integrates knowledge of brain research. Since inception, the program has shown an average gain of one grade level for every four hours of instruction. YCC participates in Performance-based Standards (PbS), a self-improvement and accountability system used in 26 states to better the quality of life for youths in custody. PbS sets national goals and provides the blueprint and technique to achieve improvement and success in treating confined youths. The PbS program is the 2004 winner of the prestigious Innovations in Government Award. That award is given by the Harvard University John F. Kennedy School of Government. YCC has continually exceeded the national average in a majority of the operational areas in which data is collected for PbS.

The program assistants assist with recreational programming, conduct culturally appropriate activities for Native American youth, and enable youth to participate in community service opportunities. JABG Purpose Area 9: Juvenile Records System The Division of Juvenile Services (DJS) implemented an automated case management system in 1999 that integrates data between community case workers and correctional center staff. The system has made \"real-time\" data available to community corrections specialists as well as counselors, teachers and administrators at YCC. Annual support and maintenance service costs for the system continue to be paid with JABG funds. In addition, funds are used to support database management, data analysis and program planning provided by contract staff. JABG Purpose Area 14: Restorative Justice Programming The needs of the Judicial Branch continue to be a.'priority for JABG funds. Since .the implementation of the JABG program in 1998, a significant portion of the funding has been used to provide support to the North Dakota Juvenile Court, and although there has been a significant reduction in JABG funds since in recent years, funding to the Juvenile Court has continued in an effort to strengthen the State's juvenile justice system. JABG funding was used to implement and operate a statewide Restorative Justice Program that provides offender accountability conferencing and victim empathy seminars. These programs assist juvenile court probation officers in holding youth accountable by broadening their continuum of services. A majority of the costs for the Restorative Justice Program are now covered by state general funds; however the Restorative Justice Program Director as well as two part-time Restorative Justice Specialists continue to be supported with JABG funding. JABG Purpose Area 16: Detention/Corrections Personnel and Training In order to maintain a highly responsive, effective corrections system, DJS has placed a priority on providing its staff with regular and intensive training. JABG funds continue to be allocated and used to cover the costs of training for DJS personnel. Among other things, DJS provides quarterly training for its community corrections case management staff as well as YCC administrative personnel and counselors.

Currently the parapets are covered with a drivel material and the flat topside of the parapets is deteriorating, due to the moisture that can penetrate through the drivel system. The metal would be installed over the parapet to deflect the moisture issue and to provide protection from moisture to the interior wall of the building. 6) Miscellaneous Repairs: $18,305. This would include necessary X-O repairs that funding would allow for various other projects on campus.

(Nursing Station Stock Inventory- medical and dental) TOTAL $ 221,000 NDYCC {FTE Personnel Requests) 2007-2009 1) Juvenile Institutional Resident -(4 FTE) General Fund JIRS I: Since January of2004 we have had 11 postings (sometimes a posting fills more than one vacancy) for JIRS positions. On average, this process has yielded from 3-4 qualified applicants per posting. We just posted an authorized JIRS position and have received 22 qualified applicants. This larger pool of applicants allows us to choose applicants that are better suited and more experienced to provide quality services to juveniles. Since January 2004, our turnover rate for temp JIRS is 66.7% and the turnover rate for employees in authorized JIRS positions during this same time is 9.3%. This turnover results in additional overtime expenses, training costs, and negatively impacts continuity of services and efficiency of the general operation of the facility. Should these positions be approved there would be no need for the temporary positions. 2) Security Officer I -(1 FTE) General Fund Security Officer I: There are two positions at NDYCC with this classification, one is a temporary and the other is an authorized position. The 57th legislative session approved an authorized security officer position on July I, 2001. Since its inception, only two employees have been in the authorized position. The authorized position has been vacant only one month, that being the time between the first employee resigning and the second assuming the position. Since July of 2001, four different employees have filled the temporary position with an average length of employment of 15 months. This temporary position has been vacant a total of 11 months, one time 8 months and another 3 months, in this time frame. A job announcement was posted during this I I-month period of time. This temporary position offers no benefits and is a 32-hour/week position. This turnover results in additional overtime expenses, training costs, and negatively impacts continuity of services and efficiency of the general operation of the facility. Should this position be approved there would be no need for the temporary position .

The resulting product is a Composite Salary Schedule recommendation for the next biennial budget. Salary schedules and benefit information was typically gathered from public schools in: Bismarck, Devils Lake, Fargo, Grand Forks, Mandan, and Minot. The 59th Legislative Assembly in Senate Bill 2015 (DOCR's appropriation bill) expanded the data source of the study: SECTION 9. LEGISLATIVE INTENT -COMPOSITE SCHEDULE. It is the intent of the fifty-ninth legislative assembly that future composite schedules for teacher salaries prepared by the office of management and budget's human resource management services division be developed so that the pay increases are based on the salaries of all teachers who teach in schools with a combined enrollment of greater than one hundred students, excluding the Fargo and West Fargo school districts. Results Overview -Salary Schedule Composite Schedule 1 Composite Schedule 1 (attached) is a composite salary schedule reflective of the 2005- 06 salary schedules of 138 schools (list at end of Report) that have a combined enrollment of 100 students or more, excluding Fargo and West Fargo school districts. [The inclusion of Fargo and West Fargo would result in an increase of $71 at base, $81 at the Master's and no experience point.] Page 1 of 4 As is typical of school district salary schedules and composite salary schedules in the past, Composite Schedule 1 advances across based on credentials, while it advances down based on years of service. Composite Schedule 1 base (Bachelor's degree with no experience) represents the exact average of the base of school district salary schedules. The Schedule advances $800 to the second and third lanes (i.e. Bachelor's + 15), $850 from the third to the fourth and the fourth to the fifth lanes, and $1000 to each of the lanes beyond. Composite Schedule 1 advances $500 per step within each lane. These figures were arrived at by considering select points on the schedule in relation to the market average at the same points. Select poin\\s throughout this schedule reflect a variance of +1.3% to -5.7% from the average of the schools' schedules. Observations There are several schools that have significantly fewer lanes and steps than is typical, some as few as 2 lanes. For example, Killdeer has 2 lanes; Wahpeton and Killdeer have only one step. Many schools have hiring schedules only, and these schools typically give a flat dollar or percentage amount to returning teachers. This Composite Schedule is lower than the 2005-07 Composite Salary Schedule. Composite Schedule 2 Composite Schedule 2 (attached) is a salary schedule based on the schedules of the same six school districts as the composite salary schedules dating back to 1997 - Bismarck, Devils Lake, Fargo, Grand Forks, Mandan, and Minot Composite Schedule 2 advances $850 to the second lane (i.e. Bachelor's+ 15), $925 from the second to the third lanes, $950 from the third to the fourth, $975 from the fourth to the fifth, and $1000 to each of the lanes beyond. These increments have not changed since development of the 2001-03 Composite Salary Schedule. \u00b7 The schedule advances $725 per step within each lane. This increment also has not changed since the development of the 2001 -03 Composite Salary Schedule. This figure was arrived at by evenly distributing the difference from step 0 to the maximum and considering points in between in relation to the market. Select points throughout this schedule reflect a variance of +3.2% to -4.9% from the average of the schools' schedules. Page 2 of 4 Common Characteristics of Composite Schedules 1 and 2 Both schedules have progressively increasing increments from lane to lane. This is characteristic of teacher salary schedules and allows for an incentive for teachers to obtain more education in their fields of teaching. Flat amounts from step to step versus progressively increasing amounts reflect that additional experience alone does not increase the value of an employee, but that experience together with additional credentials makes an employee more valuable to the organization. Composite schedules are based on school districts' 2005-06 salary schedules. Therefore, when a composite schedule is implemented, It will already be lagging those of school districts by two years. The amount of the lag is unknown. Results Overview -Benefits The table of Teacher Benefit Information is also included at the end of this Report. The purpose of this information is to show the cost of the various benefits that are provided by the schools surveyed, not to compare the value or quality of benefits in one school to those of another. Summary & Recommendation The Legislature in SB 2015 set forth a different data source to be used in the development of composite schedules. The result is a lower composite schedule (Composite Schedule 1) than is currently in place for the 2005-07 biennium. Implementing a composite schedule that is lower than the current one will have a devastating impact: It will result in inequities as new teachers are hired with the same experience and education as existing teachers. The inequities could result in potential allegations of disparate pay and discrimination if there is a negative impact on protected classes of employees. Salaries of existing employees cannot be decreased without employees being afforded due process. All teachers at the NDSB and NDSD are required to have special education credentials and knowledge in deaf or blind culture. All teachers at YCC work constantly with troubled youth in an at-risk environment. These special situations exceed requirements/conditions for the majority of teachers at other schools. A composite schedule that is lower than the 2005-07 Composite Salary Schedule does not take into consideration the specialized required credentials and work environment of the three state schools. Page 3 of 4 Implementing a lower composite schedule would further compound recruitment problems of hard-to-fill teacher positions, which could jeopardize the schools meeting their missions. NDSB and NDSD have experienced recruitment and retention difficulties. As of this writing, NDSD has a vacancy announcement posted for a Special Needs Teacher for which they have been recruiting unsuccessfully since November, 2005. NDSB and NDSD need to be able to compete with typically larger schools for teaching staff with the same specialized credentials as are required at NDSB and NDSD. All three schools need to be able to compete with schools in their locales (Grand Forks, Devils Lake, and Mandan). Human Resource Management Services (HRMS), without SB 2015, Section 9, in place, would recommend implementation of Composite Schedule 2. It is consistent with the methodology implemented several years ago. It is also important to note that by the date of implementation, the schedule lags the six market schools by two years. It is neither advisable nor appropriate to implement a lower composite schedule. HRMS, therefore, recommends continuing the use of the 2005-07 Composite Salary Schedule through the 2007-09 biennium. Human Resource Management Services also recommends that future composite salary schedules be based on the salary schedules of the six schools identified on page 1 \u00b7 in order that the Composite Salary Schedule maintains a consistent relationship to the market with which it directly competes. Questions pertaining to this document or the study may be directed to Virginia Rivinius at Human Resource Management Services at 328-3374.

The division embraces the Transition from Prison to Community Initiative (TPCI), an evidence based program that helps reduce recidivism. TPCI provides a continuum of care for inrnates leaving the prison and transitioning back into society, by helping them with housing, jobs, treatment referrals, and medical and psychological appointments. Programs Offered We offer level 2.1 and level 3.5 addiction treatment There are AA. NA, and White Bison support groups at all facilities. During the cmrent biennium we added the R.LP. (Rapid Intervention Program) at the MR.CC for parolees who have relapsed while on community supervision. Each addiction treatment program includes a \"family week\", wheI'P. inmates are given the opportunity to make amends with their family members, and the families are given insight into enabling, and relapse issues. Sex Offender Treatment: Sex offenders are screened and assessed for the type of sex offender therapy they require. Staff offer Intensive Sex Offender Group, and Sex Offender Education Classes. Inmates at all three facilities can participate in Sex Offender Anonymous self help groups, and we also provide individual therapy for special needs sex offenders (those who cannot function in a group setting due to behavioral, mental health, or intellectual deficiencies). A Treatment for mental illness: Mentally ill inmates are mostly managl'.d within the general W, population through the use of individual counseling with mental health professionals. When they are in crisis, we have the Special Assistance Unit at the JRCC, and 24-bed mental health unit designed to help the inmate through the crisis, and get stabiliz.ed back on the prescribed medication. Tnmates ('811 also be monitored through our Special Needs Mental Health group. Therapists offer Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) for inmates with a history of post tramnatic mess disorder. Tnmate suicide is a great threat in prison, and we have a unique program where we train inmates to become members of the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT), a group of volunteers that will sit with the suicidal inmates while housed in our observation area. Anger Management: We offer Anger Management and Intensive Anger Management groups for these offenders. We have an Administrative Segregation Anger Management pre-group, for those inmates locked in our most.secure unit Finally, we rely on community volunteers to operate the Alternatives to Violence class, which takes place over 6 weekends annually. Religious Services: The chaplains arrange for retreats, Tent Revival ceremonies, and there are bible studies led by volunteers from most of the traditional Christian churches in the area. The chaplains also host community volunteers for a Time-out for Men .I \u00b7I workshop, Marriage Encounter weekends for inmates and their wives, and an advanced couples counseling weekend. Education: A little more than 20% of our offenders come into prison without a high school diploma, and we immediately get these inmates into a GED program. Approximately 8% of these are assessed as being functionally illiterate and in need of some type of special education to address their learning disabilities. Those that can't read at a level high enough to begin GED class are placed in an Inmate Tutor program, where inmate helpers work with the poor readers in a computeriz.ed reading tutorial program. Inmates may purchase and earn college credits while incarcerated through independent study correspondence classes. They can also participate in a non-credit college level accounting class, and can receive college credits for completion of the Restaurant Management class. Prison instructors teach a pre-algebra class for inmates wishing to study for the SAT or ACT exams. Minimum security inmates may apply for education release, where they are allowed to take college classes on campus at the University of Mary, or Bismarck State College. Staff also assist iomatrs with college applications and financial aid requests for th~se that are being released from prison, and wish to begin post secondary education. We offer a computer typing skills program and Microsoft Office Certification (MOUS) at all three facilities. Inmates go through a pre-release class, that assists them with basic living skills, such as parenting classes, how to balance checking accounts, and resume' writing. We also hold a mock job fair annually, where local employers come to the \\facility and interview inmates, giving them advice on how they can improve their resutne's, and interview skills. Vocational training: Presently, inmates r,an learn how to work in the food service industry though the Restaurant Management Class, and we have an award winning Auto Mechanics program at the MRCC. However, we have been forced tci close Carpentry and Welding vocational p.togiams ove:t the past decade-due-ttnheli1ckoffeaeral fonding that arnhhe-state'sinaoilitytofimll these expenses. Industries: Rough Ridei Industries is a program we offer at all three facilities that can help teach inmates a trade in woodworking, silk screening, upholstery, cut and sew operations, and welding, but there are only enough Industry jobs for about 20% of the male population.

I ' DRAFT House Bill 1015 Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation Appropriation Request Testimony on Prisons Division Funding House Appropriation Committee Human Resources Division 1/10/2007 Tim Schuetzle, Prisons Division Director The request before you is the Governor's proposed budget for operating the three secure facilities that make up the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (DOCR) Prisons Division; the North Dakota State Penitentiary (NDSP), the Missouri River Correctional Center (MRCC) in Bismarck, and the James River Correctional Center (JRCC) in Jamestown, along with an allocation of the DOCR Central Office. My testimony this morning will address this funding request pertaining specifically to these three secure facilities. I have Warden Don Redmann from the James River Correctional Center, who will later present testimony in support of the Governor's budget for the James River Correctional Center, and Dennis Fracassi, who will testify on the budget for Rough Rider Industries. I also have Mr. Keith Grabowska, the Director of the MRCC who is available to answer questions related to his facility, and Dick Frohlich, who will assist in presenting the $42 million dollar request for the building expansion at the State Penitentiary. The 2007-2009 Governor's Executive Budget Recommendation for the Prison Division excluding Rough Rider Industries, is $125, 514, 464, an increase of approximately $58 million dollars in general funds. This increase includes the $42 million for a capital project to renovate the existing State Penitentiary. Before I address the 2007-2009 budget request though, I would like to give the committee a quick review of the prison's division use of the 2005-2007 appropriation. I. 2005-2007 Biennium Highlights a. Current Population Levels The number of inmates incarcerated in the Department of Corrections rose by 42 inmates in the first 18 months of this biennium, going from an average daily population for July of 2005 of 1361, to the December 2006 average daily population of 1403. This is a growth rate of 3% during the first 18 months of this biennium. The male population has increased by 24 inmates since the start of this biennium (1214 on July 1, 2005, to 1238 on January 1, 2007) for a growth rate of 2% for men. This is a smaller percentage than in past biennia, and may be an indication that the rapid growth rate in numbers of our prisoners is beginning to decline. However, the number of female inmates grew by 12.24%, going from 147 on July 1, 2005, to 165 on 1/1/07. The male population growth is very close to our projected levels, but the growth in the number of females is much higher than we projected in our budget Due to construction of 20 additional beds at the JRCC that came available in August of 2006, our operational capacity at the 3 male prisons is now 1011 beds. On 1/1/07, the prisons division had a count of 1238 male prisoners. We needed to contract with county jails, halfway houses, treatment centers, and private prisons to find beds for the male ' I I 2 inmates that couldn't fit irito these 1011 beds. These male inmates were placed in county jails around the state (43), at the Tompkins Rehabilitation and Correctional Center (TRCC) program at the State Hospital ( 4 7), the Bismarck Transition Center program in Bismarck (73). In August of 2006, we were able to discontinue our contract with the private prison in Appleton Minnesota, although we averaged about 40 male inmate boarders there for the first 14 months of the biennium. In September of 2006, we began our relationship with the North Central Correctional and Rehabilitation Center, and on January 1 of this year, we boarded 30 state inmates in the treatment program there, and 4 state inmates in their jail. On 1/1/07, our female inmate count was 165. Of these, 118 were being held at the Dakota Women's Correctional and Rehabilitation Center (DWCRC) in New England, 21 were involved in the women's addiction program at the TRCC at the State hospital, 19 were boarded out at the female transition programs in Bismarck and Fargo, 5 were housed in county jails, and 2 were on temporary leave. b. 2005-2007 Budget Forecast We believe we will end this biennium with a deficiency. Reasons for this deficit include: 1) A higher number of female inmates than projected and a higher cost per day than what was included in our appropriation; 2) Increased medical costs for both male and female inmates that were over the amount we have been allocated; 3) Increases in the amount we needed to expend for boarding male inmates at Appleton and jails, while waiting for boarding cells in state to be constructed (BTC, NCCRC). 4) Higher numbers of inmates kept inside the three facilities, and a higher cost for food. The estimate provided by 0MB and included in SB2023 (the deficiency bill) totals $3.9 million. However, this amount is dependent on a fairly stable population growth over the final 6 months of the biennium, and is subject to change. c. Staffing and Salaries New Positions The 2005 legislature authorized 18 new positions, mostly for more treatment counselors and medical professionals. We were able to hire a Physician and a Nurse Practitioner, and a Dentist and Dental Assistant. This has saved the state money by allowing us to do more procedures on site in our secure infirmaries, as opposed to transporting inmates into the community clinics and hospitals for these medical and dental procedures. We have also been able to do more health education with the inmates, a proactive step in decreasing medical costs. All told, we were able to hire 14 new treatment professionals, including 3 Licensed Addiction Counselors (LAC's), 3 Social Workers to assist in addiction group therapy with the LAC's, and 3 Correctional Caseworkers to teach the cognitive restructuring component of the addiction treatment process. We received two positions to conduct the addiction and risk assessment to all new arrivals. We also received 3 sex offender counselors. When we have been able to hire and retain these people, we have met our goal of getting the inmates through programming more quickly and hence, making them eligible for parole earlier into their sentences. However, we are having difficulty ' I ' 3 attracting, training and retaining these staff. To date, we have already lost three addiction counselors and three sex offender counselors this biennium to better paying jobs. Presently we're having difficulty filling an Addiction Counselor Ill and a Sex Offender Therapist at the JRCC, because the salary we can offer isn't enough to attract applicants. Staff Turnover High staff turnover is not only an issue with counselors, but with Correctional Officers as well. The first year of the biennium, 24 out of 217 Correctional Officer II FTE's left employment with the Prison's Division, an 11 % turnover rate. For the first 6 months of this second year, we've already lost 20 full time Correctional Officers. If the turnover rate continues the next 6 months, we project a turnover rate of 18% for this year. Losing trained officers from our security force negatively impacts staff and inmate safety, and it's also expensive to hire and train their replacements. The quantity and quality of applicants for these open positions is also decreasing. We need temporary employees to fill in for vacation relief for our full time security staff, and we carry an average of 18 temporary Correctional Officers between the three facilities. These temporary officers receive the full 120 hours of training and become certified Correctional Officers. It is from this pool of employees that we fill the open FTE when an officer resigns. However, the starting pay is lower for temps, and they do not qualify for benefits until they move into a vacant FTE spot. Because of this, the turnover rate for these temporary correctional officers is even higher than for full time staff. The first year of the biennium 1 O of these temps left our employment before assuming a full time position, a turnover rate of 59%. In the first 6 months of this second year, 7 of 18 (39%) have already stopped their employment with us. Many of these new officers leave because once they have been trained and certified by the state, they become attractive to county jails, and their starting salary there is frequently much higher than the state offers. Staff Salaries The Governor and 2005 Legislature provided state employees with a 4% raise each year of this biennium. In addition, there was approximately 1.75 million dollars in this budget for equity raises for correctional officers, parole officers, and DOCR staff. Those staff that received the annual raises and an equity increase are very appreciative of the recognition of their salary problems you gave them this biennium. d. Capital Construction Projects during 2005-2007 The present biennium budget included approximately 1.5 million dollars for capital projects, all at the JRCC. There was $980,000 for adding 20 new beds in the ET building, the main dormitory, and to add new exterior windows and install steel ceiling tile to one or more of the floors that serve as the secure space for the inmates. The 20 new cells were completed on schedule and budget, and we moved inmates into them in August of 2006. The bids for the window project will be opened next week. with work to be completed this spring and summer. I ' 4 We also received $584,000 for building code improvements to the 18A building. This three-story building has the space prison needs for treatment and education classes at the facility, but it required improvements to bring it up to code before it could be occupied. These improvements included adding an elevator and stairwell to make it ADA accessible, new roofing, and restrooms. This work was completed last summer. 11. 2007-2009 Biennial Budget The 2007-2009 Governor's Executive Budget Recommendation for the Prison Division, excluding Rough Rider Industries, is $125, 514, 464, an increase of approximately $58 million dollars in general funds. However, this general fund increase includes the $42 million to renovate the existing State Penitentiary, and 14 million more for the cost of operations. Significant changes to the budget which require this 14 million increase include: a. Employee Compensation- $4.42 M 07-09 Insurance $1.1 M 05-07 Continuation $629,000 The Executive Budget recommendation for the Prisons Division includes a 4% pay raise for staff in each of the next 2 years, which increases our appropriation request by 2.1 million dollars. It also proposes to fund 100% of the staff health insurance benefits at a cost of 1.1 million. In addition to these recommendations to the DOCR budget, the Governor proposes a 10 million dollar equity fund to address inequities in staff salaries. I strongly support these measures that have been taken to address pay for staff and ask that you also support them by keeping this appropriation in the DOCR budget. New bricks and mortar may work as a physical barrier to keep the inmates locked away from society, but it's well-trained, experienced staff that prevent prison riots, escapes, and provide the real security of a prison. North Dakota is fortunate to have some of the best correctional staff, and therefore prisons, in the country. This past biennium, we had no escapes from any of our facilities, there were no riots which resulted in property damage, and no unnatural inmate deaths. However, as mentioned earlier, our employee turnover rate is too high. The challenge for us will be to keep these trained staff by implementing pro-active measures that reduce our turnover rates. The proposals in the executive budget for staff raises. a good benefit package, and an equity pool will give us some tools to remain as an attractive place to work. Please help us continue to protect the public by supporting these measures that will allow us to retain our experienced staff. As the prison's populations have increased, the staff have become adept at taking on additional job duties to meet the need. A recent review of job classifications showed that a number of positions should be reclassified to a higher grade. A good portion of this money is needed to reclassify 10 Food Service Worker positions at the JRCC, to Correctional Officer II positions. These are employees that worked previously for the State Hospital, but were transferred to the DOCR in July of 2003 when the JRCC began preparing the meals for both the hospital patients, and the JRCC inmates. These employees directly supervise inmates in producing and serving the food, and have been trained as Correctional Officers. Employees in similar positions at NDSP and MRCC are ' ' --- ------------- 5 classified as Correctional Officers due to the security work they perform daily. There are other large groups of staff that are also having their positions reclassified. For example, the job duties and responsibilities for Correctional Officer ll's, presently at a grade 9, have increased so that they meet the guidelines to be reclassified to grade 10 next biennium. Although there is no guarantee of more salary with a reclassification, the starting pay range for a grade 1 O is higher than for a grade 9 position. A portion of the $592,000 is needed to increase the salaries of those employees so that they will fall within the next highest pay range. b. Additional Staff -$982,000 The Executive budget includes a total of 14.3 new positions in the Prisons Division cost center however, 3.3 of these new positions are actually our cost allocation for new positions that will go to the DOCR Central Office. These allocated new positions will be addressed by Director Bertsch in her remarks. This leaves 11 new positions for the Prisons Division. 6 of these new positions we're requesting are not actually new to the department, but are for staff that have been filling these duties as temporary employees, in some cases for over 4 years. The other 5 new staff would be for COiii (lieutenants) at the JRCC. JRCC Lieutenants- 5 FTE. Warden Redmann is in a better position to discuss the critical need for these staff at his facility, so I will keep these comments short. When the JRCC opened in 1998, there were only 3 floors available, for a total useable bed space of 240 inmates. At that time, it was felt that one shift supervisor was sufficient to meet the supervision needs for a smaller staff. However, since then, the JRCC has increased its number of useable beds to 359, plus added the Special Assistance Unit. During the present biennium, they have operated daily with an average of 30 inmates over that capacity. We have requested these additional supervisory positions for the past two biennia and there is a critical need for us to get these staff hired as soon as possible. Chaplains- 2 FTE. We have two full time chaplains in the Prisons Division, one to serve the inmates at JRCC, and the other to work at the two Bismarck facilities. Originally, these people were employed by the North Dakota Conference of Churches, and we would contract with them for their services. The Conference of Churches had a benefit package for these employees. Over 4 years ago, our relationship with the Conference of Churches ended, and we began to contract with the chaplains directly. However, since we don't have the FTE in our budget, they are considered temporary employees. They do not qualify for the state benefit package. Both of these employees have been at their posts for over 4 years as temporary staff. We believe it is only fair to treat these men as full time staff, and allow them to participate in the benefit package. Administrative Assistant I, Treatment Department -1.25 FTE. We are requesting that the 1.25 temporary clerical positions in the Treatment department be made full time employees. Both of these temporary positions have been in place for over 6 years. They are needed to help with filing the treatment records for all the inmates within the prisons division, and to provide clerical support for the 14 new treatment positions we received this biennium. We've seen extensive turnover in one of these positions due to the low pay and lack of benefits. The electronic filing system software is complicated, and requires specialized training to master the system, so we quickly fall behind when we lose the person to a different job and need to retrain a new hire. The other .25 position is already filled by a long term employee that works 40 hours each week; 30 of those as a --------- ------- ----------- 6 \u00be state employee, and 10 hours as a temporary employee. The .25 FTE request would allow us to make that position a full time, state employee. 1 Office Assistant Ill and .5 Office Assistant I in the Medical Department- We presently have a half-time Office Assistant I position, which had been filled for 14 years by the same employee, whose main duties are transcribing physician orders and managing the eye doctor clinic. Approximately 3 years ago, we could not keep up with the workload, and this half-time employee began working full time, with the other 20 hours each week paid out of temporary dollars. We are requesting that we be granted a .5 position so we can now make this position a full time state employee. The Office Assistant Ill position was added in June of 2005 to manage the clinics we run at the prison now that we have the Physician and Nurse Practitioner on board, and to manage the Medicaid billing process through the OHS for the Prisons and the DWCRC. This person has been in a temporary position for 2 years now. 1 Registered Nurse-NDSP-This is also presently a temporary position that was needed when we hired the Physician and NP. This temporary RN has been in place since the fall of 2005 . . 25 lnstructor-NDSP/MRCC- This position teaches Adult Basic Education, assisting inmates at NDSP and MRCC to obtain their GED, and has been a \u00be FTE for over 10 years. About 6 years ago, we requested that this employee work full time as our inmate population was growing and we could not meet education needs of all the inmates. Since then, this instructor has been working 40 hours each week; 30 hours as a \u00be state employee, and 10 hours as a temporary employee. The .25 FTE request would allow us to make this position a full time state employee. c. DWCRC Housing payment -$2.1 million increase The Prisons Division cost center contains the appropriation to fund the boarding of female inmates at the DWCRC. As noted earlier, the number of female inmates has grown at a faster rate than we projected this biennium, and costs to house these extra women make up a great percentage of our anticipated deficiency. We continue our strong relationship with the DWCRC, which operated at full capacity for most of this biennium. Early in the biennium, we began providing all of the prescription medications for the women at DWCRC from the pharmacy at the State Penitentiary, and we also began processing the medical bills incurred by female inmates at the DWCRC through the prison's medical department. These measures have helped offset the amount of the deficiency created by the higher number of female inmates, but we still find ourselves needing more money to incarcerate women. The Executive Budget provides an additional $2.1 million for the next biennium to meet these needs, and I ask that you support this increase. d. Food Services ($1.2 Ml and Medical Services ($2.0 Ml Both of these cost centers are factors for our present deficiency. We project a deficiency in the food services budget for 2005-2007 of around $200,000. We estimate a need for an increase in this cost center for the next biennium because we expect to be feeding more inmates at JRCC and patients at the State Hospital, and due to inflationary costs in the food and transportation sectors. We're basing this request on an average meal cost for inmates of $1.27/meal, and for the patients at the State Hospital at $2.64/meal. ' 7 The medical costs also exceed our budget. Causes for this are the same as in past years. increased costs for services. and a more unhealthy prison population created mostly from methamphetamine use. As anticipated. the addition of the Physician, NP and Dentist have helped us contain these rising costs as we have mitigated the expenses incurred in past biennia by doing more procedures \"in house\". as opposed to taking the prisoners to local clinics and hospitals. a. Inmate Electronic Medical Filing System -$1M. The budget before you includes 1 million dollars for the software and for implementation of an electronic filing system for inmate's medical records. There are three different options we are exploring to bring our medical files to a paperless system; the AIMS system. presently utilized by the State Hospital; a different medical records software system that was developed specifically for prisons by the Federal Bureau of Prisons; and the medical kernel for the iTag system from Syscon. the software company that produced iTag. our current inmate information management software. The budget was based on using the iTag software. Obviously, if either of the first two options would be viable. the software costs would likely be less than purchasing the iTag medical kernel, but the costs to make sure the new software could be inter-phased with our current system could run much higher. The department will choose the most cost effective option. The most recent price quote for the Syscon software was $720, 491. This price included the software kernel, pre-implementation studies, customization and enhancement changes that may be needed to the software program to fit into our current business practices. installation costs. and staff training. The remainder of the requested appropriation would be for paying a temporary work force required to load all the paper files into the system. This request was screened by the SITAC committee, and was ranked highest among the IT proposals submitted by the DOCR. and seventh overall. f. Equipment- 1.1 million The executive recommendation includes 1.1 million for equipment expenditures next biennium. however approximately $550,000 of this total is equipment requested by Rough Rider Industries, and would not be paid for with general funds. Some of the larger cost items. by facility, are: NDSP (total $258.000) -A new digital x-ray machine and scanner-$54,000; EKG machine -$5,000; A package screening machine (security in the front lobby) -$27,000; Repeater for digital radios -$48,000. total) ion track (drug and explosives) screening machine - $45,000, and new x-ray machine -$75000, and a self propelled articulating boom lift - $5g,ooo. g. Extraordinary Repairs -$1.8 million The prisons division is requesting approximately 1.8 million for extraordinary repairs. We have established a 10 year schedule for repairs that we know we'll be facing over that time frame. and have prioritized them according to urgency. Should the legislature endorse construction of a new facility over the Executive Budget plan for renovating the State Penitentiary in place, it may be that a portion of the 1.1 million requested at NDSP. and the $42,000 requested for MRCC could be eliminated. However some of the repairs I ' 8 would need to be completed, even if the state was only going to operate these buildings for 3-4 more years during the construction of a new prison. Some of the more expensive repair needs, by facility, are: NDSP ($1.1 million)- Overhaul of the stand-by generator-$300,000; RRI building roof-$45,000; NDSP network ($600,000) -Warden Redmann from the repair projects for the JRCC. MRCC (42.000)- Repair Dining Hall roof-$12,000; Heat pump replacement-$ 15,000; Road and Parking lot maintenance-$13,000. h. Capital Project-$42M for renovating existing prison A few years ago at our strategic planning meeting, the Prisons Division completed a needs assessment of the physical plant issues faced by our department. Due to the increase in the inmate population, we were forced to board many of our inmates outside the three prisons. Each month we averaged between 70 to 75 new arrivals coming into the prison for orientation, and our present orientation unit was not large enough to house all of the inmates needing the 30 day reception program. Our 40 bed Administrative Segregation Unit (AS) where we house our most violent offenders was full, and we faced daily decisions to find the least risky AS inmate to release back into the general population, to make room for a more violent inmate that required this higher level of security. The prison's infirmary was in a poor location on the second floor of the administration building, and had only 5 hospital cells, which were also always full. The clinic, in the same location was too small, and did not provide the privacy necessary for doctor/patient discussions. The 2003 legislature approved funding for the department to contract with an architectural firm to explore these physical plant needs, and in May of 2004, we contracted with Ritterbush Ellig and Hulsing architects, in conjunction with HOR Architects Inc., to develop a building plan for renovating and remodeling the current State Penitentiary. The booklet before you is the end result of that planning. It details a $42 million renovation project which would expand the inside perimeter, add a new reception building and a 75 to 100 bed orientation dorm, a 225 bed cell house, a 90 bed Administrative Segregation unit, a 20 bed infirmary and clinic area in the middle of the facility, and location changes to the south tower, laundry and warehouse buildings, which need to be moved to accommodate space for the new construction. After this new construction is completed, there would be 794 useable beds for the general population at NDSP. This plan has been supported by the Governor, and by the members of the Legislative Interim Budget Committee, albeit by a close vote of 10 to 9, over a plan discussed by some on that committee to completely replace the NDSP and MRCC, sell the lands, and build a new prison. It's encouraging that our leaders have recognized the need to do something to address the need for more prison beds, and both plans have advantages and disadvantages. ' ' ' 9 Some advantages of the $42 million \"rebuild in place \"option is it's relatively lower cost than building a new facility. It allows the state to retain some of its $31 million investment it has made in capital projects over the past twenty years. Of the approximately 320,000 square feet of building space inside the walls of the State Penitentiary (including the power plant), 180,000 sq. ft., or 57% of the space, has been constructed since 1982, and many of these buildings still have a useful life expectancy. This plan addresses all of the present needs of the department (more general population beds, a larger AS unit, Clinic and Infirmary, and Orientation/reception building, etc.). After the East Cell house is demolished, the next two oldest buildings would be the Administration building that was constructed in the 1950's, and the West Cell House, opened in 1962. Other than the West Cell House though, the other cell blocks are designed in a pod style, and are staff efficient to operate. The rebuild in place philosophy is that when the West Cell House and the Administration Building have reached their life expectancy, they could be replaced with a newer energy and staff efficient design on the same site. The plan in the executive budget is projected to meet the state male prison population needs through the summer of 2014. This has also been designed so that additional pod-style cell houses could be added to the south and east perimeters should there be a need for more beds. Some disadvantages of this plan are that these older buildings will require more maintenance costs than a new building. If it is decided to keep the existing NDSP and MRCC into the future, more money for maintenance and repairs will need to be invested. Some of the extraordinary repair costs requested ion this budget could instead be put towards constructing a new facility. The west cell block would remain, and because of it's design, that building is staff intensive to provide the needed security. The other plan being discussed this session would be to sell the land that houses the MRCC and the 80 acres around the NDSP and use this revenue to demolish these buildings, and acquire land in Burleigh County to build a new 800-bed maximum security prison facility and a 150-bed minimum security facility adjacent and outside the secure perimeter of the maximum unit. Towards that end, the Legislative Interim Budget Committee requested that we have this land appraised. We contracted with Dakota Appraisal and Consulting, Ltd. and have received land values of $5 million for the 80 acres around NDSP, and $7,850,000 for the 785 net useable acres surrounding the MRCC. There are many advantages to building a new facility. The buildings could be designed to be energy efficient, and the newer cell house designs should require fewer staff to provide security. However, exactly how many staff would be needed would be impossible to determine until there were construction plans drawn. One would not expect that a new building would need many repairs over the first 10 years or so, so there would be a savings on the extraordinary repairs line item. The new construction would address all the current needs for more bed space, more segregation beds, a larger Orientation unit, infirmary and clinic. A new building could be designed so that future cell house pods could be added within the perimeter to meet future housing needs. The greatest drawback to new construction is its cost. At the request of some members of the Legislative Interim Budget Committee, the architects that were hired to design the prison remodel plan compiled an estimated cost for a new 950 (800 maximum security and 150 minimum security) bed facility that would mimic the same size, and features of the renovated NDSP and existing MRCC. Their cost estimate is approximately $116 I ' million. A lesser concern that I have might be the tendency for the state stakeholders to believe that building a new facility would meet all of the prisons needs. They may feel less likely to appropriate money to address inmate programs, or officer salary and benefit issues, and that would be a mistake. It is the inmate programs that help the inmates change their negative behaviors, which keeps our recidivism rate low and the population from rising, and it is the quality of the staff that keeps the roof on the prison, making it a safe place to work, and for the inmates to live. This concludes my prepared testimony, but I would be glad to answer any questions the committee members may have. / _.,,,, .. / // // < / /. ..... - / ,,,. ~ . ~ // 15 Years , '( '\\ \\ '~5. .. ,,.--/:>/ 0 ~------------------------------------------~ NORTH L ~ PLANNING AND PROGRAMMING r'LJ ~ NORTH DAKOTA PENITENTIARY EXPANSION HOR Arcliitecture, Inc.

My testimony this morning will address this funding request pertaining specifically to these three secure facilities. The 2007-2009 Governor's Executive Budget Recommendation for the Prison Division excluding Rough Rider Industries, is $125,514,464, an increase of approximately $58 million dollars in general funds. This increase includes the $42 million for a capital project to renovate the existing State Penitentiary. Before I address the 2007-2009 budget request though, I would like to give the committee a quick review of the prison's division use of the 2005-2007 appropriation. I. 2005-2007 Biennium Highlights a. Current Population Levels The number of inmates incarcerated in the Department of Corrections rose by 42 inmates in the first 18 months of this biennium, going from an average daily population for July of 2005 of 1361, to the December 2006 average daily population of 1403. This is a growth rate of 3% during the first 18 months of this biennium. The male population has increased by 24 inmates since the start of this biennium (1214 on July 1, 2005, to 1238 on January 1, 2007) for a growth rate of 2% for men. This is a smaller percentage than in past biennia, and may be an indication that the rapid growth rate in numbers of our prisoners is beginning to decline. However, the number of female inmates grew by 12.24%, going from 147 on July 1, 2005, to 165 on 1/1/07. The male population growth is very close to our projected levels, but the growth in the number of females is much higher than we projected in our budget Due to construction of 20 additional beds at the JRCC that came available in August of 2006, our operational capacity at the 3 male prisons is now 1011 beds. On 1/1/07, the prisons division had a count of 1238 male prisoners. We needed to contract with county jails, halfway houses, treatment centers, and private prisons to find beds for the male inmates that couldn't fit into these 1011 beds. These male inmates were placed in county jails around the state (43), at the Tompkins Rehabilitation and Correctional Center (TRCC) program at the State Hospital (47), the Bismarck Transition Center program in Bismarck (73). In August of 2006, we were able to discontinue our contract with the private prison in Appleton Minnesota, although we averaged about 40 male inmate boarders there for the first 14 months of the biennium. In September of 2006, we began our relationship with the North Central Correctional and Rehabilitation Center, ------------- 9 Some advantages of the $42 million \"rebuild in place \"option is it's relatively lower cost than building a new facility. It allows the state to retain some of its $31 million investment ii has made in capital projects over the past twenty years. Of the approximately 320,000 square feet of building space inside the walls of the State Penitentiary (including the power plant), 180,000 sq. ft., or 57% of the space, has been constructed since 1982, and many of these buildings still have a useful life expectancy.

The rebuild in place philosophy is that when the West Cell House and the Administration Building have reached their life expectancy, they could be replaced with a newer energy and staff efficient design on the same site. The plan in the executive budget is projected to meet the state male prison population needs through the summer of 2014. This has also been designed so that additional pod-style cell houses could be added to the south and east perimeters should there be a need for more beds. The House has passed a budget which provides for $85 million to build a \"new prison\" on the site of the existing State Penitentiary, but that allows for continued use of some of the present buildings. While this plan makes sense in that it retains the state's investment in many of the newer buildings on site, we don't believe that we would need $85 million to replace some of the older, less efficient buildings. If additional money was provided above the $42 million requested in the executive budget, we would explore demolition of the West Cell House, the prison Administration Building, and the DOCR Central Office building. The House plan also calls for selling the MRCC land, and constructing a new minimum-security unit on the land at the Stale Penitentiary. We believe that we could replace these three additional buildings, and rebuild a minimum\u00ad security unit for approximately $65 million. However, we are not in favor of selling the MRCC lands, or relocating that facility. The MRCC dormitory is only about 15 years old, and still has many years of service to provide the state before it needs to be replaced. In addition, there is a new Rough Rider Industries building on the grounds there, which would be abandoned in the House plan. We have had the MRCC land appraised, and its value is estimated at $7 .85 million. Despite this professional appraisal, there are many who erroneously believe that the MRCC land is worth more than that. It doesn't make fiscal sense for the state to sell this land at a point in time when the state doesn't need the revenue, and there are still serviceable buildings at that facility. If the state would postpone this decision for 15 to 20 years, it would allow us to gel the useful life out of the buildings, and the land would only appreciate in value, creating more revenue for the state at a time when it may be more needed Yet a third idea still being discussed this session would be to sell the land that houses the MRCC and the 80 acres around the NDSP and use this revenue to demolish these buildings, and build a new 800-bed maximum security prison facility and a 150-bed minimum security facility adjacent and outside the secure perimeter of the maximum unit. Towards that end, the Legislative Interim Budget Committee requested that we have the State Penitentiary land appraised. We contracted with Dakota Appraisal and Consulting, Ltd. and have received land values of-$5 million for the 80 acres around NDSP. -\u00b7--\u00b7------------------- 10 There are some advantages to building a new facility in that the buildings could be designed to be energy efficient, and the newer cell house designs should require fewer staff to provide security.

No matter which plan the legislature decides, not doing anything is not an option. The DOCR needs more cell space to handle the greater number of prisoners coming into the system, and we need to improve the Infirmary, Orientation, and Segregation units if we are to continue to provide the state with a secure facility that protects the public, and maintains safety for the staff that work there, and the inmates that become wards of the state. This concludes my prepared testimony, but I would be glad to answer any questions the committee members may have.

(Copies of data are also in your packet.) Key things to consider include: 1. Impact of parole -growing rapidly 2. Impact of our assessment center program -reducing the number of offenders going to prison 3. Court's increased use of felony probation sentences North Dakota offender demographics (as of December 31, 2006) A. We serve 4,818 offenders*. 4,233 are on probation (court jurisdiction) 372 are on parole (Parole Board jurisdiction) 589 are interstate transfer cases (Interstate Compact jurisdiction) B. There is a strong relationship between the prison's population and the population that we manage: ~ Field Services Homicide 33 Sex offense 300 Robbery 39 Assault 533 Burglary 502 Theft 724 Drugs Weapons 2,165 71 Prison 116 213 26 346 121 222 1,127 46 o 47% have split sentences that require us to manage them after their release from prison o Approximately 45-50% of prison \"new arrivals\" are probation revocation cases o 61 % of inmates were released on parole supervision * Offenders may /Jave multiple supeivision types. Tile total number of supeivision types may be greater I/Jan the total number of offenders seived . -2 - IV) The building blocks of our success! A. Effective assessment strategies (that provide the court, the Parole and Pardon Advisory Boards, as well as the department, prompt information concerning offender criminal records and future criminal behavior risk factors): 1. Use of risk predicting assessment tools such as: LSI-R (all offenders) MnSOST-R, Static 99, Acute 2000, Stable 2000 (sex offenders) 2. Use of sentencing reports prepared between January 1, 2005 - December 31, 2006: 2,191 Parole/Pardon Advisory Board sentencing reports 1,092 pre-sentence reports 3. Department of Corrections Case Planning Committee \"We provide decision makers with the information they need in order to make good decisions!\" B. Evidence-based treatment and transition programming (that effectively reduces offender future risk): 1. Tompkins Rehabilitation and Corrections Center 2. Transition programming for men (BTC) 3. Transition programming for women (Centre, Inc.) 4. Re-entry programming 5. \u00bd way and \u00bc house placement 6. Department of Human Services programming 7. In-patient treatment (North Central Correctional Rehab Center) 8. Teen Challenge 9. Assessment center programming 10. Proposed transition program to be sited in the Red River Valley C. Thoughtful Parole Board interventions that effectively assist the department in managing its inmate population (supported by our Institutional Offender Services Program -IOSP): 1. The Institutional Offender Services Program (IOSP) develops sentencing reports. The reports are utilized by the Parole and Pardon Advisory Boards, as well as the department. 2. IOSP is the administrative arm of the Pardon Advisory Board and the Parole Board. North Dakota was second in the nation with a 17% increase in the number of people on parole in 2005. Parole revocation -21 % in 2005 compared to a national average of 55%. \"We are making more people attractive for release on parole; they are succeeding!\" -3 - D. Aggressive supervision/security measures (that reduce recidivism and protects the public): 1. Goal orientated/outcome based case planning 2. Drug Court program 3. Drug and alcohol testing 4. Surveillance program 5. GPS and traditional electronic monitoring 6. Home visits 7. Project Safe Neighborhood program 8. Polygraph 9. Operation Falcon/UVAP warrants 10. Sex-offender Specialist program E. Empathetic victim programming (that ensures that victim issues are met): 1. Manage VOCA/CVA programs. 2. Manage Crime Victims Compensation program. 3. Maintain a victim coordinator on staff to assist victims, the department, and the parole and pardon process. This reflects the victim coordinator's activity for the period January 1, 2005 -December 31, 2006. 1. Served 1,971 victims ii. Provided 3,162 separate victim services 4. Holding offenders fiscally responsible. For court-ordered fiscal obligations. This reflects collections from cases terminated during January 1, 2005 -December 31,2006. 1. $2,924,176 restitution ii. $221,972 court costs iii. $454,060 fines Iv. $678,328 fees v. $4,278,536 total For direct fiscal payments to the division. This reflects collections from January 1, 2005 -December 31, 2006. 1. $2,252,753 supervision fees ii. $114,402 interstate compact return fund iii. $2,367,155 total F. Serious consideration of future concerns for corrections in North Dakota: 1: Caseload and delivery systems are heavily burdened and they may fail in the future. 2. Revocation rates for those under supervision will rise if workload issues are not addressed. 3. Less people will be attractive for parole release if workloads are not stabilized. -4 - V) We are proud of what we do! A. Our staff is making a difference; they do a great job! Staff manages a large and risky population of offenders efficiently and effectively. B. Victims of crime, and the public at large, are well served by the Field Services Division. C. Our work is nationally recognized. We consult with other states on \"outcome based\" corrections program designs. We are also leaders on matters concerning the federal Interstate Compact for the Supervision of Adult Offenders. D. Our programming has reduced the growth of the cost of North Dakota corrections this biennium. The proposed budget for '07-'09 will accelerate our favorable impact on the department's budget!

Anticipate I 00% expended at the end of the biennium. NOTE: Crime victim compensation (CVC) current funding is not adequate to meet current need. The 2005-07 budget provides for a total of $426,403 in crime victim compensation payments. The 2005-07 projected need for crime victim compensation payments totals $958,695. The difference between these amounts represents a funding deficiency that is not represented in the current DOCR deficiency request. The current practice regarding these payments is when the budgeted amount for the biennium is met; any additional claims are held and not paid until the start of the next biennium. Considering the 05-07 CVC funding deficiency noted above and the 07-09 eve budget request of$426,403, it is likely that eve claims received and approved in the 07-09 biennium would go unpaid until the 09-11 biennium. In an attempt to \"get in front\" of the eve problem the DOCR respectfully requests that the DOeR be given the authority to use $515,855 of general funds which were appropriated to the DOCR in SB234 l by the 2005 Legislative Assembly. Due to the fact federal funding for the proposed treatment pilot project described in SB2341 was not received, the corresponding general funds of $5 I 5,855 remain unspent.

Friel In 1988, James Evans was sentenced to prison for second-degree murder. Like many Inmates, his educa\u00ad tion had been sketchy; he had completed only the third grade. Faced wlth a lengthy sentence, Evans decided to participate In the vocational training then available at the Utah State Prison. To date, Evans has completed training In building construction, construction management, architec\u00ad ture and an electrical apprenticeship. However, Evans Is not scheduled for release until 2009. Too many times, Inmates graduate from programs, only to sit idle, waiting to complete their sentences. The longer the lag time between finishing the program and the day they are released, the less impact the program has on their eventual reentry Into society. An Ideal situation would be to have an inmate graduate from a program and then be released simultaneously, allowing the Inmate to take full advantage of his or her newly acquired skills. This Is easy to Imagine, but difficult to implement. It has proved a challenge to develop and coordinate a type of program that would help offenders use their abili\u00ad ties In a sufficient timeline and still maintain the security and operational needs of a prison. When administrators at the Utah State Prison at Draper first examined such a pro\u00ad gram, It soon became apparent that It would taJce more than just the Department of Corrections to solve this dilemma. Expanding the Program Vocational training, and specifically, a construction trades program, has been avallable In the Utah state cor\u00ad rectional system since the mld-1980s. At that time, the Salt Lake Community College received a grant that enabled the department to develop an inmate building-construction program, which included an apprenticeship program. Upon completion of the program and after their release from prison, Inmates were provided jobs by local labor organiza\u00ad tions and the Utah Home Builder Association. Such Inmates proved to have knowledge and sldlls above most workers they were competing with for jobs. However, there often remained a distinct lag time between graduation and release dates, a time that left Inmates sitting idle and waltlng. In 1999, a joint operation was developed between the Utah Department of Corrections, Utah Correctional Indus\u00ad tries (UCI), Salt Lake Community College and various other community organizations and members. This collaborative program was called the Construction Apprentice Program, or CAP. The idea behind CAP was to vocational training program available through Salt Lake Community College. The program then provided training In skills such as framing, cabinet maklng, plumbing, electrical and dry wall, interior finishing and business management. As a final project, the Inmates would actually build homes within prison grounds, and upon completion, the college would transport them to predesignated sites. The next step was to coordinate with UC! to take the program to another level. In Utah, UC! is not funded by the state, and is required to make a profit. In addition, inmates In UCI cannot take jobs that will have a negative Impact on the private sector. Therefore, UCI researched the needs of the community, eliminating anything that might provide unfair competition wtth private contractors. Its research, conducted with the help of Salt Lake Community College, uncovered a need for low-income housing. Although Utah, like so many states, has experienced a housing boom, the low-income range was and Is woefully under-setviced. This provided a niche for UCL Moving Forward It took three years, from 1999 to 2002, to hold the neces\u00ad sary public hearings, meetings with local unions and other organizations, and to overcome governmental and commu\u00ad nity obstacles. But finally, permission was granted for the program to go forward. At this point, all that was needed was a work force. Corrections professionals can understand the difficulty and uniqueness of having a work force of Inmates. One has to deal with everything from provide offenders at one of the department's all-male facllltles with opportunities for success from the time that they are com\u00ad mitted until the time that they are released back into the community. When an inmate Is first committed to prison, needs and aptitudes are Identified In reception and orienta\u00ad tion. If an inmate qualifies, as far as education level, skills, physical capabilities and other factors, he Is Over time, the inmates have become more invested in the program and do not want to see anything happen that might jeopardize the privileges associated with it. release dates, gang affllla~ lions, scheduled and unsche\u00ad d uled lockdowns, security checks, accounting for tools and equipment, conflicting time demands, counts, and more places to supervise and not enough staff to go around. One bad Incident could put the whole pro\u00ad gram in jeopardy. offered the opportunity to enroll In a two-year vocational training college degree program in building trades. When Inmates graduate from the training program, they are then placed in an apprenticeship pro\u00ad gram, where they are put to work buildlng homes and earning apprentice hours toward their journeyman certification. Upon release, inmates receive approximately $1,200 worth of tools, and are assisted In finding a job through which they can make a llving wage -making the transition from inmate to citizen and from a taxpayer expense to a con\u00ad tributor to society. On paper, It sounds pretty easy and ideal; however, when you are dealing with entitles and organizations out\u00ad side of your control, along with the Inevitable setbacks from Inmates, staff, foul weather, public scrutiny and, of course, security, It can seem overwhelming. When the process was Initiated In 1999, Utah State Prison officials began, with their existing resources, the In the beginning of the program, 20 to 25 medium\u00ad security inmates who had already graduated from vocational tralnlng were needed. However, with 40 inmates graduating each year, that requirement wac; not hard to meet. A more difficult requirement was living space, It wiis apparent that the Inmates involved in the program needed to be housed together to minimize the risk of tools and contraband finding their way Into the Institution, There\u00ad fore, If a tool did come up missing, it would be confined to a single area The solution to this requirement unexpectedly solidlfled the program. To provide room, the prison officials moved the current Salt Lake Community College vocational train\u00ad ing to another site, with expanded classrooms and con~ crete pads for construction. As the new concrete pads were poured, additional pads right next to those for the vocational training were built. This provided space for the vocational training students to build their project homes December 2006 Corrections Today -63 on one set and for the UCI inmates to build homes for profit on the other. At that point, the two programs were easily combined into one extended program, taking an Inmate from college directly Into the work force. Because participants In both areas were working side\u00ad by-side, they could be housed in the same facility, which made It possible to concentrate security resources. It also made it possible to designate that part of the prison as an honor area, where inmates were granted more privileges. As many who work In corrections know, when inmates have nothing, they have nothing to lose. By housing the inmates together and giving them more privileges, it became a more desirable place to live. It also meant that they would have more to lose if they elected to break the rules. Over time, the inmates have become more Invested in the program and do not want to see anything happen that might jeopardize the privileges associated with It. This has provided added assistance with the security and manage\u00ad ment of the inmates. Instead of fighting and resisting cor\u00ad rectional officers, Inmates are now working with the staff toward a common goal: their success and the success of the program. AJso noteworthy ts that the inmates working for CAP are among the highest paid inmates in the Institution, earning money that can be used for the cost of their education, saved to help with their transition Into the community upon their release, or used to pay restitution or family sup\u00ad port. This Is another incentive to motivate the Inmates to make the program a success. Lessons Learned Here are some guidelines that have proved effective In the apprentice program: House the Inmates together Qike a therapeutic com\u00ad munity). Together, they share a common goal and motivations. Work and feeding times can be coordi\u00ad nated, as well as counts and security concerns. e Make sure the Inmates know and sign all rules unique to them and the penalties for breaking them. This can help prevent Inmate Ignorance or overzealous offi\u00ad cers from sabotaging the program. 64 -December 2006 Corrections Today o Make it a desirable program, one that the inmates will see as valuable to them and their families. If they can see thts as a way to stay out of prison, they also will have the support of their families -another great motivator. Give the inmates involved in the program added priv\u00ad ileges. Keep In mind that if they have nothing, they have nothing to lose. Give them privileges for posi\u00ad tive behavior and consequences for negative behav\u00ad ior (which can include laziness, being argumentative, producing poor product and being late for work). Along with the skills they are learning, bunates must be taught proper work habits and the expectations an employer will have of them. Providing Opportunities for Success Once the homes are built, they leave the secure perime\u00ad ter of the prison and are moved to a predesignated site. A crew of 12 minimum-security inmates prepares the site beforehand, pouring the foundation, providing for the mar\u00ad riage of the home, the home setup and landscaping. When the home is finished, Inspected and ready for sale, the Utah Housing Corp. takes care of the financing and selllng of the house. Inmates In the Salt Lake Community College building program complete an average of four to six homes each year. Last year, UCI inmates built four homes; this year, they expect to fi_nish 10. UCI's goal In the future is to com\u00ad plete 50 homes yearly. However, the main goal of CAP Is, of course, to help Inmates upon their release. As they build homes for UC!, they generate apprentice hours for thelr Journeyman certi\u00ad fication through Salt Lake Community College. Their Instructors and job services staff actively help them find jobs on the outside. In fact, 90 percent of former inmate students are placed in good Jobs. In addition, some go beyond mere employment. \"We have 10 graduates who now own their own construction businesses, and they employ up to 12 Individuals,\" CAP Instructor Jay Miller said. And what about James Evans'/ An active participant in CAP, he says, \"This program saved me from prison.

Drug and Sex OITenses During the last decade, drug offenders were the fastest growing segment of the prison population, with a dramatic increase in the number of inmates with blood borne diseases like Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and AIDS. Some inmates 20 to 30 years old have serious heart and lung damage due to methamphetamine addiction. And sex offenders are expected to receive longer and longer sentences as North Dakota residents become increasingly intolerant of sexually deviant and/or violent behavior. Prison/Hospital Solution Construction of a new Prison/Hospital facility at the James River Correctional Center would allow the transfer, from the North Dakota State Penitentiary, of all inmates with blood borne diseases and inmates with sex offender status, as well as elderly patients that require specialized facilities. This solution would leave a physically and mentally healthy prison population in the North Dakota State Penitentiary. It would be most efficient by concentrating all inmates with se,ious medical problems, as well as the medical resources required to deal with the problems, al James River Co1Teclion Center. No More Studies -Get It Done Prison design consultants should be hired immediately to formulate, design, and construct the new Prison/Hospital at the JRCC. And the first priority should be the security of the medical providers, prison staff, and the surrounding community. Cost should fall under half the $42 million (under one-fourth the $85 million). North Dakota State Penitentiary May Then Be Relocated In The Long Term The Citizens of North Dakota are interested in an optimally efficient corrections system that lowers recidivism. They are NOT interested in more inmate \"creature comforts\". A moratorium on new construction at the NDSP is appropriate due to the rising value of the land it occupies. The NDSP can serve North Dakota well for another 25 to 50 years with minimal renovations over the years. And when the land value is equivalent to its replacement cost at a more remote location, it can be relocated. Use Part of the Savings to Provide Adequate Pay Levels Pay for corrections officers should be raised incrementally until turnover is reduced to the national average for businesses of about 8%. The biggest future problem in the DOCR will be a prison riot unless something is done about officer pay and associated entry level "}
