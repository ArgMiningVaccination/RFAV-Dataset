Statistical Evidences. Abstract We're now almost 2 years in the pandemic. 2021 was marked by the vaccination of billions of people. There was a lot of debate about those COVID vaccines, loved and hated. Everyone had to be vaccinated from kids to elders. Discrimination has been encouraged in order to promote them. Fundamental rights have been suspended (work, freedom of movement). In order to assess the risk versus benefits balance, you have multiple benefits hard to quantify : - Protection versus infection; - Protection versus death; - Herd Immunity protects our community; - Protection versus hospitalization allowing hospital to keep a reasonable number of patients. In the balance : adverse effects ranging from mild to death. The benefits allegedly immensely outweigh the risks. Is it true? We are now 2 years in the pandemic. We have 2 years of data. 2020 without Vaccine and 2021 where vaccine could mitigate the pandemic. There's a scientific and obvious consensus about the benefits for the population aged 70. So I am going to focus this research to younger people where a few scientists had concerns. So, In this paper I'll observe the benefit/risk balance through a statistical analysis of the mortality in Europe on those aged 15-44. Method My hypothesis is that the vaccine is going to provide a certain amount of protection against death to the community (the patient won't die and wont transmit the disease to someone else who won't die) for a few month. At the cost of a risk of dying for a few months (from the product, stress,..?). So we are going to consider the accumulated death count as the dependent variable and will observe its correlation to the number of dispensed vaccines. The more vaccine dispensed : In one hand, a stronger immunity will result in a lower accumulation of death in the following days, week months. In another hand, deaths due to adverse events accumulate as well. So We should observe a negative correlation and be able to calculate the number of life saved by each dose. In order to isolate deaths related to the COVID-19 epidemic, I actually observed the excess of deaths in 2020-2021, compared to 2017-2019. That way I removed from my data all the seasonal mortality that appeared as well in 2017, 2018 and 2019 while keeping COVID related mortality. Results There's a strong correlation between mortality and vaccination (R-squared = 76%). 76% of the excess death is statistically correlated with the number of vaccine dispensed. But to my surprise, it is positive! The more vaccines have been inoculated, the higher the mortality! Sickness and death by the COVID have surely been avoided but they did not make up for the loss due to the vaccine Adverse Events. At a 95% confidence, we can estimate the net result was somewhere between 3.4 and 4.3 deaths for 1 million of dose inoculated in this category. As far as 15-44 years old are concerned, COVID vaccination policies would be responsible for 76% of the excess death, or 1.6% to 2% of Europe mortality in 2021... Limits Those statistics do not take into account long term benefits/risks (we don't have the mortality yet). But it does not look to me the scientific consensus foresees any long term effects, positive or negative. Europe has been inoculating a mix of Moderna, Pfizer, AstraZeneca vaccines. They may have different side effects or efficacy that are not shown. Benefits could have leaked to another age range. Vaccinating 15-44 may harm them while benefitting 70+. So they would not be taken into account. I consider that all doses (1st, 2nd, booster) have the same toxicity, however the analysis of the residues show they likely don't. Conclusion The linear regression suggests that COVID-19 vaccines had a negative effect on the healthy population : 1.6% to 2% of the mortality in the 15-44 years old. Those Vaccines are not likely safe and efficient for the majority of this category. Policies have been rolled out swiftly without enough data about the risk benefit balance. Mandatory vaccination and coercion were and are still not justified. More studies are definitely required to continue the rollout safely. We need to : - Better understand who benefits from them; - Understand their contraindication, Who is dying? Any patterns? - Better identify and quantify benefit to the communities at least if not the individuals. First, do not harm. Also, you would expect benefits to raise with time : At first, knowledge on the risk/benefit is thin, but as data piles up we have the opportunity to adapt policies and it should get better. Here it is the other way around. When you look at the graph (Figure 2): Again what troubles me is that this steep raise from 200 to 1500 excess deaths happened in the last wave of vaccination at Fall. When people were vaccinated under duress. Edit : In order to dig deeper into the model we may want to analyze the deaths that are not explained by the injections (the blue line in Figure 2.), the statistical residues (Figure 3.). We see the same patterns in the mortality due to COVID (Figure 4.), which tends to validate that our model rather explain deaths than life saved. There's two anomalies : - The low residues at fall, when actually death were slightly increasing. It look to coincide with the absence of Inoculations (Figure 5, Week 42-45). Our model consider that patients can die at any time following the inoculation. I think this anomaly might suggest most of the \"incident\" happen in the weeks following the inoculation. - Another region of concern is the residual mortality after week 98, 2021-44, (Figure 3.). Our residues are exploding when deaths due to COVID are going down. Could that be related to the booster rollout? (Figure 5.). That's troubling for the least. We'll see in the next weeks if booster rollout continue to be followed by unprecedented spike of mortality. Will ideally be observable when 4th dose will be rolled out. Annex 1.
