President's spokesman steps down WASHINGTON (UP1)-Larry Speakes, who has clashed and parried with reporters for almost six years as President Ronald Reagan's cblef spokes\u00ad man, announced in the midst of the Iran arms-Contra aid furor Thursday that he will resign Feb. 1. Speakes denied the con\u00ad trover y that ha engulfed the White House and raised ques\u00ad tions about the past two years of the Reagan presidency had prompted him to accept a lucrative ofl'er from the giant Wall Street firm Merrill Lynch &tCo. lOA great opportumty pre\u00ad sented itself and Speakes said in an interview . \"I wanted to be certain the president was comfortable with my decision and my tim\u00ad Ing and he was.\" Talks of a possible staff exo\u00ad dus continued to raee, how\u00ad ever, when Speakes everal hours later announced the res\u00ad ignations of White Hou e drug policy adviser Carlton Turner and White House physician T. Burton Smith. \"THESE ARE THREE unre\u00ad lated resignations,\" said Brashear . \"None of them has anythine to do with one another\" Speakes said the Iran arms uproar, which has confronted the White House with an immen e public relation problem, persuaded him to delay his departure until Feb. 1. \"I wanted to .tay on for a longer period than one nor\u00ad mally would have,\" he said. \"The 60 days will give us an opportunity to talk to the public. 1 am convinced the president has been doing the right thing and I think by the time I leave we'll have put a lot of this behind us.\" Speakes, 47, who served as a lower-level White House spokesman In the Nixon and Ford administrations, will become senior vice president for communications for Mer\u00ad rill Lynch at what is expected to be a hefty six-figure salary.

Although no successor was named, the candidates are thought to include Interior Undersecretary Ann Dorr McLaughlinj Sheila Tate, a former pre s secretary to Nancy Reagan; Brashear; Mar\u00ad lin Fitzwater, press secretary to Vice President George Bush, and Gary Schuster, a former Detroit News and CBS News correspondent now working as a consultant to the White House. In New York, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Wil\u00ad liam Schreyer said, \"We are extremely pleased to have Larry Speake join Merrill.\" Senate subpoenas Iran documents WASHINGTON (UPI) -The Senate Intelligence Commit\u00ad tee expanded its probe of the Iran arms-Contra scandal Thursday by subpoenaing documents nationwide, and the committee chairman called on President Ronald Reagan to reveal everything he knows so the country can \"put this behind it.\" Sen. Dave Durenberger , R-Minn., said committee staff members are \"flying around the country issuing subpoe\u00ad nas\" for documents and said the committee's investigation has expanded becau e of \"the volume and value\" of Informa\u00ad tion it has received. Durenberger said that while former National Security Adviser John Poindexter and his fired deputy, Lt. Col. Oliver North, refused to answer ques-tions before the committee to avoid possible self\u00ad incrimination, \"at the end of everything that they did was another person, in many cases memoranda and other pieces of information.\" DURENBERGER , speaking to reporters outside the hear\u00ad ing room, said the man who could help the committee most was Reagan himself. The said the committee Is faced with finding an answer, \"which I'm afraid the Ameri\u00ad can public assumes he already knows. If he does, it would obviously help ... if he told us about it. \"I think the expectation, as I see it, of the American public is they'd like to know the answers and they can decide on forgiveness after that And I suspect this president Is much more forgivable than a lot of others,\" Durenburger said. Earlier Thursday, Reagan defended the use of Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination by Poindexter and North and said any Cabinet member called to testifY before Con\u00ad gress would have the same right. 00 oard moves toward care facility sale Today By Jam Clhoy to privatizing it, but this Staff Writer county can simply not afford to throwaway the potential pro- The Johnson County Board of fit we would recieve from sell\u00ad Supervisors took the first step ing the facility,\" Myers said.

Des Moines teen inhales fumes, dies Universil WEST DES MOINES , Iowa (UPI) -A high school student collapsed and died Thursday when he inhaled toxic fumes from a photo lab canister stu\u00ad dents routinely sniffed to get high, a witness in the class\u00ad room said. Franklin Sanchez , 16, Des Moines, was killed by fumes from a chemical adhesive in the canister at Valley High School's darkroom , school offi\u00ad cials said. He was transferred from the school to Iowa Methodist Med-ical Center by helicopter at about 10:45 a.m., but died shortly after his arrival at the hospital. Two other students who sniffed the can, James Winters II and Matthew Van Hauen, both 16, were treated and released from Iowa Methodist Medical Center in Des Moines. THE CANISTER, referred to as \"Canned Air,\" is used to blow dust off negatives, photo\u00ad graphers said. It contains a substance similar to freon, which turns into ice when the can is turned upside down. Jerry Bird,18, a student in the class, told United Press Inter\u00ad national it was not unusual for students to sniff the can. He said he saw Sanchez shortly before he collapsed . \"He (Sanchez) went into the darkroom with the canned air, Upped it upside down and sprayed it into his mouth to get high. He started to turn blue and vomited through his nose,\" Bird said. \"It's kind of a joke to take the can and spray it in e __ -------\u00ad other's ears. We've been do that for a long time.

Waking up The next time a cry goes up to \"get the federal government off the backs of the people,\" it might be worthwhile to consider what is being asked for. Less outside interference coupled with more individual freedom? Or a crippled local government trying desp\u00ad erately to meet record-high demands for assistance? Like most things in this world, there are two sides to the story. Six years ago, a god-like President Ronald Reagan ascended the throne, promising to free the common man from the restraints of an overgrown federal bureaucracy. In many ways, Reagan's promised land seemed quite inviting: lower taxes, fewer regula\u00ad tions, local decision-making . But now another side to this paradise is being seen, as the seeds planted in the land of milk and honey are bearing fruit Six years of budget cutting, tax restructuring and court rulings at the federal level have added up to a plague of difficulties for local government. Iowa City Manager Stephen Atkins tells the same story being told by local administrators all over the country. ''We're being weaned from federal money, but we're not being weaned from federal policies,\" he said. What Atkins is talking about is the fact that local governments are losing federal support, but still must carry out federally-mandated regulations. A classic example of this situation is the recent decision by Reagan to veto the $18 million Clean Water Act while requiring state and local governments to meet ever\u00ad stricter purity standards . Further complicating things, says Atkins, are state laws prohibiting local governments from raising taxes bey\u00ad ond certain levels. Obviously, these are problems which only surface years after new pOlicies are implemented. But now that the effects of such policies are becoming known, it's time to recognize the causes. And it's time to demand a restructuring of national priorities to secure funding for things that improve lives: new sewage treatment plants, more low-income housing, low-cost daycare facilities, etc. People can't have it all, but they can have what they need.

In 1976, the U.S. Supreme Court lifted its ban on capital punishment Since then, 67 individuals in 12 states have been sentenced to die in this country. Their deaths have supposedly been humane and quick -electrocu\u00ad tions, firing squads and even lethal injections. But the point is not whether a procedure is humane, it's whether or not any human has the right to pass such grave judgment on another. The answer is no. Unquestionably, crimes committed by those sentenced to die arc often heinous and utterly cruel -rapes, cold-blooded killings and merciless tortures -but taking one human life in reparation for another isn't justice. It's plain vengeance. The throne of judgment is reserved for a being higher than man. In the end, every man, woman and child will be judged according to standards higher than any humans can'set It simply isn't man's place to point a finger and decide who will die for which deeds. It's God's. Obviously, a society without punishment is a society without law. And any society without law is a form of anarchy. Punishments are necessary in life, but willful killing is not The old credo \"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth\" is simply that -old. It's archaic and barbaric. Mahatma Ghandi once said living by that philosophy \"only makes the world blind.\" Unfortunately, the world gets increasingly blind day by day. Christopher G.

From: Lt. Col. Oliver North, U.S.M.C. Re: Arms Shipments AS STATED in our previous correspondence, we are still studying your request for spare parts and defensive weapons . And let me reiterate that we would much prefer that you use whatever influ\u00ad ence you have to secure the release of American hostages in Lebanon rather than, as you put it, \"delivering into our clutches hordes of condemned souls whom we may scourge, oppress and brutalize at lei\u00ad sure.\" Whatever policy goals we have along those lines have been realized through cuts in most social welfare programs . Thanks anyway. As per the request in your most recent communication , I have contacted the appropri\u00ad ate research personnel at the Pentagon to determine whether or not your fears are justified that certain muni\u00ad tions of the types you have requested might be sponta\u00ad neously detonated by expo\u00ad sure to fire and brimstone . Insufficient data is available at this moment to make a determination , but I shall pursue the matter at the ear\u00ad liest possible opportunity, which should be when the appropriate research person\u00ad nel stop brandishing a cross at me whenever I approach them. I REALIZE that the resolu\u00ad tion of this transaction is tak\u00ad ing longer than you would have wished, but I beg your indulgence. This is, of course, a delicate matter, made all the more delicate by the fact that yours is not the only brutal, unpopular regime we are deal\u00ad ing with in this manner. We are presently, through a third party. Involved in an intricate business transaction with the Islamic Republic of Iran, sell\u00ad ing them the same kinds of materiel you have requested, with the profits from that sale going indirectly to aid the Contras in Nicaragua, in prob\u00ad able contraventio n of U.S. law. (By the way, it was heartening to hear that you would approve of any profits from our transaction also going to aid the Nicaraguan freedom fighters. Your comment that you are \"intimately familiar\" with many of the Contras' activities indicates to us the kind of right thinking which should make for a long and mutually beneficial business relationship .) BUT, AS I stated before, I am sure your patience is wear\u00ad ing thin. Therefore, as a ges\u00ad ture of goodwill, I am author\u00ad ized to offer up for eternal damnation the souls of all Campus Young Republicans attending universities in the Big Ten athletic conference . Considering the overall qual\u00ad ity of the merchandise involved, this is, of course, a token gesture. But it is nonetheless a sincere one, and I hope it is taken as such. One last reminder. I would continue to urge you to grant NO interviews concerning our negotiations . This is still a classified matter, and there are many members of this administration at the highest level who are unaware of our contacts and would disap\u00ad prove of them strongly. It could mean my job if this leaked out. And it is, of course, my ultimate ambition to be a true American hero. No one in their right mind would refer to me as one if it was discovered I had been dealjng with the Devil or someone like him. Yours in the cause offreedom. Ollie.

A writing which con\u00ad cludes, \" ... I don't think peo\u00ad ple really care about the death, injustice and racism in South Africa nearly as much as they care about NCAA tro\u00ad phies\" stands on its own mer\u00ad its. Yet Gisleson 's writing calls for a response because it mis\u00ad understands one important issue and ignores another: it wrongly equates a citizen with the political system of her country, and it ignores the character and beliefs of the Guest Opinion player involved. I'll discuss the second of these first since it sheds light on the entire discussion . THE SOUTH AFRICAN player whom Gisleson was referring to -but declined to name -is Michelle Murgat\u00b7 royd. a bright and personable woman I first had the pleasure to know as her Rhetoric instructor last year. Michelle is not only a hard\u00ad working. gifled athlete and good student; she is also generous and warm-hearted, well-liked by her teammates and others who know her. In ... addition , from conversations I've had with her I can say she stands firmly against the pol\u00ad icy of apartheid and yearns for a peaceful transition to a fully democratic and inclusive gov\u00ad ernment in her country. Perhaps the greatest benefit of having international stu\u00ad dents like Michelle is the opportunity we have to learn from them even as they learn from our university , culture and political system. One of the first things I learned from Michelle was about a sort of \"reverse prejudice\" -how certain people judged her as being racist Simply because she was white and South Afri\u00ad can. GISLESON SEEMS TO be making that very judgment when he suggests we should not condone any athletic com-petitions with \"practitioners\" of apartheid and insinuates throughout his writing that Michelle is just such a practi\u00ad tioner. Now I'm backto my first point: Gisleson misunderstands the relationship of an individual to her government. Michelle's dtizenship as a South African does not mean she symbolizes. represents, or endorses the policies of the South African government. On the contrary, while feeling affection for the home of her family and friends (as we all do), Michelle opposes the sys\u00ad tem of apartheid. In other words, she is South African, not \"South Africa.\" JUDGING PEOPLE BY their nationalities only leads to further misunderstanding at a time when the need for .IIrea\u00b7 ter international undersfand\u00ad ing is ripe. I'm sure Gisleson can join me in hoping that when we Ameri\u00ad cans travel to foreign coun\u00ad tries we will not be equated with the policies of the Rea\u00ad gan administration . I plan this summer to go to West Germany where I hope my American citizenship is not identified as a mark of approval for the buildup of nuclear weapons in Western Europe or support for a Star Wars defense system. r hope my West German acquaintances seek to know me as I seek to know them - that they not \"shUn,\" \"banish\" or \"ostracize\" (Gisleson's terms) me because of my nationality. That is the least we can ask of eafh other and of ourselves.

It came just days after Planned Parenthood launched a campaign aimed at television networks with full\u00ad page ads headlined : \"They did it 9,000 times on television last year. How come nobody got pregnant?\" The ad wa admittedly a bit hyperbol ical-9,000 times? Who's counting? Nobody pre\u00ad gnant? Surely an actress or two. But the point was sharp. The tube is steaming with sexuality and freezing out messages about self-control and birth control. The only place that the C-word appears with any regularity is on the evening news.

Grant M. Hili Graduate Assistant Exercise Scienoe Artful gratitude To the Editor: The fall season at Hancher Auditorium has presented unparalleled excitement and energy. This is undoubtedly due to the imagination and courage of the new director, Wallace Chapell. Think about it -Cloud Gate , Mabou Mines, the Knee Plays, Momix and Laura Dean. When did we ever have so many alternatives to dance by 19th century \"European Masters\" (with music by dead Germans and their imitators) and the same, tired, \"legitimate\" thea\u00ad ter? Could it be that the per\u00ad forming arts did survive the 19th century? Robert Wilson's the Knee Plays would seem to affirm that idea. The staging, music and dance were brilliant. I consider myself lucky to have seen it, since its performance in the Midwest was limited to Iowa City and Minneapolis. Thanks so much for bringing 20th century entertainment to Iowa, Chapell. Michael Farley 1133 Holtz Ave. Journalistic advice To the Editor: Joe Levy's column (The Daily Iowan, Dec. 3) on how one should act while being inter\u00ad viewed by a reporter lell out one important sentence, the first one. His column should have started: \"A journalist is a communicator . He or she must make every effort to write what was said and to present the Intent it was said with.\" A journalist 's job is not only to ask open-ended questions . It is to gain understanding of diffe\u00ad rent people's perspectives in order to present all sides of the issue. I doubt, as Levy contends , that President Ronald Reagan will suggest he was misquoted. Misquoting anyone is against the law, and the Washington press is well aware of this fact. The final question is one of perspective . Those intervie\u00ad wees, whether people in the public eye or the person on the street, have a right to fair and accurate reporting as much as the reader does. It is always easier to look at what others can do to improve before examining oneself. Personally, while reporting for the DI, I never had a bad interviewee . But, I can recall times when I was a bad inter\u00ad viewer. Those were times peo\u00ad ple came up to me and said, \"I wa mi quoted.\" Marianna Chernl 1015 Oakcrest Ave NO.3 need To the Editor: The Iowa Petroleum Council\u00ad Dlvislon of the American Pet\u00ad roleum In titute believes that the federal government and the public must be made aware of the serious implica\u00ad tions for the economic well\u00ad being and national security of the nation (concerning ) what is happening to the petroleum Industry. The dramatic decline in exploration activities and the dismantling of the Industry's capability to explore for oil and gas are resulting In rapidly rising dependence on foreign supplies. The potential is great for disruption and shortages, with attendant sharp price rises -and sooner than many expect. Until both the public and the government understand these facts, and develop a sense of urgency in addreSSing them, reasonable and timely olu\u00ad tions will not be forthcoming . Government actions this year which further hamper invest\u00ad ment, including those on tax reform and the Superfund, are ample evidence that the seri\u00ad ousness of the situation is even now not appreciated by Washington. The country cannot walt until a crisis is upon It. Something clearly needs to be done - and soon. Both our industry and the federal government are currently reviewing a wide range of energy policy options. . \" no options '\" should be ruled out. Robert L Schulz Executive Director, Iowa Petroleum Council Others'Views By United Press International The Journal-BulleUn, Providence, R.t The Iran affair presents the Democrats in Congress .. , the unaccustomed benefit of the Reagan admi\u00ad nistration at a tactical disadvantage. But it also harbors hidden risks ... Intimation of scandal can take on a life of their own, and Congress, like the press, has the capacity to lose its sense of proportion . To it credit, the Democratic leadership seems to recognize that a thin line sepa\u00ad rates the search for truth and the instinct for blood. (t remains to be seen whether it can restrain those elements of the party that fail to distinguish between partisan advantage and the national interest. Aner all, more than party politics is at sLake. When America sneezes, the world catches cold. And when the United States is paralyzed by domestic discord - especially in the final quarter of a two-term pres\u00ad idency -the global implications are far more serious than any of the allegations currently under review. Just ask our allies, who have grown accustomed to Reagan and depend on American strength. Detroit Fr Pre .. If ... the president was in charge and knew through what miracle his \"freedom fighters\" were getting funded during the lean years when Congress specifi\u00ad cally banned direct or indirect aid, why doe n't he admit it? As Richard Nixon found out, it is not policy blunders , no matter how grievous, but attempts to hide them from the electorate that damage presidents and the throw the nation into turmoil, To prevent such a turn of events, the administration should move quickly to provide answers to the most obvious questions : Who approved the draft of (former national security adviser John) Poindexter ' ... direc\u00ad tive to sell arms to Iran? What were the reactions of the State Department, Defense Department and the Central Intelligence Agency? If the president was, indeed, not informed about the illegal financing of the Contras, was it because he didn't care to know or because someone failed to inform him? Rocky Mountain New., Denver On Friday, the 131st B-52 bomber equipped to launch cruise missiles flew into Carswell Air Force Base, Texa , ending U.S. compliance with the second Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty. President Ronald Reagan's decision to exceed the pact's limit ... constitutes a risk. It could provoke an escalation of the arms race. Or, paradoxically, it could serve arms control by convincing the Kremlin that it cannot cheat on it agreements with impunity .... Last May. Reagan said he would base his strategic decisions on the threat of actual Soviet forces, not on a treaty that has been \"seriously undermined by Soviet noncompliance .\" Intead of backing down, as Moscow and the arms-control lobby hoped, he has shown resolve and bolstered his credibility by doing as he said. The Miami New.

A state of the art paper shredder can fabricate a whole planeload of band-wiper materiel during the three hours allotted North after he was formally notified that his activities were under investigation and before his omce was sealed. I GENUINELY BELIEVE North was at every step doing what he believed was the \"right\" thing, even if he also knew nearly everytbing he was doing was in clear violation of the law. The various German lieutenants who went on trial for their World War II activi\u00ad ties also were following orders. Poorly balanced comparison? I certainly hope so. The bomb\u00ad ings, burnings and torture of non-political, non-combatant villagers in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala have not yet reached the prop\u00ad ortions of the 1940s Jewish HoloC8!!,St nor tbe 1960s Vietnamese Holocaust. But we're slipping in that direc\u00ad tion everyday. Now we begin to wonder: Will the White House six be so fortunate as to do only 15 days penance in a county jail in return for the megatons of gunpowder they helped dump on the infants and young parents of Central America? WILL THE White House six be subjected to six months of undignified daily trial as were the Tucson Twelve, the church workers who dared to offer food, blankets and baby bot\u00ad tles of milk to the families of Salvadorans who came here seeking the beacon of the Statue of Liberty? Is the U.S. Refugee Act of 1980 (promoted by President Ronald Reagan) not intended for babies of brown skin? As the daily headlines grow in size, let us hope not for politi\u00ad cal vengeance upon the White House six, but rather let us hope and calmly demand that our nation's greatest energies be turned toward repairing some of the damage our elected and appointed rep\u00ad resentatives have been doing to our brothers and sisters in Central America . Hanukkah and Christmas and other high holy days through-out the world are approaching. Our tears and hand wringing are not needed. Our helping hands and spare dollars are needed worldwide .

Pointing out that a general studies degree does not require the sequence of courses that many other degrees require, Kaufmann said the degree is tailor-made for some students. \"It's particularly good for stu\u00ad dents with diverse interests who are academically strong,\" she said. \"Students sometimes use this to combine courses in a way they might not be able to do with a single major.\" TO EARN A general studies degree, a student must accu\u00ad mUlate 124 credit hours, 36 in advanced level courses. Besides restrictions on the number of courses that can be taken in one area, the only other restriction for the degree is that the student must complete the regular general education requirements of the UI College of Liberal Arts. According to the UI Regi\u00ad strar's Office, 163 VI students are candidates to receive a general studies degree after Student farm crisis this semester. \"The student doesn't have one large group of courses that make up a major,\" Kaufmann said. Having a diverse educational background can be useful in getting a job, she added, despite the fact that a general studies major may not look particularly impressive on a resume. \"IT'S UP TO the student to convey to the prospective employer that they are going to be a useful employee,\" Kaufmann said. VI Business and Liberal Arts Placement Office Director Nancy Noth said the merit of the degree in the eyes of pros\u00ad pective employers depends on which courses the student chooses. \"They want someone who has good basic skills,\" she said. Noth estimated that about one-third of the 120 companies that recruited graduates on the UI campus this fall were looking for graduates that had \"any degree,\" including a gen\u00ad eral studies degree. Noth added that companies looking for management trai\u00ad nees or sales representatives often seriously consider gen\u00ad eral studies majors. \"The BGS is a well-rounded degree for that type of job,\" she said. groups will meet By Monica Seigel Staff Writer In an etTort to raise student awareness about the farm cri\u00ad sis, the University Rural Action Network of Iowa will sponsor an \"Education for Action\" Conference Saturday at Iowa State University in Ames, UI Rural Crisis Group member Mary Bruns said Thursday . \"The caucus will allow us to update each other's groups on what's going on at each of our campuses,\" UI Rural Crisis Group member Mary Bruns says of the conference. \"We'll be able to make some strategies as a group.\" be: Dixon Terry, chair of the Iowa Farm Unity Coalition presenting \"The Harkin Bill: Supply Management vs. the Free Market\"; George Naylor of the North American Farm Alliance presenting \"Agribusi\u00ad ness Food Policy in the U.S.\"; Mark Lundgren, ISU sociology professor, presenting \"The Radical Right\"; Dan Levitas of Prairiefire Rural Action Inc. presenting \"Iowa Land Tenure\"; Barb Grabner of the Iowa Farm Unity Coalition presenting \"Lobbying for New Farm Policies\"; and Steve Wandro ofIowa Legal Services presenting \"Farmer/Borrower Rights.\" \"We want to provide some information to students, espe\u00ad cially students from rural areas, before they go home for Christmas break,\" Bruns said. \"That way, when they're home, they will be able to talk to their family and neighbors about the latest developments in the farm crisis.\" the national conference.

Bret Dublinske, an Iowa State University student and president of United Students of Iowa, said the proposed increases, would violate the universities' mission to provide high quality, accessible education. The proposal, which is scheduled to be voted on by the regents Dec. 18, would boost resident student tuitions 12 ent at the UI and Iowa State and 13 percent at the ersity of Northern Iowa next fall. Out-of-state students would pay 20 percent more to attend the three schools. Regents Executive Secretary R. Wayne Richey said most of the $18.6 million raised by the tuition increases would be used to raise faculty salaries at the three universities. Dublinske said 60 to 70 active members of USI from all three schools will be writing letters and phoning regents and legislators pushing for smaller tuition increases. Businesses and high school students in Ames, Iowa City and Cedar Falls also will be asked to join in the lobbying effort, he said. Workers shun raise as 'good gesture' ESTHERVILLE -Union employees of the city of Estherville Thursday turned down the city's offer of a pay raise and agreed to a one-year wage freeze to help the city's beleaguered budget Dennis Lukins, president of Local 79A of United Food and Commercial Workers union which represents 23 of 37 public works employees, said the employees decided to shun the city's offer of a 10 cents an hour raise as a \"good gesture\" toward the community. The union work\u00ad ers will hold a ratification vote Monday. City administrator Steve Woodley said he was surprised when union leaders told him they would accept the freeze. \"It's almost unheard of,\" he said, adding the agreement will save the city up to $11,000 a year. Dole promotes Iowa wortd trade meeting WASHINGTON -Sen. Robert Dole, H-Kan., is urging Soviet officials to support a call by Gov. Terry Branstad for a world trade conference in Cedar Rapids next year. In a letter to Soviet Trade Minister Boris Aristov, Dole said Branstad's idea \"is a good one.\" Dole said the conference can be held anywhere, including the Soviet Union, but said Cedar Rapids is a good \"no nonsense location.\" \"It is a real Midwestern city which would inspire candid conversation,\" Dole wrote. Branstad's plan is for a one-or two\u00b7day conference to be held in Cedar Rapids next summer. lOOT offers parking stickers to veterans AMES -State transportation officials Thursday announced they will issue license plate stickers to handicapped veterans, allowing them to use deSignated handicapped parking spaces, beginning Jan. 1. Applications for the permit stickers are available from driver license stations throughout the state, or from the Department of Transportation's office of Vehicle Registration, Lucas State Office Building, ,Des Moines. Each application must be accompanied by a letter from the handicapped veteran's physician stating whether his or her handicap is temporary or permanent Pine cone lights may create fire hazard DES MOINES -State Fire Marshall Wilbur Johnson Thursday urged Iowans not to use lighted plastic pine cones sold at home parties by Christmas Around the World. The lights' plastic reflectors melt after being lighted, creating a potential fire hazard, Johnson said. The sets, which bear the stock number 54-201, carry the Underwriters Laboratory approval on the lights, but UL did not approve the pine cone-shaped reflectors, he said. Experts foresee attention to farm crisis DES MOINES -Despite Congress's preoccupation with the Iran arms deal, members of the House and Senate will spend most of their time next session dealing with agricultural issues, the American Farm Bureau Federa\u00ad tion's chief lobbyist said Thursday. John Datt, addressing the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation Convention in Des Moines, said he expects the Iran arms issue will occupy Congress dUring the first two months of the new session. But Datt said by March, the lawmakers should be ready to act on other issues. However, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, told the 1,700 IFBF delegates he does not think agriculture issues will be put on the back burner because of the Iran arms controversy. Grassley said although Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who will take over as chairman of the Agriculture Committee, also will playa leading role in the Senate's investigation of the arms deal, Leahy will not neglect agriculture. \"I would expect the current farm bill to be examined, re-examined, praised, damned and about everything said about it possible during the first several months in 1987,\" Datt said. Datt said he also expects Congress to consider several bills to reduce the record U.S. trade deficits this year. : Deere workers hold I 'funera~~ services MOLINE, Ill. (UPI) -About I 700 idled Deere & Co. union workers staged a mock funeral Thursday outside the com\u00ad pany's headquarters to mark the \"death\" of their trust in the company's willingness to settle a 14-week labor dispute. \"Your trust was buried here today' Your team work is a flop our ship is sinking, it's beca it is leaking from the top,\" read one of the many placards idled United Auto Workers waved during orderly rallies in Moline, Milan, 111., and Mount Joy, Iowa. Union members parked a hearse at the entrance to , Deere's administrative center, \\ had pallbearers carry a coffin up the winding driveway and planted a headstone at a mock gravesite that \"HIP team work.\" ,. \"The mutua relationship ... between Deere & Co. and the union has been non-existent the last four months.

Nitze's assessment brought a sharp protest about a lack of administration cooperation with Congress on arms issues. Last week the United States fielded its 13lst B-52 bomber equipped with cruise missiles, putting the country beyond a SUb-limit in the unratified treaty on the number of various types of weapon launchers . The deployment came a month before members of Congress had been led to believe it would be announced . Panel Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., asked Nitze ifthere was \"any chance\" the administration would bring U.S. forces back within treaty limits. \"I think it's small,\" replied Nitze. Egypt discloses foiled coup attempt CAIRO, Egypt -Egypt said Thursday it had foiled a Moslem fundamentalist plot to overthrow the govern\u00ad ment of President Hosni Mubarak and arrested 33 alleged plotters, including four army officers. State Prosecutor Mohammed Aziz Al\u00b7Guindy said testi\u00b7 mony linked the suspects to the outlawed Jihad Organi\u00ad zation, a Mdselm extremist group blamed for the 1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat. He said the 33 men in custody and three others still being sought had illegally formed an extremist religious group and were undergoing military training. Sources said the coup plot was uncovered during an investigation into a series of video-club bombings this year by fundamentalists . The arrests were the first indication that Islamic fundamentalists had infiltrated the army since Sadat was slain. National Guard unit trains in Honduras WASHINGTON -The Reagan administration said Thursday an artillery unit of the Florida National Guard is training in Honduras but will not operate any closer than 30 miles to the Nicaraguan border. White House spokesman Larry Speakes said the troops are on \"a training exercise ... under tropical conditions in a remote area of Honduras .\" Told that Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega had claimed U.S. troops were massing on his border, Speakes said, \"Ortega's Just using this as an excus'e to stir up fear among the Nicaraguan people about a U.S. invasion. He's been doing it for years, and this is only his latest attempt.\" Speakes did not say why Florida National Guard troops needed to go to Honduras to find tropical conditions. Canada assists Soviet army deserters OTTAWA -Five Soviet army deserters given asylum in Canada two weeks ago were flown from Pakistan aboard an unmarked U.S. government jet, a Canadian newspaper . reported Thursday. The Ottawa Citizen, quoting security experts and sources recently in Pakistan, said the United States and Pakistan were involved in the operation . The report said the deserters from Soviet-occupied Afghanistan were turned over to Canadian authorities in Pakistan near its border with Afghanistan, arriving in Canada on Nov. 20. According to the Citizen, an unmarked U.S. aircraft flew the deserters out ofIslamabad on Nov. 19. The Canadian government has refused to detail its involvement in the clandestine operation. Paul Fraser, a spokesman for the External Affairs Department, refused to confirm or deny U.S. involvement in the operation . Student kills teacher, wounds principal LEWISTOWN, Mont. -A 14-year-old boy shot and killed a teacher in a high school classroom Thursday, then opened fire in a hallway, authorities said. The boy fled Fergus County High School and went home, where he surrendered to a police SWAT team that converged on the house, Lewistown Assistant Police Chief Tom Killham said. The youth was charged with deliberate homicide. Killham said the boy entered a classroom, killed substi\u00b7 tute teacher Henrietta Smith, 40, by shooting her in the face with a large-caliber handgun , then shot a vice principal in a hall. On his way out the school's door, he turned and shot at the vice principal again and fired at least two more shots into a group of students. Two students were treated for minor wounds, and vice principal John Moffatt underwent surgery for a stomach wound, Killham said. Quoted ...

See story, page 3A. Immigration drugs WASHINGTON (UPl) -Edu\u00ad cation Secretary William Ben\u00ad nett said Thursday the depart\u00ad ment will spend $15.5 million next year to combat illegal drug use on college campuses. At a luncheon sponsored by the department's Fund for the Improvement of Post Secon\u00ad dary Education, Bennett com\u00ad plained college and university administrators are ignoring or tolerating illegal drug use by students. \"I think there still is insuffi\u00b7 cient attention to the problem on America's campuses,\" Ben\u00ad nett said. \"I fear that this issue, if not addressed by institutions of higher educa\u00b7 tion, will damage higher edu\u00b7 cation severely.\" \"USE OF DRUGS, illegal drugs ... is a violation of the law but second, it's a violation of the ethos of learning. We know that drug use affects learning. And we know that widespread use of drugs tend to be addictive,\" he said. The $15.5 million in govern\u00ad ment money will go to c~mpus programs , training and demon\u00ad stration projects, Bennett said. Regulations for distributing the money will be completed by early next year, and grants will be awarded by late sum\u00ad mer. Bennett said administrators are reluctant to adopt tough drug abuse policies or counsel students with drug problems Freakish accident kills girl SEATTLE (UPI)-A mentally retarded 4-year-old girl was electrocuted by a hospital nurse who, in an \"incredible and unusual\" accident, plugged her heart monitor into a pump connected to a wall outlet, authorities said Thurs\u00ad day. Maria Yvonne Stark died of low-voltage electrocution, the King County medical examin\u00b7 er's office said, adding that the death is viewed as accidental and is under investigation . The nurse had just finished routine tr.eatment and was replacing the intravenous pump and heart monitor when the accident occurred Tues\u00ad day, officials at Children'S Orthopedic Hospital said. The nurse inserted three separate metal prongs -con\u00ad nected by wires to flat, circu\u00ad lar objects taped to the girl's chest -into an outlet on an intravenous pump instead of the heart monitor machine, the officials said. The pump, used to administer liquids or medication, was plugged into a wall socket, and the electricity flowed through the heart monitor lines, elec\u00b7 trocuting the child immedi\u00b7 ately, John Neff, hospital med\u00b7 ical director, said. Hospital spokesman Brien Lautman said the nurse was the o'nlY person in the room at the time of the accident. \"She has voluntarily taken herself off active duty,\" Laut\u00ad man said. \"She worked at the hospital for a year, and was a nurse in very good standing\u00ad she is well respected.\" William aenneH because of the time and energy required . Another problem, he said, is the fear of adopting anti\u00b7drug abuse policies that may be challenged in court. \"I THINK IT'S realistic to expect litigation,\" Bennett said. \"If you're going to have a firm policy on this kind of issue, you're going to run into problems with litigation.\" Bennett said the department has \"a good track record\" for \"being on the side of any school that is making any rea\u00ad sonable effort\" to combat drug abuse. He pledged continued support from both the Educa\u00b7 tion and Justice departments. Soviets, U.S. start trade talks' WASHINGTON (UPI) -U.S. and Soviet officials met Thursday in a closed session aimed at finding ways to expand non-strategic trade between the two nations. The U.S.-U.S.S.R Joint Com\u00ad mercial Commission, co\u00ad chaired by Commerce Sec\u00ad retary and Soviet Foreign Trade Minis\u00ad ter Qoris Aristov, was to meet in a daylong session Thursday and again today, Commerce Department spokesman John Thomas said. The commission was formed in 1972 under President Richard Nixon to explore ways of expanding bilateral trade, but did not meet between 1978 and 1985 because of friction following the Soviet invasion of Afgha\u00b7 nistan. THE MEETINGS resumed last year in Moscow. The group's mission is \"to identifY and take practical steps to support expansion of non\u00b7strategic trade,\" Thomas said. This year, a principle task will be to discuss opportuni \u00ad ties surrounding recent changes in Soviet trade reg\u00ad ulations including new provi\u00ad sions for joint commercial ventures between American and Soviet firms, he said. U.S. exports to the Soviet Union came to $2.4 billion in 1985, compared with Soviet imports to this country of $440 million, he said. WINTER B ...... Ja ... Tanning Specials 8 .. $1.350 12, ..

Pa~10A -The Daily Iowan -Iowa City, Iowa -Friday, December 5,1986 National FBI head delays retirement Ex-aide confirms arms deal WASHINGTON (UPI) -FBI Director William Webster has put off his plans to retire because his agency is deeply involved in the highly sensi\u00ad tive Iran-Contra investigation, Justice Department officials said Thursday . The officials said Webster, who has led the bureau since he was appointed by President Carter in 1978, had planned to leave soon for personal rea\u00ad sons but now believes its lead\u00ad ership should not be changed during the ongoing criminal investigation . The FBI is taking the lead in the probe, officials said, inter\u00ad viewing the key players in the scandal involving the transfer of up to $30 million from Iran arms sales to the Contras fight\u00ad ing the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. AND ALTHOUGH Attorney General Edwin Meese has asked a special court panel to appoint an independent counsel in the highly volatile case, officials said it was likely the FBI would continue its role in the investigation. Last week, the Justice Depart\u00ad ment asked the White House, State Department, Defense William Webster Department, and the CIA and the super-secret National Sec\u00ad urity Agency to retain \"any and all information\" relating to the Iran arms transfers and Nicaragua funding. The department also targeted seven individuals in the probe, including Lt. Col. Oliver North, the National Security Council statTer fired for his part in the scandal; his boss, John Poindexter, who resigned; and former NSC chief Robert McFarlane. Con\u00ad tra leader Adolfo Calero also was named, and another top NSC aide Paul Thompson , retired U.S. Gen. Richard Sec\u00ad ord and a deceased aide to McFarlane, Don Fortier. THE FBI NOW IS examining all information provided by the agenices, officials said. In a related development ,Jus\u00ad tice Department officials said Oliver Revell, an executive assistant director of the FBI who normally would oversee the internal inquiry, removed himself from the investigation because of his ties to the National Security Council. ReveifiiadServed as a consul\u00ad tant to the NSC and was a member of an anti-terrorism panel that included North. Officials said Floyd Clark, the head of the FBI's criminal investigations division, was now heading up the probe. An FBI spokesman declined to comment on Revell's deci\u00ad sion and said only that Web-\u00b7 ster has set no firm date to leave the agency. His 10-year term expires in February 1988. Any successor to Webster would be subject to Senate confirmation . WASHINGTON (UPI) - Between $500 million and $1 billion in weaponry was sent to Iran by the United States and Israel in a series of secret shipments this year, a former top Carter admi\u00ad nistration official estimated Thursday . Gary Sick, President Jimmy Carter's top National Sec\u00ad urity Council aide on Iran during the Iran hostage cri\u00ad sis, also said he \"can't believe\" Lt. Col. Oliver North, who held a top NSC post until his dismissal last week, kept to himself details of the diversion of profits from the sales of weapons. \"That just strikes me as too good a story to keep to your\u00ad self,\" Sick said. \"What a bril\u00ad liant coup ... in effect get\u00ad ting the ayatollah to subsid\u00ad ize the Contra operations .\" Committee not likely to give North, Poindexter immunity Between May and November this year, Sick estimated, 5,500 tons of military equip\u00ad ment was delivered to Iran from either Israel or the United States. Sick noted the $12 million figure given by the admi\u00ad nistration as the value of the weapons taken from U.S. stockpiles is conveniently within the $14 million worth that would have been required by law to be reported to Congress. WASHINGTON (UPI) -The Senate Intelligence Commit\u00ad tee, faced with unwilling wit\u00ad nesses in an investigation of the Iran-Contra scandal, likely will not even consider seeking immunity for key figures in the probe until a special prosecu\u00ad tor is named in the case. However, if the committee decides to ask for immunity for Lt. Col. Oliver North and Vice Adm. John Poindexter, who refused to testify before the committee this week, the panel is required under fed\u00ad eral law to satisfy a series of strict requirements, legal experts said. The matter would be further complicated by the appoint\u00ad ment of a special prosecutor, which is expected. North, a National Security Council official fired Nov. 25, was described by Attorney General Edwin Meese as the only person with \"precise\" knowledge of the diversion to Nicaraguan rebels of up to $30 million in profits from U.S. arms sales to Iran. WHEN HE WAS called before the Senate committee on Monday, he reportedly invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate him\u00ad self. Poindexter , who resigned as President Ronald Reagan's national security adviser the same day North was fired, followed suit Wednesday . Members of the intelligence panel have suggested that granting immunity from prose\u00ad cution to figures like Poindex\u00ad ter and North may be the only way to guarantee that their stories will be heard. Once assured he will not be prose\u00ad cuted as a result of his testi\u00ad mony, a witness can no longer invoke the Fifth Amendment and can face contempt of Con\u00ad gress charges for refusing to answer questions. Under the federal immunity law, the Senate committee, with a two-thirds vote, must apply to the federal court in Carlucci: Accessibility to president is assured WASHINGTON (UPI)-Presi\u00ad dent Ronald Reagan's new national security adviser, Frank Carlucci, said Thursday he will have direct access to the Oval Office to present both, his own advice and staff options on conducting foreign policy. Carlucci appeared before reporters at the White House, declaring, \"I will be visible\" to the press and public, unlike his predecessor, Adm. John Poindexter, the career Navy man who resigned Nov. 25 after Reagan learned he had some knowledge about the diversion of Iranian arms pay\u00ad ments to Nicaraguan rebels. Carlucci, a former deputy director of the CIA and deputy defense secretary, said his aim was to \"bring a good quality control mechanism to the decision-making process\" that apparently went awry during the tenure of his two pre\u00ad decesssors, Poindexter and Robert McFarlane. HE CUT AN IMPOSING fig\u00ad ure in his brief press confer\u00ad ence, wearing a gray pin\u00ad striped suit and loud paisley tie, and declaring: \"I am fully satisfied with my charter.\" \"I will have direct access to the president and on substan\u00ad tive matters I will report directly to him,\" Carlucci said after a five-minute meeting with Reagan in the president's Oval Office. White House chief of statT . Donald Regan, who apparently was bypassed in the selection process of Reagan's fifth . national security adviser, had accompanied Poindexter in most of his meetings with the president but has denied any knowledge of the diversion of Iranian money to the Contras. ; \"I do intend to share my views with the public,\" Carlucci .ald. \"I will be seen. I am not. I I'll confess to you, a highly visible person, but I will make myself available (to reporters) on appropriate occasions .\" He said he has already spoken with congressional leaders. \"THEY TELL ME I am a known quantity and they are certainly glad to work with me,\" he said. He said his method of opera\u00ad tion would be to formulate foreign policy options for the president, make sure the decision -making process works properly within \"the apptopriate statutes and checks and balances\" and to \"give full and frank advice to the preSident.\" Asked if he would act merely as an \"honest broker\" of a variety of opinions among foreign policy and intelligence experts or would offer his own views, Carlucci said, \"I don't think I would hide my views under a bushel.\" Carlucci had nothing but praise for other administra\u00ad tion officials reported to have opposed his selection. \"I like and admire\" Regan, he said, and plans to keep Regan informed. Secretary of State George Shultz, he said, first hired him to work at the Office of Management and Budget in 1970 and \"1 have the utmost admiration for him.\" HE SAID HE SEES his immediate task as \"organizing for the future\" and has already assigned 10 staff mem\u00ad bers to look into National Security Council operations. Carlucci refused to comment on a Washington Post report that as deputy CIA director in the Carter administration he supervised a failed covert operation to harass Marxist South Yemen and stop any advances against its pro\u00ad Western neighbor, North Y:emen. Washington for a grant of immunity to any witness. BEFORE MAKING THAT request, however, the attorney general -or in this case, the speCial prosecutor -must be notified by the committee and given the opportunity to try to dissuade the committee from taking the action. If that fails, the special prose\u00ad cutor can ask the court to defer action for 20 days to give the prosecutor time to come up with proof to prosecute the witness later. Because of those complica\u00ad tions, legal experts say it is unlikely the Senate committee would go forward with such moves until an independent counsel, as a special prosecu\u00ad tor is formally known, is named. Meese announced Tuesday he would ask a special panel of three federal judges to appoint such a prosecutor to investigate the dealings under the Ethics in Government Act.

Also, high school diplomas would say where a graduate studied, giving universities the ability to select students from preferred schools. CRITICS SAY THE bill is elitist and would give the edge in jobs to students with degrees from more prestigious schools. No one was reported arrested during the demonstration, the largest of a two-week series organized by leftist factions to pressure the government to cancel planned changes in education policy. Students also took to the streets in other major cities in France, including 20,000 in Marseille.

TAIPEI, Taiwan (UP1) -Tai\u00ad l wan's 11.8 million voters will have their first opportunity in 37 years Saturday to cast bal- lots for an opposition party - a fragile coalition that has alarmed both Taipei and Pek\u00ad , ing with its veiled support for national independence. 4 ,Political scientists, citing unprecedented public inter\u00ad est, said more than 65 percent of the island's voters could ~ show up at the polls. Taiwan has been under mar\u00ad tial law since 1949, when , Nationalist Gen. Chiang Kai- shek and some 2 million sup- porters fled to the island fol\u00ad f lowing the communist takeover of mainland China. ~ The Nationalist mainlanders -14 percent of the island's population of 20 million - have retained tight political control and still claim to be the sole legitimate govern\u00ad ment of all China. BUT THE DEMOCRATIC Progressive Party, a 2-month-old opposition group that draws most of its support from native Taiwanese, has openly called for \"self\u00ad determination\" - a euphem\u00ad ism for independence -Caus\u00ad ing alarm on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. In Peking, the Chinese Fore\u00ad ign Ministry warned that the communist government is firmly opposed to any theory or acts that advocate the inde\u00ad pendence of Taiwan or self\u00ad determination. ,Convictions doled out , 1 in Grenada coup trials 'ST.GEORGE'S,Grenada(UPI) THE PROSECUTION said 10 ) -Fourteen people were con-defendants were members of a , victed of murder Thursday government central committee lind sentenced to hang for that issued orders to kill killing Prime Minister Maur- Bishop and his followers.

The sixth-rated Hawkeyes, coming off a four game win\u00ad ning streak, will be going for their fourth Classic champlon\u00ad ! ship. They lost to Arkansas State in the first round of last year's Classic, 66-62. Iowa (4-0) plays Delaware in I the first game Friday night, followed by Washington State (2-1) vs. Loyola-Marymount (2-0). The first-round losers will then play Saturday night, , with the championship game following that. Even though Iowa is favored to win the tournament hands down, Hawkeye Coach Tom Davis said it will not be as easy as it looks. \"WE SHOULD GO into Fri\u00ad \\ day healthy, and hopefully we'll be in good condition,\" Davis said. \"They (Delaware) are a good running, aggressive j ball club. We expect an attack with an aggressive fast break.\" Delaware returns four starters from last year's team, which finished 11-16, but only won ~O\\lT out of 14 contests in the East Coast Conference. The Blue Hens have defeated , Glassboro, 73-59, and Washing\u00ad ton Colleg,e, 91-73, this season. If the Hawkeyes are able to I get past their first-round oppo\u00ad nents, the competition will get I a little tougher. \"I know enough of the other two teams to know that who\u00ad ever comes out of that bracket is going to be a good, competi\u00ad tive team,\" Davis said. LAST YEAR Loyola- Marymount finished 19-11, tak\u00ad ing second in the West Coast Athleti: Conference, and received its first-ever bid to the National Invitational Amana-Hawkeye Classic Iowa Hawkeyes vs. Delaware G Carver\u00b7Hawkey.

The team is aver\u00ad aging 106 points per game this year after defeating Azusa Pacific and Susquehanna . \"Loyola was in the NIT last year, and while they lost a couple of good players, they have a lot of good players back,\" Davis said. \"They have a couple of good players that I think could make them a con\u00ad tender for the Amana\u00ad Hawkeye Classic title.\" Washington State finished in a tie for fifth in the Pacific Ten last year, with a conference record of 8-10 and an overall record of 15-16. They return three starters. \"WASHINGTON STATE is 2-1,\" Davis said. \"They lost to Idaho, which is one of their rivals. They beat Gonzaga, another rival, and they beat a good Montana team. They're very talented. \" \"You're going to see some good size on the Washington State team and probably bet\u00ad ter talent then Loyola or Dela\u00ad ware has,\" Davis said. After winning the Great Alaska Shootout, the Hawk\u00ad eyes defeated Division II Missouri-St. Louis Wednesday night. If they want to win the Amana-Hawkeye Classic, the Hawkeyes may need to regain their intensity. \"It's very important to get our second championship under our belts,\" Iowa forward Brad Lohaus said. \"We have to come out with intensity. It's within our grasp, but we can't be as flat as we were (Wednesday ).\" Trivia Teaser Section B The Dally Iowan Friday, December 5, 1986 Brad LohauI, left, \"rambles 'or a ball In an atttempt to gain control of a rebound agalnlt Miliouri-St lOWanIOoug Smith Loul. Wednesday night Lohsu. four gamel thll leason. Forward Lohaus has taken' bumpy road to improvement By Julie Deardorff Staff Writer It's no wonder Iowa's Brad Lohaus was accident prone as a child. With size 17 feet and the majority of his body com\u00ad pri ed of knees and elbows, the -Glendale, Ariz., native was bound to run into a few prob\u00ad lems. \"I started playing ball in fifth grade,\" Lohaus, the Hawkeyes ' 7-foot forward, recalled. \"I played at the junior high on a backboard on an old volley\u00ad ball standard, and 1 kept spraining my ankle because I went in on my layups and landed on the tire (at the bottom of the pole).\" It was Lohaus's motorcycle, however, that can almost be credited for starting his basketball career. \"I was tak\u00ad ing some library books down to the bookmobile (a moving library) and I hit a trench and wiped out,\" Lohaus said laugh\u00ad ing. \"I skinned up every part of my body. My next door neighbors were moving and they had a backboard so I traded in my motorcycle for it.\" The rest is history. DESPITE ADMITTEDLY never learning to dribble due to a gravel driveway, Lohau went on to become an all\u00ad American in high school and was recruited by almost 250 schools. lie played in 20 games his freshman year and won the Most Improved Player Award as well as the Coaches Appre\u00b7 ciation Award. The following season he had a 6.8 average scoring 191 points and scored a season-high 17 points against Wi con in. He was also named Iowa's Most Improved Player for the sec\u00ad ond season in a row.

Page 38 :Wrestlers escape with 18-17 win over Lehigh By TIm Warner Special to The Daily Iowan BETHLEHEM, Pa. -The Lehigh Engineers took four of the first six matches but were unable to hold on in their bid I to upset No.1 ranked Iowa as they bowed 18-17 at Stabler Arena Thursday night. Though happy and relieved with the win Iowa Coach Dan Gable expressed the fact that the Hawkeyes have a great deal to improve upon. \"A lot of our first teamers Wrestling were not here tonight,\" Gable said as Iowa competed without No.1 ranked 177-pounder Rico Chiapparelli as well as two other all-Americans . Chiap\u00ad parelli is out of action with a rib injury. THE MEET WAS decided by a classic battle of the titans as Iowa entered the heavyweight match-Up leading by a single point. Iowa's Brooks Simpson wrestled Steve Vetsch to a 2-2 draw, giving the Hawkeyes the 18-17 victory. Iowa's Steve Martin earned a 5-3 decision over Rick Hart\u00ad man in a tight U8-pound match to give the Hawkeyes the early lead. The Engineers stormed right back taking the next three decisions giving them a 9-3 overall lead. At 126 pounds Lehigh's John Epperly defeated Steve Knight 8-2. Joe Herrmann used a late second-period flurry to better Iowa's C.T. Campbell 12-7 at 134 pounds. The 142-pound showdown between No. 1 ranked Pete Yozzo of Lehigh and No. 2 ranked Greg Randall was the highlight of the evening. Yazzo used a quick 5-0 first period start which included a near\u00ad faU to defeat Randall and give the Engineers the edge, 9-3. Iowa'sJim Heffernan , No.1 in dom\u00ad inated Lehigh's Jim Frick throughout the match to earn a 13-5 decision. THE ENGINEERS were able to keep Iowa on the ropes as 158-pounder Tom Toggas, ranked seventh nationally, won a tough 2-1 decision over John Heffernan on 1 minute, 47 seconds riding time. This helped Lehigh to hang on With a 12-9 lead. The Hawkeyes, with the help of Royce Alger's pin of Mike Ekberg at 167 pounds, took the lead 13-12. It looked at thi point as though Iowa would pull away, but Lehigh's Eyvind Boyesen was equal to the challenge as he defeated Eric Duus, 7-4, giving the Engineers a two\u00ad point lead entering the final two matches of the night. At 190 pounds Iowa's Charlie Sherertz got the decision, 9-4, over Derek Brophy, normally a 177-pounder for Lehigh.

The victory stopped a two\u00b7 game losing streak for Coach Vivian Stringer's team after losses to No.3 Tennessee and Nebraska . \"I can't tell you how important winning this game was for us,\" Stringer said. \"We were look\u00ad ing for the burning desire to win, and I think this team has that.\" Price had lO first-half points to the Hawkeyes to a 38-dvantage . She hit on seven of eight shots for the game and grabbed five rebounds. Lisa Long and Michelle Edwards each had 10 points for the Hawkeyes, now 2\u00b72.

A layup by Drake's Mary Otten cut. the Iowa lead down to 13 with just over 5:20 remaining . Price drilled two free throws with 2:14 left as Iowa held off the Bulldogs' final charge. \"Drake can be a very good first step to living up to our own, not others' expectations,\" Stringer said following the victory. Drake's Missy Slockett led all scorers with 20 points. She was followed by teammate Otten with 14. Price said she had something to prove with her performance against Drake. \"I have had a lot of talks with teammates and coaches about my shooting,\" the 5-foot-9 for- I Iowa 71 Drake 57 Drak.

The strategy is not novel, but if it works it will be.

I think we've helped send him to the Pro Bowl,\" Washington linebacker Neal Olkewicz said. \"He's a very good back, he's deceptively strong and he's got great accel\u00ad eration.

Cows have calves, and they have stretch marks like women.\" In the last meeting between the teams, on Oct. 27, the Giants beat the Redskins 27-20 with Morris gaining 181 yards and scoring twice. \"IthinkJoe Morris has been a problem because we've helped him be a problem -we've put the guy in good situations,\" Redskins defensive end Dex\u00ad ter Manley said. \"The first Monday night game he had 181 yards, and it was due to our inability to tackle and get to the point of attack and make the play.\" THE GIANTS AND Redskins have clinched at least the home field in the NFC wild\u00ad card game, but they want more.

Rawlings recently was named the official uniform and pro\u00ad , tective equipment supplier to major league baseball -the first company to earn that special recognition.

The Vikings, 10-0-1, play Con\u00ad cordia College of Moorhead, Minn., Saturday in a semifinal game of the NCAA Division III playoffs. An Augustana victory before the home field crowd Saturday would put the Vik\u00ad ings in their fifth consecutive Division III championship game with the chance to win their fourth consecutive national title. Both streaks would set national records for any level. Augustana also has a 48-game unbeaten streak dating back to the 1982 championship game the Vikings lost to West Geor\u00ad gia. That is 15 games behind the longest in history, 63, set by Washington from 1907 to 1917. WITH ALL OF THAT history behind them, it would be only human for the players to be looking ahead to their annual trip to the Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl game. But Coach Bob Reade says his players know better than to disregard an opponent. \"If you start looking past someone, you'll be watching them on TV\" Reade said. \"We are as far as we are because we haven't looked past any\u00b7 body.\" The Vikings started the sea\u00ad son by pointing to the nation's best-ever winning streak of 47 games set by Oklahoma from 1953 to 1957. An opening week 0-0 tie to Elmhurst College ruined those plans, but Reade said the surprising outcome of that game had neither positive nor negative effects on the team. \"It really wasn't a detriment ,\" he said. \"All it did was take away our chance to break the Oklahoma record, and maybe it told all of us that if you don't prepare properly each week things can happen to you that you don't expect.\" But a tie is better than a loss, and it kept Augustana's unbeaten streak alive. There are several seniors on the Augustana team that have never lost a college football game, including senior defen\u00ad sive tackle Lynn Thomsen of Normal, III., who has started every game the Vikings have played since his freshman year. AUGUSTANA IS A running team. It has attempted only 69 passes in 11 games. The Vik\u00ad ings rush for 286 yards per contest and have had 12 diffe\u00ad rent players score touchdowns on running plays. Johnson will remain coach of Hurricanes MIAMI (UPI) -Jimmy John\u00ad son, the football coach of No.1 Miami, has ended speculation he will take another job by saying he will remain with the Hurricanes. Speaking on his weekly radio show Wednesday night, John\u00ad son -reportedly among the candidates for coaching jobs at Texas and Southern Califor\u00ad nia -said, \"J'm staying.\" Johnson's name came up in connection with the Texas job because he is a native of Texas and played in the Southwest Conference while an all-SWC guard for Arkansas. Inquiries last year from Southern Cali\u00ad fornia and Pittsburgh prompted Miami to extend Johnson's contract through the 1990 season. \"I want the recruits to know I will be here, and that every\u00ad thing else has been only rumors,\" Johnson told a local television station. \"We want to be here. If Texas, Southern California or anybody else calls, I'll tell them thanks but no thanks.\" EARLIER THIS WEEK, Johnson refused to comment on the reports other than to say he was concentrating on recruiting and Miami's Jan. 2 24 Imported BPerl Ion Fiesta Bowl with No.2 Penn State. Miami Athletic Director Sam Jankovich met with Johnson as speculation spread. NBC reported Sunday that Johnson would leave the Hurricanes after this season, but Johnson said he was not contacted by another school. \"We're ecstatic that he's come out publicly and said this is where he wants to be and where he wants to coach,\" Jankovich said Rob Schulz -TYCOON I:C. 223 East Washington Friday & Saturday $250 .

Gordon Staff Writer IT'S THE AGE of Aquar\u00ad ius as well as the age of high tech, and it was only a matter of time before art began harmonizing the Aquarian's grand vision of nature with the infinitesimally small world of the microchip. \"I'm always pursuing some\u00ad thing relevant to our day and age, and we're in the computer age,\" said Sandra VanderMey , VI graduate student in the Art Department and recent win\u00ad ner of two major international competitions. \"I want to exploit the common materials we're living with now. People pay attention to how they func\u00ad tion, but they're beautiful, too.\" VANDERMEY 'S WORK was among 80 works selected by the Smithsonian Institute for exhibition in its Looking at Earth show and among six to be featured in November's Smithsonian magazine. Look\u00ad ing at Earth will consist of artists' interpretations of aer\u00ad ial views of our planet. VanderMey also had all three of her entries selected by the Artist's Society International competition, judged by some of the most respected museum and gallery curators in the country. VanderMey's sculpture and jewelry look high tech because it is high tech. Her materials include large wafers of compu\u00ad ter chips, titanium and nio\u00ad bium colored by electrically controlled oxidation, and laser compact discs -the same CDs the rest of us would probably listen to rather than look at. VanderMeycredits her initial inspiration to a UI computer science professor who showed her a wafer of microchips . \"I said, 'That is so gorgeous,l want to make jewelry out of it.' He thought I was crazy.\" \"HER CONCEPTS ARE highly imaginative ,\" said UI Metalsmithing and Jewelry Professor Chunghi Choo, who encouraged VanderMey to explore materials further_ \"Her originality has been rapidly recognized in the art world.\" Some materials are hard to come by, computer chip waf\u00ad ers, especially. VanderMey called several computer com\u00ad panies asking them for chips, but they were concerned about unpatented information contained in the chips. Van\u00ad derMey finally called the pres\u00ad ident of Hewlett-Packard, and gave him photographs of her work as well as an original brooch. He sent her the waf\u00ad ers. ALONG WITH HER other accomplishments, VanderMey has had a series of wall pieces commissioned by UI Hospi\u00ad tals. They are visions of the Earth in each of the four seasons, reminiscent of the famous Apollo moon landing photographs of the planet. All four are circular. Within the circles are the rainbows of CDs, the silvered oranges and plums of oxidized metal, the structured complexities of \"GONE WITH THEWIlVJT Dally 2:15; 8:00 The Dally Iowan/Carlos M. computer chips -all shaped by clear and tinted plexiglass. Her works for the Smithsonian and the Artist's Society Inter\u00ad national competitions are similar. VanderMey, married to a UI doctorate student in creative writing and is a mother of two, has been working on her mas\u00ad ter's degree here for eight years. But only recently has she begun work with these unusual materials. \"My work before this was very organic. I thnk the nature of the medium had a lot to do with how the work looked. As soon as I started working with high tech material everything got more geometric,\" she said. \"Although she's using high tech material, the images come from nature,\" Choo said. \"Her work is very visible because of the excitement and freshness of the colors.\" VanderMey's work in jewelry, which is along the lines of the larger sculpture , can be seen and purchased along with other UI artists' jewelry at the Holiday Sale in the UI Art Building from 12 to 4 p.m. tomorrow and Sunday. Brass bash a 'blast despit~ classical disappointments By B. Gordon Staff Writer BRASS IS a metaphorical metal, often meaning showy or high-ranking.; and the members of the Canadian Brass, who performed \"A Canadian Brass Christmas\" Wednesday night at Hancher Auditorium, live up to every inch of the brightness of their name. But sometimes brass connotes superficiality, looking like gold without actually being that precious element. And although the Canadian Brass is one of the most respected names in the classical music world, Wednesday night's performan,ce leaned heavily on the playful, if not superficial, side of things. The ensemble is world famous for its tran\u00ad scriptions and interpretations of baroque and Renaissance music for brass quintet. The group is renowned for its musical acumen, but it is also one of the most popular ensembles in the chamber music world. MUCH OF THIS popularity is due to the fun the players have onstage, liberally mixing vaudevillian comedy routines with explana\u00ad tions about the music they play. \"We all had the opportunity to study the music of the Elizabethan period in great detail,\" Charles Daellenbach, the tuba player, told the audi\u00ad ence Wednesday night. \"Unfortunately, none City Dental Care General DenllstJy Bradrord Stiles, D.D_S.

Wednesday night's program feature the Brass's traditional fare, but seemed like counterpoint to the very large proportion of New Orleans-style jazz the group played during the evening. Perhaps they thought a program of baroque music was less appropriate to Christmas than the more festive jazz. THERE IS CERTAINLY nothing wrong with this music, even if it is not especially Christ\u00b7 masy. But the Cl;lnadian Brass players, for all their extraordinary musicianship, are not jazzmen. They could only pay tribute to the true practitioners of the art of jazz, so it was disappointing to hear such true practitioners of their own art spend an evening as affection\u00b7 ate admirers. Another disappointment was the Brass's ver\u00b7 sion of Vivaldi's famous The Four Seasons, the group's latest album. Although the transcrip. tion is excellent and fabulously difficult, and although the musicians played with usual virt)losity, there is Simply no duplicating the effects the composer actlievlesN with a section of strings by playing a horn.
