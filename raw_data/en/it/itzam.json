The magazine has thrived under Wendy Bautista's diligent oversight, and we owe her our most sincere thanks. She's atough act to follow. Speaking of changes, about a year ago my back decided to play host to a pair of unwanted guests named \"stress\" and \"anxiety.\" As they made themselves at home inmy shoulder blades and neck, they producedaches and tension. I tried to cope with a combi-nation of stretching exercises and aspirin. For a while, I was able to hold discomfort at bay, but eventually I found myself in the office ofBruce Sambursky, DC, who practices in Jack-sonville, Fla. It was my first visit to a chiropractorand I was a bit nervous. Sambursky found a few misalignments, and after we discussed the matter I opted to try acourse of treatment. Over the past six weeks, I've discovered many improvements in my health and sense ofwell-being and plan to continue getting adjustments on aperiodic basis. In this issue we have several different perspectives on the subject of general wellness and corporate wellness programsyou can enact in your practice. The ability to attract andcultivate patients who seek sustained wellness is a specialand important part of chiropractic. Adding wellness clients could be a small adjustment to your practice that pays large dividends, as you'll learn in thepages that follow. By the way, earlier I mentioned that I wasnervous about my first chiropractic visit. Well, getting anadjustment is now something I look forward to all week.Even a small change can lead to profound results.

It is true that many patients can be benefitted bychiropractic care who arenot yet seeing a chiropractor.However, this new referralpattern also brings signifi-cant responsibility. An MDor DO has to have confi-dence that you are going togive not just great care butwill also be able to diagnoseimportant conditions andknow when not to treat. Are you ready to make a diagnosis of cervical stenosiswith myelopathy? Can youidentify the differencebetween lumbar neurogenicclaudication and peripheralneuropathy? Taking the mantle of spine expert means youneed to increase your database. To be the expert spinereferral source for allopathicphysicians takes extraknowledge and good diag-nostic skills. These skills can be acquired with the informa-tion given to you by yourchiropractic school andsome additional education,but it takes increased effortto gain the appropriateexpertise. You must be able to read and understand MRIs andX-rays \u2014 not just forsubluxations but for degen-erative spondylolysthesisand instability. Do you see a missing pedicle on X-ray and, if so,what is the next step intreatment? Do you knowwhat long tract signs on thephysical examination meanand where to look for thispotential disorder? What isthe natural history of apatient with a herniated discand radiculopathy? Chiropractors will make an excellent first stop forspinal disorders but need tostep up their game to takeon this mantle.

Patients are often frustrated by a perceived lack of congruency between the care from their MD and theirchiropractor. Even in different para-digms, the top priority should be tohelp the patient, which is why it is soimportant to reach out to the medicalcommunity and inform them aboutwhat you do and how you can partnerto help their patients. The 4 keys to MD referrals The following are the four keys toimproving intra-professionalrelationships.1. Consistency: Building relationships is not just a one-time deal. Like any rela-tionship, consistency needs to bedeveloped over time. 2. Communication: When communicat- ing with the medical field, use theirlanguage to communicate what you aredoing (or at least define chiropracticlanguage in their terms). When youjust use chiropractic language, otherdoctors are less receptive to it. Forexample: You can say something like, \"Upon exam, Joe Smith was foundto have a spinal restriction causingnerve interference 'subluxation' at C2.\" 3. Building trust: Always follow through. In other words, say whatyou mean and mean what you say.If you tell someone you are going tosend them an update, then send theman update! When you have consistency in your actions over a period of time, thisbuilds trust. The MD simply wants to make sure the patient is going to be looked afterby the referred chiropractor. 4. Results: This is where you give updates on re-evaluations. When youconsistently send improved results toan MD, they will feel more comfort-able referring patients to you. Also ask the patients to thank the MD for referring them to your office,as this is great positive feedback.Improve your professional relationships How to work with the medical community without sacrificing principles BY DON MACDONALD, DC24 C H I R O P R A C T I C E C O N O M I C S J A N U A R Y 2 0 , 2 0 1 1 W W W. C H I R O E C O . C O MCLINICAL CONCERNS A proven strategy Several years ago, an optometrist found great success with the four keys toimproving intra-professional relation-ships mentioned above. It started whenhe began wondering about how togenerate more referrals from MDs. He decided to start asking every new patient who visited his practicewho his or her MD was and then hewould write a brief summary of whathe did in his initial exam and whatthe outcomes were. He would thenfax a copy to the MDs as a courtesyfor their files. He did this consistently for the first two years of his practice but didn't getmuch feedback initially. He eventuallynoticed, however, that he was receiv-ing increasingly more referrals fromlocal MDs. This experience taught him that the keys to creating good relationships areconsistency, communication, trust,and results. Having a great relationship with the medical community does not meanyou have to practice in their paradigm.It just means you should keep opencommunication with the patients' bestinterest in mind. When doctors start to see the results their patients are getting, they willbecome more likely to make referrals. As with everything, some MDs aren't open to a vitalistic paradigm, but don'tlet those experiences taint your effortsto reach out to them. This symbioticrelationship can truly benefit patientsand enhance their quality of life.

C H I R O E C O . C O MCLINICALCONCERNS The battle against breast cancer Chiropractors have a unique opportunity to educate female patients on the advantages of natural healthcare BY GALEN O. BALLARD, PHD CANCER IS POISED TO SURPASS CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AS THELEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE U.S.AND BREAST CANCER IS AT THE FORE - FRONT OF THIS INCREASE .It is the most common form of cancer among women. The U.S. has one of the highest breast cancer rates in the world. Each year, 191,000 women will be diagnosedwith breast cancer and 40,800 will dieof the disease. 1One out of eight women will be diagnosed with breastcancer in her lifetime. HRT and breast cancer There has been abundant evidence thatpharmaceutical estrogens and prog-estins were linked to reproductivecancers, such as breast and uterine, formore than three decades. 2 The American Cancer Society (ACS) found a close relationship betweenhormone replacement therapy (HRT)and cancer in 1975. That study wasgenerally ignored.Women have been unwitting partici- pants in a grand drug experiment bythe medical and pharmaceutical cartel.While this has been known for sometime, it was the outcome of the famousWomen's Health Initiative clinical trialsin late 2002 that made the dangers ofHRT impossible to ignore. The HRT portion of the study was ended three years early because ofunacceptable increases in the rate ofbreast cancer as well as heart diseaseand stroke among the women taking acombination of estrogen plusprogestin daily. 3 We now know that HRT has a possible 120 combined risks and side-effects. Estrogen and progestins arecarcinogenic substances implicatedin breast,ovarian,anduterinecancer. 3 Background on HRT How did allopathic medicine and thepharmaceutical industry get 16 millionwomen to take synthetic chemicalsthat transformed a normal life cycleinto a female disorder? It began with a book published in 1966, titledFeminineForever by Robert A. Wilson, who theorized thatmenopause and its symptoms are adisease of estrogen-deficiency. Thedrug industry set up the Wilson Foun-dation for the sole purpose of develop-ing and promoting estrogen drugs. The industry employed ghostwriters to prepare medical journal articles onclinical studies, some of which empha-sized the benefits of estrogen-progestintherapy while downplaying the harm. Promoters or protectors? Following the Women's Health Initiativeclinical trials, women began searchingfor natural alternatives to HRT. The pharmaceutical industry, fearful of losing a \"cash cow,\" raised the ques-tion:\"Ifsyntheticestrogensarepotential promotersofbreastcancer,aren't'natural'alternatives,suchasphytoestro-28 C H I R O P R A C T I C E C O N O M I C S J A N U A R Y 2 0 , 2 0 1 1 W W W. C H I R O E C O . C O Mgens,potentialpromotersofbreast canceraswell?\" This is a valid question because the majority of breast cancers are estrogenreceptor positive and depend on estro-gen for growth. In studies conducted to determine the answer, it was discovered that the supplyof estrogens in breast tissue is derivedfrom androgens. androgens to estrogensand the majority of breast carcinomasexpressthisenzyme. These studies suggest that early expo- sure to relatively high concentrations ofphytoestrogens may have a protective effect on breast cancer because they blockcancer-causing androgen conversion. Phytoestrogens are widely distributed in various plants and herbs and arestructurally similar to mammalianestrogens and can thus bind weakly toestrogen receptors. 5As such, they exhibit a protective effect against breastcancer by inhibiting the aromataseenzyme from converting androgens toestrogens in breast tissue. 6 Phytoestrogens can therefore help to stabilize estrogen levels and relievesymptoms caused by hormone-relatedailments. They are a viable alternative toHRT because they don't alter the body'sown levels of circulating hormones. 7 Earlier studies confirmed that while there was abundant evidence linkingpharmaceutical estrogens to cancer, theincidence of breast cancer is very low inJapan, where traditional diets are highin phytoestrogens. 8Research among Finnish and Japanese populations hasfound that phytoestrogens may protect against breast cancer. 9 Xenoestrogens and breast cancer A natural hormone functions by attach-ing to cell receptors designed specifi-cally for that hormone. Once connected, they trigger various chemical changes in the body. Naturalestrogen (estradiol) and natural phytoe-strogens tend to be disassembled rela-tively quickly by the body and are theneliminated from the bloodstream. Xenoestrogens are chemicals that function like estrogen but wreak havocon a woman's hormonal system bytaking up a receptor site and preventinga natural hormone from binding, thusblocking its normal function.

Virtually every chiroprac- tor today when asked, \"Whatsystem is your primaryfocus?\" will answer, \"Thenervous system!\" They will,then, because of traditionwithin the chiropracticeducation system, go on totalk about vertebralsubluxation. They will describe how this creates \"nerve rootcompression,\" which in turncreates abnormal neurologi-cal function. Research hasnever been able to provethis theory and furtheroffers no explanation forchiropractic techniques thatdo not move vertebra yetshow great results. A profession lost between what it believesand what it says. A profes-sion lost between what itcan do and what it will getpaid for by the insurancecompanies. Perception ordeception is the questionand on whose part?A new direction Now that there's an under-standing of where theprofession is today, and laterin this paper, how themisdirection happened aswell as the cost to chiroprac-tic, the potential to redirectand develop a way out ofthis restrictive and disem-powering position will bediscussed. What is fascinating is that the road back to a brightfuture for chiropractic doesnot involve a complete newstructure. All it takes isrecognizing the \"intent\" ofchiropractic care. It is reallythat simple! The profession has the foundation in place, and 99percent of practitionersalready understand the\"intent\" of chiropractic \u2014the primary focus of its careis thenervoussystem. This simple statement is the keythat will unlock your future. The research today in the field of neuroscience contin-ues to demonstrate theimportance of understand-ing the role of the nervoussystem in the relationshipbetween health and disease. Modern science has moved away from the \"germtheory\" and toward\"psychoneuroimmunology\"and \"immunoendocrinol-ogy\" when looking for thecause of such as the \"thala-mic neuron theory\" and\"dysponesis.\" 1,2 If you can demonstrate the ability of the chiroprac-tic adjustment to alter theneurological response, youcan then defend your posi-tion and role in the field ofhealth and wellness. Thegood news is that researchhas already been done toprove the adjustment doesin fact directly affect theimmune response and hasthe ability to alter its neuro-logical patterns. 3 No longer do you have to use outdated dialog whenexplaining why chiropracticgets results; dialog such as,\"Your spine is misalignedand it is putting pressure onthe nerve!\" The dialog today should be \"The reason you arehaving challenges\" (such asback pain, asthma,headaches, chronic fatiguesyndrome, high blood pres-sure, ulcers, IBS, etc), \"isbecause the stressors in yourlife (physical, emotional,chemical, electromagnetic),over time, have createdpatterns of neurologicalactivity that are now chal-lenging your health. 4 Your nervous system has become overwhelmed and issending signals to yourbody's systems that are nownot working ideally.\" WhatNeurologically based chiropractic Science is redefining the relationship between the adjustment, the nervoussystem, and health.

C O MRESEARCH RESuLTS we need now is to understand the neurological connection. The neurological connection The primary failing in the historicaltheory of chiropractic was the inabilityto explain how the vertebral misalign-ment (VS) happened in the first place.The theory of VS begged the questionof \"If the body is a self-maintainingand self-correcting mechanism 'how'and 'why' would it create VS and/ornot be able to correct it?\" When you add the unexplained positive results from techniques, thatdo not use manual vertebral thrusting,it becomes obvious that there must besomething other than correcting verte-bral misalignments involved. The body is a sensory-to-motor response neural network. With the adageof one of the chiropractic chants of\"above down-inside out\" (ADIO), whatwas sadly missed was the first part of theaction, that being, \"outside in-inside up. \" In other words, the sensory informa- tion side was completely missed. Thiswas a critical mistake, because it couldhave explained the power of the adjust-ment to alter people's lives. The study of the three main systems of the body offers a picture on theirrelationship. 5 1. The passive system \u2014 bones and joints \u2014 does nothing on its own; itprovides the potential for movement,measured via X-ray and posture studies. 2. The active system \u2014 the muscles \u2014 creates movement in the joints andall other body activities \u2014 respiration,cardio vascular, elimination etc. \u2014measured by sEMG ROM. 3. The control system \u2014 the nerv- ous system \u2014 is the central organizingauthority; measured by EEG and auto-nomic nervous system responses. The historical definitions have the profession believing it is neurologicallybased but its focus and dialog is on thepassive system that cannot do anythingon its own. Any response at the passivelevel is actually a tertiary reaction. The work done in the EEG studies on the effect of the adjustment to alterbrain wave patterns demonstrated theinfluence of the adjustment to stimu-late the sensory system. 6,7 EEG scans are very reproducible and are a reliable method of demonstratingthe effectiveness of a therapy to affectchange in the CNS. The results weredramatic and have great impact on theunderstanding of the role of the chiro-practic adjustment in altering systemfunction. Even with this breakthroughresearch, the profession continues tocling to its own concepts. The effect of the EEG adjustment studies in redefining the profession The new knowledge of the power of the adjustment to alter brain function 36 C H I R O P R A C T I C E C O N O M I C S J A N U A R Y 2 0 , 2 0 1 1 W W W. C H I R O E C O . C O MRESEARCH RESuLTS creates a need for new definitions within the profession. It is importantthat when using the new definitionsfor the profession, it be recognized thatthe new position doesn't discard thebasic principles but offers a moderninterpretation that stands up to currentneuroscience knowledge. As the intent of care is to focus on the neurological function, the followingdefinitions support this position. Indealing with the complete neurologicalresponse (from afferent to efferent) youmust include the sensory system role. To do this best, start with under- standing how the chiropractic adjust-ment is a feedback system. Feedback isa process whereby the results of anaction serve continually to modifyfurther action. As the term subluxation when used within chiropractic suggests a fixedmal-position of a vertebral jointsurface (not the medical definition),and while this may exist, the relation-ship between this condition and nerveroot interference has never beenproven. Add the unexplained effective-ness of light touch techniques and it isclear that the time has come to rede-fine the term. 8 Updated model of subluxation The first step here to understand is theideal neurological state of neural integrity ; this creates general health and wellbeing, \"a resource for daily living,\"and includes: is an abnormal neurologicalpattern or compromised neural integrity(CNI). As the adjustment (discussedlater) is not the act of correcting amisalignment but rather a neurologicalresponse, this definition brings chiro-practic into the 21st century. It is a verypowerful neurofeedback application. RICHARD BARWELL , DC, has more than 30 years of experience in chiropractic practice and is thefounder and president ofChiropractic Equity Offices Inc.

Did you ever notice that somechiropractic/wellness centers seem tobe so well known that they are asked toparticipate in everything in town? You'll find that what makes them more successful than other practices areusually things you can do, too, even inwhat some say is a \"changing economy.\" It's really all about servingand serv- icingyour patients. It happens when every team member works together tocreate a patient pleasing practice. These can be easy things, such as acknowledging patients for simplybeing your patients, making sure to say\"thank you\" for referrals, and having afun and interesting office. Make sureyour practice is consistently educatingpeople in the community about healthand wellness through chiropractic. Many simple things that make patients feel special can be done on adaily basis. For example: Remembering birth- days, acknowledging births and specialoccasions, calling former patients whohave been missing and seeing howthey are, are all ways to make patientsfeel well cared for and special. Is your office known for its top- notch services? Do you make it easyfor patients to become patients? Areyou up to date with modern equip-ment and technology? These are waysto differentiate your practice fromothers in town. Are patients able to take advantage of multiple services when they come toyour office? You want to be known asanexperton certain health and wellness issues. What about your team? Are they knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful,and do they love chiropractic? Haveyour team regularly discuss the thingsthat make your practice unique. Andmake sure they are excited and show-ing excellent energy at all times. There are numerous ways that professionalism shows. What are otherssaying about your chiropractic/wellnesscenter? You should want your practiceto be the best stop of the day, every dayfor your patients. Believe it or not, thisis what attracts new patients to yourpractice and it keeps your currentpatients coming back. The following are some actions steps and how you can implement them inorder to make 2011 your best year everfor recruiting new patients. Some ofthese steps may seem simple or trivial,but the most successful practices dothe simplest of things and are always seeking out new ways to attract newpatients into their offices. These action steps should be thought out, planned well in advance,and evaluated afterward. 1. Speak on health, wellness, and safety topics to local schools, businesses,and organizations. Call principals, safetydirectors, and human resource directorsand ask to speak to their employees ona specific topic or issue. (This is part ofyour \"community outreach program,\" sothere should be no charge.) 2. Join your local Chamber, Toast- masters, Rotary Club, BNI, and othernetworking organizations to meet newpeople and spread the word onchiropractic. Many of these organizations will allow you to attend at least once forfree so you can decide whether or notto join. These organizations also allowyou to address their members. 3. Offer in-house presentations healthy children,\" \"backsafety,\" will fromthese specific presentations and invitethem to bring a coworker or friend.Educate everyone.

C H I R O E C O . C MANY PRACTICE ISSUES FROM BOTH SIDES OF THEFENCE , a deep appreciation of the problems, pitfalls, and unique needs of chiropractic clinics has emerged. It has also helped to know how and when a practice can benefit from theinput of an outside \"expert. \" Do youknow whether or not you need toengage a consultant? And if you do, doyou know how to make the most of hisor her contributions? Do you need a consultant? It's easy to answer this question whenit's obvious a practice is on the skids. Atthat point, a doctor's choices presentthemselves in stark detail: Get the housein order or get a desk job somewhere. It is much more difficult when the problems exist below the surface. Theycan be ignored or put off \u2014 butusually with long-term negative effects. Chiropractors normally leave school with a solid scientific education, agood attitude, and a commitment tohealing. What they rarely acquire istraining in how to develop andconduct a practice. This shortcoming can manifest itself in one or more problems, chief amongthem are ineffective coding and docu-mentation that leads to paymentdelays, denials, audits, and reimburse-ment demands; deficient patient acqui-sition and retention practices thatimpede growth and profitability; poorbusiness practices that result in ineffi-cient office operations, ragged billing,and collection practices; and rockystaff and patient relations. This is where a consultant can show real value. Quest for assistance By their very nature, chiropractic clin-ics tend to be small, with one or twodoctors and a small support staff.When they're busy, there's little timefor reflection, and when they're not,they have only each other to talk to. The answer for many is to engage a consultant, then another, and another.In fact, some doctors have retained ahalf-dozen or more consultants over a30-year career, never really finding theanswers they were seeking. One reason is that doctors often do not know how to identify the prob-lem(s) they are trying to solve so theydon't know the questions to ask. Some seek answers through cookie- cutter solutions, delivered remotely oroften via seminars, that force thedoctor and his/her clinic into anuncomfortable one-size-fits-all mold. This may work for some, for a while, but the long-term result oftenis continuing insecurity and dissatis-faction \u2014 the sense that they are notdoing as well as they should. They tryto emulate their mentors and continuecomparing themselves to otherdoctors' operations (many of whommay also be in the comparison game). This will ultimately lead to the doctor returning to the systems andvocabulary he or she is comfortablewith, making the effort to changepointless. And there is always self-study, but, here again, the answers often tend tocome before the necessary self-exami-nation has taken place and so they areAdding to the mix How to make the most of a consultant's contributions BY BHARON HOAGMARKETINGMATTERS 42 C H I RO P R ACT I C ECO N O M I C S J A N U A R Y 2 0 , 2 0 1 1 W W W.C H I RO ECO.CO M44 CHIROPRACTIC A N U A R Y 2 0 , 2 0 1 1 WWW.CHIROECO.COM In the relatively short history of chiropractic,September 2007 shouldgo down as a significant milestone. /trianglertIn 1895, D.D.

Leadingthewayforward As with most significant initiatives, onefigure is usually instrumental in driv-ing the issue. In this case, that some-one is LewisBazakos, DC. Bazakos is a 6-foot-2-inch chiro- practor from New York. He was a highschool football linebacker, defensiveend, and an All Star first baseman. Heobtained his undergraduate degreefrom St. Johns University in New York,his DC from New York ChiropracticCollege in 1978, and a master's degreein clinical nutrition from the Univer-sity of Bridgeport in Connecticut. In 2005, he became chairman of the board of the ACA, serving a two-year term. \"Chiropractic has been known as a profession that circles the wagons andshoots in,\" he says. \"I have always beenabout wanting to change that. I havealways felt we have more in commonthan what we disagree about. And weowe it to our patients to strengthenand grow our profession.\" One of his first acts as chairman of the ACA was to conduct a survey todetermine the major issues facingchiropractors in their practice. \"Wewerenotsurprisedtofindthat manydocsarefinanciallyhurting,oftenbecauseofproblemswithdocumenta-tionrequiredbyMedicareandinsur-ancecompanies,\"saysBazakos.\"Also,docshadlowlevelsofself-esteem,wantedtoimprovetheprofession'simage,andfeltthatthelackofaunifiedapproachbythevariousfactionsofourprofessionareresponsibletoadegreeforthecurrentstateoftheprofession.\" Obstaclesandopportunities DavidO'Bryon, JD, executive director of the ACC, attended the first Summitmeeting in 2007. All representativesfrom 13 chiropractic organizationsagreed that the survey reflected themost significant issues confrontingchiropractic and chiropractors, he says.To effectively deal with these issues,the leadership base of the Summitneeded to be broadened. \"The main obstacle for the Summit in the beginning was to overcomepersonal agendas and focus on speak-ing out with one voice for the profes-sion,\" says O'Bryon. To that end, a Steering Committee was established to include ACA, ICA,COCSA, and ACC. A 75-percent voteis required by the Steering Commit-tee for motions to be approved.Approval of proposals by the overallSummit membership requires a two-thirds majority. \"A month following our first Summit meeting, the SteeringCommittee began to determine the keyissues we needed to concentrate onand who else to invite to be partici-pants,\" says Bazakos. \"But not manyinvitations needed to be extended.Once the Steering Committee wasestablished, other leaders of the profes-sion began calling us.\" Today,theSummitincludesmore than40majororganizationswithintheprofession,includingkeyassociations,regulatorybodies,educators,researchers,majorvendors,andmedia,includingChiropractic Economics magazine. ofChiropractic (WFC), former WFCPresident Clum, and myself, thecurrent president of the WFC, havebeen involved from the first Summitmeeting,\" says J.MichaelFlynn, DC. \"Bringing an international perspectiveto the challenges and what has beenaccomplished across the globe has Photographs courtesy of John C.

DOORNICK, DC WHAT DOES THE WORLD NEED NOW AND WHERE DO YOUFIT IN ?For many years, humanitarian work throughout the world has been synonymous withmassive organizations includingDoctors Without Borders, the UnitedNations, and the Red Cross. In a world that's been confronted by so many catastrophic events, thedemand for reactive help has gonethrough the roof. You are used to hearing of tragedies such as tsunamis, hurricanes, earth-quakes, and floods. The fact is that youlive in a world that \"corrects\" itselffrom time to time and leaves a wake oftragedy and suffering behind. As aresult, these \"allopathic\" and \"reactive\"focused organizations have beenembraced and the world has becomedependant on them. Just like the human body, there is a critical mass or tipping point reachedwhere self-correction takes place. Weeither take care of our bodies and ourplanet or they start to make decisionsfor us. There is a major shift and correction happening right now, both in health-care and the planet. More diseases andmore planetary problems than ever arebeing \"treated\" in a reactive way. Nosolution to the cause is being addressedwith the vigor that is given to the solu-tion to the symptom. People know what truly needs to be done in both scenarios; yet why is itsuch a struggle? Why not bandtogether and save the planet? Why notjoin together and completely model to aproactive approach? Wouldn't thismake a difference? This is where chiropractic humanitar- ian efforts fit in. Two of the biggest chal-lenges the profession faces today is yourperceived value and the question ofwhether or not you are the right personfor the job of saving the world througheducation and results-driven care. The basic principles of chiropractic state that by restoring tone and properfunction of the body, it will do what itis intended to do: flourish. Isn't thatwhat is needed on this planet? You have a calling to serve and your philosophy can be a catalyst to createchange. Change that will providepeople with more opportunities tothrive with proper health as intended. So how can you allow both the world and the profession to bring thistruth to life? Welcome to the world ofchiropractic mission trips. Bethechange A typical volunteer for a chiropracticmission trip is a doctor who realizeshe or she is part of the problem andnot coming close to making thechange. Many have spent their time and money on building a practice full ofpeople. Their life goals may servepeople who somewhat understandchiropractic, but nothing is changingin the world. What drives service is the growing awareness that there is a world outthere that doesn't have the opportuni-ties for health as the U.S. does. When this feeling is strong enough, there is no choice but to act on it. Dr. Martin Luther King called this the \"fierce urgency of now. \" When youfind your true calling, connect it with astrong purpose, and take massiveaction, mountains will move.

Have you askedwhat they expect? And haveyou shared your expectations ofthem with them? In the case of expectations, the secret to communication isseeing through the illusion thatit's actually taken place.

C O MPRACTICE CENTRAL on employee healthcare (and the amount it could save). Curtin credits the Standard Process corporate wellness program withimproving both employee recruitmentand retention. About 50 percent of theworkers have been with the businessfor eight years or more. And one study, conducted by the Harvard University School of PublicHealth, shows that for every dollarspent on wellness, medical expendi-tures drop by $3.27 and costs associ-ated with absenteeism drop by $2.73. \"Companies are going to want to know that they're spending money theright way, \" Rallis says. \"How are theygoing to demonstrate success?\" Breaking into the business Dr. Timothy Gay, who heads UltimatePractice, a chiropractic consulting firm,notes that more and more chiroprac-tors are coming to him with questionsabout how to expand their businessesinto corporate wellness. \"W e see such a huge need from the standpoint of employees who arefrequently either sick or out of theoffice, \" Gay says. \"Doctors are becom-ing more aware of the potential ofbeing involved in corporate wellness. \" Gay typically advises clients to build a relationship with a corporation byoffering a free presentation foremployees. A brown-bag lunch seminar for warehouse employees about injuryprevention, for instance, can benefitthe chiropractor in two ways: First, itallows an opportunity to impress thecompany with instruction on how tolift, bend, and reach effectively, andsecond, it exposes the practice to agroup of potential clients \u2014 employ-ees who physically exert themselveson the job. The next step, of course, is to buildon the success of the initial programoffering, perhaps by suggesting moreextensive programs with workbooksand fees for participation. \"If the corporation comes back and says, 'W ow, you guys did a great jobwith that, ' we might start with a pilotprogram and see how one departmentresponds, \" Gay says. \" And if theyrespond well and we begin to see achange in behavior, we can starttalking about working with the wholecompany. \" Selling the right product Introducing services through at-workseminars can be an effective way towork around what Dane Donohue, athird-generation DC, describes as astigma against the profession. \"If you go out and ask 100 people on the street, 'Do you need a chiro-practor?' maybe 95 of them will sayno, \" Donohue says. \"But if you ask 68 C H I R O P R A C T I C E C O N O M I C S JANUARY 20, 2011 W W W.

The publicdoesn't necessarily perceive chiroprac-tic's role in wellness yet, but they needto understand that we are functionalwellness specialists. \" Another potential customer for a chiropractor-developed wellnessprogram, Donohue adds, is a companythat sells healthcare coverage to corpo-rations. Selling a healthcare provideron a contracted wellness programmeans that company can offer moreservices to its customers. Customize for customers Corporate wellness programs can takeany number of forms, from free nutri-tion seminars to full-scale fitnessprograms, complete with personaltrainers and chiropractors employedby the company. And chiropractorscan mold a wellness program to fittheir expertise.Rallis says companies reach out to him for a number of needs, fromhealth assessments for their executivesto comprehensive programs for allemployees, to health screenings fordiabetes and cholesterol; pain manage-ment for comp injuries; orstress management and smokingcessation programs. For Donohue, offering corporate seminars on such topics as stressmanagement or overall wellness opensthe door to inviting potential clients tohis practice, which is a full-servicewellness clinic that includes a gym andchiropractic and acupuncture facilities. Securing success For Rallis, gaining a foothold in thecorporate wellness arena led to greatexposure. \"Once you land a company,it's instant success, \" he says. \"Welanded one, and he referred his twofriends, who then became clients. Wehad three happen back to back, andwent from having a personal trainerdoing some aspects of personal train-ing to billing $16,000 worth ofpersonal training for one company. \"From a big-picture perspective, there's a public health need for chiro-practors' work in corporations on alarge-scale level, \" Rallis says. \"It doestake courage and a fundamental shiftin how you see yourself \u2014 as eitherjust delivering an adjustment, or beinga vitalistic chiropractor who has thebig-picture view. \" AMY isa writerandeditorbasedinSt. Times andwasmost Amongotherfeature-writinghonors, herworkwasrecognizedintheanthologyBest American Sports Writing 2010.

How do you increase the number of wellness patients you see? Create awellness program based on the chiro-practic model of checking and adjust-ing the wellness of patients weekly.This will help you run your practicesmoothly and bring extra money intoyour office. This model does not increase your overhead with additional expenses; itfocuses on providing your chiropracticadjustments to wellness patients for alifetime. Research has shown thatpeople 65 years of age and older underregular chiropractic care spend 31percent less than the national averageon healthcare. 1 Takestepsnow Whether you are just starting out inpractice or have been in practice foryears, a model like this can work.Step1.Write out a mission statement that will inspire you to fill your prac-tice with wellness patients. Some wanta low-stress, high-patient-visit practicethat makes you move faster andincreases your intensity. Do you thrive on the abounding enthusiasm at your practice and gohome energized at the end of yourday? Push yourself to fill each hourwith more patients than you think youcan or have ever served. Do this regu-larly and see how efficient you can be. Step2.Enlist your CAs so that they want wellness patients filling the prac-tice as well. Your CAs have morecontact with your patients. If they areexcited about wellness patients, yourpatients will know it. Step3.Start announcing this program to your patients with all its benefits.Post it on Facebook and other socialnetworking media. This will help buildexcitement and create buzz. Step4.Calculate your overhead percentage of total monthly expensesfrom your bank account statement. Donot include paychecks, taxes, drawamounts, health insurance, or autoinsurance amounts. Define your clean,clear monthly practice overhead. Step5.Take the past three months of practice overhead and find an averageoverhead per month. Next, take thepast three months of office visits andaverage these three months. Divide your total average monthly overhead by your average office visitsper month. This defines your overheadper office visit. This is critical to know;never create a wellness financial struc-ture that goes below this. Step6.Define your individual patient plan and fee for your patients to paymonthly. The first family membermust pay around double what theoverhead is per visit. For example: If the overhead is $12 per visit, then a wellness personshould have a monthly wellness feethat provides for $24 per visit forapproximately four visits per monthin this model.Wellnesspatients\u2014letthemin Cover your monthly overhead with patients who visit your practice on a steady basis BY DEAN DEPICE, DC, AND JEN DEPICE, DC72 C H I R O P R A C T I C E C O N O M I C S JANUARY 20, 2011 W W W .

Step 7 .If a wellness patient utilizes more than five office visits per month,they are assessed an additional officevisit fee. Step 8.If a wellness patient is injured and needs acute care, he or she shouldbe taken off the wellness program untilfully recovered. Step 9.Similar profiles need to be exer- cised for the second and third familymemberswithsmallincreasesinsavings. Caution:Do not use another practice's wellness amounts. Define your ownspecific amounts that cover your prac-tice's overhead while providing the bestchiropractic wellness care. Step 10.Write out your policies to earn participation in your wellness program. For example: A patient must be a regular patient for at least three yearsbefore being invited as a wellnesspatient. Avoid inviting patients into the program early or because you want togive them a financial break. They willnot appreciate the wellness programand may cause problems by expectingmore from you at less cost. Step 11.Consider setting a target number of wellness patients and familiesthat will cover your monthly overhead. Imagine the low stress you would feel going into your new patientreports if you knew your overhead wasalready covered for the month.Step 12.Share your wellness patient goal number with your CAs. Track thenumber of families and individuals onyour chiropractic wellness programmonthly. Step 13.Create a celebration to gradu- ate patients to this honor and privilegeof being a wellness patient. Considerthe benefits you can offer specificallyto these patients to save them time inyour office. For example: Make your chiropractic wellness program special.Make these patients feel your apprecia-tion for their decision and never takethem for granted. Caution:Do re-exams regularly. Give them thorough reports with clearobjective goals. Make sure they attendspinal workshops and share theirchiropractic story regularly to benefitother patients. The number of people seeking \"wellness\" is growing exponentially.These patients have paid for and valuetheir chiropractic care. Continue togive them what they want and whatyou are uniquely suited to provide. Chiropractic is the core component to any wellness model. What you teachabout human physiology may be moreimportant than even the adjustment. Fill your practice with chiropractic wellness patients and enjoy them.

Thistakes time away from busi-ness development andpatient care. As a chiropractor, you can get caught in a paradoxbecause as patient volumeincreases you must delegatetasks due to lack of time.However, taking the time tofind the right people takesaway from building thepractice. The following are three reasons why you need tofind the proper individualsfor your practice. 1.Delegation. As the practice grows, you are best suited tofocus on business develop-ment and patient volume,which assists in overall prof-its and productivity. 2.Vitalresources. Finding the proper resources enablesthose with the proper skillsto focus on critical issues.Billing and coding are leftfor those with the propertraining. 3.Freedom. You need to operate a sustainable prac-tice so you have more free-dom for family, fun, and thefuture. The reason so many chiropractors struggle withthese issues is because theyare not certain where orhow to begin. Propertechniques It is imperative to under-stand that the task is notjust to find a body and placeit into a position. Hiring is astrategic process thatrequires proper planningand time. Hiring, if done right, can lead to a better workingculture, better office morale,increased patient exuber-ance, and less employeeturnover.

Consider the following: Networking. The best candi- dates will come from thoseyou know and those youtrust. It is beneficial to constantly network not onlyfor business developmentpurposes but also for talent.During networking func-tions, seek out individualsadaptable to your practice'sculture. In addition, your clientsare an important resource.Ask your clients if there isinterest or if they know ofothers who are interested inworking in a dynamicenvironment. Save time and money by seeking out others whounderstand your value s. Takingtime. Unless there is a stockpile of paperwork,there is no need to rush. Taking the time to invest in hiring will save you timeand money in the future. Neversettle. Unless the practice has grown tremen-dously overnight, there islittle reason to choose justany candidate. Currently, theeconomy and the value ofmoney enable you to takethe time necessary to makethe best possible decision. Hiring is not always an enjoyable process, but it is avital portion of your practice.The first thing a patienthears or sees is the enthusi-asm of your employeesassisting with an appoint-ment, follow-up visit, orother activities. Taking the time to find the right person helps tobuild a sustainable practicewhile increasing patientvolume and brand. By using the right stuff to findthe right person, you willenjoy less stress, more free-dom, and more financialsuccess.

BY TODD SINGLETON, DC THE FINDINGS ARE CLEAR .Even though the treatment is the same, patients who have a good diet and exercise regularly heal faster,while patients who have a poor diet,consisting of eating inflammatoryfoods and/or smoking, have a hardertime healing. You can congratulate those patients with a good diet and who exercise, andexhort patients who smoke and/orhave a poor diet to change their waysso they can heal. This, however, doesn'talways work. Most \"pain\" patients won 't actually go home and change their diet, eventhough it would help them get out ofpain faster. Newapproach Fortunately, there's a different way topackage nutritional advice that willmake it easier for patients to take, andit can transform your practice. Even though patients come to you for your expertise, they come withcertain expectations of what they thinkyou should do for them. It doesn'tmatter that you're the doctor; mostpatients already know what they want. For example: Patients going to an MD expect to receive a prescription.Patients going to a DC expect toreceive an adjustment. And, patientsgoing to a weight-loss doctor expect tobe told to change their diet. If patients heal faster when they are given a healthy, noninflammatory diet,and if patients who want to loseweight are expecting you to changetheir diet, why not offer weight-lossprograms to them? If you've been practicing chiropractic without changing your patients' diets,you may be amazed at the improvedresults your patients will experienceonce you get them to change theireating habits. Remember, however, tobe careful how you package it. For example: If a patient comes to you for spinal decompression and youtell her she needs to change her diet inorder to have the best results, you'llprobably be met with resistance. But, if your report of findings for the same patient explains that weightloss is part of the spinal decompressionprogram, she will be anxious to hearwhat she has to do to lose weight. Thebottomline: Patients are willing to change their diet if the result is weightloss, but will resist changing their dietif it's just to get out of pain. It might not make sense, but our society has been conditioned to believethat the doctor should \"fix\" their pain,but they understand they have to takean active role in weight loss. When D.D. Palmer first started adjusting 115 years ago, the patients hetreated weren't eating the highlyprocessed foods our patients eat today.Palmer was treating abnormal stress onnormal healthy tissue. Today, we treatabnormal stress (from injury), or dailynormal stress, on abnormal andunhealthy tissue. Fortunately, patients can change that \u2014 and you can be the one to empowerthem to change. Implementing a systematic weight- loss program in your office can notonly transform your finances, it cantransform the lives of your patients.This isn't rocket science. It's simple,basic practices you and your staff canpresent to patients. There are two potential theories or reasons to practice. The first one is the\"saving the world\" theory. The secondis the \"make great money\" not accomplish both by helpingyour patients nutritionally, and packag-ing it in a way they \u2014weight loss!

Imagine a tax credit, a direct reduc- tion of the chiropractic practice's taxbill, equal to as much as 35 percent ofthe premiums paid. Unlike a tax \"deduction, \" which merely reduces the income uponwhich the tax bill is based, a tax\"credit\" reduces the tax bill. Naturally,taking advantage of the tax credit oractually claiming the healthcare taxcredit is not a cut-and-dried process,and not every employer will qualify \u2014or want to qualify. Healthcare tax credit The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) hasalready begun encouraging small busi-nesses to explore and, if qualified,claim the new small health insurancecoverage credit. If you are a small employer (no more than 25 employees and averagewages below $50,000 annually) eligiblefor a federal tax credit, you can applyfor a direct reduction of your practice'stax bill, for the amount spent on healthinsurance for your employees \u2014 up to35 percent. The full amount of the credit is, however, available only to an employerwith 10 or fewer full-time equivalentemployees (FTEs) and whose employ-ees have average annual full-timeequivalent wages from the employer ofless than $25,000. These wage limits would be indexed to the Consumer Price Index for UrbanConsumers for years beginning in 2014. Self-employed chiropractors, includ- ing partners and sole practitioners, 2-percent shareholders of an Scorporation, and 5-percent sharehold-ers in the practice, are not treated asemployees for purposes of the SmallBusiness Health Care Tax Credit. Infact, a special rule prevents sole practi-tioners from receiving the credit as theprincipal as well as for family members. If you are self-employed, you can deduct the cost of health insurance foryourself, spouses, and dependents.Thus, if an S corporation pays accidentand health insurance premiums (undera plan established by the S corpora-tion) on behalf of a more-than-2-percent shareholder who is also itsemployee and who must include thevalue of the premiums in his or hergross income, the shareholder ispermitted to deduct the cost of thepremiums paid on his or her behalf. The basics The IRS recently released a draft thatsmall businesses (as well as tax-exemptorganizations) will use to calculate thehealthcare tax credit when their 2010tax returns are filed. For tax years 2010 to 2013, the maxi- mum credit is 35 percent of premiumsCredit where due Benefiting from the employee healthcare tax credit BY MARK E. BATTERSBY W W W. C H I R O E C O . C O M J A N U A R Y 2 0 , 2 0 1 1 C H I R O P R A C T I C E C O N O M I C S 97TAXTIPS98 C H I R O P R AC T I C E CO N O M I C S J A N U A R Y 2 0 , 2 0 1 1 W W W.C H I R O E CO.CO MTAX TIPS paid by eligible small busi- ness employers and 25percent of premiums paid byeligible employers that aretax-exempt organizations. Beginning in 2014, the maximum tax credit will goup to 50 percent of premi-ums paid by eligible smallbusiness employers and 35percent of premiums paidby eligible, tax-exemptorganizations for two years. Because the limitation on the number of employees isbased on FTEs, an employerwith 25 or more employeescould qualify for the credit ifsome of its employees workpart time. For example: An employer with 46 half-time employees(meaning they are paidwages for 1,040 hours) has 23FTEs and therefore mayqualify for the credit. The number of an employer's FTEs is deter-mined by dividing the totalhours of service for whichthe employer pays wages toemployees during the year(but not more than 2,080hours for any employee) by2,080. The result is thenrounded to the next lowestwhole number. Slashing premiums Only premiums paid by theemployer under an arrange-ment meeting the tax law'srequirements (a so-called\"qualifying arrangement\")are counted in calculatingthe credit. Under a qualifying arrangement, the employerpays the premiums for eachemployee enrolled in anamount equal to a uniformpercentage (not less than 50percent) of the premiumcost of the coverage. For years prior to 2014, only premiums paid to ahealth insurance issuer suchas an insurance company orHMO for healthcare cover-age are counted forpurposes of the credit.Premiums for healthcareinsurance that cover a widevariety of conditions, suchas a major medical plan, arealso counted, as are thepremiums for coverage thatis somewhat more limited inscope, such as limited scopedental or vision coverage. The other side Although the IRS onlyrecently announced theground rules for those prac-tices eligible for this new taxcredit, you may be in for abig surprise if you \u2014 or youradvisors \u2014 do not carefullyfollow the new rules. The taxcredit penalizes employers ifthey hire more workers orincrease salaries. As your practice's average pay rises above $25,000, thetax credit slowly decreasesat a rate of 4 percentagepoints for every additional$1,000 in average pay. Thetax credit completely disap-pears once average payreaches $50,000. The value of the benefit declines quickly, so manysmall business owners inhigh-cost states get no taxbreak, and those elsewhereoften say the credit is toosmall to make much of adifference. Many practices pay work- ers more than $25,000 ayear, so the average taxcredit for the few who qual- 100 C H I R O P R A C T I C E C O N O M I C S J A N UA RY 2 0, 2 0 1 1 W W W. C H I R O E C O . C O MTAX TIPS ify is about 10 percent of the cost of the policy. That's less than $200 perworker \u2014 not enough to spur manybusiness owners to start providingcoverage. Brokers across the countryreport a similar response. Generally, an employer (other than a tax-exempt employer) cannot claim thecredit if the operation has no taxableincome and no alternative minimumtax (AMT) liability for the year. Exceptin the case of a tax-exempt employer,the credit for a year offsets only anemployer's actual income tax liabilityor its (AMT) liability. Crystal ball Starting in 2014, the healthcare reformlaw will require nearly all Americans tohave health insurance, either throughan employer, a government program,or by buying it directly. That year, new insurance markets will open for business, health plans willbe required to accept all applicants,and tax credits will start flowing tomillions of people, helping them paythe premiums. Those who continue to go without coverage will have to pay a penalty tothe IRS, except in cases of financialhardship. Fines will vary by incomeand family size. In 2014, chiropractic practices and businesses employing more than 50workers will be required to providehealth coverage and most people willbe required to have health insurance.The tax on high-cost \"Cadillac\" poli-cies will not go into effect until 2018;the increase in Medicare payroll taxesbegins in 2013; while the tax creditsavailable to small employers for health-care-related expenses started in 2010. The Health Care Tax Credits are a temporary solution until small employ-ers can shop on insurance exchanges.States will start implementing theinsurance pools in 2014, but it couldbe two more years until every state hasan exchange set up to accommodateemployers with up to 100 employees,according to many experts. For a practice or business with 25 or fewer employees, the tax credits are abig help. But bigger practices will haveto wait for the exchanges. In the meantime, the question remains: Will the Small Business HealthCare Tax Credit help your practiceprovide this invaluable employee benefitor encourage your practice MARK E.

QI want to sue an insurance company that has refused topay me because the company insists that I provided massage services.In fact, the services were rendered bylicensed physical therapists, consistedof manual therapy, and were billedappropriately. Is it possible for me tosue as a class action? Sometimes, I get things in the mail asking me if I want to be a member ofa class or telling me I can opt out of theclass if I want to. What's the differenceif I bring this lawsuit myself? If I decideto go ahead with the lawsuit, whatwould be my responsibilities and howmuch do you think it would cost me?Do you think the company would stoppaying on my other cases if I become aplaintiff? Should I wait for someoneelse to bring the lawsuit and then justjoin the class? AAn attorney who frequently defends insurance companiesonce mentioned that if a class can get \"certified, \" the defendantinsurance company is left \"twisting inthe wind. \" That compelling visualmay have some truth to it. A class action is an excellent vehi- cle to enforce the rights of manypeople at the same time. In order tobring a class action it is necessary thatall the members of the class havesuffered the same \"injury\" under thesame set of facts; in your case, thefailure of the insurance company topay the doctors for physical therapyservices properly rendered. By bringing the lawsuit as a class, efficiency is increased, costs aredecreased, and repetition of the samelawsuit is avoided.For example: If you, and other doctors in the same situation, were tobring your lawsuits against the insur-ance companies individually, youwould all need to retain counsel whowould then incur individual filingfees, costs of discovery, etc. The cases would be heard individ- ually and there would most likely bedifferent results rendered by differentjudges in different courts. The \"class\"concept avoids this confusion. Class treatment of claims may also be the only way to change wrongfulbehavior. For instance, several years ago 4,000 plaintiffs brought a class actionagainst an insurance company.Although the recovery was just $550each, the insurance company agreedto make changes to its policy. As a result, 50 pages of policy improvements covering prompt pay,medical necessity, and recovery of\"overpayments\" were added to thisinsurer's new policies, thus changingthe insurer's practices and benefit-ting healthcare professionals foryears to come. If you decide to be the representa- tive plaintiff in this matter, you wouldbe required to attend a depositionwhere the insurance company'slawyers would ask you questions. Y ouwould first be prepared for this depo-sition by your attorney. The entireprocess would take about 10 hours ofyour time. Assuming you are successful, the court will most likely award you anadditional $10,000 in damages foracting as the class representative.There should be no cost to you asthere are a number of class actionattorneys who do this type of workand they bear the costs. Granted, these lawyers if success- ful will be awarded a substantial fee,but on the other hand they aretaking all the risk. Make sure whenhiring such a lawyer that you hireone with a lot of experience in thefield of class actions \u2014 as in anyother profession, some specialists arebetter than others. Y ou may certainly wait for some- one else to bring the lawsuit and justjoin that class, but then you aretaking the risk of no one ever bring-ing such a lawsuit, never getting paid,and having the insurance companydo the same thing to you time andtime again. It is hard to imagine that an insur- ance company would stop paying youfor legitimate claims filed by you justbecause you became a named plaintiffin a class action lawsuit against it. If this were to happen, however, the insurance company would belooking at much steeper liability thanjust nonpayment of bills \u2014 it couldbe sued for punitive damages, whichcan be a substantial amount of thenet worth of a company.

C H I R O E C O . C O MIF YOU ARE NOT SURE ABOUT START - ING YOUR OWN PRACTICE WHEN YOU GRADUATE ,you probably have considered the possibility of working for another chiropractor. This is anattractive option if: /trianglertY ou have little to no startup capital; /trianglertY ou have limited experience; /trianglertY ou are in a specialization thatrequires more training; or /trianglertY ou are just not confident about yourability to run a business. If this is your situation, you're prob- ably looking for an associate position.Note that this means you will be anemployee, going through an appren-ticeship of sorts. The comparable posi-tion for MDs would be a residency, inwhich a fledgling MD has the oppor-tunity to work in his or her field for afew years to gain greater knowledgeand skills before starting a practice. Often a great possibility is a position in which the doctor may be retiring orleaving the area in a few years and youmay be able to negotiate a buy-out. Inthis way, you can learn the practiceand become familiar with the patients,stepping in easily when the otherdoctor leaves.Here are some sources for associate positions: /trianglertY our best source of information willprobably be the alumni departmentof your chiropractic school, whichnormally has a listing of alumni whoare looking for graduates to work intheir practices. /trianglertIf your school has a student newspa-per, see if it has a classified sectionwhere employment opportunities arelisted. /trianglertIf you know the area where you wantto work, and you can't find a listingfor someone who wants an associate,don't hesitate to send out your CV .Put together a good-looking r\u00e9sum\u00e9,along with a sales-type cover letterthat describes your skills and abilities.Send it to a list of doctors in the area. In the letter, state that you will be contacting them within the next fewweeks to see if there is a possibility ofemployment, then follow up with thosecalls. Y our letter may come at the precisemoment that a doctor is thinking aboutgetting an associate. When you find a doctor you want to work with, you'll need a contractthat includes:/trianglertY our responsibilities as an employeeand the responsibilities of the hiringdoctor; /trianglertThe length of the contract andrequirements and notifications forterminating the contract by eitherparty; /trianglertY our compensation, usually expressedas base pay plus incentives for bring-ing in and providing care for morepatients, above a minimum level; /trianglertThe benefits you will receive, whichshould be the same as other employ-ees in the practice; and /trianglertThe conditions of the non-competeagreement, if you leave the practice. The contract should also specify if the doctor will pay your malpracticeinsurance and any continuing educa-tion seminars. Toreadthisarticleinitsentirety,visit www.ChiroEco.com/FindAssocPosition.
