Clinical trials run by the state-owned company Sinopharm showed that it had an efficacy rate of 79 percent. China [approved the vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/30/business/china-vaccine.html) and soon began exporting it to other countries. On May 7, the World Health Organization announced a similar efficacy estimate of [78.1 percent](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/07/business/economy/china-sinopharm-vaccine-who.html). A Vaccine Made From Coronaviruses BBIBP-CorV works by teaching the immune system to make antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The antibodies attach to viral proteins, such as the so-called spike proteins that [stud its surface](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-unveiled.html). Spikes Spike Spikes Spike protein gene CORONAVIRUS To [create BBIBP-CorV](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30695-4), the Beijing Institute researchers obtained three variants of the coronavirus from patients in Chinese hospitals. They picked one of the variants because it was able to multiply quickly in monkey kidney cells grown in bioreactor tanks. Killing the Virus Once the researchers produced large stocks of the coronaviruses, they doused them with a chemical called beta-propiolactone. The compound disabled the coronaviruses by bonding to their genes. The inactivated coronaviruses could no longer replicate. But their proteins, including researchers then drew off the inactivated viruses and mixed them with a tiny amount of an aluminum-based compound called an adjuvant. Adjuvants stimulate the immune system to boost its response to a vaccine. Inactivated viruses have been used for over a century. Jonas Salk used them to create his [polio vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/1955/04/13/archives/salk-polio-vaccine-proves-success-millions-will-be-immunized-soon.html) in the 1950s, and they're the bases for vaccines against other diseases including [rabies](https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/21/archives/vaccine-for-rabies-developed-cutting-shots-from-14-to-1-vaccine.html) and [hepatitis A](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/13/us/test-indicates-new-vaccine-works-against-hepatitis-a.html). Prompting an Immune Response Because the coronaviruses in BBIBP-CorV are dead, they can be injected into the arm without causing Covid-19. Once inside the body, some of the inactivated viruses are swallowed up by a type of immune cell called an antigen-presenting cell. Engulfing the virus Digesting proteins ANTIGEN- PRESENTING CELL Presenting virus protein fragments HELPER T CELL INACTIVATED CORONAVIRUS Engulfing the virus ANTIGEN- PRESENTING CELL Digesting virus proteins Presenting virus protein fragments HELPER T CELL INACTIVATED CORONAVIRUS Engulfing the virus ANTIGEN- PRESENTING CELL Digesting virus proteins Presenting virus protein fragments HELPER T CELL The antigen-presenting cell tears the coronavirus apart and displays some of its fragments on its surface. A so-called helper T cell may detect the fragment. If the fragment fits into one of its surface proteins, the T cell becomes activated and can help recruit other immune cells to respond to the vaccine. Making Antibodies Another type of immune cell, called a B cell, may also encounter the inactivated coronavirus. B cells have surface proteins in a huge variety of shapes, and a few might have the right shape to latch onto the coronavirus. When a B cell locks on, it can pull part or all of the virus inside and present coronavirus fragments on its surface. A helper T cell activated against the coronavirus can latch onto the same fragment. When that happens, the B cell gets activated, too. It proliferates and pours out antibodies that have the same shape as their surface proteins.

B cells produce antibodies that stick to the invaders. Antibodies that target the spike protein can prevent the virus from entering cells. Other kinds of antibodies may block the virus by other means. ANTIBODIES LIVE VIRUS ANTIBODIES LIVE VIRUS ANTIBODIES LIVE VIRUS Remembering the Virus Sinopharm's clinical trials have demonstrated that BBIBP-CorV can protect people against Covid-19. But no one can yet say how long that protection lasts. It's possible that the level of antibodies drops over the course of months. But the immune system also contains special cells called memory B cells that might retain information about the coronavirus for years or even decades. Vaccine Timeline January, 2020 Sinopharm begins developing an inactivated vaccine against the coronavirus. June Researchers [report](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30695-4) the vaccine produces promising results in monkeys. A [Phase 1/2 trial](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30831-8/fulltext) shows that the vaccine doesn't cause any serious side effects and enables people to make antibodies against the coronavirus.
