Immune Protect with PARACTIN\u00ae provides 100 milligrams of a proprietary, patented form of beta-glucan that has been shown to activate the host immune system's primary defenders by activating complementary systems, and enhancing macrophages and natural killer cell function.1-18 The immune cell-priming capabilities of this patented, highly purified yeast derivative exceed those of all other sources of immune supplements tested to date. It also contains PARACTIN\u00ae, an extract of Andrographis paniculata, an herb used in Asia for thousands of years to help with inflammatory factors, which provides significant seasonal support.19-21 Among the active compounds of this herb is andrographolide, a phytochemical that exerts powerful immune-boosting effects on the human body.22-25 The formula's patented blend of these andrographolides helps suppress damaging inflammatory cytokines and eases symptomatic discomfort.26-29 Only Immune Protect with Paractin\u00ae contains both beta-glucan and PARACTIN\u00ae to help boost immunity and suppress inflammatory cytokines.
