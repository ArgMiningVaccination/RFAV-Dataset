At YO1, check out these five benefits of Shirodhara therapy that have positive effects on the body and the mind.", "sitename": "yo1.com", "date": "2019-10-22", "cleaned_text": "What Is Shirodhara? Have you heard of Shirodhara before? We know it might sound a bit complex, so we thought of breaking it down for you! Shirodhara is derived from the Sanskrit terms Shiro, which means \"head,\" and Dhara, which means \"flow.\" During this therapy, warm, herbalized Ayurvedic oil is streamed on your forehead from the right to the left temple. After some time, the stream is directed to the center of the forehead, where it will remain stationary till the end. A full-body Srota or Abhyangha massage precedes the oil pour, which lasts for around 30 minutes. There are five significant Benefits of Shirodhara therapy in addition to its unquestionable calming effects. 1. Reduces the Impact of Stress Shirodhara helps in controlling excessive levels of mental stress. It encourages tranquility, fosters peace, and helps you unwind. Stress hormones decrease gradually during the therapy as you approach a profound state of relaxation. It greatly helps in reducing the heart rate and relaxing the muscles which has a positive effect on the mind. A study found that Shirodhara therapy considerably affects measurable indicators of relaxation by lowering [blood pressure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8039348/), slowing heart rate, and reducing respiration rate. Since stress is associated in some way with almost all modern diseases, reducing its negative effects is an important strategy for promoting lifetime health. Are you facing challenges in managing stress in your personal and professional life? Plan a stay at YO1 and try the Shirodhara therapy as it can induce such a potent relaxation response that the effects of stress may be reduced for a longer duration. 2. Reduces Anxiety Anxiety is one word that we all are familiar with these days, right? Be it peer pressure, or the race for success, anxiety can act as a hurdle in our lives, and natural therapies like Shirodhara can help in relieving the same. Moderate, repetitive stimulation to the forehead's center is the most natural method by which the Shirodhara therapy lessens anxiety. It is believed that vital energy points in the body are activated as the warm oil flows onto the forehead's center. The region between the eyebrows is thought to ease anxiety and agitation. According to Ayurveda, Shirodhara awakens the potent energy point on the forehead, making it possible to dispel anxiety. Are you looking for a natural remedy to cope with anxiety? A relaxing break at YO1 with comfortable stays and rejuvenating Shirodhara Therapy is what you need. 3. Awakens Intuition You must have come across the idea of Third Eye energy as per ancient traditions, but do you know what it exactly means? Let's deep dive! Many spiritual traditions refer to the area between the eyebrows as the \"third eye\" which is regarded as the location of spiritual enlightenment. In some cultures, it is described as the seat of intuition. Whatever name it goes by, stimulating the area in between the brows has long been thought to be a way to enter more nuanced worlds. According to these traditions, it is believed that the life force starts to flow freely as the third eye opens. Energy conduits called Srotas are cleared and obstructions are removed as the life force passes through them. It is believed that through this therapy, the physical and emotional blocks are removed as energy pathways are cleaned. Shirodhara can also help in overcoming the stresses of daily life, thanks to the mental clarity that it brings in. It greatly improves decision-making skills while it helps in connecting with your higher self and becoming more spiritually conscious. 4. Improves Sleep Quality Do you feel drowsy all day? Modern-day lifestyle has led to sporadic sleep loss, whether as a result of a cup of coffee consumed too late in the day or an impending deadline at work. One night of poor sleep might feel crippling in terms of fatigue and drowsiness. But when your sleep is consistently poor, not only do you feel drowsy, but your physical and emotional health suffers. Conventional Ayurvedic therapies can improve the quality of sleep to a great extent. It has been demonstrated that Shirodhara therapy lowers brain waves to a calmer alpha state and helps manage sleep effectively. 5. Pacifies Vata Dosha According to Ayurveda, every personality and body type can be classified into three Doshas - Vata, Kapha, and Pitta. These 3 doshas are defined by the attributes of 5 elements of nature - space, water, fire, air, and earth. The Vata dosha combines the elements of space and air. It is believed that Vata can cause physical restlessness, disorganized thoughts, dispersed concentration, and forgetfulness when it builds up in your constitution. Shirodhara therapy is regarded as one of the most efficient ways to reduce excessive Vata in Ayurvedic circles. The Vata dosha's chilly, light, and erratic characteristics are balanced by the warmth, weight, and consistency of the oil pour.
