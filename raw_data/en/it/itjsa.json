Fordyce spots are caused by the abnormal secretion of sebum (oil) by the sebaceous glands present in the skin ( [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6943138)). The accumulated sebum acts as a breeding ground for bacteria, and this infection causes inflammation of the surrounding tissue. It is important to note that this is not a sexually transmitted infection. Dr. Mozzi says, \"It looks like a tiny white or yellow bump under the skin (typical size is between 1 to 3 mm in diameter). Fordyce spots (also called Fordyce's granules) are often multiple or clustered together.\" She adds, \"They are enlarged oil glands (sebaceous glands) that are not associated with hair follicles, found around the edges of the lips and occasionally on the genital skin such as the scrotum, shaft of the penis, or on labia.\" There are several home remedies that may help treat Fordyce spots on the lips. But before treating them at home, you must consult a specialist to eliminate the chance of these spots being a sign of a sexually transmitted disease.
