The same acts that would bepunished if directed at an employer, a neigh-bor, or an acquaintance often go unchal-lenged when men direct them at women,especially within the family. For over three decades, women's advo- cacy groups around the world have beenworking to draw more attention to thephysical, psychological, and sexual abuseof women and to stimulate action. Theyhave provided abused women with shelter,lobbied for legal reforms, and challengedthe widespread attitudes and beliefs thatsupport violence against women. 2 Increasingly, these efforts are havingViolence against women is the most per- vasive yet underrecognized human rights vio-lation in the world.

Today, international institutions are speaking out against gender-based vio-lence. Surveys and studies are collectingmore information about the prevalence andnature of abuse. More organizations, serv-ice providers, and policy makers are recog-nizing that violence against women hasserious adverse consequences for women'shealth and for society. This chapter provides a brief overview of the issue of violence against women,including definitions, international preva-lence, the documented health conse-quences of abuse, and evidence regardingcausation and women's experiences ofabuse. We include this information here forindividuals who may be new to the topicand/or for those who are writing researchproposals and may not have easy access tothe international literature. DEFINITIONS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN Although both men and women can be victims as well as perpetrators of violence,the characteristics of violence most com-monly committed against women differ incritical respects from violence commonlycommitted against men. Men are morelikely to be killed or injured in wars oryouth- and gang-related violence thanwomen, and they are more likely to bephysically assaulted or killed on the streetby a stranger. Men are also more likely tobe the perpetrators of violence, regardlessof the sex of the victim. 1In contrast, women are more likely to be physicallyassaulted or murdered by someone theyknow, often a family member or intimatepartner. 2They are also at greater risk of being sexually assaulted or exploited,either in childhood, adolescence, or asadults. Women are vulnerable to differenttypes of violence at different moments intheir lives (see Figure 1.1). There is still no universally agreed-upon terminology for referring to violence againstwomen. Many of the most commonly usedterms have different meanings in differentregions, and are derived from diverse theo-retical perspectives and disciplines.FIGURE 1.1 THE LIFE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN (Adapted from Watts and Zimmerman, 20026and Shane and Ellsberg, 2002.7)Pre-birth Infancy ChildhoodElderly AdolescenceReproductive AgeSex-selective Female infanticide Neglect prostitution Trafficking Forced early marriagePsychological violenceSexual assault by harassmentA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 11One frequently used model for under- standing intimate partner abuse and sexualabuse of girls is the \"family violence\"framework, which has been developed pri-marily from the fields of sociology andpsychology. 8, 9\"Family violence\" refers to all forms of abuse within the family regard-less of the age or sex of the victim or theperpetrator. Although women are fre-quently victimized by a spouse, parent, orother family member, the concept of \"fam-ily violence\" does not encompass the manytypes of violence to which women areexposed outside the home, such as sexualassault and harassment in the workplace.Moreover, feminist researchers find theassumption of gender neutrality in the term\"family violence\" problematic because itfails to highlight that violence in the familyis mostly perpetrated by men againstwomen and children. There is increasing international consen- sus that the abuse of women and girls,regardless of where it occurs, should beconsidered as \"gender-based violence,\" as itlargely stems from women's subordinate sta-tus in society with regard to men (Figure1.2). The official United Nations definitionof gender-based violence was first presentedin 1993 when the General Assembly passedthe Declaration on the Elimination ofViolence against Women. 10According to this definition, gender-based violence includes ahost of harmful behaviors directed atwomen and girls because of their sex,including wife abuse, sexual assault, dowry-related murder, marital rape, selective mal-nourishment of female children, forcedprostitution, female genital mutilation, andsexual abuse of female children (see Box1.1 for the complete definition). 10 Even when the abuse of women by male partners is conceptualized as gender-based violence, the terms used to describethis type of violence are not consistent. Inmany parts of the world, the term \"domes-tic violence\" refers to the abuse of womenby current or former male intimate part-ners. 11, 12However, in some regions, includ- ing Latin America, \"domestic violence\"refers to any violence that takes place inthe home, including violence against chil-dren and the elderly. 13, 14The term \"bat- tered women\" emerged in the 1970s and iswidely used in the United States andEurope to describe women who experi-ence a pattern of systematic dominationand physical assault by and\"intimate violence\" are generallywomen, whereas \"wife abuse\" and \"wifeassault\" can be read to exclude common-law unions and dating violence. For the purposes of this manual, we use the terms \"violence against women\" (VAW)and \"gender-based violence\" (GBV) inter-changeably to refer the full range ofabuses recognized by the UN Declarationand other international agreements. We useVIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AS A HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT ISSUE The term \"violence against women\" means any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffer- ing to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or private life. Accordingly, violence againstwomen encompasses but is not limited to the following: a) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including battering, sexual abuse of female children in the household, dowry-related vio-lence, marital rape, female genital mutilation and other traditional practicesharmful to women, non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation; b) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring within the general com- munity, including rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation atwork, in educational institutions and elsewhere, trafficking in women and forcedprostitution; c) Physical, sexual and psychological violence perpetrated or condoned by the State, wherever it occurs. Acts of violence against women also include forced sterilization and forced abortion, coercive/forced use of contraceptives, female infanticide and prenatalsex selection.BOX 1.1 UNITED NATIONS DEFINITION OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN (From United Nations, 1993.10)12 Researching Violence Against Womenthe and to the range of sexu-ally, psychologically, and physicallycoercive acts used against adult and ado-lescent women by current or former maleintimate partners. PREVALENCE OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE International research consistently demon- strates that a woman is more likely to beassaulted, injured, raped, or killed by a cur-rent or former partner than by any otherperson. Table 1.1 presents findings fromnearly 80 population-based studies carriedout in more than 50 countries. These studiesindicate that between 10 percent and 60 per-cent of women who have ever been marriedor partnered have experienced at least oneincident of physical violence from a currentor former intimate partner. Most studies esti-mate a lifetime prevalence of partner vio-lence between 20 percent and 50 percent.Although women can also be violent, andabuse exists in some same-sex relationships,the vast majority of partner abuse is perpe-trated by men against their female partners. Researchers find considerable variation in the prevalence of partner violence fromcountry to country, and among studieswithin a country. Unfortunately, lack ofconsistency in study methods, studydesign, and presentation of results makes itdifficult to explore the causes and conse-quences of violence. As a result, it is oftendifficult to compare results even betweenstudies performed in the same country. Partly to address this shortcoming, the World Health Organization worked withcollaborating institutions in 15 sites in tencountries between 1998 and 2004 to imple-ment a multi-country study of domesticviolence and women's health. The WHO Multi-country Study on Women's Healthand Domestic Violence Against Women \u2014 also referred to here as the WHO VAWStudy\u2014was the first ever to produce trulycomparable data on physical and sexualabuse across settings. 16This research proj- ect sought to minimize differences relatedto methods by employing standardizedquestionnaires and procedures, as well as acommon approach to interviewer training. We will return to the WHO VAW Study many times throughout the manual tohighlight some of the challenges posed bythis project and how they were resolved. THE PATTERNING OF INTIMATE PARTNERVIOLENCE The WHO VAW Study also provided a rare opportunity to examine the \"patterning\" ofviolence across settings. Does physical vio-lence occur together with other types ofviolence? Do violent acts tend to escalateover time? Are women most at risk frompartners or from others in their lives? The WHO VAW Study findings confirm that most women who suffer physical orsexual abuse by a partner generally experi-ence multiple acts over time. Likewise, phys-ical and sexual abuse tend to co-occur inCHAPTER ONE FIGURE 1.2 THE OVERLAP BETWEEN GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE AND FAMILY/DOMESTIC VIOLENCE Gender-based violence For example: Rape by strangers Female genitalmutilation Sexual harassament in the workplace Selective malnutritionof abuse Child abuse Elder abuseFamily violenceA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 13VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AS A HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT ISSUE Proportion of women physically assaulted Year of Sample Study* by a partner (%) Country Ref study Coverage size population* Age (years) last 12 mo Ever Africa Ethiopia 172002 Meskanena Woreda 2261 1367 III 15-49 16 31 South Africa211998 Eastern 396 III 18-49 11 271998 Mpumalanga 419 III 18-49 12 28 1998 Northern Province 464 III 18-49 5 19 221998 National 10,190 II 15-49 6 13 Tanzania 202002 Dar Salaam III 15-49 15 33 202002 Midlands Province 966 I >18 17b Latin America and the Caribbean Barbados261990 National 264 I 20-45 30a,c Brazil 202001 Sao Paulo III 15-49 202001 Pernambuco 1188 III 15-49 Santiago 22-55 26d 281997 Santiago 310 II 15-49 23 292004pSanta 19d National Dominican 242002 National 6807 III 15-49 11 22 Ecuador 321995 National 11,657 II 15-49 12 El Salvador 332002 6 Haiti 242000 National 2347 III 15-49 21 29 Mexico361996 Guadalajara 382003 Nicaragua391995 Leon 360 III 15-49 27 52 401997 Managua 378 III 15-49 33 69 411998 National 8507 III 15-49 13 30 421995-1996 III 15-49 10 432004 National 5070 Peru 242000 National 17,369 III 15-49 2 42TABLE 1.1 PHYSICAL ASSAULTS ON WOMEN BY AN INTIMATE MALE PARTNER, SELECTED POPULATION-BASED STUDIES, 1982-200414 Researching Violence Against WomenCHAPTER ONE Proportion of women physically assaulted Year of Sample Study* by a partner (%) Country Ref study Coverage size population* Age (years) last 12 mo Ever Latin America and the Caribbean (continued) Peru (continued) 202001 Lima 1019 III 15-49 17 50 202001 Cusco National 8000 I >18 1a22a Asia Western 6300 3b8b,d 502002-2003 National 6438 National (villages) 1225 II <50 19 16 National 15-49 20-64 India 241998-1999 National 90,303 15-49 10 19 531999 Six states 9938 III 15-49 14 40 292004pLucknow 506 IV 15-49 25 35 292004pTrivandrum 700 IV 15-49 20 43 292004pVellore 716 IV 15-49 16 31 Indonesia552000 Central Java 765 IV 15-49 2 11 Japan 202001 Yokohama 1276 III 18-49 3 13 New Zealand 562002 Auckland 1309 III 18-64 5 30 562002 North Waikato 1360 III 18-64 34 Papua New Guinea 571982 National, rural villages 628 IIIk67 Philippines 581993 National 8481 15-49 10 591998 26 City & Bukidnon 292004pPaco 1000 IV 15-49 6 21 Republic of Korea 601989 National 707 II >20 38 Samoa 202000 National 1204 III 15-49 18 41 202002 Nakonsawan Ha Tay province 1090 III 15-60 14 25TABLE 1.1 PHYSICAL ASSAULTS ON WOMEN BY AN INTIMATE MALE PARTNER, SELECTED POPULATION-BASED STUDIES, 1982-2004A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 15VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AS A HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT ISSUE Proportion of women physically assaulted Year of Sample Study* by a partner (%) Country Ref study Coverage size population* Age (years) last 12 mo Ever Europe Albania 622002 National 4049 III 15-44 5 8 Azerbaijan 632001 National 5533 III 15-44 8 20 Finland *641997 National I 30 *652002 9i 661999 20-49 18 27 Republic of Moldova 721997 National 4790 III 15-44 8 15 Romania 731999 National 5322 III 15-44 10 29 Russia 742000 Three 5482 15-44 7 22 Serbia/Montenegro 202003 1189 >18 10 Anatolia I 14-75 58a Ukraine 791999 National 5596 III 12a30a 812001 National 12,226 821995-1996 National 7123 III 15-49 13 34 292004pEl-Sheik Zayed 631 IV 15-49 11 11 Israel831997 Arab population 1826 II 19-67 32 West Bank and Gaza Strip841994 Palestinian population 2410 II 17-65 52 Key DHS survey data24INCLEN data85CDC study WHO study20*International Violence Against Women (IVAWS) StudyTABLE 1.1 PHYSICAL ASSAULTS ON WOMEN BY AN INTIMATE MALE PARTNER, SELECTED POPULATION-BASED STUDIES, 1982-2004 * Study population: I = all women; II = currently married/partnered women;III = ever-married/partnered women;IV = women with a pregnancy outcome; V = married women - half with pregnancy outcome, half without; VI women who had apartner within the last 12 months. aSample group included women who had never been in a relationship and thereforewere not in exposed group.bAlthough sample included all women, rate of abuse is shown for ever-married/partneredwomen (number not given). cPhysical or sexual assault. dDuring current relationship. eRate of partner abuse among ever- married/partnered women recalculated from authors' data. fWeighted for national representativity.gWithin the last five years. hIncludes threats. iSince the age of 18. jSince the age of 16. kNonrandom sampling methods used. pPublication date (field work dates not reported).

Figure 1.3 summarizes the proportion of women who have experi-enced violence by an intimate partneramong ever-partnered women aged 15 to 49in the various sites included in the study.The first bar portrays the percentage ofwomen in each setting who have experi-enced physical violence by a partner; thesecond bar portrays sexual violence by apartner; and the third bar represents the per-centage of ever-partnered women who haveexperienced either physical and/or sexualviolence by a partner in their lifetime. Until recently, it was believed that few women exclusively experienced sexual vio-lence by an intimate partner. Available stud-ies from North and Central America hadindicated that sexual violence was generallyaccompanied by physical abuse and by emo-tional violence and controlling behaviors. 2 The findings from the WHO VAW Studysuggest that, although this pattern is main-tained in many countries, a few sitesdemonstrate a significant departure. Inboth the capital and province of Thailand,a substantial portion of women who expe-rience partner violence, experience sexualviolence only (Figure 1.4). In Bangkok, 44percent of all cases of lifetime partner vio-lence have experienced only sexual vio-lence. The corresponding statistic in theThai province is 29 percent of cases. Asimilarly high percentage of cases of vio-lence in Bangladesh province (32 percent)and Ethiopia province (31 percent) involvesexual violence only. These results speak to the importance of developing a broader international researchbase on violence against women. Insightsderived exclusively from the NorthAmerican literature may not reflect the real-ity of women's experiences in other settings.

Forced sexual contact can take placeat any time in a woman's life and includesa range of behaviors, from forcible rape tononphysical forms of pressure that compelgirls and women to engage in sex againsttheir will. The touchstone of coercion isthat a woman lacks choice and faces severephysical, social, or economic consequencesif she resists sexual advances. Studies indicate that the majority of non- consensual sex takes place among individu-als who know each other\u2014spouses, familymembers, dating partners, or acquain-tances. 86, 87In fact, much nonconsensual sex takes place within consensual unions andincludes a woman being compelled to havesex when she does not want it, or toengage in types of sexual activity that shefinds degrading or humiliating. 1, 88, 89Much sexual coercion also takes place against children and adolescents in bothindustrial and developing countries.Between one-third and two-thirds ofknown sexual assault victims are age 15 oryounger, according to justice system statis-tics and information from rape crisis cen-ters in Chile, Peru, Malaysia, Mexico,Panama, Papua New Guinea, and theUnited States. 2 Sexual exploitation of children is wide- spread in virtually all societies. Child sex-ual abuse refers to any sexual act thatoccurs between an adult or older adoles-cent and a child, and any nonconsensualsexual contact between a child and a peer.Laws generally consider the issue of con-sent to be irrelevant in cases of sexualcontact by an adult with a child, definedvariously as someone under 13, 14, 15, or16 years of age. Because of the taboo nature of the topic, it is difficult to collect reliable figureson the prevalence of sexual abuse in child-hood. Nonetheless, the few representativesample surveys provide cause for concern.VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AS A HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT ISSUE FIGURE 1.4 INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE ACCORDING TO TYPES OF VIOLENCE (AMONG EVER-ABUSED WOMEN) 100 - 80 - 60 - 40 - 20 - 0 - Bangladesh City Bangladesh ProvinceBrazil City Brazil Province Ethiopia ProvinceJapan City Namibia CityPeru City Peru Province Thailand City Thailand ProvinceTanzania City Tanzania ProvinceSerbia Samoa sexual violence only physical violence only sexual and physical violence (From WHO, 2005.20)Percent 44 30 2648 19 3229 65 630 61 2935 45 2139 45 1723 73 430 58 12 418 Researching Violence Against WomenA review of 25 studies worldwide indicates that 0 to 32 percent of women report thatthey experienced sexual abuse in child-hood (see Table 1.2). Although both girlsand boys can be victims of sexual abuse,most studies report that the prevalence ofabuse among girls is at least 1.5 to 3 timeshigher than among boys. 90Abuse among boys may be underreported compared withabuse among girls, however. Further data reveal that coercion may be an element in many young girls' initiationinto sexual life. An increasing number ofstudies have begun to document that asubstantial number of young women's first sexual experiences are forced orunwanted, especially among younger ado-lescents. Table 1.3 summarizes data from anumber of population-based surveys onthe prevalence of forced first sex, includingdata emerging from the WHO VAW Study.A plethora of studies now confirm that theyounger a girl is when she first has sex,the more likely she is to report her sexualdebut as forced. 91 Trafficking in women and girls for forced labor and sexual exploitation isanother type of gender-based violence thathas grown rapidly during the past decade,largely as a result of war, displacement,and economic and social inequitiesbetween and within countries. Althoughreliable statistics on the number of womenand children who are trafficked are lack-ing, rough estimates suggest that from700,000 to 2 million women and girls aretrafficked across international borders everyyear. 6, 92, 93These women face many risks, including physical violence and rape, bothin their work and when trying to negotiatesafer-sex practices. Another aspect of gender-based violence that has been largely overlooked until recently is violence against women in situ-ations of armed conflict. Recent reportshave documented systematic rape in manyconflicts, including the former Yugoslavia,Rwanda, Liberia, Sierra Leone, andUganda. 94-96These reports have highlighted the extent to which rape has been used asa deliberate strategy to \"destabilize popula-tion, advance ethnic cleansing, expresshatred for the enemy or supply combatantswith sexual services.\" 96In 2002, the International Criminal Tribunal in TheHague recognized the seriousness of sex-ual offences in war as a crime againsthumanity. International relief agencies arealso calling attention to the precarious situ-ation of women in refugee settings whererape, child sexual abuse, intimate partnerviolence, and other forms of sexualexploitation are widespread. THE EFFECTS OF VIOLENCE ON WOMEN'S HEALTH Gender-based violence is associated with serious health problems affecting bothwomen and children, including injuries,gynecological disorders, mental health dis-orders, adverse pregnancy outcomes, andsexually transmitted infections (STIs)(Figure 1.5). Violence can have direct con- sequences for women's health, and it canincrease women's risk of future ill health. Therefore, victimization, like tobacco oralcohol use, can best be conceptualized asa risk factor for a variety of diseases andconditions, rather than primarily as a healthproblem in and of itself. 2, 4 Both population-based research and studies of emergency room visits in theUnited States indicate that physical abuse isan important cause of injury amongwomen. 97Documented injuries sustained from such physical abuse include contu-sions, concussions, lacerations, fractures,and gunshot wounds. Population-basedstudies indicate that 40 to 75 percent ofwomen who are physically abused by apartner report injuries due to violence atsome point in their life. 2 Nevertheless, injury is not the mostCHAPTER ONEA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 19VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AS A HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT ISSUE Country & Year (Ref.

The experi-ence of abuse often erodes women'sself-esteem and puts them at greater risk ofa variety of mental health problems,including depression, anxiety, phobias,post-traumatic stress disorder, and alcoholand drug abuse. 2 Violence and sexual abuse also lie behind some of the most intractable22 Researching Violence Against Womenreproductive health issues of our times\u2014 unwanted pregnancies, HIV and otherSTIs, and complications of pregnancy.Physical violence and sexual abuse canput women at risk of infection andunwanted pregnancies directly , if women are forced to have sex, for example, or ifthey fear using contraception or condomsbecause of their partner's reaction. A his-tory of sexual abuse in childhood also canlead to unwanted pregnancies and STIsindirectly by increasing sexual risk-taking in adolescence and adulthood. There is agrowing body of research indicating thatviolence may increase women's suscepti-bility to HIV infection. 117-120Studies carried out in Tanzania and South Africa foundthat seropositive women were more likelythan their seronegative peers to reportphysical partner abuse. The results indi-cate that women with violent or control-ling male partners are at increased risk ofHIV infection. There is little informationas yet to indicate how violence increaseswomen's risk for HIV. Dunkle and col-leagues suggest that abusive men aremore likely to have HIV and imposerisky sexual practices on their partners.There are also indications that disclosureof HIV status may put women at risk forviolence. 118 Violence can also be a risk factor during pregnancy. Studies from around the worlddemonstrate that violence during preg-nancy is not a rare phenomenon. Withinthe United States, for example, between 1percent and 20 percent of currently preg-nant women report physical violence, withthe majority of findings between 4 percentand 8 percent. 5The differences are due partly to differences in the way womenwere asked about violence. 3, 5, 121, 122A recent review found that the prevalence of abuseduring pregnancy is 3 to 11 percent inindustrialized countries outside of NorthAmerica and between 4 and 32 percent indeveloping countries, including studiesfrom China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Mexico, India,Nicaragua, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, andSouth Africa. 3 Violence during pregnancy can have serious health consequences for women and their children.2Documented effects include delayed prenatal care, inadequateweight gain, increased smoking and sub-stance abuse, STIs, vaginal and cervicalinfections, kidney infections, miscarriagesand abortions, premature labor, fetal dis-tress, and bleeding during pregnancy. 4 Recent research has focused on the rela- tionship between violence in pregnancyand low birth weight, a leading cause ofinfant deaths in the developing world.Although research is still emerging, find-ings of six different studies performed inthe United States, Mexico, and Nicaraguasuggest that violence during pregnancycontributes to low birth weight, pre-termdelivery, and to fetal growth retardation, atleast in some settings. 121, 123A recent meta analysis of existing studies confirms thatintimate partner violence during pregnancyis indeed associated with a significant,albeit small, reduction in birth weight. 124 In its most extreme form, violence kills women. Worldwide, an estimated 40 tomore than 70 percent of homicides ofwomen are perpetrated by intimate part-ners, frequently in the context of an abu-sive relationship. 125By contrast, only a small percentage of men who are murdered arekilled by their female partners, and in manysuch cases, the women are defendingthemselves or retaliating against abusivemen. 126A study of female homicide in South Africa found that intimate femicide(female murder by an intimate partner)accounted for 41 percent of all femalehomicides. This study estimated that awoman is killed by her intimate partner inSouth Africa every six hours. 127Violence is also a significant risk factor for suicide.Studies in numerous countries have foundthat women who have suffered domesticCHAPTER ONEA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 23VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AS A HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT ISSUE Gender-Based Victimization Child sexual abuse Sexual assault Physical abuse Nonfatal Outcomes Fatal Outcomes Direct & Indirect Physical Health Mental Health Injury Post traumatic stress Femicide Functional impairment Depression Suicide Physical symptoms Anxiety Maternal mortality Poor subjective health Phobias/panic disorders AIDS-related Permanent disability Eating disorders Sexual dysfunction Injurious Health Behaviors Low self-esteem Smoking Mental distress Alcohol and drug use Substance abuse disorders Sexual risk-taking Physical inactivity Overeating Functional Disorders Chronic pain syndromes Irritable bowel syndrome Gastrointestinal disorders Somatic complaints Fibromyalgia Reproductive Health Unwanted pregnancy STIs/HIV Gynecological disorders Unsafe abortion Pregnancy complications Miscarriage/low birth weight Pelvic inflammatory diseaseFIGURE 1.5 HEALTH OUTCOMES OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN (From Heise et al, 1999.2)24 Researching Violence Against Womenviolence or sexual assault are much more likely to have had suicidal thoughts, or tohave attempted to kill themselves. 19 EXPLAINING GENDER- BASED VIOLENCE Violence against women is widespread, but it is not universal. Anthropologists havedocumented small-scale societies\u2014such asthe Wape of Papua New Guinea\u2014wheredomestic violence is virtually absent. 128, 129 This reality stands as testament to the factthat social relations can be organized tominimize abuse. Why is violence more widespread in some places than in others? Increasingly,researchers are using an \"ecological frame-work\" to understand the interplay of per-sonal, situational, and socio-cultural factorsthat combine to cause abuse. 21, 130-133In this framework, violence against women resultsfrom the interaction of factors at differentlevels of the social environment (Figure 1.6). The framework can best be visualized as four concentric circles. The innermost cir-cle represents the biological and personalhistory that each individual brings to his orher behavior in relationships. The secondcircle represents the immediate context inwhich abuse takes place: frequently thefamily or other intimate or acquaintancerelationship. The third circle represents theinstitutions and social structures, both for-mal and informal, in which relationshipsare embedded, such as neighborhoods, theworkplace, social networks, and peergroups. The fourth, outermost circle is theeconomic and social environment, includ-ing cultural norms. A wide range of studies shows that several factors at each of these levelsincrease the likelihood that a man willabuse his partner: At the individual level , the male was abused as a child or witnessed maritalviolence in the home, had an absent orrejecting father, or frequently uses alco-hol. A recent review of nationally repre-sentative surveys in nine countriesfound that for women, low educationalattainment, being under 25 years of age,having witnessed her father's violenceagainst her mother, living in an urbanarea, and low socio-economic statuswere consistently associated with anincreased risk of abuse. 24 At the level of the family and rela-tionship , the male controls wealth and decision making within the family andmarital conflict is frequent. At the community level , women are isolated with reduced mobility and lackof social support. Male peer groupscondone and legitimize men's violence. At the societal level , gender roles are rigidly defined and enforced and theconcept of masculinity is linked totoughness, male honor, or dominance.The prevailing culture tolerates physicalpunishment of women and children,accepts violence as a means to settleinterpersonal disputes, and perpetuatesthe notion that men \"own\" women. The ecological framework combines individual level risk factors with family,community, and society level factors identi-fied through cross cultural studies, andhelps explain why some societies andsome individuals are more violent thanothers, and why women, especially wives,are so much more likely to be the victimsof violence within the family. Other factorscombine to protect some women. Forexample, women who have authority andpower outside the family tend to experi-ence lower levels of abuse in intimate part-nerships. Likewise, when family membersand friends intervene promptly, theyCHAPTER ONEA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 25appear to reduce the likelihood of domes- tic violence. In contrast, wives are morefrequently abused in cultures where familyaffairs are considered \"private\" and outsidepublic scrutiny. Justifications for violence frequently evolve from gender norms, that is, socialnorms about the proper roles and respon-sibilities of men and women. Many cul-tures hold that a man has the right tocontrol his wife's behavior and that womenwho challenge that right\u2014even by askingfor household money or by expressing theneeds of the children\u2014may be punished.In countries as different as Bangladesh,Cambodia, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan,Papua New Guinea, Nicaragua, Tanzania,and Zimbabwe, studies find that violence isfrequently viewed as physical chastise-ment\u2014the husband's right to \"correct\" anerring wife. 2As one husband said in a focus group discussion in Tamil Nadu,India, \"If it is a great mistake, then the hus-band is justified in beating his wife. Whynot? A cow will not be obedient withoutbeatings.\" 134 Worldwide, studies identify a consistent list of events that are said to \"trigger\" vio-lence. 130These include: not obeying the husband, talking back, not having foodready on time, failing to care adequatelyfor the children or home, questioning himabout money or girlfriends, going some-where without his permission, refusing himsex, or expressing suspicions of infidelity.All of these represent transgressions ofdominant gender norms in many societies. Although the ecological framework has gained broad acceptance for conceptualiz-ing violence, there have been few attemptsto explore how individual and communitylevel risk factors relate to each other andultimately influence women's vulnerabilityto violence. One study performed in theUnited States found that the socio-eco-nomic status of the neighborhood had agreater impact on the risk of violence thanindividual household income levels.135A study in Bangladesh found that someaspects of women's status could eitherincrease or decrease a woman's risk ofbeing beaten, depending on the socio-cul-tural conditions of the community she livesin. In one site, characterized by more con-servative norms regarding women's rolesand status, women with greater personalautonomy and those who participated for ashort time in savings and credit groupsexperienced more violence than womenwith less autonomy. Community-levelmeasures of women's status had no effecton the risk of violence. The opposite was true in the less conser- vative setting where women had betteroverall status. In this site, individual meas-ures of autonomy and participation in creditschemes had no impact on the risk of vio-lence, whereas living in a community wheremore women participated in credit groupsand where women had a higher status over-all had a protective effect. These findingssuggest that the same condition (mobility orparticipating in a credit group) may havecompletely different effects on a woman'srisk of violence, according to whether theactivity is seen as acceptable by communitynorms. These findings underscore the com-plexity of these issues and the dangers inapplying knowledge gained from one site toanother without understanding of thebroader cultural context. 136 HOW DO WOMEN RESPOND TO ABUSE? Most abused women are not passive vic- tims, but use active strategies to maximizetheir safety and that of their children.Some women resist, others flee, and stillothers attempt to keep the peace by capit-ulating to their husband's demands. Whatmay seem to an observer to be lack ofresponse to living with violence may infact be a woman's strategic assessment ofVIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AS A HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT ISSUE26 Researching Violence Against Womenwhat it takes to survive and to protect her- self and her children. A woman's response to abuse is often limited by the options available to her.Women consistently cite similar reasons forremaining in abusive relationships: fear ofretribution, lack of other means of eco-nomic support, concern for the children,emotional dependence, lack of supportfrom family and friends, and an abidinghope that \"he will change.\" In some coun-tries, women say that the social unaccept-ability of being single or divorced poses anadditional barrier that keeps them fromleaving destructive marriages. 2 At the same time, denial and fear of social stigma often prevent women fromreaching out for help. In numerous sur-veys, for example, from 22 to almost 70percent of abused women say that untilthe interview they never told anyone abouttheir abuse. Those who reach out do soprimarily to family members and friends.Few have ever contacted the police. 1, 20Despite the obstacles, many women eventually do leave violent partners\u2014evenif after many years. In a study in Le\u00f3n,Nicaragua, for example, 70 percent ofabused women eventually left theirabusers. The median time that womenspent in a violent relationship was sixyears. Younger women were likely to leavesooner than older women. 137 Studies suggest a consistent set of factors that propel a woman to leave an abusiverelationship: The violence gets more severeand triggers a realization that her partner isnot going to change, or the violencebegins to take a toll on the children.Women also cite emotional and logisticalsupport from family or friends as pivotal intheir decision to leave. 2 Leaving an abusive relationship is a multi- stage process. The process often includesperiods of denial, self-blame, and endurancebefore women recognize the abuse as apattern and identify with other women inthe same situation, thereby beginning toCHAPTER ONE FIGURE 1.6.

Most women leave and return several times before they finallyleave once and for all. 138Leaving does not necessarily guarantee a woman's safety,however, because violence may continueeven after a woman leaves. In fact, awoman's risk of being murdered by herabuser is often greatest immediately afterseparation. 139 CHALLENGES FOR INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH ON GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE Nearly 30 years of groundbreaking research in the field of gender-based vio-lence has greatly expanded internationalawareness of the dimensions and dynamicsof violence. However, there are still manygaps in our current state of knowledge.Researchers interested in gender-based vio-lence from a public health perspective facea number of important challenges. The scarcity of population-baseddata limits our understanding ofhow violence affects differentgroups of women. Until very recently, the majority of research was been car-ried out with nonrepresentative samplesof women, often those who haveattended shelters or other services forvictims. Although these studies are use-ful for understanding the dynamics ofabuse, they do not tell us how manywomen overall are affected, nor provideinformation about individuals who donot seek services. According to mostestimates, these women greatly outnum-ber those who seek help. Most international prevalence figureson violence are not comparable. This is due mainly to inconsistencies in theway that violence is conceptualized andmeasured. Researchers need to developconsensus around violence researchmethods that allow us to make mean-ingful comparisons between studies.Methodological consistency refers notonly to defining violence using similarcriteria, but also the use of measures tominimize underreporting of violence,such as ensuring privacy during theinterview and providing interviewerswith special training on violence. 139 Research on violence may putwomen at risk. Many researchers point out that research on violence involves anumber of inherent risks to both respon-dents and interviewers. 140The World Health Organization has developed a setof guidelines to minimize the risk ofharm to researchers and participants. 141 However, these guidelines are just nowbeing incorporated more widely intointernational research practice. More public health research isneeded to understand how violenceaffects the health of women andchildren in different settings. Studies of battered women consistently demon-strate the negative impact of abuse onwomen's psychological status and repro-ductive health, and emerging epidemio-logical studies indicate that violencetowards mothers may even affect infantbirth weight and survival. However,more research is needed to determinewhat proportion of women's overallmental and physical health problems isassociated with violence and to investi-gate the mechanisms through whichviolence affects health. More cross-cultural research isneeded to reveal how societal normsand institutions promote or discour-age violent behavior. Most researchers agree that cultural norms can greatlyaffect the extent and characteristics ofVIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AS A HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT ISSUE28 Researching Violence Against Womenviolence, as well as the way that spe- cific acts are interpreted in differentsocieties. Nonetheless, there have beenfew systematic attempts to comparethese issues in different settings. Mosttheories about the dynamics of abusehave been based on the experiences ofUS and European women, and it isunclear how relevant these are towomen from other cultures. Research evaluating differentapproaches to violence prevention isscarce. Although there has been an enormous increase in both communityand clinic-based programs to preventviolence and to support abused womenand girls, few programs have been sys-tematically documented or evaluated.For example, many activists and profes-sional associations in the United Statescurrently encourage health providers toask each woman at every visit whethershe has been abused. However, there islittle information about what happens towomen after disclosing violence, orwhether asking women is an effectivetool for enhancing women's safety. Inparticular, we need to develop criteriafor assessing whether practices that areeffective in one setting are likely to berelevant or feasible in another, very dif-ferent setting. The greatest challenge facing researchers in the field of violence is tolearn from past mistakes, to identify \"bestpractices,\" and to find out what makesthem successful so that we can channelresources and efforts where they are mostlikely to make a difference.1.
