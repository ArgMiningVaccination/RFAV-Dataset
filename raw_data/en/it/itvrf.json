A qualitative study using the patient perspective Lisanne M. A. Janssen1,2, Kim van den Akker3, Mohamed A. Boussihmad3 and Esther de Vries1,4* Abstract Background: Patients with predominantly (primary) antibody deficiencies (PADs) commonly develop recurrent respiratory infections which can lead to bronchiectasis, long-term morbidity and increased mortality. Recognizing symptoms and making a diagnosis is vital to enable timely treatment. Studies on disease presentation have mainly been conducted using medical files rather than direct contact with PAD patients. Our study aims to analyze how patients appraised their symptoms and which factors were involved in a decision to seek medical care. Methods: 14 PAD-patients (11 women; median 44, range 16-68 years) were analyzed using semi-structured inter - views until saturation of key emergent themes was achieved. Results: Being always ill featured in all participant stories. Often from childhood onwards periods of illness were felt to be too numerous, too bad, too long-lasting, or antibiotics were always needed to get better. Recurrent or persistent respiratory infections were the main triggers for patients to seek care. All participants developed an extreme fatigue, described as a feeling of physical and mental exhaustion and thus an extreme burden on daily life that was not solved by taking rest. Despite this, participants tended to normalize their symptoms and carry on with usual activities. Non-immunologists, as well as patients, misattributed the presenting signs and symptoms to common, self-limiting illnesses or other 'innocent' explanations. Participants in a way understood the long diagnostic delay. They know that the disease is rare and that doctors have to cover a broad medical area. But they were more critical about the way the doctors communicate with them. They feel that doctors often don't listen very well to their patients. The participants' symptoms as well as the interpretation of these symptoms by their social environment and doctors had a major emo - tional impact on the participants and a negative influence on their future perspectives. Conclusions: To timely identify PAD, 'pattern recognition' should not only focus on the medical 'red flags' , but also on less differentiating symptoms, such as 'being always ill' and 'worn out' and the way patients cope with these problems. And, most important, making time to really listen to the patient remains the key.

However, since there are around 8000 rare dis - eases, some 30 million people in both Europe and in Open Access *Correspondence: e.devries@tilburguniversity.edu 1 Department of Tranzo, TSB, Tilburg University, PO Box 90153, 5000 LE Tilburg, The Netherlands Full list of author information is available at the end of the articlePage 2 of 18 Janssen et al. Orphanet J Rare Dis (2021) 16:289 the USA suffer from a rare disease. This is an important problem for the patients as well as for the society they live in because rare diseases are often diagnosed late, especially when they share symptoms with common dis - eases, leading to delayed and inadequate treatment. As a consequence, these patients suffer a decreased life quality as well as a decreased potential for societal participation (school, work) [1, 2]. Predominantly (primary) antibody deficiencies (PADs) are a typical example of such difficult-to-recognize rare diseases [3]. Hypogammaglobulinemias are by far the most common forms of PAD, comprising nearly half of all primary immunodeficiency (PID) diagnoses [4-6]. Affected persons commonly develop recurrent otitis media, sinusitis, and pneumonia. Recurrent pneumonias can lead to bronchiectasis, which serves as a negative factor for long-term morbidity and mortality. Since the introduction of immunoglobulin replacement therapy, there have been dramatic improvements in survival [7, 8]. Recognizing symptoms and making a diagnosis is there - fore vital to enable timely treatment. Although PADs are the most common primary immu - nodeficiencies (PIDs) in humans, they are still rare with a prevalence of approximately 1:25,000 to 1:110,000, depending on the type of PAD [3]. These patients often go unrecognized, because the general public as well as most healthcare professionals, who are not specialized in immunodeficiency, do not consider PAD in patients with recurrent \"normal\" infections. Because of the variability of presenting clinical manifestations, patients visit vari - ous physicians of different specialties in search of a diag - nosis, which increases the risk of missing the overarching clinical pattern and thereby overlooking the underlying hypogammaglobulinemia [9]. Timely diagnosis and treat - ment will likely result in improved clinical and quality-of- life outcomes for patients with PAD, higher participation in society (school, work) and lower healthcare costs [10- 15]. Reducing diagnostic delay is therefore crucial. Studies on disease presentation have mainly been con - ducted using medical files rather than direct contact with PAD patients. We aimed to explore the presenting pattern of PAD from the perspective of patients and to identify factors that affect a correct and timely diagno - sis, by exploring the period leading to the PAD diagnosis through narrative patient interviews. Materials and methods Design and setting Patient experiences regarding their journey to receiving a diagnosis and adequate clinical care are best understood via an in-depth qualitative approach. Through individual semi-structured interviews with patients who had a diag - nosis of PAD, new insights derived from their perspective were sought. Their experiences and reasoning regarding complaints and the diagnostic delay they suffered were explored. New interviews were conducted until satu - ration of key emergent themes was achieved, meaning additional interviews were no longer adding new themes to the data set. Methods and results are reported accord - ing to the COREQ checklist [16]. Population Participants were recruited by an email sent by the Dutch patient organization for primary immunodefi - ciency diseases to all their members ('Stichting voor Afweerstoornissen' , SAS). The email invited the members to participate in an interview of about one hour at a place of their choice and stated that it would be audiotaped. All participants provided written and audio informed consent. The interviews were primarily with study par - ticipants but the contribution of a relative, if present, was also welcomed. Data collection The interviews were performed in October and Novem - ber 2016 at the patients' homes. The interviews were conducted by a master student in the last year of medi - cal education (KvA). Questions were semi-structured, designed to address those items which the interviewer wished to raise, and also allowing participants the free - dom to express their own perspective and to offer an opportunity for serendipitous findings. The questions (overview in Additional file 1) were based on the litera - ture related to clinical characteristics of primary anti - body deficiency [9, 17-19] and to psychosocial theories relating to symptom appraisal and care-seeking [20]. All interviews were reviewed and discussed with an experi - enced medical immunologist with expertise in qualitative methods (EdV). Data analysis All interviews were audiotaped and literally transcribed (KvA and MAB), and analyzed using the framework method [21]. Data were anonymized by removing any information that could identify the patient. Transcripts were read and re-read to ensure familiarization, and inde - pendently coded (MAB and LJ). The coding was reviewed by a third coder (EdV), to ensure that the type and range of codes applied was appropriate and consistent. The coding lists were used to develop a framework organ - ized into categories. In total, we identified 154 codes we divided into 11 categories, which were organized in 3 themes (Additional file 2). The coding was finalized using the software package Atlas.ti Version 7.1.5 (Berlin, Ger - many), and the coded data were exported (MAB). This export was read, re-read and then summarized for each Page 3 of 18 Janssen et al. Orphanet J Rare Dis (2021) 16:289 of the 14 participants of the study. Each category was then interpreted using an analytical memo to explore emerging themes and concepts. Results In total, 14 participants were interviewed. Interviews lasted from 45 to 105 min. Eleven women and three men participated, median age 44 years, range 16-68; all participants were Dutch. Participant characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Three interviewees were accom - panied by a relative during the interview. The results are presented under subheadings reflecting the main steps in the diagnostic pathway, namely: presentation of PAD and participants' interpretation of symptoms, progression of symptoms and realization that something is really wrong, starting the patient journey, doctors' interpretation of symptoms, and triggers to diagnosis. Participants were also asked to reflect on care provision and on the emo - tional toll of the diagnostic process. Presentation of primary antibody deficiency and participants' interpretation of symptoms The presenting features of PAD described by partici - pants were diverse, intermittent and sometimes non-spe - cific, covering a broad range of behavioral and physical changes (Table 1). Being always ill featured in all partici - pant stories. It often occurred from childhood onwards and was considered to be a problem by participants and/ or their parents when periods of illness were felt to be too numerous, too bad, too long-lasting, or when antibiotics were always needed to get better. Then I got my penicillin course, then it was over within two days, but then the penicillin course was over again and two days later it started all over again. (Participant 4) Many participants thought recurrent infections to be normal for children, or in some cases due to atopic dis - ease. Seven adult participants just felt ill and did not have a particular explanation for why they were more often ill than others but assumed that the symptoms would prob - ably resolve with time. Participants tended to downplay and/or normalize their symptoms. When it started with asthma, I had two to four respiratory tract infections a year. That's not very strange, it is not what strikes you as abnormal if you have asthma. (Participant 9) I think everybody coughs sometimes with a little mucus, but then I don't feel very sick. Usually, it resolves with time. Eventually, when I was diagnosed with CVID, they did a Chest-CT. Then they saw the beginning damage that fits the clinical picture and lungs. They also said: 'how is that possible, you said you only had pneumonia once, but from looking at the scan it seems as if it really cannot have been just once' . (Participant 10) Fatigue was present both before and after the diagno - sis in many participants and was described as a feeling of physical and mental exhaustion and thus an extreme burden on daily life. Most participants recalled that they slept very well, but still remained tired. The decrease in energy level could result in the need for an afternoon nap. And really a lot of fatigue, I slept for three hours during the day and ten hours at night. I really slept thirteen to fifteen hours a day. Just to keep up. (Par - ticipant 1) I spoke about it with my sister recently. I always thought, everybody works the whole day, five days a week, but I actually can't do that. It would tire me so badly, it's not possible. (Participant 6) Participants described they thought they exerted them - selves too much, causing their symptoms themselves by working too hard, taking care of their whole family or by being too active socially. The degree of fatigue could be significant before the participant really labelled it as a problem. Eleven participants reported their fatigue was so severe it took away all their free time, because after a work/school day there was no energy left for social activities. Then I sleep the whole night, being just able to ful - fil the expectations set during the day. I don't have any free time left, because when I come home, I go to sleep, and then another day begins. (Participant 10) Participants had comorbidities, complications or mis - diagnoses, and tended to attribute their symptoms to these conditions. For example, a participant with iron deficiency anemia attributed her fatigue solely to this condition, and a participant with Graves' disease attrib - uted her fatigue solely to that. Whereas in both partici - pants these conditions could well be complications of their\u2014unrecognized\u2014PAD. Another participant with a misdiagnosis of asthma thought her fatigue was the result of needing more potent inhalers. In total, four par - ticipants (1, 7, 9 and 12) attributed their symptoms to asthma. At that time I got diagnosed with asthma, for which I had to use inhalers that just did not work. (Partici - pant 7) Participants carried on with their usual activities despite significant limiting symptoms. Just tired... I always went to work anyway, ...what Page 4 of 18 Janssen et al.

At one point it became less and less due to fatigue. That I just couldn't man - age to exercise for an hour at eight o'clock in the evening. Sometimes I had to force myself to do it, but then I just took an extra puff, so I could do it again. (Participant 1) Often, unusual and alarming signs for PID were not recognized as unusual medical conditions by the consult - ing doctors, for example: ITP , alopecia areata and recur - rent infections in participant 3; recurrent chicken pox in participants 8 and 9; excessive oral aphthous lesions in participant 10; recurrent meningitis in participant 5; recurrent otitis in adult patients repeatedly needing tympanostomy tubes in participants 1, 2 and 8; exces - sive weight loss in participants 1 and 4; salpingitis after swimming in participant 6, and impaired wound healing in participant 9. Progression of symptoms and realization that something is really wrong Typically, the symptomatology evolved over weeks to months, with non-specific early features such as recur - rent \"normal\" infections, fever, chronic cough and fatigue, mimicking those of common, self-limiting ill - nesses. Some participants described a triggering event (thyroid disease, pregnancy, weight loss or severe wound infection after caesarean section) as starting point for a sudden increase in infections. Symptoms often pro - gressed over time. Infections slowly became abnormally recurrent, severe and/or persistent. It starts with only periods of coughing and then at one point it's actually all the time. (Participant 3) Four participants (4, 6, 8 and 12) suffered from chronic rhinosinusitis and underwent sinus surgery. This resulted in only a short relief of complaints. In the sons of par - ticipant 8, multiple sinus surgeries were performed in addition to weekly nasal irrigation and polypectomy. The ENT specialist was alarmed by their voluminous medical file. But the ENT-specialist told us: 'you are right, at the whole ENT-department we have nobody with a file as large as those of your sons' . We came there for only three years. He said: 'those files are now already big - ger than the files of a fifty-year old' . (Participant 8) Nine participants (1, 3-6, 8, 9, 12 and 14) recalled their infections only resolved with antibiotic treatment. As soon as I got my antibiotics intravenously in the hospital, I recovered. So everyone was like, you're fine again, you can go home. So yeah, it was okay for a while, only after four episodes of six days, so four weeks of illness, they wanted to conduct further research. (Participant 1) Participants often recalled a pattern in the complaints. In participants 1 and 12 the upper respiratory tract infec - tion (otitis, pharyngitis and/or sinusitis) always pro - gressed to a lower respiratory tract infection. It progressed from an infection of the sinuses, to the ears and then to the throat and airways. (Partici - pant 1) It often began with infections: lungs, sinus, yes very often my sinuses, and then it spread to my lungs and throat at the same time. (Participant 12) Four participants (1, 2, 3 and 8) repeatedly developed otitis\u2014often after swimming\u2014in adulthood and were treated with tympanostomy tubes. Well, I mean, everybody might have an ear infec - tion once a while, but every time I had it, it lasted a month. That I really had so much pain for a month, that you just wanted to hit your head against the wall, because you don't know what to do about the pain anymore. Then the doctor told me: 'yes, but antibiotics do not help against an ear infection, so I do not really want to give that' . Then it lasted just really long every time, but the GP did not think: 'oh, that is weird' . (Participant 3) Participants 7 and 9 realized they differed from other people when comparing the duration of recovery. I often had a cold. Another person had it for two days and if I had it was for two months. (Participant 7) I played handball and that is not a 'sweet' sport, to be fair, my wounds recovered badly... That was very weird, the wound always got infected or it took four weeks to heal. With the other kids in my environ - ment the wounds always recovered within a week or two. For me never, it always took longer. (Participant 9) Participant 6 recalled her infections to start rapidly and become severe in a short time. It could be that one moment I thought: 'I'm going to make it' , but then an hour later I would be so ill that I didn't make it. (Participant 6) The burden of infections was perceived to be suscep - tible to change. Participants pointed out that they expe - rienced positive as well as negative fluctuations in the Page 7 of 18 Janssen et al. Orphanet J Rare Dis (2021) 16:289 burden of infections due to weather conditions: four patients reported being sick throughout the year (1, 2, 4, 8); three patients were almost never ill during the sum - mer (5, 6, 9). All except two participants were working age and ini - tially thought that their symptoms were a normal part of their busy lifestyle and job, but once recognized as abnor - mal by others (employers, colleagues) they sought help. Family members often witnessed participants struggling with symptoms and encouraged them to seek help. Five participants (1, 2, 4, 5 and 7) often recalled that their social environment thought they were sicker than they admitted themselves. I just went to my job, I have often been sent home by my boss. (Participant 1) That's also what my colleagues said, how often I was at the office with a sinusitis or otitis, that everybody was like: 'you shouldn't do that, you're ill' . Yes, I am very often ill, this isn't even that bad. (Participant 1) Most participants were quick to seek medical advice from their GP as soon as they realized something was really wrong. However, it took most participants a long time to realize this; they continued to hope that the symptoms would simply disappear. Starting the patient journey The factors which triggered the seeking of care were various. One patient sought help because of the psycho - logical stress she suffered due to the many unexplained symptoms. Recurrent or persistent infectious episodes like recurrent otitis, sinusitis, or pneumonia or endless coughing, were the main triggers for patients to seek care. Often the fatigue and strain of coping in life while hindered by all the symptoms were the reason to go\u2014 again\u2014to the GP . Combinations of problems could also be the final push. Participants reported cumulative barriers that led to delays to seek help. Their interpretation of the initial signs and symptoms of the disease influenced whether they sought help. Participants either got used to their symptoms or hoped their symptoms would pass by. At a certain point you raise the bar and think by yourself: 'I am not using medicines or visit the doctor again' . You think: 'I just keep taking pills' . Then you raise the bar again and wait and see for another day. (Participant 1) Well, in the beginning you go to the doctor... But when you are always ill, you just don't go to the doc - tor anymore. (Participant 3) Others no longer sought help because the health - care professional only treated symptoms instead of searching for the cause. Before the CVID diagnosis was made in patient 8, he underwent recurrent sinus surgeries resulting in only short relief of the (chronic) sinusitis. These experiences kept him from seeking help after a while. Another theme that emerged was feeling delegitimized. This led them to feel distressed by the way they were treated, by not being believed or listened to and not being able to cope with symptoms. Participants reported the feeling that both healthcare professionals and others did not see them as having a legitimate illness and that the credibility of their symp - toms was frequently questioned. Patient 3 reported that her symptoms were for a long time attributed to an unacknowledged mental health condition and which made her feel that the symptoms were not due to an underlying pathology. I went to the doctor, who thought: 'I think it's not that bad how often you are sick' . So then she said: 'I think it is how you experience it, that it is in your head, but not real' . So then she initially referred me to a psychologist. (Participant 3) Over time, having healthcare professionals ques - tioning their credibility made participants question the legitimacy of their symptoms too. Participants described feeling guilty for wasting healthcare pro - fessionals' time, or downgrading their symptoms by normalization, waiting till another infectious episode passed by. Once patients began to seek a diagnosis, delays also occurred within the healthcare system. Clinicians were not often familiar with PID and were challenged by the complexity and rarity of the disease. This impacted their ability to make a differential diagnosis. Sometimes healthcare professionals seemed to have difficulties in abandoning an initial diagnosis. Participant 6 was treated for bacterial pneumonia, but her general state of health worsened with loss of condition, leading to the inability to climb the stairs. She suggested herself to screen for possible PID because of recurrent Hemophilus Influen - zae pneumonia despite adequate antibiotic treatment, after which CVID was discovered. In addition to physi - cian inflexibility, this case reveals the importance of com - munication concerning symptoms from everyday life as well as medical symptoms. Six participants (1, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 14) recalled their social environment forming a bar - rier in seeking help. The social environment of these par - ticipants downplayed the participants' complaints. They attributed the symptoms to stress/a busy life or told the participants it would resolve with time. 'It is probably because of the stress' , people say that a lot too. (Participant 10)Page 8 of 18 Janssen et al. Orphanet J Rare Dis (2021) 16:289 Doctors' interpretation of symptoms Many participants recalled initially being offered an incorrect explanation for their symptoms (Table 2). Most doctors initially attributed the participant's symptoms to minor, viral illnesses, asthma, anatomical ENT-problems or to other 'innocent' explanations such as ascribing joint pains to sporting activities, episodic dyspnea to stress- induced hyperventilation, feeling worn out to the combi - nation of working too hard and taking care of a newborn child, erythema nodosum to mosquito bumps and exer - cise intolerance to menopause. In one participant XLA, despite a positive family history, was only discovered years after he already had several episodes of meningi - tis. In one participant, her symptoms were put down to being pregnant. Participants were referred to several different special - ists (Table 2), often only after strongly insisting on it. In two participants, their symptom attribution to psycho - logical factors, led to multiple visits to a psychiatrist. I did not have severe infections, but I couldn't do anything anymore. Well, what happens then: 'psy - chic, menopause, divorce' . I started believing that after a while. Then I went to a psychiatrist. I went there for years. (Participant 14) Two participants (2 and 8) appeared to have one or more decreased immunoglobulin isotypes years before the final diagnosis, but this was not noticed by the doc - tor or the doctor did not know what this meant and ignored the results. This reflects the problem that most non-immunologists have minimal or no knowledge of PID. Even treatment failure\u2014implying an unusual dis - ease course\u2014did not alarm an ENT specialist to think of potential PID. I had meningitis in 2011 and then I recovered and they thought it went better, but then I became sick again. Then I went to the ENT-doctor... They cleaned my sinuses. That was February 2012. Then I became sick again, they didn't understand it anymore. Then I ended up in the hospital again in April. (Partici - pant 4) Triggers to diagnosis In none of the participants, the symptoms were attrib - uted to potential PID by the GP , except for one partici - pant, in whom his children were already diagnosed with PID. Only two participants were referred directly to an immunologist, where referral immediately led to a cor - rect diagnosis. Two participants were diagnosed through a positive family history , although one of them had already suffered a meningitis eight times (which had not triggered the potential diagnosis). In two participants (2 and 11) PID was incidentally discovered while screening for celiac disease (low serum IgA). Multidisciplinary consultations can support the diag - nostic process. In participant 10, who had splenomegaly, erythema nodosum and pancytopenia, one of the special - ists recognized the symptom pattern and suggested to test for immunoglobulins. Eventually the internist told me: 'I actually don't know what you have, I think it's sarcoidosis, but your blood doesn't show that' ... 'I'm going to discuss you one more time in a multidisciplinary consultation, if we don't find it then, then we really don't know' . In that consultation I think one smartass said: 'test for antibodies' . (Participant 10) Alarm symptoms can trigger the diagnosis. For exam - ple, healthcare professionals were triggered to conduct additional investigations when participant 1 and 4 suf - fered from excessive weight loss. Sometimes PID was diagnosed while searching for another diagnosis. Partici - pant 1 suffered from weight loss, night sweats and sple - nomegaly and was screened for leukemia or lymphoma. Instead, she was found to have CVID. Participant 3 suf - fered from idiopathic thrombocytopenia and alopecia and was screened for some form of autoimmune disease. Her IgG was found to be decreased instead of elevated; she was diagnosed with CVID. They started searching for an autoimmune disease and they determined the total serum IgG level. They expected that to be super high, because they thought of lupus or something like that. But it was very low at that time. (Participant 3) Abnormal symptom patterns can trigger the healthcare professional to conduct further investigations. In par - ticipant 9 the ENT specialist noticed inflammation on the inside of the nose, usually indicating allergic rhinitis. However, allergy tests were negative and antihistamines, nasal corticosteroids and turbinate reduction did not alleviate her symptoms. This triggered the ENT specialist to refer to an immunologist. When I entered, he inspected my nose and said: 'this is what an allergic nose looks like' . I said to him: 'you can say that, but nobody can prove that I have aller - gies' . Then they cut it out and cleaned it, but I kept having a lot of complaints. Then he started to look further.

Orphanet J Rare Dis (2021) 16:289 and failure to thrive since birth and was diagnosed with hypogammaglobulinemia at the age of 5 (during fol - low-up a diagnosis of unclassified primary antibody deficiency was made). The sons of participant 8 were diagnosed with CVID by their pediatrician, triggered by recurrent need for tympanoplasty and sinus surgery. While their father had severe and recurrent infections for several years, he was only diagnosed with CVID after this was discovered in his two children. Participant 9 and 14 played a direct role in obtain - ing their PID diagnosis by searching for a cause of their symptoms on the internet and diagnosing a potential PID by themselves . Participants in a way understand the long diagnostic delay. They know the disease is rare and a GP has to cover a broad medical area. They realize the diagnostic delay is due to not knowing, instead of not wanting to know. It is of course so rare. There are so many things that doctors should be aware of that I understand that it has not been directly diagnosed. (Patient 1) I don't blame her, because you can't know every - thing, but I thought: 'Gosh, I felt really miserable then' . (Patient 2) But participants are more critical about the way the doctors communicate with them. They feel that doctors often don't listen very well to their patients. They want the doctor to acknowledge they don't know what is the matter and to refer the participant to a specialist, and to observe existing guidelines. The stupid thing is that there is a pulmonology guideline for recurrent airway infections. According to the protocol he had to make a referral. He didn't know that but then at least be honest enough to say that you don't know. (Participant 9) Emotional toll of the diagnostic delay During the interviews it became increasingly clear that the participants' symptoms as well as the interpretation of these symptoms by their social environment and doc - tors had a major emotional impact . Finally knowing they have probably had PAD for years without being diag - nosed also negatively impacted their lives. Participants recalled feeling a lack of understanding by their social environment, who often questioned or downgraded their complaints. Well I didn't think it was hard to accept the fatigue and just go to bed. It was often more the incom - prehension of others, like: 'Gosh, already? . (Participant 1) Then they think: 'there she comes again, she is sick again' . (Participant 4) Eight participants stated that their symptoms had a negative influence on their future perspectives. Strug - gling with their untreated symptoms they made different choices in their career paths or were hampered in getting promoted. It always got in the way of everything. Because he was really good at his job, he would be promoted, but then he was ill again. So another person got the job. That was always very depressing. (Wife of par - ticipant 8) In others, symptoms prevented them from doing what made them happy, because they felt themselves to be a burden for their social environment. Concerts, yes I love that. I didn't do that in a long time, because it is the worst annoyance of every orchestra member when somebody is coughing in the hall. (Participant 6) I haven't, for example, been on vacation for years. I very often felt that I was a burden for other people. When we went on vacation and I was sick again, that's not what you want. (Participant 6) Many participants reported that fatigue negatively influenced multiple aspects of their social network. They often could not participate in social activities due to fatigue or had to deal with the consequences of taking part in social activities by sleeping all next day. This led to social isolation and feelings of loneliness. Every time they say: 'we can't come' . At seven o'clock they lie in bed and their friends go out. So then you won't be asked anymore. (Mother of the sons of par - ticipant 8, who also have CVID) You always have to disappoint people because you have to drop out last-minute. That's why a lot of CVID patients get isolated, because at some point, you don't want to disappoint people anymore. (par - ticipant 8) The daily limitations due to the PAD-related com - plaints were a heavy mental burden for many partici - pants. Eight patients mentioned that they had, to some degree, lost the joy in life. Of course when being younger I really felt alone, sometimes even depressed. (Participant 12) Discussion This study reveals presenting patterns that can help to identify those patients who are 'always ill' and 'worn out' with PAD. This is important, because recurrent Page 16 of 18 Janssen et al. Orphanet J Rare Dis (2021) 16:289 respiratory infections and fatigue are much more preva - lent without concomitant PAD [22]. Participants in this study tended to normalize their symptoms and carry on with usual activities. Coping strategies of the extreme fatigue that PAD patients develop therefore differ from those with chronic fatigue syndrome, because patients with chronic fatigue syndrome often use escape/avoid - ance strategies [23]. Also, PAD patients reported to sleep well, whereas chronic fatigue patients generally report more difficulty falling asleep and interrupted sleep [24]. In addition to these non-medical aspects, partici - pants recalled many medical aspects that could trigger suspicion for potential PAD: infections being unusu - ally frequent and/or severe, not clearly season-bound, requiring antibiotics to clear. Many participants under - went repeated sinus surgery, tympanoplasty and/or pol - ypectomy, at best only temporarily resulting in relieve of symptoms. These aspects are in fact already known, but their relevance is often missed in everyday practice. Therefore, to timely identify PAD, 'pattern recognition' should not only focus on the medical 'red flags' , but also on less differentiating symptoms, such as 'being always ill' and 'worn out' and the way patients cope with these problems. And, most important, making time to really listen to the patient remains the key. A wide range of factors affected the speed and accuracy of diagnosing PAD. First and foremost, both patients and non-immunologist healthcare professionals tended to persist in misattributing the presenting signs and symp - toms to common, self-limiting illnesses or other 'inno - cent' explanations. Both patients and non-immunologist healthcare professionals initially attributed \"being always ill\" and \"feeling worn out\" to or 'sleep - ing too little' , or to medical conditions such as nasal pol - yps, nasal septum deviation, asthma or chronic rhinitis. The prevalence of most presenting symptoms of PAD in the general population is high. A population preva - lence of 11% is for instance reported for sinusitis, and in a symptom prevalence study 28% of patients expe - rienced coughing in the previous 7 days, and 11% had experienced fatigue [25, 26]. This can explain why 'nor - malizing' prevalent symptoms such as fatigue or recur - rent infections is so widespread. The normalization of symptoms and symptom misattribution to less serious or pre-existing conditions have been reported to account for appraisal delays in various cancers, particularly when the early symptoms were commonly occurring non-spe - cific symptoms (e.g., fatigue) [27, 28]. Remarkably, also the appraisal of less common and more alarming signs, such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), exces - sive oral and recurrent otitis repeatedly needing tympanostomy tubes in an adult, did not alert both patients and health care professionals to potential underlying disease. Participants were referred to multiple physicians before a diagnosis was made, intensifying the time of worrying and wonder - ing. These findings highlight an important knowledge gap among general practitioners and non-immunologist hos - pital doctors regarding the clinical presentation of PAD. Education campaigns that address this issue could reduce the time between the onset of symptoms and treatment. In addition, multidisciplinary consultations (MDC's) with a number of specialists working together can sup - port the diagnostic process for patients presenting with non-specific symptoms who have visited multiple physi - cians [29]. It would be interesting to explore health care professionals' views about PAD and about recognizing rare disease. This would help to reveal what health care professionals need to be able to use this knowledge in their own practice. A second major theme was an increasing reluctance to seek care, albeit in some participants more than others. Reasons for this were diverse. They included getting so used to symptoms that they were considered to be 'nor - mal' , the feeling of not being taken seriously, and oppos - ing 'just being treated for symptoms anyway' instead of being investigated for their cause. The quality of the doctor-patient relationship had a significant impact on the process of obtaining a correct diagnosis. A GP's prior view of a patient as being 'thin-skinned' or 'a wor - rier' could influence how seriously they investigated their complaints. These two themes highlight the full range of factors potentially influencing a timely diagnosis, rather than the presenting medical features of the underlying disease alone. All this led to a significant mental burden for the par - ticipants. The period prior to the diagnosis was particu - larly challenging, with people feeling dismissed by health care professionals, in spite of their distress. The lack of a definitive diagnosis not only left them open to self-doubt, but also to the negative judgements of others including family, friends and employers. This concept is not unique to PAD as other conditions which are challenging to diagnose, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), elicit similar 'journeys' . In patients with SLE, the percep - tion of being dismissed and of the lacking of empathy from a health care professional has been described as leading to feelings of emotional neglect [30]. Participants in this study reported relief when they found a name for their symptoms after they had spent years fighting searching for that. Although the PAD diagnosis helped them by legitimizing their symptoms, validating their suffering and improving their emotional status by being believed and listened to, they still had to cope with the burden of their disease and its treatment for the rest of their lives. While it has already been shown that PAD can Page 17 of 18 Janssen et al. Orphanet J Rare Dis (2021) 16:289 result in a considerable disease burden [14, 31], our qual - itative study adds the perspective of the patients them - selves. Participants found the impact of being 'always ill' and 'worn out' on their daily functioning to be a key fac - tor determining their emotional well-being. They expe - rienced serious limitations in their social functioning, causing social isolation and feelings of loneliness. This is in line with results from a previous study on COPD- related fatigue, which stated that fatigue influences physical, cognitive, and psychological functioning [32]. Another study related fatigue to perceived health and concluded higher fatigue correlated to a lower perceived health [33]. Other pathologies, such as different types of cancer, showed fatigue being a driver in the impact of quality of life in patients [34-36]. These results highlight the need for more attention to the potential patient bur - den in the diagnostic delay of PADs. Limitations Because of the relatively small sample, whilst the size of the sample is in keeping with the in-depth nature of qual - itative research, this explorative study should perhaps be validated by future studies. The sample included patients who had been diagnosed some years previously. This may have contributed to recall bias. Nevertheless, the study produced a rich amount of material and the findings pro - vide insight into areas of potential future research. Conclusions This study revealed non-medical patterns that can help to recognize patients with potential PAD. With in-depth interviewing, it became clear that\u2014although fatigue can be one of their major complaints\u2014these patients are different from patients with chronic fatigue syndrome: patients with PAD tend to normalize their symptoms and carry on with usual activities. The difficulty experienced by clinicians, as well as patients, in recognizing unusual and alarming signs and attributing symptoms correctly, illustrates that non-immunologists have little knowledge of PAD. This is not surprising, since PAD is a rare disease. Although this underlines the importance of education programs, which should not only focus on the medical 'red flags' of PID, but also on coping strategies of more common, less differentiating symptoms, such as 'being always ill' and 'worn out' , this cannot be the final solution. It is impossible for non-experts to know about all > 8000 rare diseases. Hopefully, modern developments in auto - mated pattern recognition can be developed to offer 'red flags' in the electronic patient file that alert a physician to potential underlying problems. The results obtained in this study can support the design of predictive models in this regard.Abbreviations COREQ: consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research; COPD: organization for immunodeficiency).
