It includes a highly developed immune response that serves as a barrier against pathogenic infection s. Wound healing is a dynamic process underpinned by numerous cellular activities, including homeostasis , inflammation, proliferation , and remodel- ing, that require proper harmonious integration to effectively repair the damaged tissue . Following cutaneous damage, microorganism s can quickly enter the tissues beneath the skin , which can result in chronic wounds and fatal infections. Natural phytomedicine s that possess considerable pharma- cological properties ha ve been widely and effectively employed forwound treatment and infectio n prevention . Since ancient times, phytotherapy has been able to efficiently treat cutaneous wounds, reduce the onset of infections, and minimize the usage of antibiotics that cause critical antibiotic resistance. There are a remarkable number of wound -healing botanicals that have been widely used in the Northern and Inula . This review addresses the most often used medicinal plants from the Northern Hemisphere that facilitate the treatment of wounds , and also suggests viable natural alternat ives that can be used in the field of wound care. Keywords: wounds ; wound healing ; bioactive components ; medicinal plants 1. Introduction: The entire body 's surface is covered by the intricate organ known as skin. It acts as both a physical shield and a barrier between the body and the outside environment , pre- venting the loss of water and electrolytes, limiting chemical penetration, and guarding against pathogenic microbes [1]. In developed nations, wounds end up costing millions of dollars each year as they are a major public health concern due to the microbiological complications they cause , such as local or apparent infection, poor healing , and the devel- opment of multi -resistant bacteria [2].Traumatic wounds occur particularly in de- mographics of people at the two opposite ends of the age spectrum , namely infants and the elderly [3].As the population ages, chronic lower limb wounds place a greate r burden on healthcare services [4].Acute wounds tend not to disrupt the long -lasting restoration of the anatomical and functional integrity of the skin , whereas chronic wounds can cause the healing process to fail in an arranged manner [5].The wound healing process Therapeutic Wound Healing Bioactivities of Various Medicinal Plants.

Life 2023 , 13, 317 2 of 22 the interconnected movement s of numerous cell types with different functions during the stages of h omeostasis, inflammation, proliferation, re -epithelialization , and remodeling , as is shown in Figure 1 . Figure 1. The four main ph ases of the wound healing process phase , damaged blood vessels rapidly contract after injury, and a blood clot forms to stop exsanguination caused by vascular dam age; platelets are then triggered when they come into contact with the vascular sub -endothelial matrix, homeostasi s, and coagulation [7,8]. Platelets are packed with cytokines and growth fac- including (i) insulin -like, (ii) latelet -derived , (iii) transforming , and (iv) epidermal growth factors. These chemicals activate and draw neutrophils, which later attract macro- phages, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts, acting as repair agents in the w ound healing cascade [9]. Next is the inflammatory phase , which starts with the early inflammatory response that begins during the late phase of coagulation and ends shortly there after. This phase triggers neutrophil aggregation in the wound area, where their primary function is to operate as wound cleaners. Various chemo -attractive chemicals are secreted by bacteria and platelet products within 24 to 36 h after injury ; these draw neutrophils to the wound area in order to remove the bacteria via pha gocytosis and in so doing prevent infection. Once all contaminating microorganisms have been eradicated, neutrophils are eliminated by apoptosis ; after 48-72 h, wound macrophages continue the phagocytosis process. Mac- rophages have a longer lifespan than ne utrophils and operate as essential regulatory cells, supplying an ample reservoir of potent tissue growth factors, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells . Thus, the removal of dead tissue and foreign bodies by neutrophils and macro- phages result s in the product ion of growth factors, cytokines, proteases, reactive oxygen species is rebuilt by keratinocytes and fibroblasts , which are crucial to the development of the granulation tissue that closes the wound and serves as a structural platform for c ell adhe- sion, migration, growth , and differentiation as the wound moves toward the completion of repair [11]. The primary cell type involved in remodeling the wound 's ECM is fibro- blasts that create mature collagen fibrils [ 12].There are several impediments to the wound Life 2023 , 13, 317 3 of 22 healing process , including forei gn bodies bringing the possibility of infection , ischemia, edema or elevated pressure [13]. Thus, t o encourage wound healing and prevent addi- tional problems, appropriate diagnosis and treatment are crucial [ 14]. One of the fundamental steps in wound treatment is preserving a clean wound bed . If done correctly, wound washing can lessen the bioburden and postpone the formation of bio films. Although antiseptic solutions are used to clean wounds in order to avoid in- fection, it is not generally known whether antiseptic solutions such as irrigation liquids speed up the healing process [15]. An i mproper healing procedure \u2014which can result in significant harm, including skin loss and the start of an infection, typically in the case of chronic wounds \u2014is the most frequent and unavoidable barrier to wound healing [16]. Herbal medicine s (HM) , which are known as c omplementary and alternati ve medi- cines, have been used over the decades to treat medical ailments and promote wellness through their bioactive ingredients [17]. Over time, humans have discovered which plant species are more effective as treatments for specific illnesses. The use of herbal medicine is a standard practice in t raditional Chinese Medicine, Ayu rveda, Unani, Russian herbal- ism, and other medical systems to apply botanicals topically to treat wounds a nd other dermatologic al problems (Table 1) . Moreover , the biological functions of botanicals ' sec- ondary metabolites are what give rise to their pharmacological effects [ 18]. Table 1. Dermatological problems treated by various traditional herbal medicines. Medical System Dermatological Conditions Reference Chinese Diabetic foot ulcers and international organizations have included a o ne-health strategy in their action plans to deal with antibiotic resistance , where improvements in antimicrobial usage policies/ regulations, infection control, sanitation and alternatives to antimicrobials are all necessary measures [ 23]. An increased likeliho od of unsuccessful treatment and recurrent infections is linked to persistent antimicrobial resistance. As a result, they play a significant role in rising mortality rates, which raise healthcare expenses. Antibiotic re- sistance is easily detectable using c ommon microbiological tests, and the harm it poses has long been understood. Antibiotic persistence is a phenomenon where bacteria survive antibiotic exposure despite being completely sensitive. Unlike antibiotic resistance, anti- biotic persistence is hard to measure and is sometimes overlooked, which could result in treatment failure [ 24]. Wounds have beco me a category in the National Institutes of Health's Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tool \u2014this is owing to rising health care ex- penses, an ag eing population, increasing awareness of infection hazards (including bio- films ) that are challenging to treat, and the ongoing danger of diabetes and obesity world- wide. Moreover , by 2024 the market for wound care products is anticipated to grow eco- nomically to around $15-22 billion annually [25]. The implementation of measures de- signed to lessen the development of antibiotic resistance and the dissemination of resistant bacteria must be enforced. Thus , over the years , plant -based medications have been used to treat a variety of medical disorders [26]and diverse skin diseases such as atopic derma- , and psoriasis [27]. There are sequential steps for any drug 's disco very, development , and approval [28]. Many laboratories throughout the world are concerned about the screening and testing of extracts against various pharmacological targets in order to p rofit from the immense nat- ural chemical diversity [29].The current review aims to introduce the main and most ef- fective botanicals and herbal treatments and their modes of action intreating wounds. The purpose of this research is to provide dermatologists and scientists with the most effective natural substitutes for the wound care sector. Life 2023 , 13, 317 4 of 22 2. Plant Species and Their Potential Therapeutic Interests 2.1. Achilleamillefolium L. Numerous yarrow (Achillea ) spe cies have been used in ethnopharmacology for quite some time. A. millefolium is among the most frequently utilized natural plant species for treating wounds, bleeding, stomachaches, gastrointestinal disorders, colds, flu, and stom- ach issues [30]. The Greek hero Achilles is reported to have utilized this plant to monitor his blood flow and to cure his wounds during the Trojan War . Thus, the genus name may have been derived from his name , while the species name \"millefolium \" alludes to the del- icately split, feather -like leaves [30]. Since ancient times, several Achillea species have been utilized as traditional herbal medicines in numerous cultures. One of the most significant and commonly used medic- inal plants in the world is yar row, Achill ea millefolium L., which grows naturally through- out Europe, Asia, North Africa, and North America [31]. The flower y plant is indigenous to the Northern Hemisphere and has been employed in conventional medicine as an as- tringent, antiseptic, anti -inflammatory, and antispasmodic agent to speed up the recovery of burns, ulcers, cuts , and wounds [32]. The primary Achillea's antioxidant phytochemical components are presented in Fig- ure 2. The antioxidant and anti -inflammatory benefits of A. millefolium have been linked to its flavonoid concentration [33].The considerable tyrosinase inhibiting , antioxidant, and antibacterial activities of Achillea extracts make them intriguing candidates for use as ac- tive ingredients in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics that protect the ski n from the damaging effects of environmental stresse s [34].In cultured skin biopsies, the expression profiles of cytokeratin 10, transglutaminase -1, and filaggrin have improved, and the thickness of the epidermis has also grown after two months of in vivo administration of A. millefolium ex- tracts compared to placebo [35]. Figure 2. Bioactive also known as Aloe barbadensis , is a member of the Lilaceae family. The word aloe comes from the Arabic word \"alloeh,\" which m eans\"bitter.\" Aloevera is now used more frequently in the production of new food products due to its medicinal and func- tional qualities [37].Early Egyptians referred to Aloe vera as the \"plant of immortality \", and it has been used as a traditional medicine for more than 2000 years in Arab, Chinese, Life 2023 , 13, 317 5 of 22 Egyptian, Greek, Indi an, Japanese, and Korean societies to treat diseases including skin issues, constipation, external and internal ulcers, hyper lipidemia, and diabetes [38]. Aloe vera production has become a growing industry because of the plant's many claimed health benefits. It is used to make cosmetic products, laxative medications, and functional foods such as face and hand creams, foundation s, cleansers, lipsticks, lotions, shampoos and hair tonics, shaving preparations, bath products, and preparations for makeup and fragrances [ 39]. Aloe plants have been linked to a variety of biological activities, such as detoxi fica- tion, treating constipation, flushing out toxins and wastes from the body, and promoting digestion . Aloe plant bioactivities are due to its antibacterial and antimicrobial, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, -rheumatoid, and anti -arthritis activities [ 40]. Aloe vera consists of three layers, the outer leaf, green pulp , and aloe gel [41]. Aloe gel, flowers, and leaf skin have all demonstrated antioxidant activities [ 42]. Since ancient times, Aloe vera has been used to cure wounds [ 43]. Aloe vera has been used to treat chronic wounds such as pressure ulcers , as well as burn wounds, surgical wounds, cracked nipples, genital herpes, and psoriasis [44]. Aloe vera hydrogel has had a beneficial effect on swelling, angiogenesis, and wound contraction, result ing in a 29% reduction in overall healing time and complete wound closure in just 15 days [ 45]. Figure 3 shows the bioactive effects of Aloe vera on clinical trials obtained during specific time frames. Figure 3. effects of pharmacological bioactiv e components of Aloe vera on clinical trials [46]. 2.3. Curcum a longa Curcumin , a chemical substance that is bright yellow, comes from Curcuma longa L. (turmeric) plants of the Zingiberaceae family. Approximately 200 years ago, Harvard Col- lege laboratory scientists Vogel and Curcuma (turmeric) [47]. Traditional herbal has utilized turmeric as a treatment for dige stive problems, weight loss, and gastrointestinal and skin 48]. Tur- and bisdemethoxycurcumin, which are curcuminoids that have been shown to have anti -inflammatory, anti -cancer, and anti-aging properties [49]. A previous stud y showed that , following topical Curcumin treatment , the wounds of mice closed rapidly with well -formed granulation tissue that was predomina ntly Life 2023 , 13, 317 6 of 22 composed of deposited collagen and a regenerating epithelium. Furthermore , Curcumin treatment significantly reduced matrix metallopeptidase -9 and tumor necrosis factor al- pha and sped up the healing of wounds in mice via controlling the amounts of different cytokines [50].Several potential effects of Curcumin essential oils are illustrate d in Figure 4. Figure 4. Some active components of curcumin essential oils and their potential effects [51]. In hairless rats with skin injured by corticosteroids, a combination of Curcumin and ginger extract enhances wound healing and skin function simultaneously, lowering the development of non -healing wounds [52]. 2.4. Althaea officinalis Althaea officinalis L. (Malvaceae), often known as marshmallow, has a long history of use as a medicine to treat laryngopharyngeal mucosal irritation and its associated dry cough. The medicinal plant marshmallow ( Althaea officinalis ) has roots, leaves, and flowers that are frequently used in traditional medicine throughout the world [53].A. officinalis has a variety of substances which have been extracted, including starch, pectins, saccharose, mucilage, flavonoids, [54].In addition , Althaea officinalis is a medicinal herb used to treat lipemia, no se and oral cavity inflammation , and other conditions such as stomach ulcers and pl atelet aggregation. It has been proven that A. officinalis extract dis- play s significant antioxidant activity [55]. For many years, an extract from Althaea officinalis has been used to cure wounds and inflammations. The root 's capacity to hold water and its abundance of polysaccharides can boost the immune system [56]. Thetopical application of an A. officinalis extract on a rat exci sion wound model was studied , and the wound healing percentage was much higher in the extract -treated wounds compared to the control , as shown in Figure 5 . More- over, the A. officinalis hydroethanolic extract includes phytochemicals that can serve as antibiotics to kill gram -positive bacteria a nd can quicken the healing of wounds through other mechanisms [57]. Life 2023 , 13, 317 7 of 22 Figure 5. Efficiency of Althaea officinalis L. extract that significantly heals excision wounds on rats and inhibits gram positive bacteria compared to control group [57]. 2.5. Calendula officinalis Flower extracts from Calendula officinalis (pot marigold) have a long history in eth- nopharmacology. Traditional medicines for treating mild skin inflammation and promot- ing the healing of minor wounds include lipophilic and aqueous Calendula alcoholic ex- tracts [58]. C. officinalis extracts have been linked to several pharmacological actions, the most significant of which include anti -inflammatory, -edematous, oils, amino acids, and lipids make up the majority of the chemical composition of C. officinalis [59].Other pharmacological proper- ties of C. off icinalis include antimicrobial, antiviral , effective treatment for breast cancer, antioxidant and anti -immunomodulatory activity, treatment of acne, potent anti -gastric ulcer activity , wound healing properties, treatment of bacterial infections in animals, and hepatoprotective and renoprotective ac tivity [60]. Calendula officinal is was used topically and orally to examine its effects on rat excision wounds. The results showed that o n the eighth day after the wound was formed , the ex- tract -treated group had a 90.0% wound closure rate (in contrast to the control group's 51.1% wound closure ), and the hydroxyproline and hexosamine contents were signifi- cantly higher in the extract -treated group than in the untreated group (Figure 6) [61].More- over, Calendula ointment can be used to accelerate cesarean recovery since it significantly speeds up the healing of cesarean wounds [62].

Matricaria chamomilla The Asteraceae family of plants includes the well -known chamomile ( Matricaria chamomilla L.). The therapeutic and fragrant qualities of German chamomile ( M. chamo- milla ) make it a well -known star herb. German chamomile ( M. chamomilla ) is a perennial herb that grows in south -eastern Europe and neighbor ing Asian nations. Both the flower heads and the essential oils are used in traditional medicine [63].A wide range of second- ary metabolites and types of active compounds are present in M. , including Sesquiterpenes , bioactive phenolic compo unds contained in chamomile extracts (Table 2 ) [64]. The primary uses of chamomile are as an antibacterial, anti -inflammatory, antiseptic , and antispasmodic [ 65]. Research showed that , within 10 days, re -epithelialization and the development of collagen fibers were accelerated by the use of chamomile extract oint- ment [ 66]. Furthermore , chamomile loaded mat is to be suitable for use in wound healing due to its antibacterial, antioxidant, b iocompatibility, and mechanical qualities. Moreover , excellent antibacterial effectiveness was demonstrated by 15, 20, and 30% of chamomile loaded mats, and inhibitory zones grew as chamomile content rose. Additionally, these nanofibers exceeded the commer cial silver -coated wound dressing in terms of antibacte- rial efficacy [ 67]. Life 2023 , 13, 317 9 of 22 Table 2.

Eucalyptus Eucalyptus plantations provide high -quality woody biomass for a variety of indus- trial applications while alleviating demand on tropical forests and related biodiversity [68].D ue to its quick growth and excellent adaptability to varied settings, Eucalyptus is regarded as a highl y successful reforestation tree species [69].There are plenty of species of Eucalyptus plant s [70].The essential oil extracted from Eucalyptus globulus leaves has been used worldwide both as an antiseptic and for easing the symptoms of cold s, cough s, sore throat s, and other illnesses [71]. In comparison to pure Eucalyptus essential oil (EEO) and regular gentamycin, the optimized nanoemulsion of EEO was chosen for wound healing investigation, collagen estimation, and histological evaluation in rats. The optimized EEO nanoemulsion showed considerable wound healing activity in rats [72].Other research has shown that Eucalyptus alba leaves should be dried at a temperature of no higher than 30 \u00b0 C and extracted in eth- anol for optimal wound healing results and more cell proliferation [73]. 2.8. Jojoba The Jojoba plant, which is adapted to a warm, dry climate, is now commercially grown in areas with a severe lack of water , as well as in places where conventional farm- ing methods were previously not fin ancially sustainable. This shrub can withstand high temperatures, requires very little soil fertility and watering, and is also believed to be drought -tolerant [74]. Simmondsia chinensis , also known dioecious desert shrub. S. chinensis prod uces seeds that produce liquid wax esters, a valuable ingredient in lubricants used in industry and cosmetics [75]. Jojoba oil is a naturally occurring light yellow oil that can bead ministered topically and is capable of healing wounds and rebuild ing skin barriers. Jojoba oil is made up of bioactive substances such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and alkaloids in addition to 97% linear long -chain esters. The administration of Jojoba oil dry nanoemulsion powders (JND) resulted in reduced bleeding and inflammatory cell infiltrations in acute lung injury models (ALI), emphasizing its efficiency as natural oil -based anti -inflammatory and free radical scavenger s used to treat ALI [76]. Furthermore, a previous study showed t hat both keratinocytes ' and fibro blasts' wound closure are noticeably accelerated by jojoba liquid wax (JLW). JLW was also discovered to promote collagen I production in fibroblasts (Fig- ure 7). JLW's pharmacological characterization suggests that it could be employed in clin- ical settings t o treat wounds due to its effects on skin cells [77]. Jojoba oil is more com- monly referred to as liquid wax than oil since it contains over 98% pure waxes (mostly wax esters, with a small amount of free fatty acids, alcohols, and hydrocarbons), sterols, and vitamins that possess several b ioactive properties [78]. Life 2023 , 13, 317 11 of 22 Figure 7. Jojoba liquid wax (JLW) wound healing properties examined by western blot, ELISA and scratch wound analysis on in vi tro human dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes [77]. 2.9. Planta go major The Plantaginaceae family , which include s Plantago major L., are also often known as plantain\u2014a perennial herb with rosette -shaped leaves that are 15 to 30 cm in diameter [79].The plantain plant, or Plantago major , thrives in a variety of habitats, including road- side ditches, developed fields, canal water, and waste site s[80].The plant leaves and seeds have a long history of usage in folk medicine for a variety of ailments, incl uding the treat- ment of a wide range of illnesses and disorders including digestive problems and respir- atory issues. Additionally, it has been utilized as an anti -inflammatory, anti -microbial, and anti -tumor agent to treat wounds. Plantains also contain com pounds that can coun- teract both internal and external toxins [ 81]. Plantago major contains a number of lipids, is shown in Table 3 [82]. A safe and effective herbal remedy for the treatment of second -degree burn wounds is P. major ointment, which not only contains qualities for healing wounds but also functions as an analgesic and an antibacterial agent [83]. Furthermore , it was found tha t, when com- pared to alternative therapies, P. major extract effectively accelerated the healing of dorsal cervical injuries in mice [84]. P. major leaves can accelerate wound -healing processes in an ex vivo pig wound -healing model. That extracts of freeze -dried leaves made from both ethanol and water have shown a stimulating effect suggest s that P. major might be a useful source of many bioact ive compounds with wound healing potential. Moreover , a concen- tration of 1.0 mg/mL (dry weight) has the best results for both types of extracts [85]. Life 2023 , 13, 317 12 of 22 Table 3. The phytochemistry of the major bioactive components of Plantago major [82]. Molecule Name is a vast genus of about 100 species of flowering plants that are native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. Many of these species have been used as sources of medicines [86].Inula contains several terpenoids, flavonoids, and are also widely distributed [87]. Many different biological effects have been observed for Life 2023 , 13, 317 13 of 22 chemicals derived from Inula species against oxidative stress -related illnesses, inflamma- tion, diabetes, cancer, and neurological [88]. A perennial herbaceous plant called Inula viscosa , often locally known as \"Ma- gramane \", is found throughout the Mediterranean basin. As a result, the plant has been employed in traditional medicine to treat a variety of illnesses ; this is attributed to its anti - inflammatory, anthelmintic, antipyretic, antiseptic, and antiphlogistic properties [89]. Inula viscosa serve as a source of bioactive substances , volatile oils and phe- nolic compounds. Additionally, its potential for the development of natural preservatives with applications in agro -food is indicated by its antioxidant, antibacterial, and antifungal capabilities [90]. The Inula genus is a source of structurally diversified antioxidant chemi- cals that can combat many oxidative stress -related human diseases via various pathways, making it beneficial for the creation of new medications [91]. The administration of ex- tracts of Inula racemose (Ir) significantly increase s total phenolic content and free radical scavenging activity , and the protein expression of p53, bax, and bcl -2 are returned to near - normal level s. Thus , the extracts of Ir may be p otential therapeutic agent s for providing several beneficial effects in hepatic injury following orthotopic liver transplantation [92]. The pharmacological Inula are presented in Figure 8. Figure 8. Pharmacological wound healing activities of some remarkable medicinal plants. 1: Jo- joba,2: Calendula officinalis ,3: Eucalyptus , 7: Althea officinalis . 2.11. Pine To produce a variety of products, pine trees are planted all over the world. For build- ing materials, there are wood and cellulose [ 93]. Pine produces phenolic chemicals and oleoresin, the latter of which contains a variety of terpenoids. Polyphenolic parench yma cells and specialized ray cells both create phenolic chemicals , and specialized resin ducts are distributed throughout the wood, bark, roots, and needles. Specialized secretory tis- sues also create large amounts of terpenoid resin, which are then stored there [94]. The p ine tree is constitute d of several parts , including wood, bark, resin, needles, cones , and seeds [95]; the chemical composition of each part of the pine tree are shown in Figure 9. Pine pollen polysaccharides (PPPS) can speed up the recovery of mouse skin wounds and encourage the growth of chicken embryo chorioallantoic vasculature by encouraging Life 2023 , 13, 317 14 of 22 cell division, shifting the cell cycle from G1 to S and G2, and upregulating Cyclin B1 e x- pression in vitro. These effects of PPPS were accomplished by JAK2 -STAT3 signaling pathway activation [96]. The largest benefits in the wound healing activity models were seen with the essential oils extracted from Pinus pinea and P. halepensis cones. How ever, other essential oils did not exhibit any notable anti -inflammatory or wound healing prop- erties [97]. Abietic acid makes up more than 50% of pine resin. Abietic acid significantly increased angiogenic capacity, which is linked to increased production of p38 and extra- cellular signal -regulated kinase abietic acid accelerated cell tion and tube formation in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells . In mouse mode ls with cutaneous wounds, groups treated with 0.8 M abietic acid de monstrated acceler- ated wound closure in comparison to the control groups [98]. Figure 9. Chemical composition of different pine parts [99]. 2.12. Green Tea More than two -thirds of the world 's population drink tea, including green tea brewed from the leaves of the Camellia s inensis plant [100] . One of the oldest and most widely consumed beverages worldwide , it is made from the Camellia sinensis (L.) plant (green tea) and is mostly grown in Japan, China, and Taiwan [101] . Green tea has been demonstrated to have positive impacts on human health, including effects against cancer, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, infections, and neurological disorders [102] . Numerous variables, including agricu ltural methods, climate, season, and plant type s, can affect the content of tea. Green tea 's key ingredients are polyphenols, mainly flavonoids. Catechins make up 6 %-16% of the dried green tea leaves. The four main cate- chins are : epigallocatechin (EGCG), w hich accounts number of catechins; epigallocatechin -3-gallate (ECG) , account ing for roughly 13.6% ; and epicatechin (EC) , account ing for roughly 6.4% amount [103] . Numerous studies h ave been conducted on the health advantages of green tea , espe- cially epigallocatechin gallate(EGCG) ; it iswell recognized that these effects are mostly relate d to its polyphenols [104] .The most prevalent component in tea leaves is EGCG , which is thought to have the major bioactiv and angiogenic effects that induc e a proper wound healing process and minimiz e the onset of infection [105] . Life 2023 , 13, 317 15 of 22 Figure 10. Pharmacological effects of green tea on the wound healing mechanism [106] . Episiotomy pain seems to be effectively reduced by green tea ointment, which also helps to speed up wound healing [107] . Moreover, animal experimentation and molecular mechanism studies have demonstrated that green tea polyphenols could speed up dia- betic rats ' ability to heal wounds by modulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway [108] . 2.13. Punicagranatum L. Pomegranate , known as Punica grana tum L., is an old fruit full compo- nents including total and minerals [109] . A pomegranate fruit consists of several parts : the peel , which accounts for 49% to 55% of the total fruit size , and the arils, which account for 45% to 52% (18 % to 20% seeds and 26 % to 30% juice) [110] . Pomegranate seeds are a rich source of phytochemicals with a high antioxidant activity [111] . It has been shown that p omegranate peel extracts had significant positive effects in the minipig second -degree burn model, which may be related to increase s in VEGF -A and TGF -b1 protein and gene expression levels [112] . Pom- egranate is a promising medicinal plant for the recover y of skin burn wounds, where pre- vious research showed that 10% of standard pomegranate extracts can hasten the healing of serious second -degree burn wounds which is characterized by angiogenesis, a complete and m ature epithelium, a low number of inflammatory cells, and a high density of colla- gen with a good organization [113] . Moreover, rats given cream containing P. granatum flower extract experienced faster wound healing on day 25 of the treatment than those given other treatments \u2014where the wound healing was accelerated by the P. granatum flower extract, which can also be uti- lized to treat burn injuries [114] . According to mechanical (contraction rate, tensile strength), biochemical (raising of collagen, DNA, and protein synthesis) and extract as- sessments, pomegranate peel ointment considerably improved the wound contraction and the time of epithelialization in excised wounded models over 10 days [115] .The phar- macological bioactivities of various medicinal plant s pecies are summarized in Table 4.

Conclusion s Each of the botanicals we have studied possess es chemical complexities that are con- nected to several pharmacological activities. These specifically shared characteristics in- clude anti-microbial, anti -inflammatory , and anti tions may emerge from medic inal herb s, which ha ve fewer side effects and better bioa- vailability fo r healing wounds. Particularly when treating patients with persistent or re- sistant skin ulcers, topical or systemic usage of phytotherapeutic drugs alone or as a sup- plement to other healing medications should be considered.
