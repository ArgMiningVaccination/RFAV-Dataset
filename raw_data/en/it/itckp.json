In the United States,sixteen states have legalized or are on the path to legalizing theconsumption of cannabis. This trend has led to more lactationand healthcare professionals being faced with the question, \"Is itsafe for me to use cannabis during pregnancy and lactation?\" Theanswers vary widely due to myth, bias, and poorly conducted andaccessed research. These widely differing recommendations leadhealthcare professionals to scratch their heads and face theknowledge that they don't know what to say to families. Theproblematic question of safety is compounded when issuesinvolving equity and healthcare access come into play, as biascertainly plays a role in the US response to cannabis. Healthcareprofessionals have a sincere concern as the endocannabinoidsystem, which interacts with almost every organ system and theimmune system, reacts to the molecules found in cannabis. Theendocannabinoid system plays a role in brain development,system homeostasis, and the functioning immune system. Whatwe actually know about how much perinatal use affects babies isstill unknown. This presentation takes a harm reductionapproach while looking at the most recent research and policiessurrounding this controversial herb during the perinatal period. \u00a9 MotherJourney/Laurel Wilson 2021www.motherjourney.cominfo@motherjourney.comIdentify two cannabinoids concernduring the perinatal period.Describe the endocannabinoid system.Describe why a harm reduction approach to cannabis use duringperinatal period is is more effective than risk reduction.Originated in China > IndiaMedicinal use for over 5000 yearsFound in 2700 tomb in western China Gobi desert1611 Hemp brought to North America as a Crop1840's Cannabis brought to colonies as a medicineEarly 1900's decline as other medicines (opiates) became availableNewspaper reports were filled with murders and psychotic behavior, mainlyassociated with communities of color1937 US Federal Government - Marijuana Tax$1 per oz medical use, $100 per oz for rec use Response to Mexican immigration andantiblackness1942 removed from Pharmacopia1970 added to Schedule 1 -1970 Drug Wars under NixonHeroinLSDMarijuanaMescalineMDMAGHBEcstasyPsilocybinMethaqualone KhatBath SaltsAmerican Medical Institute Institute of Medicine DHHS wrote a patent on Cannabinoids - antioxidants and neuro-protectantFDA approved medicines made with THC and CBDNASEM recognizes medicinal effects3.9% of pregnant women used in past month and 7.0% used in past 2-12 months * Self reported use 5.7% in pregnancy and 5% during lactation**Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit substance among pregnant women inWestern societies.Cannabis is the world's third most popular recreational drug, after alcohol and tobacco.History of Cannabis Schedule 1 Substances Schedule 1 ChallengesAntenatal and Postpartum Use Women with severe nausea during pregnancy (3.7%), were significantly more likely touse marijuana (Robertson, 2014)To treat \"naturally\" other ailments, such as migraines, chronic pain, etc.Ko (2018) found postpartum use is associated with depressive symptoms and shorterbreastfeeding duration. 30% said no harm to fetus (Mark et al, 2017)Perceive no general or specific risk (Mark et al 2017; Jarlenski et al, 2017Perceived as safer and less expensive as a coping mechanism (Bayrampour et al,2018)There is conclusive or substantial evidence that cannabis or cannabinoids areeffective:For chronic pain in adults Antiemetics in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomitingMultiple sclerosis spasticity symptoms There is moderate evidence that cannabis or cannabinoids are effective for:Improving short-term sleep outcomes There is limited evidence that cannabis or cannabinoids are effective for:Increasing appetite and decreasing weight loss associated with HIV/AIDSSymptoms of Tourette syndromeAnxiety symptomsPTSDTypes of Edibles, Capsules, SuppositoriesK2 or SpiceSynCannsSprayed on dried plant for smoking or used as oilSymptoms-rapid heart rate, vomiting, violent behavior, suicidal thoughts, deathMyclobutanil - \"Bad Actor\"Imidacloprid - \"moderately hazardousAbamectin and the avermectin \"Bad Actor,\"EtoxazoleSpiromesifenWhy do parents use during perinatal period?Perception of Little HarmNational Academy of Sciences, Engineering, Medicine Do Not Confuse with Synthetic CannabisPesticides2013 Journal of Toxicology report found 70% of pesticides used on cannabis can passthrough body via inhalationSmoking can mean absorbing 10 times what you would through ingestion ofpesticidesDabbing increases risk significantlyTHCPsychoactiveEuphoriaAnalgesicAntibacterialAntiemeticAnti-tumoralBronchodilatorAppetite StimulantNeuroprotective (medium doses)Sleep System, Connective Gonads, System of hungerHippocampus Short term memory Lack of memoryCerebellumCoordination Lack of coordinationAmygdala Learn to fear Become ParanoidLimbic System Dopamine Feel pleasureTHC and Animal StudiesDisrupts brain (from saline induced abortions)Decrease in dopamine receptor (D2) mRNA expression in amygdalaSignificant prevalence in males.

Careful consideration of the risks versus benefits of breastfeeding in the setting ofmoderate or chronic marijuana use At this time, although the data are not strong enough to recommend notbreastfeeding with any marijuana use, we urge caution. Hill/ReedIf a woman is going to smoke tobacco, she should be encouraged to continuebreastfeeding. There is a lack of evidence to suggest that the recommendation toa mother who uses marijuana should be any different.AAPAAP - Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding avoid marijuana use. ACOG also recommends that obstetrician-gynecologists counsel women againstusing marijuana while trying to get pregnant, during pregnancy, and while they arebreastfeeding.Lactmed/NIHIn general, professional guidelines recommend that cannabis use should beavoided by nursing mothers, and nursing mothers should be informed of possibleadverse effects on infant development from exposure to cannabis compounds inbreastmilk. In addition to possible adverse effects from cannabinoids inbreastmilk, paternal cannabis use may also increase the risk of sudden infantdeath syndrome in breastfed infants. Surgeon General 2019Maternal marijuana use may still be dangerous to the baby after birth. THC hasbeen found in breast milk for up to six days after the last recorded use. It mayaffect the newborn's brain development and result in hyperactivity, poor cognitivefunction, and other long-term consequences. Additionally, marijuana smokecontains many of the same harmful components as tobacco smoke.
