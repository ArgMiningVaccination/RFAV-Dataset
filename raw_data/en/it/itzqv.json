People seek out energy work for a variety of health and life challenges. The soothing and nourishing nature of energy work helps to clear, balance, and energize the human energy system, thus promoting physical, emotional, mental, and energetic healing. Reiki and energy healing are now part of patient care systems in many hospitals in the United States. Because of the effective results seen over recent years, energy healing has been actively researched and more than 50 studies have been completed at universities, medical centers, and in other settings. Green Lotus offers Reiki, Emotional Freedom Techniques, and Eden Energy Medicine. In addition, we also have three levels of reiki training for those who would like to learn how to use reiki's healing energy on themselves, loved ones, and even pets, or for those seeking to start their own practice. What to Expect from a Reiki, Emotional Freedom Techniques, or Eden Energy Medicine Session Reiki and Eden Energy Medicine sessions are done in one of our serene treatment rooms, while lying comfortably on a massage table, fully clothed, with blankets and pillows. Practitioners use their hands with light or near-body touch. Emotional Freedom Techniques sessions are done in chairs in our counseling room.

He is an incredibly gifted practitioner, extremely professional, knowledgeable, and flexible in scheduling appointments. David truly does have a mastery of reiki. He is fully present during sessions and provides me with the best experience possible so that I may go back out into the world feeling a little lighter, more at peace, and calmer. It is the little things that David does that add to the experience, working with rune stones, crystals, or listening for fifteen more minutes than the scheduled time. ~ S. Stone Reiki Energy Healing Although reiki dates back 2,500 to 3,000 years it was rediscovered in the 1800's by Dr. Usui, who believed that Reiki had been accessible to all people at one time. Reiki's soothing and balancing energy can be useful for ourselves, our loved ones, and even our pets. It can be used to restore and nourish the body of every day life stressors. Reiki is used to aid the bodies natural ability to heal headaches, exhaustion, colds, sleeplessness, injuries, and other forms of \"dis-ease\". Rei: means universe, Ki: life force energy. Available at all locations. Emotional Freedom Techniques Emotional Freedom Techniques, also known as EFT, tapping, and psychological acupressure is an evidence-based practice that has been shown to help physical, emotional, and performance challenges. EFT stimulates select acupressure points which facilitates energetic and emotional equilibrium in the client. Even for physical pain, EFT sessions have been found to often bring immediate relief. Medical research supports EFT's efficacy for relieving anxiety. During your first session with Therese you will be empowered with techniques to use anytime you need them for immediate relief. Available in Mendota Heights and Eden Prairie with [Therese Naber](https://www.greenlotusyogactr.com/healing-therapeutic-experts/therese-naber). Eden Energy Medicine Eden Energy Medicine (EEM) is a comprehensive set of techniques and protocols that work with nine different energetic systems, including, among others, the meridians, chakras, and the aura. The goal of any EEM session is to support and balance the body's energies in order to bring more overall balance to the body. The practitioner uses energy testing (often called muscle testing) to identify which energetic systems need support. This means the client's energies lead everything and sessions are highly individualized as a result. Clients remain fully clothed, light or no touch is used, and work happens both on and off a massage table. The techniques and protocols can be deep and powerful and can result in significant change in energetic patterns, emotional well-being, and overall health. EEM is also very self-empowering. Clients learn quick and easy techniques to support the work at home, which continues to retrain and balance energetic patterns. New clients start with an initial 90-minute session and follow-up sessions can be 60- or 90-minutes.
