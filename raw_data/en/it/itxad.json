It holds the belief that a healer is able to channel healing energy into the client seeking help through different methods: hands-on healing, hands-off healing, and distance healing (where the client and healer are in different locations). There are many different methods of energy healing. It has been known as bio-energetic healing, spiritual healing, light healing, contact healing, distance healing, sound healing, therapeutic touch, Chakra balancing, Reiki and Qi Gong. Energy Medicine usually states that imbalances in the body's \"energy field\" result in illness, and that by re-balancing this energy field, health can be regained and maintained.
