In this study, the microbial degradation of model (alkylated) PAHs (i.e., phenanthrene, 3-methylphenanthrene, 3,6-dimethylphenanthrene (36DMPhe), pyrene, and 1-methylpyrene (1MP)) by the bacterium Sphingobium quisquiliarum EPA505, a known degrader of PAHs, was studied. To evaluate the toxic potential of the metabolic products, reaction mixtures containing metabolites of 36DMPhe and 1MP were fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography, and their effects on the luminescence inhibition of Aliivibrio fischeri were evaluated. Although the luminescence inhibition of 36DMPhe and 1MP at their solubility levels was not observed, inhibition was observed in their metabolite fractions at the solubility limit of their parent molecule. This indicates that initial biotransformation increases the toxicity of alkylated PAHs because of the increased solubility and/or inherent toxicity of metabolites. Qualitative analysis of the metabolite fractions suggested that mono-oxidation of the methyl group is the main metabolic pathway of 36DMPhe and 1MP.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-09-03", "cleaned_text": "Enhancement of Toxic Efficacy of Alkylated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Transformed by Sphingobium quisquiliarum [https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176416](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176416) [Advances and more abundant than their unsubstituted forms in crude oil and refined petroleum products and are thought to be major contributors to the overall toxicity of spilled oil [ [4](#B4-ijerph-17-06416), [5](#B5-ijerph-17-06416)]. However, the environmental fate and transformation of alkylated PAHs after spills or other contamination requires further elucidation. [6](#B6-ijerph-17-06416), [7](#B7-ijerph-17-06416), [8](#B8-ijerph-17-06416)]. [9](#B9-ijerph-17-06416)]. Many bacterial strains have been evaluated for their ability to degrade aromatic hydrocarbons including PAHs via one of the three methods: mineralization, transformation, and non-specific oxidation [ [10](#B10-ijerph-17-06416)]. Sphingomonas sp. strains can degrade PAHs with 2-5 rings, which are major PAHs of toxicological concerns after spills, via non-specific oxidation utilizing enzymes such as dioxygenase or other oxygenase [ [11](#B11-ijerph-17-06416)]. Although the biodegradation of unsubstituted PAHs by microorganisms has studied [12](#B12-ijerph-17-06416), [13](#B13-ijerph-17-06416), [14](#B14-ijerph-17-06416), [15](#B15-ijerph-17-06416)], aerobic biodegradation of alkylated derivatives has not been widely examined and studies have mainly focused on important toxicants in oil contamination, studies are needed to identify their biodegradation and transformation products during weathering processes. In a few studies, the biodegradation kinetics of alkylated PAHs were investigated [ [23](#B23-ijerph-17-06416), [24](#B24-ijerph-17-06416), [25](#B25-ijerph-17-06416), [26](#B26-ijerph-17-06416), [27](#B27-ijerph-17-06416)]. Zhong transformation of 1-methylphenanthrene by Sphingobium sp. MP9-4 occurs by the simultaneous monooxygenation of the methyl group and dioxygenation on unsubstituted benzene ring [ [22](#B22-ijerph-17-06416)]. However, metabolic transformation studies have been conducted for only a few alkylated PAHs, whereas there are many other alkylated PAHs present in spilled oils [ [28](#B28-ijerph-17-06416), [29](#B29-ijerph-17-06416), [30](#B30-ijerph-17-06416)]. Further studies are needed to understand whether oxidation pathways in aerobic bacteria such as Sphingobium sp. can be generalized to various alkylated PAHs. [31](#B31-ijerph-17-06416), [32](#B32-ijerph-17-06416)]. Although alkylated PAHs have very low water solubility, the transformation products are expected to be more soluble, resulting in increased exposure of organisms if water solubility limits chemical exposure. Moreover, the carcinogenicity of PAHs is mediated by their reactive transformation products. As concerns regarding environmental effects have increased, the ecotoxicity of oxy-PAHs including hydroxylated PAHs, aromatic acids, and chronic toxicity of 1-methylphenanthrene and its hydroxylated derivatives to Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes), showing that ring hydroxylation enhanced the toxicity of PAHs [ [35](#B35-ijerph-17-06416)]. Similar results were observed in developmental toxicity tests of zebrafish embryo by chrysene and its hydroxylated derivatives, revealing that hydroxylated PAHs are more toxic than unsubstituted PAHs [ [37](#B37-ijerph-17-06416)]. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. [41](#B41-ijerph-17-06416)]. 2.2. Culturing of Bacteria the PDMS with fluoranthene, PDMS sheets were submerged in methanol solution containing excess crystals of fluoranthene in a glass bottle. The bottle was placed on a horizontal shaker at 150 rpm and 25 \u00b0C for 24 h. After shaking, the PDMS sheets were removed from the methanol solution and air-dried in a clean bench. A frozen supply of S. quisquiliarum was plated onto LB agar plates and incubated at 28 \u00b0C. After incubation, a single colony was picked and inoculated into a glass bottle containing 50 mL of minimal salt medium and a fluoranthene-loaded PDMS sheet. The bottle was closed loosely with a cap and incubated at 25 \u00b0C and 120 rpm for 4 days. After incubation, 0.8-mL aliquots of medium containing the grown biomass were dispended into a sterile external cryovial (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The medium was then mixed with 0.8 mL of glycerol and stored at 80 \u00b0C until use. 2.3. Biodegradation Kinetics [Table 1](#ijerph-17-06416-t001)). The DMSO content in the medium was 0.1% by volume. After mixing the spiked medium, 5 mL of the sample was collected and added to a 20 mL glass vial with a Teflon-coated screw cap. The biodegradation test was initiated by placing the test vials on a rotary shaker (200 rpm) at 25 \u00b0C in the dark. All samples were prepared in triplicate, and the negative control prepared with sterilized cells was included in all tests. Three vials were used to detect the concentrations of remaining compounds at 0, 1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6 h after initiating the biodegradation test for phenanthrene, 3-methylphenanthrene, and 3,6-dimethylphenanthrene, and at 0, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 24 h after initiation for pyrene and 1-methylpyrene. Bacterial biomass at the end of the tests was counted to assure that bacterial activity was not altered during the tests. At each sampling time, the whole medium was extracted using 3 \u00d7 20 mL hexane:ethylacetate (7:3, v/v). The extract was then passed through a sodium sulfate layer and regenerated cellulose membrane filter (pore size 0.2 \u00b5m, diameter 47 mm, chmlab group, Barcelona, Spain). The filtered extract was evaporated using a rotary evaporator to approximately 2 mL and the remaining solution was evaporated under a gentle nitrogen gas stream to complete dryness. The dried residue was re-dissolved in 1 mL methanol for ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) analysis. 2.4. Fractionation of Transformation Products [Table 2](#ijerph-17-06416-t002)) was placed on a rotary shaker (200 rpm) at 25 \u00b0C for at least for 24 h. After incubation, the solution was passed through an Oasis\u00ae HLB (200 mg) cartridge (Waters). The loaded cartridge was eluted with 4 mL methanol for metabolites from 3,6-dimethylphenanthrene or 4 mL dichloromethane for metabolites from 1-methylpyrene. The eluent was filtered through a 0.2-\u00b5m regenerated cellulose membrane filter (chmlab group), and then re-dissolved in 4 mL methanol after evaporation of the extraction solvent using a rotary evaporator and nitrogen gas stream for 3D-scanning (fixed ex at 260 nm) with a fluorescence detector (FLD). Based on the peaks identified by 3D-scanning, the eluent was further fractionated using a Waters HPLC system equipped with a Waters 717+ autosampler, Waters 2475 multi fluorescence detector, and two Waters 515 HPLC pumps. Fifty microliters of eluent were injected into the HPLC system, and the metabolites were separated on a Thermo C18 column (4.6 \u00d7 150 mm, 5 m particle size; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mobile phase in isocratic mode was 90% acetonitrile and 10% water (v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL min1 at ambient temperature. 2.5. Identification of Metabolic Products of Alkylated PAHs 2.6. of phenanthrene and its alkyl derivatives were much higher than those of pyrene and 1-methylpyrene. As shown in [Figure 1](#ijerph-17-06416-f001)a, the biodegradation of phenanthrene (k = 0.54 \u00b1 0.04 h1) was fastest, followed by 3MPhe (k = 0.44 \u00b1 0.05 h1) and 36DMPhe (k = 0.14 \u00b1 0.02 h1). However, the biodegradation constant of 1MP (k = 0.022 \u00b1 0.002 h1) was S2b, Supplementary Material](#app1-ijerph-17-06416)), the peak of 36DMPhe nearly completely disappeared, and two major new peaks of potential transformation products were identified after biodegradation. The column effluents containing the two peaks were collected separately and chromatograms for the isolated fractions (36DMPhe_F1 and 36DMPhe_F2) were obtained ( [Figure S2c,d, Supplementary Material](#app1-ijerph-17-06416)). The transformation products were thought to be more polar than 36DMPhe because they showed shorter retention times during separation using a reverse-phase column [ [49](#B49-ijerph-17-06416)]. The fluorescence emission of each unidentified peak was tested after excitation at 260 nm, and the optimal emission wavelength (em) was observed at 353.3 nm, which was the same optimum em as that of 36DMPhe ( [Figure S3, Supplementary Material](#app1-ijerph-17-06416)), suggesting that the ring structure was retained. [Figure S4](#app1-ijerph-17-06416)shows the chromatograms for (a) 1MP, (b) biodegradation mixture of 1MP after 24 h, and (c) the isolated fraction containing the peak of the transformation product in (b). As with the case of biotransformation products of 36DMPhe, transformation products of 1MP should be more polar than the parent compound. The optimal fluorescence emission wavelength (em) of unidentified peak was observed at 374.5 nm after excitation at 260 nm, which was same the optimal emission wavelength of 1MP ( [Figure S5, Supplementary Material](#app1-ijerph-17-06416)). Identification of Transformation Products [Table 2](#ijerph-17-06416-t002), the mass spectrums and retention times of the tentative metabolites in the selected chromatograms for each fraction are shown with those of the parent compounds. Mass spectrum of three tentatively identified metabolites are also shown in [Figure S6 [52](#B52-ijerph-17-06416)] a mass S7, ver. [45](#B45-ijerph-17-06416)] adopting a group contribution method, the solubilities of the identified transformation products were estimated as 0.77, 15, and 12 M for 36DMPhe_F1, 36DMPhe_F2, and 1MP_F, respectively, and the values were much higher than those of 3,6-DMPhe (0.18 M) and 1-MP (0.46 M). 3.4. Evaluation of Luminescence Inhibition by Transformation Products [Section 2.2](#sec2dot2-ijerph-17-06416)was evaluated by using the luminescence inhibition by was not observed at their water solubility limits in the previous study [ [47](#B47-ijerph-17-06416)], clear dose-response relationships were observed for all three isolated fractions ( [Figure 2](#ijerph-17-06416-f002)). Because the em for the transformation products did not differ from those of the parent compounds, the levels of transformation products were estimated based on the relationship between the peak area and parent compound mass assuming that they had similar chromatophores. [Figure 2](#ijerph-17-06416-f002), the isolated fractions were more soluble in water than the parent compounds, and the observed luminescence inhibition at the solubility level of the parent compounds was greater (shown in cross marks) than those of parent, which were not observable [ [47](#B47-ijerph-17-06416)]. At the solubility level of 36DMPhe, 34.6% 28.3% luminescence inhibition was solubility level of 1MP. 4. Discussion [24](#B24-ijerph-17-06416)]. [22](#B22-ijerph-17-06416)], the rate constants were increased methylation \u00b1 1.44 indicating no significant difference between the biodegradation rate constants of these compounds. The biodegradation rate constant decreased with alkylation for phenanthrenes whereas the rate constant for 1-methylpyrene was greater than that of pyrene in this study. It has been suggested that the main site for dioxygenation of phenanthrene by Sphingomonas sp. is the 5,6-C site 3,4-C which equivalent; [Figure Material](#app1-ijerph-17-06416)) [ [22](#B22-ijerph-17-06416)]. In 3-methylphenanthrene, however, 3,4-C site is hindered by methylation, resulting in inhibition of dioxygenation-derived metabolism. In 3,6-dimethylphenanthrene, both dioxygenation sites are hindered by methyl groups, resulting in a significant decrease in the biodegradation rate constants compared to the unsubstituted form. The observed trend in the biodegradation kinetics for phenanthrene, 3-methylphenanthrene, and 3,6-dimethylphenanthrene agrees well with this hypothesis. In case of pyrene, no site preference was observed in the metabolism because of its high symmetry ( [Figure S8b, Supplementary Material](#app1-ijerph-17-06416)). Diverse metabolic pathways pyrene may result in a higher biodegradation rate constant of 1MP than that of pyrene. The identification of the biotransformation products of 36DMPhe and 1MP also supported this hypothesis as explained below. However, it is also well-known that co-factors such as metal ions included in the culture medium influence on the observed bacterial or enzymatic degradation rate and transformation pathways [ [55](#B55-ijerph-17-06416), [56](#B56-ijerph-17-06416)]. Further investigations on the mechanism and pathways of the transformation of alkylated PAHs would explain the differences in biodegradation rates among PAHs and their alkylated homologues. [22](#B22-ijerph-17-06416)]. It was observed that unsubstituted positions in benzene ring was preferentially attacked in bacterial degradation of 1-methylphenanthrene [ [22](#B22-ijerph-17-06416)]. For 36DMPhe in this study, however, monooxygenation of the methyl group appeared to be the major biodegradation pathway because the 5,6-C site (or equivalent 3,4-C site), which is known as the main site for dioxygenation by Sphingobium sp. [ [22](#B22-ijerph-17-06416)], is hindered by methylation. The isolated fraction of the metabolic products of 1MP, 1MP_F, was also identified as the monooxygenated form of 1MP, confirming that monooxygenation of the methyl group also occurred during bacterial degradation of 1MP. This indicates that the alkyl-substitution on pyrene could serve multiple degradation pathways and make the biodegradation faster than unsubstituted pyrene. [57](#B57-ijerph-17-06416)] with log Kow values estimated by EPISuiteTM. These values were 0.39, 0.49 and 1.5 M for 36DMPhe_F1, 36DMPhe_F2, and 1MP_F, respectively. The toxicity ratios (TR) were calculated by dividing the EC50 values derived from the quantitative structure-activity relationships prediction by the measured EC50 in this study. These values were 0.47, 4.61, and 1.23 for 36DMPhe_F1, 36DMPhe_F2, and 1MP_F, respectively. It is generally accepted that chemicals with a TR < 5 cause narcosis [ [58](#B58-ijerph-17-06416)]. Although all tested fractions could be classified as baseline toxicants, the fraction 36DMPhe_F2 may have a specific toxic mode-of-action. The luminescence inhibition of A. fischeri by aromatic acids showed that the toxicity increased with increasing hydrophobicity, which is the general tendency observed for baseline toxicants [ [33](#B33-ijerph-17-06416)]. Previous studies compared the toxicity of PAHs and their oxygenated derivatives [ [35](#B35-ijerph-17-06416), [36](#B36-ijerph-17-06416)]. Enhanced chronic toxicity in the early life stage of Oryzias latipes was observed for 1-methylphenanthrene by hydroxylation, as hydroxylated derivatives were 4-fold more toxic than 1-methylphenanthrene [ [35](#B35-ijerph-17-06416)]. The developmental toxicity of chrysene and its hydroxylated derivatives tested using zebrafish embryos showed similar results, indicating that the photochemical or microbial transformation of PAHs enhances the toxicity of PAHs [ [36](#B36-ijerph-17-06416)]. This suggests that both the toxic potency and efficacy of metabolic products of alkylated PAHs could be greater than their parent compounds because of the greater inherent toxicity of metabolites and/or enhanced water solubility. 5.
