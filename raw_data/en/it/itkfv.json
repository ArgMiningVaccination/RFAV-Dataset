I had my first loss of conscious episode/seizure 1 month later, was put on an anti-depressant and had a terrrible 6 months of seizing. I was removed from the ATD and my seizures have lessened. Only bummer of my hysterectomy ws the Doc left in an ovary. He said so I would still have hormones. Well sorry Doc...fool left in a non-functioning ovary. Now I have to have surgery again to have the remaining one removed since I now have a 3 1/2-4 cm cyst on it and it is causing pain. Hi Carol, My menopause was surgically induced last August.

Oh yeah - there are more then a few of us out here having the time of our lives.....that was a joke! I am on Dilantin and Mysoline (over 30 years now seizure free and using generic forms of both meds). Since being blessed with the change I have added a mild anti-depresent (Lexapro) in a low dose - just to level out some of the bumps that the hormone replacement theropy doesn't. It has helped. I notice that I am always a little better the 14 days that I am on prometrium then the days that I am not. I have learned that hormones do play a part in our seizure activity but no one seems to be SURE whether they benefit it or cause it - or just what they do......and since each of us is different that one may take years to figure out. I have raised my dilantin level by 30m a day just to get rid of some deju vu and \"funny feelings\" I was beginning to have again. That too has helped and hasn't raised my blood levels too high for me to experience the same effects as drug induced. I have had problems with that in the past and so we keep my med levels high enough to be effective for me (6 to 8) but low enough to keep me from having the drug induced effects (usually around 10). It has been a guessing game all along - but I take care of myself, take extra calcium and other vitamin and mineral additives to help keep my general health good and eat healthy. Some days are good and other days belong to the devil.....I guess that is what menopause is. Tip - if it is one of those days where hot flashes are frequent and strong - put on a sweatband and go weeding. mowing or some other sweaty labor. You'll find that you won't notice the flash as much and can put that frustration to great work on the weeds or whatever. Hang in there. All things pass in time.....some sooner then others! I too am 55 and have been going through this for over 10 years now (counting the perimenopause). Talk to your OBGYN for serious solutions to the M problem and make sure they know about the E problem too. Now - scream, throw something that won't break then go stand in a cool shower.............

Re: Menopause and seizures Submitted by LindaMitchell on Sun, 2009-03-15 - 22:31 hi all, I was redirected to check out menopause and seizures by someone on another chat forum because after being seizure free basically for 14 years, the last 6 months my Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy has become refractory - with lately 40+ jerks a night. I am 55 and have gone through menopause - now don't get angry - without one hot flash or other side effect. So it never even occurred to me that these jerks could be caused by menopause. Basically at this point the docs are so bewildered that they want me to go through - what would be my first VEEG. Does anyone else have anything that remotely relates to JME getting worse after menopause?

Watch your Soy & Caffiene intake. What worked for me is cutting out Soy Milk for Organic lowfat Milk. Cutting my caffiene in more than half cut my seizures by more than 50% too.. Caffiene can obviously interact with seizure meds and cause a major problem. For me its been with Keppra XR) It actually changed the total quality of my life, I was housebound from seizures until I cut way down on both.. Good Luck !

They tried blaming it on the type 1 diabetes that had started 2 years earlier but then changed their mind and said they had no idea what caused it. The seizure happened in the middle of the night as did the following grand mals. The various anti-seizure medication I have had over the years, and I have tried 14 different kinds, have seemed to stop the grand mals but I have continued to have complex partial seizures, the dejz vu type, since, running 2-6 a month. Last year I had a vagus nerve stimulator implanted. We are still adjusting it. Last month I had seizures every Sunday. (At least I knew when they would hit) When they implanted the stimulator, they paralized my left vocal cord so now I constantly sound like I have a really bad cold. The seizures or the medication I have taken for the last almost 14 years had taken away my long term memory. I no longer remember my life, only stories I have told repeatedly do I remember. I no longer remember my wedding, my children's growing-up, the places we've lived, the trips we've taken.......my husband goes with me to the doctor in case he asks a question concerning something that happed a while back. All I want to know is what has caused these seizures?!?!?!?! All I get is, I don't know. That's what the Mayo Clinic told me. They wanted to take out a portion of my temporal lobe, but it would take more of my memory so I nixed the idea. They only gave it a 60% chance of it doing any good anyway. All along I've wondered if it have to do with menopause, but all the doctors I've had, and I've had several, have just sluffed if off. I just moved to a new area and got a new doctor. I think he's giving menopause and hormones a thought. I'm keeping my fingers crossed. It was really nice knowing that someone else out there had the same seizure problem.

I attached a graph of the ages of my seizures and the homone levels averaged during a womens life. I think its pretty clear. granted there wrere adjustments to meds etc. but the pattern is so amazingly clear that when progesterone takes a fall so do I.

Re: Menopause and seizures Submitted by buckaroo2 on Thu, 2009-05-21 - 09:32 Hi, I was diagnosed at 6 yrs.of age,didn't have any seizures(what I called seizures) until 5 months before my periods started which was 2 mos. before I turned 13. I have 6 children,ages 34,32,25,24,18 and 12. I had at least 1 seizure within 4 wks.of giving birth to all but the first one. The last one was split in half, I could tell that I wasn't done with it, and 8 days later, it finished. My doctor, from India, put me on the correct dosage for me and have been seizure free since. I take dilantin 4 a day, and have been on phenobarbital since I was 6 yrs. old. I started off with petit mal seizures,but didn't count them. After numerous drs and eeg's, I decided to be completely honest. I also had a quack doctor. Check your doctor out. If your instincts tell you he's wrong,he probably is. Get a second opinion. I knew since my second child, that mine were related to my hormones. I worried about menopause, but seeing how I'm being regulated, my blood levels are checked 2 times a yr., I found out I had nothing to worry about. Stress is very much a factor. So is worrying and losing sleep over it. Just relax,pray,read a book, talk to others,find something to reduce the stress load. You have to take care of yourself. We all support each other.

I was switched to a New Medication, I had been treated with Dilantin & Lamictal, my Neurologist changed me from Lamictal to Keppra, I have not had any since. In my 20's I had suffered a miscarriage & my Horomones went crazy afterward, & for a short time I had Panic Attacks, but as my body adjusted itself so did the frequency of the seizures. Stress is a Major trigger also, & now trying to find Health Insurance that is affordable & Not a Scam, is really testing me since my husband retired, I was on his insurance plan. Its hard enough having this disease, but the insurance companies make it even worse by penalizing us for having it with astronomical rates, as of right now I have none. You will be in my thoughts & prayers & hope everything will be well for you.

I was switched to a New Medication, I had been treated with Dilantin & Lamictal, my Neurologist changed me from Lamictal to Keppra, I have not had any since. In my 20's I had suffered a miscarriage & my Horomones went crazy afterward, & for a short time I had Panic Attacks, but as my body adjusted itself so did the frequency of the seizures. Stress is a Major trigger also, & now trying to find Health Insurance that is affordable & Not a Scam, is really testing me since my husband retired, I was on his insurance plan. Its hard enough having this disease, but the insurance companies make it even worse by penalizing us for having it with astronomical rates, as of right now I have none. You will be in my thoughts & prayers & hope everything will be well for you. Re: Menopause and seizures Submitted by LindaMitchell on Sat, 2009-05-23 - 10:20 Well, I had the VEEG in April and then last week went back to the dr to get a full understanding of what happened, even though he had given me a good one while in hospital. Basically I have JME (juvenile myoclonic epilepsy) that started when I was 13 - on my birthday. I am 55 now and had been fairly well controlled until Oct of last year. The VEEG proved that I had abnormal discharges - but not necessarily correlated to the jerks I was experiencing and they could see were waking me up. He only kept me in for 2 days because he is assured I have JME and didn't want to wean me off my medicine and cause me to have a seizure and then not be able to be controlled with the meds I'm on (Depakine Chrono - similar to Depakote; Keppra and then he raised the Klonopin) When I asked what caused the change after being so well-controlled for 16 years, he said he didn't know - could be stress, could be menopause - I'm postmenopausal - , etc. So much of this is an art rather than a science. He just says the seizures sometimes change as our bodies do. Because the neurological nurse practitioner asked me about why I kept waking up at night - at first I didn't think anything of it. Then I realised it was because I had to use the toilet - which has been me for ages. I was referred to a good urogynecologist, and she is now treating me for those issues. That's helping me to sleep better and now for 2 weeks there have been no jerks. All I can say women, is I have learned the hard way, to get everything checked out. We all know that not sleeping can cause seizures, so if any of you also struggle with that, I would encourage you to get checked out.

For what it's worth, Linda Re: Menopause and seizures Submitted by kimberlyhart on Thu, 2010-02-25 - 12:00 I had my first seizure @ 50 and it was a Tonic Clonic and exactly 1 year later I had another Tonic Clonic. Never had any problems before, but I was going through menopause and having sleep problems. I found a good Neuro,but he so dismisses the idea that my seizures could be due to hormones. I did do a 24 hour EEG and had spikes? during the night only. I guess that would also contribute to the fact I never could sleep. My 2nd seizure totally flipped me out. It took me awhile to come around and I could not get the words right when I was asked a question. I know Duke University and there is a research hospital in N.Y. are doing research projects with epilepsy. Newsweek had a whole article called \"The Mystery of Epilepsy\" dated Apr. 20, 2009 that was good,but in my opinion there is so much more to find out. I feel like my seizures had a lot to do with the fact that I was going through menopause. My P.A. @ my GYN offfice is great and she ran blood tests and said my levels of hormones were extremly low along with other blood level factors. It will take some time to convince Neuro's that any of that has a connection. So with that I am on Tegretol 300mg. twice a day. This is just my opinion,but I am switching to a female Neuro that was recommended to me by a dear friend who is a nurse. I thought I would be able to face menopause with the attitude that it was no big deal. So much has happened medically to me in the past two years that I wonder what is next! I have always been healthy and optimistic,and now I feel like someone else! I know it helps to research and be an advocate for your own healthcare. I am doing everything I can.

Best of Wishes to All and Hang in There! Re: Menopause and seizures Submitted by pewter on Sun, 2013-01-13 - 09:52 I experienced full Partial-Complex seizures for some years BEFORE perimenopause. Yet, now that I've been diagnosed with peri-menopause (am 46) and have had symptoms of such for a little over a year... had noticed my seizures changed over this past year. Whereas they were, initially, hit or miss and sporadic.. never ever being able to pinpoint when or if... NEVER at night after I laid down to sleep or upon awaking... and ruled out to NOT be hormonal by neurologists by the calendar I was keeping at the time.... to now, I have mainly Partials, I've started having more and more at night after I've laid down to sleep or just upon awaking (will actually awaken because of them) in the very early cusp of daylight, to them going into clusters of many over a period of 3-5 days. I still have... the sporadic hit or miss one or two in between... but as time has passed, they've changed and I do believe they to have changed due to the onset of peri-menopause. They are more frequent, NOT every month however, but also different in having the night ones and clustering. I experienced full Partial-Complex seizures for some years BEFORE perimenopause.
