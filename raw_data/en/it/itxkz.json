Furthermore, every credit firm which can arrange to do so will do its best to crawl in under the revolving credit exemption or under the $10 exemption on as many transactions as possible, so while it is a one-twelfth-truth-in-lending billon open-end credit, it is a no-truth bill on any credit transaction costing less than $110. CONSUMERS MUST GET INTO THIS DATTLE So while I am pleased that we have completed committee action and ap- proved what in many respects is a good, strong bill compared to the Senate bill, I am certainly not expressing any great jubilation until we get a bill through the House which requires that all interest rates and credit costs in consumer credit transactions be set forth in a completely straightforward and undisguised man-ner, and that means annual rate dis-closure across the board, and applyingequally to all who give credit. When consumers pay their monthly bills next week or next month, I hopethey will pay particular attention to thecredit charges for which they are given little or no explanation, and then wish me luck on this fight. It is their fight. They can help in this fight by writing to their own Members of Congress for a billthat will require the same disclosure for all. It is expected this bill will come to the House floor for vote late in January. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES XEDNESI)AY, NOVEMBEIE 29, 1967 The House met at 12 o'clock noon. The Chaplain, Rev. Edward G. Latch, D.D., offered the following prayer: Let Thy mercy, 0 Lord, be upon us, according as we hope in Thee.-Psalm 33: 22. Eternal God, our Father, in this time of trouble and this day of demanding duties and persistent problems we bow in Thy presence praying that we may be calm and confident in the discharge of the responsibilities placed upon us. We would be true, for there are those who trust us; we would be pure, for there are those who care; we would be strong, for there is much to suffer; we would be brave, for there is much to dare. Keep us ever faithful in the great office to which we have been elected and ever loyal in the grand adventure which seeks the high road of freedom and justice for all. Cleanse the thoughts of our hearts that we may live in good will with our fellow man and in good faith with Thee. Amen. THE JOURNAL The Journal of the proceedings of yesterday was read and approved.

CRITICISM OF GENERAL DE GAULLE Mr. FARBSTEIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to address the House for 1 minute, to revise and extend my re- marks, and to include extraneous matter.The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. FARBSTEIN. Mr. Speaker, though I have long been an admirer of General de Gaulle, I cannot help but conclude from his recent press conference that he has, in his zealousness to free his country of what he considers excessive American influence, completely lost his perspective on foreign affairs. At age 77, he has be- come obsessed, I fear, that America is all that stands between him and the res- toration of France as a great power. His comments about Canada were ab- surd. His remarks about Israel and world Jewry were insulting. His decision to stand firm on the exclusion of Britain from the Common Market, will, I be- lieve, prove unwise in the long course of history. General de Gaulle's chief criterion for foreign policy appears to be to frustrate the United States, whether he deals with international finance, the Mideast, or the countries which are our friends. General de Gaulle's long career has been too bril- liant to end on this note of personal ran- cor and narrow chauvinism, sentiments which are by no means shared by the French people. ESCALATION INCREASES AND SO DOES DANGER Mr. DOW. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani- mous consent to address the House for 1 minute, to revise and extend my remarks, and to include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. DOW. Mr. Speaker, of immense moment these days is the background de- bate on whether to escalate in Vietnam or not. Suggestions have been heard that the departure of the Secretary of De- fense, Robert S. McNamara, is related to this debate about escalation. Further, we have the proposal by General Eisenhower for an end run around the DMZ to enter North Vietnam and battle the main forces there. This issue is the most critical one in our present time because it can involve us more deeply in what might become a world war. We should have no doubt that the response to an end run around the DMZ will be equal to our effort. If North Viet- nam is unable to provide the forces, there34124 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE will be volunteers provided by her major allies. In the face of evidence that our coun- try is \"cry evenly divided on the ques- tion of pursuing the conflict in Viet- nam, I deplore any form of escalation. Deescalation should be the order of the day. I have spoken in this vein a number of times recently here on the floor of Congress. I hope others will join me. The vain pursuit of a will-o'-the-wisp victory can enmesh America and all great na- tions in a vicious entanglement from which there will be no return for any- body. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Americans to make known to our President that the successor to the position of Secretary of Defense ought to be a man who has dis- cretion about the war's extension and will favor dccscalation rather than esca- lation. INDIGNITIES SHOWERED UPON THIS COUNTRY BY FRENCH PRESIDENT DE GAULLE Mr. WOLFF. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend my remarks. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. WOLFF. Mr. Speaker, it is not in the best interests of the United States to passively submit to the indignities show- ered upon this country by French Presi- dent de Gaulle. Blinded by visions of grandeur to the very fact that he and his country owe their existence and pros- perity to the United States, De Gaulle has set out to undermine the dollar and disrupt the Western Alliance. The United States must replace pas- sivity with action. To date I have rec- ommended that all French assets in this country be frozen until France begins payment on her outstanding World War I debt of $6.8 billion and that American tourism to France be ended immedi- ately. Now I urge that the United States sus- pend all proposed purchases of the French-made Concorde, which has not yet satisfied the American public with re- spect to the problem caused by sonic boom to evidence through yet another means our opposition to Gaullist policies. The Concorde, a supersonic aircraft will be an important element in the French economy in the next decade and suspension of planned purchases by American Airlines would be another way of demonstrating to De Gaulle the seri- ousness of his action and the need for an immediate payment plan for France's 50- year-old debt. DREW PEARSON AND THE MANURE HEAP Mr. FINO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani- mous consent to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend my remarks. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York?There was no objection. Mr. FINO. Mr. Speaker, last week I took the floor to raise a point of per- sonal privilege concerning a column written by Drew Pearson. Evidently Mr. Pearson found my re- marks about his manure farm rather disconcerting, because he has seen fit to attack me once again in this morn- ing's column. Today's thrust from the manure heap is directed at my participation in the recent truth-in-lending debate in the House Banking Committee. Citing me as the chief Republican opponent of full disclosure of interest rates, Mr. Pearson once again referred to me as \"the little Italian-American.\" I am proud to be an Italo-American, but I suggest that Mr. Pearson is trying to use the term as one of insult. Mr. Pearson should confine himself to his politics and his manure pile, and not attempt to smear the hard-working Italo-American popu- lation of this Nation. I would also like to say that Mr. Pearson should spend more of his manure profits on research work. His references to the truth-in-lending bill produced by the House Banking Com- mittee are totally inaccurate. First of all, Pearson says that the Senate bill has been weakened by the House. This is pure stupidity. The Washington Post, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Associated Press, and United Press International have all cited the House-reported bill as stronger than the Senate bill. Second, the Johnson administration does not oppose this bill. The truth-in- lending bill reported by a 30-to-1 vote yesterday is similar to a compromise bill offered to the Johnson administra- tion 2 weeks ago by Banking Com- mittee Republicans. Every indication points to White House enthusiasm for this compromise bill. And why not? It is far stronger than the Senate-passed bill praised by former Senator Paul Douglas, the longtime chief protagonist of truth in lending. The only people who are lobbying for ^Drew Pearson's position are the fat-cat bankers-they want the Sullivan bill. Maybe this explains why Drew Pearson wrote the story. The American Bankers Association is arm in arm with Drew Pearson's stand on the revolving credit provision of the truth-in-lending bill. This is a matter of public record. Maybe Drew Pearson needs a bank loan to expand his manure sales operation? Let me say in closing that our truth- in-lending bill includes administrative enforcement and advertising provisions which the Senate bill does not include, as well as first mortgage and wage gar- nishment provisions. It is a good tough bill which I am proud to have sup- ported. Evidently Drew Pearson has not read it. He must be spending too much time on his manure farm. SERIOUS THREAT TO DOMESTIC LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY Mr. BERRY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani- mous consent to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend my remarks.The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from South Dakota? There was no objection. Mr. BERRY. Mr. Speaker, I have demanded immediate action from the Department of Agriculture and the De- partment of Commerce to embargo all forms of meat and livestock from Argen- tina and Great Britain because both countries are experiencing a serious epi- demic of foot-and-mouth disease. I have also demanded that Agriculture and Commerce clamp a ban on all im- ports of cattle, sheep, and pigs until importing countries prove their country is free from this infectious disease. According to the British press, up- ward of 200,000 head of meat animals have been slaughtered in northern Great Britain alone and farmers have placed a voluntary quarantine on their farms pro- hibiting neighbors from visiting. They have canceled livestock shows, meetings of farm groups, horse races, and so forth, in order to halt the spread of this dan- gerous virus. Italy and Holland have already banned imports of cattle, sheep, and pigs from Britain. Ireland has not only banned all livestock imports, but is now refusing to admit any vehicles by ferry from Brit- ain. The Irish Agriculture Ministry has appealed to countrymen working in Britain not to return home until the epidemic is over. The United States is importing from 8 to 10 percent of all domestically con- sumed cattle, sheep, and pork. It is bad enough for American farmers to be re- quired to meet competition from areas where production is less expensive than in the United States without having to take the chance of losing everything through a foot-and-mouth epidemic brought about by meat imports from infected countries. If this administration is interested in preserving the American farmer and the domestic livestock industy, it must im- mediately take every precaution to pre- vent the foot-and-mouth virus from get- ting a start in this country. DE GAULLE, INGRATE Mr. KUYKENDALL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to address the House for 1 minute, to revise and extend my remarks, and to include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. In Flanders fields the poppies blow Between the crosses, row on row. -JOHN McCRAE. Mr. KUYKENDALL. Mr. Speaker, I wonder if Charles de Gaulle remembered those crosses the other day when he launched his attack upon the United States. When he accused us of tryir.; to take over France, did he remember the Marne, Chateau-Thierry, the beaches of Normandy littered with thousands of American dead who came to save France, to drive the Nazis from Paris and make it safe for General de Gaulle to reenter the city as a hero?34125 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 It is quite apparent that he chooses to forget the $7,152,985,471 France owes us. Perhaps it is time to remind the French President of his obligations by citing a few facts. At the end of September, France held $600 million against our gold supply. Since January 1962, France has withdrawn $2,369,000,000 in gold from the United States in spite of the fact that de Gaulle denies he is trying to under- mine the dollar. France is now third in the world in gold reserves with over $5 billion. Certainly the French President has a convenient and short memory. It is re- grettable that he chooses to end a friend- ship of two centuries between two great allies. It is sad to see him leading the French people down the road to disaster as he courts the dictators in the Kremlin at the expense of those who have always been ready and willing to help France defend her cherished freedoms. But if this is his choice, then I see no course open to us than to accept the fact that we can no longer depend upon France as an ally in the current struggle for freedom in the world. Therefore we should consider some im- mediate steps to strengthen our position by taking whatever action necessary in- cluding a demand for payment by France of her long outstanding debt, and by dis- couraging American tourists from visit- ing France and helping to bolster her economy with hundreds of millions of dollars a year. ANOTHER AMERICAN CITY VOTES IN SUPPORT OF THE AMERICAN PRESENCE IN VIETNAM Mr. ALBERT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend my remarks. The SPEAKER. Is there objection tothe request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. ALBERT. Mr. Speaker, the voters of Cambridge, Mass., have endorsed by a 3-to-2 margin the American commitment in Vietnam by voting against the with- drawal of our forces there. This, it seems to me, is an accurate indication of how the American people feel about the Vietnamese war. Nobody is very happy about it-but we are deter- mined to see it through. This is the second American city to vote against American withdrawal. Re- cently, the voters of San Francisco over-whelmingly supported the American presence in Vietnam. Mr. Speaker. Cambridge, of course, in- cludes Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, two of the great universities of the world. It seems to me that this might beliethe frequently heard charge that the in-tellectual community of the country is overwhelmingly opposed to our policy in Vietnam. I believe that President Johnson can take heart from this vote, for it showsthat the American people understand that we cannot back down on our com- mitment to the people of South Vietnam. It shows that our Nation has the patienceand the courage to see this conflict through until peace can be realized in that war-torn land. Mr. HOLIFIELD. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. ALBERT. I yield to the gentleman. Mr. HOLIFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I con- cur in the view expressed by the gentle- man from Oklahoma. No poll is as meaningful as an actual vote. Yesterday, the results of a citywide referendum on Vietnam were released in Cambridge, Mass., showing that voters oppose by a 3-to-2 margin the immediate withdrawal of American troops in Viet- nam. This vote, coupled with similar results obtained by voters in San Francisco, demonstrates that the American people do not want their country to renege on its commitment to the people of South Vietnam, no matter how distasteful this war may be. It is interesting to note that the anti- war group in Cambridge had announced prior to the vote that a vote of more than 40 percent against the war would be a victory for their group. They received 39 percent of the vote. This vote is clearly a victory for rea- son. We simply cannot withdraw from this war until aggression halts and Hanoi agrees to negotiations for a peace- ful settlement. This is what President Johnson has been saying all along. And yesterday, the voters of Cambridge made clear that they agree with him. Mr. HAYS. Mr. Speaker, will the gen- tleman yield? Mr. ALBERT. I yield to the gentleman. Mr. HAYS. Mr. Speaker, I concur in the views of the gentleman from Okla- homa. I would just like to make one further comment. Professor Galbraith is quoted as say- ing that \"the opposition vote was a re- markable showing.\" I cannot quite buy that, since this city is his home base and it has been a source of a great deal of protest against the war in Vietnam, led by this same Professor Galbraith. If there is anything remarkable about him, it is that Galbraith, a man who was such a miserable failure as an ambas- sador-I would say one of the worst am- bassadors we ever had in the history of this country-would be listened to by anybody, anywhere. MEETING ON HIGH INTEREST RATES CALLED BY 30 HOUSE MEMBERS FOR 4 P.M., THURSDAY Mr. PATMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to address the House for 1 minute, to revise and extend my remarks, and to include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. PATMAN. Mr. Speaker, 30 Mem- bers of the House have jointly called a meeting for 4 p.m., Thursday, to discuss possible solutions to the monetary crisis being created by high interest rates. Themeeting will be held in the hearing roomof the Banking and Currency Committee2128 Rayburn House Office Building. Mr. Speaker, I hope that every Memberwho is sincerely concerned about thecrush of high interest rates on theAmerican people will take time to par-ticipate in this meeting. Interest rates are at the highest levelsof this century and are creating a tre-mendous burden on the Federal budgetas well as the farmer, the small business-man, the worker, the homebuyer, andthe average consumer. It is becoming obvious that the Congress must act and I believe that Thursday's meeting will give us a great opportunity to draft a coursethat will gain broad support. Participating in calling this meeting are the following Members: FRANK ANNUNZIO, of Illinois; WILLIAM A. BAR- RETT, of Pennsylvania; GEORGE E. BROWN, JR., of California; DOMINICK V. DANIELS, of New Jersey; CHARLES C. DIGGS, JR., of Michigan; DON EDWARDS, of California; HENRY GONZALEZ, of Texas; RICHARD T. HANNA, of California; HENRY HELSTOSKI, of New Jersey; CHET HOLIFIELD, of KARTH, ROBERT KASTENMEIER, of Wisconsin; JOSEPH G. MINISH, of New Jersey; PATSY T. MINK, Hawaii; JOHN E. Moss, of Cali- fornia; BARRATT O'HARA, of Illinois; ARNOLD OLSEN, of Montana; PAT- MAN, of Texas; ROMAN C. PUCINSKI, Of Illinois; HENRY S. REUSS, of Wisconsin; GEORGE M. RHODES, Of Pennsylvania; PETER W. RODINO, JR., of New Jersey; DANIEL J. RONAN, of Illinois; EDWARD R. ROYBAL, of California; WILLIAM F. RYAN, of New York; TOM STEED, of Oklahoma; LEONOR K. SULLIVAN, of Missouri; CHARLES A. VANIK, of Ohio; LESTER L. WOLFF, of New York; and JIM WRIGHT, of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I place in the RECORD a copy of a memorandum which accom- panied the meeting invitation: To: All Members of the House. Subject: High interest crisis. Interest rates are at the highest levels of this century, and, in fact, some are higher than at any time since the Civil War. In recent weeks, we have seen the Treasury pay as high as 5%% on bonds fully secured by the credit of the United States Govern- ment. There are reports that other securi- ties of the U.S. Government will bring yields In excess of 6/2 % in coming weeks. We can- not long endure such extortionate interest rates. The Federal Reserve Board has heightened the problem through its decision of Sunday, November 19, to raise the discount rate from 4% to 41/2 %. This was a signal for the banks and other financial institutions to raise in- terest rates to the American consumer. The crush of high interest rates is dras- tically complicating our Federal Budget problems. When the fiscal year started on July 1, we had budgeted $14.2 billion to pay interest on the national debt-second only to the allocations for national defense. Now interest rates have risen tremendously and the total cost of interest in the Federal Budget may exceed $15 billion this year. There is much to talk about a tax increase but it is obvious that high interest rates are gobbling up Federal revenues faster than we could ever raise taxes. Based on interest rates in effect when President Truman left office in 1952, we are paying about $7 billion annually in excess interest charges on the national debt-a sum roughly equivalent to the proposed tax increase.34126 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE As we all know, the burden of high inter- est rates falls unevenly on the economy, cre- sting the greatest hardship among low in- come and moderate income families who must borrow to survive. President Johnson put the problem this way In a statement at the White House on November 20: \"People in this country are paying usuri- ous rates of interest and the poor people pay the highest rates usually. The poorer you are the higher your money costs are.\" It is unquestionably the duty of the U.S. Congress to act in the face of a monetary crisis of this proportion. We are convinced that the American people are fed up with high interest rates and are no longer satis- fied with leaving the total job to the Federal Reserve System. We believe the American people want action by their elected repre- sentatives. In the past, the Unofficial Steering Com- mittee to Oppose Any Increase in the 41/4% Ceiling has done much to hold down inter- est rates. This Committee has prevented the increase in rates on long term Government obligations in both Republican and Demo- cratic Administrations. We know that we can hold down interest rates when enough Members express concern. It is obvious that the situation will con- tinue to grow worse unless the Congress clearly expresses its intent to bring down interest rates. HIGH INTEREST RATES Mr. ANDERSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend my remarks. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mr. ANDERSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I certainly would like to re- spond to the very generous invitation that has just been extended by the chair- man of the Banking and Currency Com-\" mittee to attend this meeting on the interest rate crisis. I just wonder, how- ever, if someone of my own persuasion would attend, if we would not be about as welcome as the town drunk at a church-lawn social, because we might come and suggest a little economy. As I look over the list of names as they have been signed, I recognize, I think without exception, the names of people who have voted for every single authori- zation and appropriations that has brought about the financial crisis that now confronts the Nation. Mr. ARENDS. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. ANDERSON of Illinois. I yield to the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. ARENDS. It is interesting to hear the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Currency, the gentleman from Texas [Mr. PATMAN], who has over many, many years repeatedly referred to the Republican Party as the party of high interest rates, now on the floor of the House putting the shoe on the foot where it belongs, and clearly indicating for all to know that the Democratic Party wins all prizes as being the party of high interest rates. Mr. PATMAN. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. ANDERSON of Illinois. I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. PATMAN. I wish to assure thegentleman that he will be welcome at the meeting. So will the Republican lead- ers and all the members of the minority party. I hope they will all come and get religion in opposition to the high in- terest rates that are so destructive to our economy. Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. ANDERSON of Illinois. I yield to the gentleman from Ohio. Mr. ASHBROOK. The gentleman has heard the old story about the firebug who advocated that waterlines be increased from 2 to 3 inches to help put out the fire. Mr. ALBERT. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. ANDERSON of Illinois. I am glad to yield to the gentleman from Okla- homa. Mr. ALBERT. I have not seen the Re- publicans so apparently happy in a long time. DE GAULLE DOES FRANCE AND THE WORLD A DISSERVICE Mr. FRIEDEL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend my remarks. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Maryland? There was no objection. Mr. FRIEDEL. Mr. Speaker, it sad- dens me and, I am sure it does most of my colleagues in the Congress, to witness the apparent increasing senility of the present leader of France-General de Gaulle. Unfortunately, his strange be- havior will harm every country in the West, including France. General de Gaulle's press conference day before yesterday will only increase already existing world tensions and ag- gravate a bad situation. I feel deep sor- row that through such action, our past harmonious relations with France may suffer. Twice in the first half of this century the United States has saved France from Sbeing conquered, and we made a tremen- dous sacrifice of American lives and ex- pended almost superhuman effort on be- half of democracy in the world. An analysis of De Gaulle's speech re- flected the fact that he said \"No\" five different ways to British entry into the Common Market, unjustly condemned the State of Israel, wrongly urged es- tablishment of an independent French State of Quebec in Canada, and, in pass- ing, attacked the American dollar and, in his word, the \"odious\" American war in Vietnam. Nor should w& forget his ill- conceived decision to withdraw France from the military structure of NATO. The World War I indebtedness of the Government of France due and unpaid as of June 30, 1967, was over $5 billion, including $2 million of the principal sum and almost $3 billion on interest arrear- ages. Unmatured principal was $1.7 bil- lion. No payments have been made since 1931. The tctal obligation which might be said to have been outstanding on June 30, 1967, including both matured and un- matured principal and interest arrear- ages to that date, was $6.8 billion.It is also a fact that France has at- tained substantial economic growth and stability since World War II with U.S. grant military and economic aid total- ing $7.5 billion. In addition, it clearly appears that France is intent upon undermining the U.S. dollar. Since January 1962, under De Gaulle, France has withdrawn over $2.3 billion in gold from our country. Mr. Speaker, I call upon the President and the State Department to immedi- ately take such steps as may be necessary to compel the Republic of France to re- pay its long past due indebtedness to the United States. VIVE LA COMPAGNIE Mr. HAYS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani- mous consent to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend my remarks. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. HAYS. Mr. Speaker, I got some in- telligence, I guess the same way that columnists get their intelligence, of a recent Cabinet meeting in France at which the President of France proposed to the Cabinet that he might not be im- mortal and they ought to think about a place to bury him. So at the next meeting they suggested it would be nice if he would be buried at the Invalides alongside the tomb of Napoleon. He demurred, saying: I can't be buried by him because he was only a corporal. So they went back to think about it some more, and they suggested at the second meeting that he be buried at Colombey-les-deux-Eglises, which is the little village at which he has his country home, and which he likes very much. They made the proposal, and he demurred again, saying: That is 130 miles from Paris. It is too far for tourists to travel. They set their heads to the problem again. Finally one man in the Cabinet said: Well, he hates the British even worse than he hates the Americans. He reveres Joan of Arc. So why don't we propose to bury him exactly on the spot where the British burned Joan of Arc at the stake? They thought this would be a good idea. At the next Cabinet meeting they made that proposal to him. He thought it over for awhile and he said: Yes, that is the right place. She deserves this honor. CALL OF THE HOUSE Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Speaker, I make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER. Evidently a quorum is not present. Mr. ALBERT. Mr. Speaker, I move a call of the House. A call of the House was ordered. The Clerk called the roll, and the fol- lowing Members failed to answer to their names:34127 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 Abbitt Annunzio Ashley Bates Broomfield Brown, Ford, Gerald R. Resnick Fountain Rhodes. Ariz. Frelinghuysen Roberts Gibbons St. Onge Halleck Schweiker Hardy Sikes Taylor Mathias, Md. Teague, Calif. Matsunaga Whitten Miller, Calif. Williams, Miss. Pepper Willis Pool Young Purcell The SPEAKER. On this rollcall, 385 Members have answered to their names, a quorum. By unanimous consent, further pro- ceedings under the call were dispensed with. LSD FILM Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani- mous consent to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend my remarks. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Missouri? There was no objection. Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to remind all Members and through them their staffs and fami- lies of the showing in the morning at 9 o'clock in the caucus room of the Cannon Building of the Navy prepared film on the drug, LSD. You were notified by mimeo, 1 week ago this morning. This is a particularly propitious time for all Members and their staffs to get straight information and complete knowledge that is being given to the na- val seamen and officers concerning this drug, lysergic acid. This is a \"landmark\" film and I think it will be of value to all of you in helping to answer current and multiple questions that may come from your constituency and even from your courts. This is an unusually well done piece of work which your three \"doctors in the House\"-Dr. T. MORAN, Dr. T. L. CAR- TER, and Dr. D. G. HALL-have reviewed and join in this invitation. It has been prepared by a young com- mander of the U.S. Navy, Dr. Miner, who is a skilled pharmacist as well as a phy- sician. I recommend that all see it at 9 o'clock in the morning in the caucus room of the Cannon Building, and it will be repeated at 4 o'clock tomorrow through the courtesy of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs which is making this room available and the courtesy of the U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery as arranged by the congres- sional liaison unit and our own USMC reservist, the reading clerk, Joe Bartlett. SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTS OF 1967 Mr. BURTON of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend my remarks. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection.Mr. BURTON of California. Mr. Speaker, during the closing minutes of the consideration of the Social Security Amendments of 1967, the proceedings of the other body will indicate that the Governor of California urged, and with- out debate there was accepted, an amendment to the social security amendment that, if adopted in the con- ference, will result in 400,000 Califor- nians who are aged, blind, or crippled not receiving 1 penny of increase as a result of the action of this Congress with reference to improvements in the social security bill. This action of the Governor of Cali- fornia is unconscionable. He is making an effort to rob California's neediest citizens in some lamentable effort to beef up the California State treasury. I would hope that the conferees on this side would reject this amendment. It is an amendment that applies uniquely and exclusively to the State of California, and I would hope that we would not permit the aged, the blind, and the crippled of our State to be denied the pittance of an increase that is proposed in the bill because of the fiscal needs of the Republican Governor of our State. AMERICAN REVOLUTION BICEN- TENNIAL COMMISSION Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I call up the conference report on the bill (H.R. 8629) to amend the act of July 4, 1966-Public Law 89-491-and ask unanimous consent that the state- ment of the managers on the part of the House be read in lieu of the report. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. The Clerk read the statement. The conference report and statement are as follows: CONFERENCE REPORT (H. REPT. NO. 987) The committee of conference on the dis- agreeing votes of the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 8629) to amend the Act of July 4, 1966 (Pub- lic Law 89-491) having met, after full and free conference, have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective Houses as follows: That the Senate recede from its amend- ment. BYRON G. ROGERS, BASIL L. WHITENER, ANDREW JACOBS, Jr., RICHARD H. POFF, CHARLES E. WIGGINS, Managers on the Part of the House. EVERETT MCKINLEY DIRKSEN, JOHN L. McCLELLAN, Managers on the Part of the Senate. STATEMENT The managers on the part of the House at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 8629) to amend the Act of July 4, 1966 (Public Law 89-491) submit the following statement in explana- tion of the effect of the action agreed upon by the conferees and recommended in the accompanying conference report: The Senate passed H.R. 8629 with an amendment. The House disagreed to theamendment and requested a conference; theSenate then agreed to the conference. H.R. 8629 as it passed the House added theSecretary of Commerce as an ex officio mem-ber of the American Revolution Bicenten.nial Commission, extended the time withinwhich the Commission shall report to thePresident to July 4, 1969, and authorized theappropriation of funds to finance the workof the Commission. These provisions are not in disagreement.The Senate amendment added a provisionwhich increased from four members to sixmembers each the House and Senate mem-bership on the Commission. The conference report recommends thatthe Senate recede from its amendment. BYRON G. ROGERS, BASIL L. WHITENER, ANDREW JACOBS, Jr., RICHARD H. POFF, CHARLES E. WIGGINS, Managers on the Part of the House. Mr. POFF. Mr. Speaker, will the gen- tleman yield? Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. I yield to the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. POFF. Mr. Speaker, I understand that the conference report recommends acceptance of the House version of the legislation. Am I correct? Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. The gen- tleman is absolutely correct. Mr. POFF. Mr. Speaker, I endorse and enthusiastically support the conference report. Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I move the previous question on the conference report. The previous question was ordered. The conference report was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. FEDERAL MEAT INSPECTION ACT Mr. POAGE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan- imous consent to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 12144) to clarify and otherwise amend the Meat Inspection Act, to provide for cooperation with ap- propriate State agencies with respect to State meat inspection programs, and for other purposes, with a Senate amend- ment thereto, disagree to the Senate amendment, and agree to the conference asked by the Senate. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. The SPEAKER. For what purpose does the gentleman from Iowa rise? PREFERENTIAL MOTION OFFERED BY MR. SMITH OF IOWA Mr. SMITH of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I offer a preferential motion. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. SMITH of Iowa moves that the man- agers on the part of the House be instructed to agree to the Senate amendment to H.R. 12144. The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Iowa is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. SMITH of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the Senate amended the House meat inspection bill primarily in one area, which I believe should be ac- cepted without any further doubt. The Senate bill is like the House bill34128 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE in almost all particulars except with respect to the meat and meat food prod- ucts that are slaughtered or processed in nonfederally inspected plants. Under the House bill we provided matching funds to the States that wanted to do this, but there was no assurance that it would be done in any given time. The Senate provided the following: First. The States will have 2 years to set up meat inspection programs at least equal to Federal standards and they can be given a third year if the Secretary of Agriculture determines that the State in question will at the end of that year have such standards in operation. Second. At the end of the 2- or 3-year period, if the State has failed to apply Federal standards to plants within the State, the Federal meat inspection pro- gram will go into effect in that State. Third. A Governor may waive the 2- year period and request immediate Fed- eral inspection until such time as the State brings its meat inspection program up to Federal standards. Fourth. During the interim 2- or 3- year period, the Secretary of Agriculture shall have access to the nonfederally inspected plants to determine whether they are producing adulterated meat or meat food products which would en- danger public health. If he finds that they are, he may institute a procedure leading to the establishment of Federal Jurisdiction over those particular plants. Fifth. There will be annual public re- ports to Congress on the operation and effectiveness of both Federal and State inspection systems. This particular amendment was not before the House, and we did not have any record vote concerning this particu- lar area. So that the conferees would not be going to the conference with the feel- ing that they have got to uphold House tradition and fight for every word in the House bill, and therefore not yield to the Senate, I think it would be good if the House would express itself on this in- struction for the conferees. I have discussed this at length with the various members of the committee and I believe it should be passed, Mr. Speaker. Mr. FEIGHAN. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. I yield to the gentleman from Ohio. Mr. FEIGHAN. Mr. Speaker, I com- pliment the distinguished gentleman from Iowa and support wholeheartedly his amendment. Mr. Speaker, I hope my fellow Mem- bers will vote to support the version of the meat inspection bill passed by theSenate. I was one of the cosponsors of H.R. 12145, the so-called Smith-Foley bill. That bill was a strong measure and would have protected the American consumer by extending the Federal meat inspection program to the large- and medium-sizedintrastate plants. Unfortunately, the House rejected the Smith-Foley bill. The bill which the House did pass makes a number of needed improvements but does nothing toward requiring that intrastate plants meet Federal standards.The bill which the Senate passed yes- terday contains all of the provisions in the House-passed bill, and in addition requires that intrastate plants meet Fed- eral standards within 2 or 3 years. The Senate bill is sound and strong legislation and will accomplish the pur- pose of the Smith-Foley bill. There is a wealth of evidence that many intrastate meat plants are operating under condi- tions which present a hazard to the health of the American consumer. The Senate bill will save consumers billions of dollars that they would other- wise pay for mislabeled and inferior products and will assure consumers that the health hazards will be removed and I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this stronger bill. Mr. BENNETT. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. I yield to the gen- tleman from Florida. Mr. BENNETT. Mr. Speaker, I con- gratulate the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. SMITH] for his effort to bring out the best possible meat inspection bill and I am inclined to agree with him that acceptance of the Senate amendments at this late date in the session probably offers the best chance to accomplish this objective. Therefore, I expect to support his motion. I would like to add that those who voted against the amendment of- ferred by him when the bill was under debate in the House included persons like myself who felt that the amendment offered by him then would be less likely to improve the inspection of all meat slaughtered for human consumption than would have been the House-passed bill. The Senate has brought in a bill that would apparently cure the defects of both the House bill and the Smith- Foley amendment offered during the House debate. Therefore, I think we should accept the Senate approach. Al- though perhaps it could be improved in .conference, perhaps it could also die there or come out less than it should be. On balance, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the gentleman from Iowa in the motion now before the House. Mr. HECHLER of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. I yield to the gen- tleman from West Virginia. Mr. HECHLER of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. SMITH] and the gentleman from Washington [Mr. FOLEY] have done such a thorough job of analyzing the needs of meat inspection legislation. Both gentlemen deserve the commendation of this House for their yeoman efforts. The consumers of this Nation can be grateful to them for help- ing to spotlight the problems involved, and for displaying the courage of their convictions in pressing for more strin- gent legislation to protect the health of our people. I am pleased, Mr. Speaker, that the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. SMIrrH] has offered his preferential motion. There are some who would take exception to this legislative technique because, in a pro- cedural sense, it tends to freeze in ad- vance the position of the House conferees. I respect the point of view of those whoraise this procedural question. Essen- tially, however, we face today a question of substance rather than one of pro- cedure, and that question is simply this: Do we want to take all necessary steps to protect our people from the danger of unclean, unsanitary conditions which threaten health? Under these circum- stances, Mr. Speaker, it seems to me to be the wise course to indicate to our House conferees how we feel on this vital issue. This we have an opportunity to do in voting for the preferential motion, which I shall support. Under unanimous consent, Mr. Speaker, I include an article from the November 28, 1967, issue of the Charles- ton Gazette concerning the State meat inspection program in West Virginia and how Federal legislation would \"beef up\" that program: U.S. LAW To \"BEEF UP\" STATE MEAT PROGRAM (By John G. Morgan) Under pending federal legislation, the State Agriculture Department would be in strong position to push faster for a full meat inspection program in West Virginia. A 1966 state law on the books has the approval of the Federal Meat Inspection Service. The federal law under consideration would vastly improve chances for full fund- ing of the state program. The department has an appropriation of about $150,000 for the present program, con- sidered good as far as it goes. An additional appropriation will be sought at the next leg- islative session to bring this amount to about $200,000. Ideally, the department would like to raise the appropriation to about $400,000. This it might do with matching federal funds, if the proposed law wins final approval. Dr. Walter D. Hammer, a veterinarian and head of the department's meat inspection division; and Deputy Agriculture Commis- sioner Earl K. Kelley commented on the state law Monday in connection with the pending legislation. Both said meat inspection in West Vir- ginia has improved considerably under the 1966 law, largely because of the cooperation of meat establishments. Hammer noted, however, that the present system of inspection is largely a spot check type of operation, with the current emphasis mainly on sanitation. No specific data was available on what per- centage of the meat marketed in West Vir- ginia may go uninspected or inadequately inspected before or after the kill. But Hammer and Kelley indicated there Is pressing need for expansion and improvement of the present program. Hammer said the state should have an ad- ditional 30 inspectors, plus three to five full- time veterinarians in the field. Presently, there are only 10 inpectors, assigned to check meat in 122 establishments within the state. The total of establishments includes 27 licensed commercial slaughter houses, 22 \"custom\" slaughter houses, 30 processing plants and 43 combined commercial houses and processing plants. In addition, there is one plant which un- dergoes federal inspection. This is the BBF Commissary, 321 21st St. Hammer said there are several large, na- tionally known meat companies which have so-called \"branch houses\" In West Virginia. These \"houses,\" which are Included in the West Virginia total of commercial establish- ments, receive shipments of federally-in- spected meat, he said. The meat usually is in large or wholesale type cuts, with federal inspection markers on them. When the cuts are further processed and reduced in size, the federal inspection label often is lost. Two modern meat plants at Ona, Cabell34129 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 County, and Sissonville are outstanding ex- amples of the types of commercial or custom slaughter houses that West Virginia should have, Hammer said. The custom type is in- tended mostly for farmers who grow their own animals, bring them in for slaughter and processing, and return them to the farm homes for storage. As an example of how much slaughtering is going on in the state, officials cited these figures for September, 1967: A total of 14,900 animals killed, includ- ing swine, cattle, sheep and lambs, all weigh- ing 7,416,000 pounds. Under the federal law, proposed to become effective July 1, all states would be required to have a satisfactory meat inspection pro- gram in operation within two years-or face the threat of federal control. Hammer said West Virginia, as one of 28 states now listed with mandatory inspection legislation, should be one of the first states to meet this requirement. He said it normally takes about five years to get a first class inspection program into effect after passage of necessary state legis- lation. He hopes that West Virginia can be going full speed ahead within four years after the effective date (July 1, 1966) of the current state legislation. That would put the target date at July 1, 1970, just in time to beat the federal deadline. Mrs. MAY. Mr. Speaker, will the gen- tleman yield 5 minutes to me for col- loquy? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. I yield to the gen- tlewoman from Washington. Mrs. MAY. Mr. Speaker, I would like just to say that I would think it would be far better for this bill to go to con- ference with the conferees uninstructed, because the Senate has made five sub- stantial changes in the Purcell bill as it passed the House. I would like to tell the gentleman from Iowa in the short time I have had to study the Senate changes in the bill, I certainly conclude that three, possibly four, of the changes are definitely good, and strengthen the bill, and I can support them. I do know that there are questions that have been asked of our committee by Members on both sides of the aisle con- cerning a very controversial amendment allowing the Governor of any State to unilaterally ask for Federal inspection right after the passage of the bill, if he so desires. I think the gentleman will agree this has raised not only the problem of the potential cost of the bill, but also the question whether in this way we are go- ing to reward those States that have made no effort on State meat inspection, by paying 100 percent of their cost, while penalizing those that have gone ahead in trying to pass good meat inspection laws, and paying them only up to 50 percent. I mention this to the gentleman from Iowa to point out two or three rather serious questions which might well be raised in conference. I do not know, but obviously there might be need for techni- cal changes. Since the other body has acted in six areas with new language or added lan- guage and amendments, I believe we owe it to our colleagues in the House to go to conference and discuss the changes and their implications, and to try to an- swer some of the questions satisfactorily,so that when we come back to the House with the bill we will have some basis for asking either for agreement to the amendment or for changes. I would hope that we would turn down the gentleman's proposal and back the chairman of the committee by agreeing to the request of the Senate for a con- ference, which I for one, want to see concluded as quickly as possible. Mr. FINDLEY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. I yield to the gen- tleman from Illinois. Mr. FINDLEY. I should like to under- stand the procedural situation a little better, if I can. Am I correct that the gentleman's motion would require that the House speak on the total recommendations as made by the other body and that there would be no way to divide the question so that we could speak on the individual items? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. That is correct. The Senate made one amendment. That is what it really amounts to. This would then put the house on record as being in favor of the Senate amendment. Mr. FINDLEY. It does seem to me this runs some risk of causing Members to be on record against a package, and per- haps would encumber the members of the conference committee, and perhaps the gentleman who has the time today, from securing approval of some needed items in the Senate amendment. Mr. SMITH of Iowa. I would say that out of the 45 pages, I believe it is, in the bill, about 43 have not been changed. The change is in a relatively small area. It is an important area, but it goes only to one question; that is, the nonfederally inspected domestic plants. Really, I do not believe it involves too much to vote upon in one package. The imported meat portion is not changed one bit; The labeling portion is not changed one bit; The requirement giving us protection against meat from rendering works go- ing into human consumption is not changed one bit; and I do not believe it is too complicated. I would also say to the gentlewoman from Washington, who raised the ques- tion about the Governors having the right to request inspection during the next 2 or 3 years, this was put in in lieu of the proposal we had in the House for immediate inspection. In effect the Sen- ate said, \"No, in most cases, it will not be immediate unless the Governor re- quests it.\" It is a modification of that area. Really, it is not a new subject matter. Mrs. MAY. If the gentleman will yield further, as I said, I am really not ready to argue the merits of the amendment put on by the Senate. It may be a good one. These are questions which have come to me from other Members of this body, since I am a member of the subcommit- tee. Frankly, I cannot answer them, be- cause we have had no time to discuss this with the Senate. I read the Senate debate on this amendment. Many questions were raisedin that debate which obviously were notsatisfactorily answered. It was more orless, as I understood the remarks, thatthey hoped such and such a thing wouldnot happen, and did not think it would. Should these prognostications prove nottrue, then certainly this body is facedwith other things concerning this bill;that is, increased expense as well as the possibility of a substantial number of Governors requesting Federal inspectionimmediately. Where would the personnel from the USDA come from to fulfill this? How much would we have to appropriate to do the job adequately? Those ques- tions I think deserve and must have in- telligent discussion before we bring the bill to the House and ask for concur- rence. Mr. ARENDS. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. I yield to the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. ARENDS. I would like to add that I agree with the position taken by the gentlewoman from Washington. It is arather unusual procedure, although it had been followed on rare occasions in the past that we do what is taking place here now. I hope the House will agreethat this bill should go to conference sothat we might find out what the differ- ences are and how they might be adjusted and then come back and take action on the bill later on. Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, will the gen- tleman yield? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. I yield to the gentleman from Missouri. Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me. At the outset I want to say, being an old food and forage inspector, that I am not necessarily against either position. Second, I simply rise for a point of in- formation for the Members of the House. Is it not true that the gentleman's orig- inal amendment, which I think we called the Smith-Foley amendment when we had this bill under consideration in the House, would, first, allow intrastate plants that gross annually $250,000 or more to come within Federal jurisdiction as far as meat inspection is concerned immediately; and second, require that substandard plants would have a 5-year grace period in order to make structural changes necessary; whereas the so-called Mondale-Montoya amendment added on in the other body would, first, require that if after 2 years the Secretary of Agriculture found the State inspection inadequate, he could immediately place all plants within the State under Federal jurisdiction; and second, if the Secretary finds a plant to be in extremely poor condition, he is authorized to go to the Governor of said State in which the plant is located and grant a reasonable amount of time to make the plant comply and remedy the alleged violations, but if the Governor fails to act, the Secretary can immediately and forthwith place the plant under Federal inspection; third, the Governor of any State can abdicate State responsibility at any time and seek out and ask for and get Federal-State inspection of its meats. The point I am trying to make-and I appreciate the gentleman's forebear-34130 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE ance-is for the information of all. On point No. 2, point No. 2 could immedi- ately replace point No. 1, I submit. In other words, rather than waiting 2 years, if the Secretary finds the plant is not living up to the best interests of food and forage of the consumers of America, he could eliminate No. 1 and take over without a 2-year delay. Does the gentle- man concur in this? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. Not completely, because there would be immediate take- overs without a Governor's permission only on a plant-by-plant basis rather than on a State basis. Your first point referred to statewide action. Mr. HALL. That is correct, under the Montoya-Mondale amendments so-called in the other body. Mr. SMITH of Iowa. Yes. Mr. HALL. The point I want to make is, if indeed the Secretary is vested with this much power, I am not unfamiliar with this situation under which the gen- tleman is acting and have rather pre- dicted, studying this last evening and the day before and knowing what went on in the other body, that this device for in- structing the conferees might happen. I might say I have used it myself on past occasions, and it is within the rules of the House. However, I think if indeed we can take over the function of the States without the 2-year grace period, as was indeed in the gentleman's original amendment, which would have given sub- standard plants 5 years in order to make necessary structural changes, then I be- lieve we should argue it out in confer- ence, and I hope we can vote down the gentleman's preferential motion for that reason and go to conference on this need- ed bill. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. I yield to the gen- tleman. Mr. MONTGOMERY. As the gentle- man knows, I served on the subcommit- tee which had hearings on this bill. I rise in support of the gentlewoman from Washington. I sincerely believe your preferential motion should be voted down so we have the opportunity to put this bill in conference. I certainly com- mend the gentleman for the wonderful work that he has done on the meat in- spection bill. Certainly he appeared be- fore our committee many times. But it seems to me that this bill should be put in conference. It seems to me that the amendments that have been added on in the Senate involve no limit of cost. Could the gentleman from Iowa give me how much additional expense this would represent to the Federal Govern- ment? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. Well, there are various figures involved. It would prob- ably amount to about the sum of $30 mil- lion which is less than 1/4 cent per pound. But whatever the cost is, and if they do the same kind of job of inspection, it is going to cost the same amount, whether that inspecting is performed by the State or by the Federal Government. It would be approximately the same no matter who pays It. Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield further, the billwhich we sent over to the other body contained the provision that the State would participate to the extent of 50 percent. Would the gentleman from Iowa clarify that provision? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. That is still in the bill. If the State in its own judgment de- cides it wants to have its own inspection system, so long as it comes up to the Federal standards, they may do so. Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield further, the gentleman will agree that there were some amendments added to the bill. Mr. SMITH of Iowa. There were some rather significant amendments added to the bill by the other body. Mr. MONTGOMERY. Perhaps I do not understand what the gentleman hopes to do. Why would the gentleman object to having House Members meet with Members of the other body in confer- ence? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. It would still go to conference, but the conferees for the House of Representatives will be in the position of having some instructions to its conferees as to what the House wants to do. Mr. MONTGOMERY. I thank the gen- tleman from Iowa. However, I hope we will not send our conferees over to the other body with instructions, but send them noninstructed to represent this body as they see fit. Mr. BELCHER. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. I yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma. Mr. BELCHER. Mr. Speaker, in the first place, I think there are some amend- ments that are desirable. In the second place, I am anxious to have a meat in- spection bill. However, it is my opinion that there exists a very, very serious question about the constitutionality of this act. I say this, because if the Fed- eral Government can just walk right into a State, without there being any inter- state commerce involved at all, and take over the functions of a State, then the interstate commerce clause does not mean a thing any more. I say this be- cause there is no way at this time to conceive of a bill that would violate the interstate commerce clause any more than this one would, if finally adopted. In other words, Mr. Speaker, the Sec- retary of the Department of Agricul- ture can merely say that a particular plant, even though it does not do any business whatsoever in interstate com- merce, is not doing a good job and it is not doing enough to meet the Federal standards of meat inspection. And, further, when you go in, regard- less of the State involved, the State will be bound-the Governor of the State, the legislature, or anyone else-absolutely by the inspector there and he will close that plant, or make them live up to the standards involved. Mr. Speaker, in my opinion these rep- resent very serious questions to be con- sidered. These are things which in my opinion can be ironed out in conference, to the extent where we can have a good bill, a bill which in my opinion the gen- tleman would probably desire. As I have stated previously, in myopinion there is probably a lot of good in this approach. But, if we go to confer- ence, no one objected when the gentle- man from Texas asked unanimous con- sent to send it to conference. If we are going to send it to conference, and say at the same time to the conferees, you cannot consider one single thing except to go over there and agree to the Senate amendments, then it is absolutely futile as to what we go to conference with in question. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman from Iowa had withheld his motion and if this matter had gone to conference, and if the conferees had conferred and brought back then to the House of Representa- tives such amendments as were in agree- ment or in disagreement with the other body as they were then at that time, any portion of the conference report to which the gentleman from Iowa objects, the gentleman could then make his motion to disagree and send it back and correct that one spot. However, by proceeding in this man- ner, if you send it over there, we have got to agree, regardless of the question of constitutionality of the amendments. In other words, we have got to agree, re- gardless of the desirability of all five amendments. There may be some amend- ments that may be better. But there may be a way to eliminate the threat to the constitutionality of the act. Those are things that can be worked out in conference, but to send them over to the Senate in conference with no au- thority whatsoever except to walk over there and say to Senator ELLENDER \"We agree with you entirely,\" and then sign the conference report and take it back to the House, then that is it. Does the gentleman agree with that? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. Agree with what? Mr. BELCHER. Is not that the exact situation? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. In effect the House conferees would be instructed that the feeling of the House is that they should accept the Senate amendments. Mr. BELCHER. Just as if the House had surrendered its own position and has accepted the position of the Senate, then bring it back, all they have to do is go over there, sign their names to it, and then bring it back, regardless of whether the House or the Senate feel that there are some of those amend- ments that could be improved upon, or even the constitutionality of the act per- fected a little bit better, work out cer- tain of the amendments in conference, then bring it back, and if there is some- thing wrong with the report when they bring it back then we can attack the particular parts you do not like Mr. SMITH of Iowa. I believe we have to get this over with as fast as possible. As the gentleman knows, we are in the closing days of this session, and if this goes to conference, especially without instructions, it can come back in 1 or 2 days, or 2 weeks, or not come back until January. We have not really had a record vote on the amendment added by the Senate or on these kind of amendments, and the conferees do not have the kind of instructions and information which I believe they ought to have to go to con- ference.34131 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 Mr. BELCHER. In effect, we are put- ting the Members on this particular spot that they can either accept the bill that they do not like, or vote against the meat inspection bill entirely. They ought to have some opportunity to understand what is in it. Mr. SMITH of Iowa. That is the spot we were in when this was in the House before. Mr. LAIRD. Mr. Speaker, will the gen- tleman yield? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin. Mr. LAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I would like to state to the gentleman from Iowa that I believe this procedure would tie the hands of the House conferees, be- cause, first of all, I am sure the gentle- man from Iowa does not accept the Sen- ate amendments at face value, and wants them incorporated as they are in this bill. Let me just give the gentleman an ex- ample of one of the faulty points that I believe needs to be corrected, even though they will go a long way with it, and perhaps they will accept 90 percent of the Senate's action, however, they still should be free to negotiate in this conference. In my State of Wisconsin we recently passed a meat inspection law which goes into effect on January 1. It is a very strict law. Under the terms of this law Wisconsin will be paying 50 percent of the cost of the various inspections that will take place under our Wisconsin State law. There are several neighboring States that have done nothing, absolutely noth- ing, as far as the State is concerned, to move in this area, yet we give those States under the Senate amendment preferential treatment -preferential treatment to the States that have done nothing, and the Governors of those States can get 100-percent financing im- mediately, for those States that have failed to fulfill their obligation. I believe if these House conferees can go over to this conference with some freedom to bargain then I believe that these technical difficulties that come about through these Senate amendments can be worked out. Then if the gentle- man from Iowa is not satisfied with the conference report as it comes back to the floor of the House, instructions can be given at that time, the conference report can be recommitted-there are many ways available, rather than to send the Members that are appointed by the Speaker to the Senate conference with their hands tied so they cannot work out the various technical amendments that are absolutely needed and necessary in order for the Senate amendments to be effective. Mr. SMITH of Iowa. If the Governor of the State of Wisconsin wants the same kind of preferential treatment, all he has to do is say \"We want Federal inspection now.\" Mr. LAIRD. All he has to do is say \"We do not want this law,\" and our law is better than the Federal law. All he has to do is to say \"We do not want this State law to take effect.\" Well, I want the Wisconsin State law to be put in effect. I do not want theState of Wisconsin to give up its more stringent requirements. The other day we in this House of Rep- resen' :tives said, when we were discuss- ing the air pollution act, that we want the California standards on air pollu- tion to take precedence over the weaker standards as far as the Nation is con- cerned. We established a precedent. I believe that when a State has stronger standards, and has instituted them through legislative action, then those standards should be able to take precedence. The only way to get the 100-percent financing under the terms of the Senate amendment would be completely to say that we want no State standards-set aside the State law and let the Federal inspectors come in and use the Federal law even though it is a weaker law in some cases. Mr. SMITH of Iowa. Then there would be 2 or 3 more years of putting chopped eyeballs, hides, and all kinds of other things in the meat. Mr. LAIRD. That is not what I am talking about at all and the gentleman from Iowa knows that full well. I am talking of the technical amendments that are needed and that are necessary so that the meat inspection law can fol- low the same procedure that was fol- lowed on the air pollution act we passed here on the floor of the House just 10 days ago, where we gave to those States that want to pioneer in this field the op- portunity to have more stringent stand- ards than the Federal Government. The gentleman from Iowa knows that if you accept the Senate amendments, what you are doing is not allowing those States and not allowing these conferees to work out some provision so that those States that have standards which are more strict than Federal standards may be effective and be used. Mr. SMITH of Iowa. I know that if we accept the Senate amendments the States will either come up to Federal standards or Federal inspection will ap- ply. No States have higher standards, but they may have if they want to. Mr. LAIRD. I do not think the gentle- man from Iowa wants to take away all incentives from every State, but I think the House conferees can maintain these inspections. The Senate amendments are good but the Senate amendments need to be clarified and corrected. We should do this through the House conferees who represent this House in this con- ference-and not just go over there and play dead. Mr. SMITH of Iowa. If the Governor of a State does something that the peo- ple of the State do not like, he will hear about it at the next election. Mr. FOLEY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. I yield to the gen- tleman. Mr. FOLEY. I think the gentleman's preferential motion is wise and should be supported by this House. I have been involved and concerned with the meat inspection problem since its inception as a member of the Com- mittee on Agriculture. I think I have listened to all the testi-mony and read as much as I can of thereports from the various States. The Senate bill that was passed yes-terday by a vote of 89 to 2-and I wouldsay to the gentleman from Wisconsinthat it had the concurrence of his Sen-ators from Wisconsin, and it had theconcurrence of the Senators of everyState in the Union save one-that billwill guarantee that the States will havean opportunity to maintain a meat in-spection program if they so desire. They will have the opportunity to receive thesupport of the Federal Government if they come up to the Federal standards.But it does not delay for 2 years theimprovement of present conditions which are not good in most States of the Union.I do not like to use an example but up to this year the gentleman's own State of Wisconsin has maintained 17 inspectors to inspect 300 plants in the State of Wis- consin and in one federally inspectedplant in the State of Wisconsin--ust one-- Mr. LAIRD. What year was that? Mr. FOLEY. In 1966. Mr. LAIRD. In what year did the Wisconsin State law go into effect-and does not the gentleman admit that it is stronger than theFederal law? Mr. FOLEY. The Wisconsin State law has been in effect- Mr. LAIRD. The Wisconsin State law goes into effect on January 1. The gen- tleman is completely misinformed as to what he is talking about. The law goes into effect on January 1. Mr. FOLEY. Let me just finish my statement, if I may. In one federally inspected plant in the State of Wisconsin there are 31 full-time Federal inspectors. The problem that all States have is they have paid little attention to meat inspection up to this time. A few of the States are in a position to presently come up to the standards in my judgment. Only one State came up to the Federal standards quickly and that is the State of California. All of the others will prob- ably require a couple of years before they can. It seems to me it makes little sense, if a Governor of a State decides, as the elected representative of a State, that he does not think his State is in the finan- cial condition to go into meat inspection at that level he will have to go before his people and say it will take 2 years for some kind of inspection simply because there is no provision in the law for Fed- eral inspection. But in the meantime there is the danger that existing plants that are a threat to the public health will not be dealt with. Those of us who want and who believe in the State having an opportunity and playing their part also have the problem of justifying some States where there are weak laws, inadequate laws, or States where laws may not even exist to pre- vent the operation of a plant that is clearly a threat to the public health. One of the Senate amendments pro- vides that the Secretary of Agriculture may go in and inspect those plants, and if he finds conditions dangerous to pub- lic health because of adulterated meat, he would notify the State authority. He34132 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE could not act immediately. He must noti- fy State authority. If the State authority refuses to act, then he may act. In the minds of many of us who have been associated with the bill, this is a minimum bill. It is not the bill that I offered with the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. SMITHI and others on the floor. It does not immediately extend Federal in- spection to any State. It would merely try to take advantage of the interest of the States in passing legislation and at the same time it would protect the health of the people in those States where there is not going to be an inspection program initiated. It gives to the State government the option of saying they are not interested in bringing in Federal inspection. So the public would be protected in one way or the other. We have had a long contro- versy on this matter. The Senate has passed a bill that I think is wise and, I believe, meets many of the problems that we created in the general debate. I think it would be wise for the House to concur in the Senate amendments by, in effect, instructing its conferees to act, and to send the bill to the White House. It is a bill of which we can be proud. It is a bill that will be a major consumer bill passed by this Congress. With no dis- respect to any other legislation, I do not know of any other bill that is more im- portant to the protection of the Ameri- can household and the American house- wife and her family than the bill that passed the Senate yesterday. I think the House should concur and instruct its conferees to see to it that the bill is en- acted. Mr. FINDLEY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. I yield to the gen- tleman from Illinois. Mr. FINDLEY. To clarify a procedural point, let us assume that the gentleman's motion is not accepted by the House. The conferees would not be precluded from giving full consideration to the Senate amendments. Is that not correct? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. That is correct. Mr. FINDLEY. So that the Members of this body can vote against the gentle- man's amendment with confidence that the conferees will give full and fair con- sideration to the Senate amendments and will not be pressured? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. The conferees will go to conference. I cannot tell you what they will do after that. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. POAGE. Mr. Speaker, I do not wish to delay a decision on the pending meat bill. I do not believe that many of us do. But it is clear that, acting under the pressure of inadequate and even in- accurate reporting, many Members of the House are convinced that the Senate- approved legislation would provide our people with better and more wholesome meat. I thoroughly disagree with that view, although I recognize that Members prop- erly want to protect the health of the American people. Understandably, Mem- bers overlook the constitutional implica- tions, just as their constituents do. On the other hand, I did not want tomake the motion which was made when I asked for a conference because I do not agree with the conclusions of those who argued that the adoption of the Senate amendments-strongly as I concur in their objectives-would achieve the re- sult that they think they would. By these amendments it is proposed to bring under Federal control programs which are clearly reserved for the States by our Constitution. I realize that mod- ern thinking is to the effect that the Con- stitution should not stand in the way of what anyone thinks is \"needed\" action- but I do not agree with that either. I believe our form of government is the greatest which has yet been devised by man, and I deplore its destruction under the plea of benefiting \"the public welfare.\" I believe that the public wel- fare will best be served by strict adher- ence to our fundamental concepts. But I think that I can read the writing on the wall. I doubt that a majority of this House agrees with me. I know that many Members and their constituents are little concerned about constitutional arguments. I know neither I nor the committee of which I have the privilege to be chairman can change that feeling. We could delay action. We could obstruct. But we could do no more than to interfere with the orderly desires of the House. I never sought to be an obstructionist, and the great committee I represent here never wants to present a negative case. We are not today going to stand in the way of the majority. We propose to let the majority work its will. But I propose to state clearly my protest against what I believe to be inaccu- rately considered judgment. Meat inspection is not perfect in the United States, but we have the best in- spection system there is anywhere in the world today. Our committee sought to improve that system, so that it would be still better. We updated the law, and we did it without any prodding from Mr. Nader or from Mrs. Furness. Our com- mittee acted because we saw a need. We took note of the possibility that render- ing plants were slipping uninspected meat into commerce. We offered a strong inducement to those States which have been slow in upgrading their local sys- tems to bring them up to the Federal standards. We presented legislation which had the endorsement of the live- stock producers' associations, of the meatpackers' associations, and also of all of the State Commissioners of Agricul- ture, and of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It looked as if we had se- cured the kind of consensus which is not only helpful, but I think is also essential if we are to have any real enforcement under anybody's plan. Then came the spoilers from the out- side. They simply said, \"We want clean meat.\" So do we all-all of us. They did not even say \"Howdy\" when they tore through our Constitution. They insinuated that all State inspec- tion is bad and that all Federal in- spection is close to perfect. They have not yet mentioned just how they are going to pay a Federal inspector to sit around all day at a plant which only slaughters one or one dozen animals aday. Nor have they explained how they are going to hold the cooperation of the States, after slapping them in the face, and especially after offering to pick up all the cost any time the Gov- ernor wants to pass that cost on to the Federal Government. They have yet to tell us how we can expect the States to continue to try, after the Department of Agriculture has run out on their clearly understood agreement. Undoubtedly there are some of our outside advisers who must expect that the Department of Agriculture would take over the whole monumental job and do it well. I hope they can. But I just do not have that kind of confidence in the Department of Agriculture, or in any other department. The Depart- ment needs the cooperation of the States. The House bill provided that cooperation. The Senate bill swaps that effective cooperation for the support of a group of self-appointed \"experts\"- experts on anything and everything. I submit the very people who palmed themselves off as being \"experts\" on meatpacking are also \"experts\" on hairdressing, and on the production of carpets, and on any other subject under the sun. They are just \"experts.\" I doubt that with all of their expert- ness they will be able to retain even our present level of cleanliness. Even though the Senate bill does pay our committee the compliment of including all of our original legislative proposals, I think they have killed it with the ad- ditions that have been placed on it. Evi- dently they thought we in the House were on sound ground, but they have relied too much on the letter of the law and too little on the spirit. They have knocked Humpty-Dumpty to the ground. I doubt that all their \"ex- perts\" can put Humpty-Dumpty to- gether again. The Senate bill destroys the consen- sus we had achieved after some 8 months' work. I can only say that I hope the Senate and the critics of the House Committee on Agriculture can and will make their act work. We will give them every possible help that we can, but when it fails-and I fear it will fail-I hope there will be those who will remember that the bill as presented by our committee and as passed by this House had the kind of widespread sup- port which is so essential to the suc- cessful administration of any program of this type. I shall, therefore, vote \"no\" on the proposal to instruct the conferees. Mr. BELCHER. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. POAGE. I yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma. Mr. BELCHER. This not only would destroy States rights, but it would de- stroy a lot of other rights. A Governor would have the authority to turn over to the Federal Government all of the meat inspection in his State, regardless of the State legislature or the State supreme court or anybody else. Mr. POAGE. I believe that is correct. Mr. BELCHER. In the State of Okla- homa we have a Republican Governor34133 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 and a Democratic legislature. If that Republican Governor wanted to hold all of the funds of his administration for local use and expenses in Oklahoma, he could do it, regardless of the fact that the Democratic legislature is about 4 to 1 Democratic. Every State in the Union could do the same thing, if the Governor would like to spend his money for local projects instead of for meat inspection. All he would have to do is to turn it over to the Federal Government. By the same token, if the Secretary of Agriculture wanted to move into any particular State, all he would have to do is make a finding that a plant is not being properly inspected and is not liv- ing up to Federal standards, and he and he alone could make that finding and could put in Federal inspection, regard- less of the Governor or the legislature or anybody else in the State. So this really not only would be tak- ing away States rights but also taking away rights of everybody in America, except the Governors of the States and the Secretary of Agriculture. Mr. POAGE. The gentleman from Oklahoma correctly describes the inept drafting of the Senate amendment. Ap- parently the amendment was drafted for public consumption on the television and in the headlines rather than for actual operation in the field. Mr. MICHEL. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. POAGE. I yield to the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. MICHEL. Aside from the merits or demerits of the Senate-passed bill, what would be the increase in the num- ber of inspectors required under the provision of the Senate-passed bill? Is the gentleman aware of that? Mr. POAGE. It is quite clear within a very short time, at least, all of the meat inspection in the United States would pass under the control of the Federal Government, and the Federal Government would have to pick up the check to take care of all of these small plants. The Federal law requires constant in- spection, both before and after killing, and a man in the plant all of the time, which is going to make the cost per pound in these small plants some eight to 10 times what it is in the large plants, which will result in the ultimate destruc- tion of our smaller packing plants, of course. Mr. MICHEL. As the gentleman knows, we who serve on the Subcommittee on Appropriations for the Department of Agriculture have to fund the money to pay the meat inspectors. There is a siz- able number now. As I understand this, the number would practically be double under the provisions of the Senate- passed bill. There is no provision in the President's budget for fiscal year 1968 for this in- crease number of meat inspectors, is there? Mr. POAGE. No. Mr. MICHEL. Nor did the President make any mention of it in the \"pitch\" the other night on television, as to what the increased cost might be.This is of some concern to me, con- sidering the particularly tight budget situation in which we find ourselves. It seems to me this would require taking on a new and additional burden, and amounts of millions of dollars would be involved. Mr. POAGE. I believe the gentleman is clearly correct. The cost would be something we probably would not meet, but way beyond that, I am convinced that if we destroy this cooperation with the States we are going to get less ef- fective results, not greater; we are going to get poorer inspection, not better; we are going to have more \"dirty meat,\" not less. The Senate bill looks good on TV, but I am interested in its day-to-day en- forcement. I fear that we have gone so far in criticizing the very agencies whose cooperation we need that we may never be able to get the kind of local support we on the Agriculture Committee value so highly. Mr. BRINKLEY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. I yield to the gen- tleman from Georgia. Mr. BRINKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the preferential motion to instruct the House conferees to agree to the Senate amendment to H.R. 12144. The House-passed bill would provide Federal cooperation and assistance to the States in order to upgrade their meat inspection standards. I fully supported and voted for this, even though my own State of Georgia has good inspection standards which equal, if not surpass, the Federal standards. The Senate-passed bill would, in effect, usurp State authority in the field of meat inspection and substitute Federal control. This is going too far and is an unnecessary and unwarranted intrusion into a State's affairs. Mr. BOLAND. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to extend my re- marks at this point in the RECORD. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. Mr. BOLAND. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the conference report on H.R. 12144, with the Senate-passed Montoya- Mondale amendments, to strengthen the laws pertaining to inspection and mark- ing of meat for use for human consump- tion. The strong Montoya-Mondale provi- sions, approved by a vote of 89 to 2 in the Senate yesterday, represent the first significant step forward in improving national meat inspection standards since Federal meat inspection was authorized by Congress 60 years ago. This is the most important consumer- protection piece of legislation to come be- fore the 90th Congress to date. I strong- ly supported the tough Smith-Foley meat inspection bill which was rejected by the House on October 31. Those gentlemen, Congressman NEAL SMITH, of Iowa, and Congressman TOM FOLEY, of Washing- ton, are to be commended for the wonderful fight they made in the House for a stronger meat inspection bill. Now we have a chance in the House once again to put a tough meat inspec-tion bill on the law books to protect theAmerican consumer by accepting thisconference report. I will support Con- gressmen SMITH and FOLEY in their efforts here today for a rollcall to acceptthe strong Montoya-Mondale provisions in the report. Mr. Speaker, these are the crucial points in the Senate bill: First. The Federal meat inspection program will cover meat plants that do not now ship meat or meat products across State lines unless the States bringtheir meat inspection programs at least up to Federal standards within the next 2 years. Today, plants that do not ship meat or meat products across State lines are not covered by the Federal meat in- spection program which provides strin- gent health safeguards for the American consumer and the American traveler. Second. During this interim 2-year period, the Secretary of Agriculture will have the authority to act against plants that are found to be dangerous to the public health. Third. During the 2-year interim period, the Governors of the States may invite Federal meat inspection right away. This provision was added to take care of those States which may not want or be able to buy a meat inspection sys- tem that is at least equal to Federal standards. For those States that do wish to operate and maintain such a system, 50-percent Federal matching assistance will be provided. Mr. Speaker, why must the meat in- spection standards in every State at least equal Federal standards? The rea- son is that the American consumer- whether housewife or traveler-is not fully protected from unwholesome meat and meat products. Some 16 percent-or 5.3 billion pounds-of meat slaughtered in the United States annually, and some 26 percent-or 7.6 billion pounds-of meat processed into sausages and other products are outside the safeguards of Federal meat inspection. Some State in- spection programs do exist. But there is grave doubt that many of these programs provide adequate protection. In fact, 22 States have no mandatory meat inspec- tion laws at all. During debate on Federal meat inspec- tion on the floor of the House, Congress- man FOLEY challenged any Member of the House to stand up to say that his State's meat inspection program came up to Federal standards. No Member rose. On July 27 and July 28 of this year a U.S. Department of Agriculture offi- cial in Boston inspected five processing plants in eastern Massachusetts outside the scope of the Federal meat inspection program. Here are quoted excerpts from the inspector's report on three of the plants: Plant 3.-This plant is located in a former brewery, and, at a former time, operated under federal inspection, but due to the strictness of complying with the Meat In- spection Regulations, elected to withdraw from federal meat inspection. They manu- facture sausage products, and cure and smoke pork products. Plant 4.-A 3-story brick building, which at one time applied for federal inspection, but was rejected due to structural defects, which the applicant elected not to correct.34134 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE This is essentially a sausage manufacturing operation. Windows do not have screens. plant 5.-A 2-story brick and concrete building, essentially a sausage manufacturer. Windows have no screens, permitting the entry of flies, uncovered trash barrels evi- dent in the yard. Mr. Speaker, the inspector went on to say, and again I quote: All the above mentioned plants are located in Massachusetts, a state that does not have a meat-inspection program for processed meats. None of the plants mentioned receive any regulatory supervision. As far as I know, visits are made to the plants by State In- spectors only occasionally, and then only to advise them of the labeling requirements. The owners and operators of the plants are placed on their honor to supervise the manu- facturing processes, and the heating of pork products to arrest the action of trichina. Products from all the plants mentioned have been observed in most markets and supermarkets in the Eastern half of Massa- chusetts. On the 2 days that I observed these plants the weather was hot and humid, and flies were prevalent at all locations. Moreover, in July of this year the USDA conducted a laboratory analysis of nonfederally inspected meat products selected at the retail level in Massachu- setts. Five samples were taken including Scotch ham, frankfurters, and certain kinds of sausages. Five violations were found, such as extenders not being shown as \"added\" and excessive water being added to the meat products. President Johnson summed up the whole issue in his November 20 press conference when he said: We need the strongest possible meat in- spection bill. Nobody in this country ought to ever take a chance on eating filthy meat from filthy packing houses-it doesn't make any difference how powerful the meat lobby is. Mr. Speaker, I urge final enactment of this conference report for a strong meat inspection law as the only really effective way now possible to provide all Americans with the assurance of whole- some meat and meat products. Mr. FRASER. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. I yield to the. gentleman from Minnesota. Mr. FRASER. If I understand what the gentleman said earlier, all we are being asked to vote on with this motion is whether or not we in general approve of the amendment that was added to it in the Senate that requires the States to bring inspection standards at least up to the Federal levels after a period of 2 years. Is that right? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. Yes. That is right. Mr. FRASER. So the effect of this mo- tion, if passed, would be to tell the House conferees the sentiment of the House is generally in support of that Senate amendment. Is that correct? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. That is correct. Mr. FRASER. I also understand if this motion passes, it does not preclude the conferees from working out any tech- nical problems or any special problems that they might find as they go over the language of the bill. Is that so? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. That is correct as I understand it. Mr. FRASER. So what we are sayingin effect by an affirmative vote on this motion is that we subscribe to the idea that the housewives and the American consumers are entitled to the stronger protection afforded by the Senate amendment? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. I so understand it to be. Mr. FRASER. And that would be the significance of that vote? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. Yes. Mr. FRASER. But it would not tie the hands of the conferees in working out any particular or special problems in the bill in conference? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. I understand that is correct with regard to technical amendments. Mr. BELCHER. But we could not change one word in the Senate amend- ment? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. I am not sure that is correct. Mr. BELCHER. Do you mean, then, it was your intention we could go over there and revise those amendments in any way we wanted to? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. No. I think there would be instructions from the House and you should uphold what the major- ity of the House wants. Mr. BELCHER. Under your motion we could not change one of those amend- ments, could we? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. I hope you would not. Mr. BELCHER. Under your motion we would not be permitted to. Mr. SMITH of Iowa. You are asking a question that only the Parliamentarian could answer. My understanding is we could. Mr. BELCHER. Your understanding is we could change those amendments? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. Yes. Mr. BELCHER. Then, what good is your motion? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. It is merely for the same reason that the Republicans have used it so many times in the past,that is, to instruct the conferees what the feeling of the House is. Mr. BELCHER. The feeling of the House is it wants those amendments like they are, if your motion carries. Is that correct? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. I hope so. Mr. FRASER. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. I yield to the gen- tleman from Minnesota. Mr. FRASER. I made it a point specifically to inquire as to the effect of this vote. I understand that the con- ferees could, even after this instruction, go over there and sit on their hands. Presumably they would not because the House expressed itself, but there is noth- ing in this motion which would require the House conferees to agree to every word of it, or for the Senate, either, as far as that is concerned. They could work out particular problems and then come back to the House for further in- structions. It is an expression of senti- ment on the part of the House. It is im- portant that this vote be clearly under- stood for what it is and that people not say, \"We did not want to be bound to every comma and every period and thatis why we voted against it.\" It is a gen- eral vote on the issue as to whether the Senate amendments are desirable. Mr. BELCHER. Does the gentleman from Iowa agree with that? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. Yes. That is my understanding. Mr. BELCHER. If we give them the liberty to change the amendments, yourmotion would not be much good. Mr. SMITH of Iowa. No. I think the House just heard the reason why youhad better vote \"aye\" on this bill. Youmay not get a chance to express your sentiments in favor of a strong bill like the Senate bill again. The gentleman from Oklahoma is very candid and honest. He is a statesman. He comes inhere and tells us that they are going to riddle that bill if they get a chance to in conference. Mr. LAIRD. Mr. Speaker, will the gen- tleman yield? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. I yield to thegentleman from Wisconsin. Mr. LAIRD. If the gentleman wanted to adopt the Senate amendments, he could offer a motion to do so. A motion to recede and concur in the Senate amendments is available. Mr. SMITH of Iowa. Not at this point. Mr. LAIRD. At this particular point itis not, but an instruction is available onthe floor of the House. Then I would like to ask unanimous consent that the mo- tion of the gentleman from Iowa, Mr.Speaker, be re-read at this point. The SPEAKER. Without objection, the Clerk will re-read the motion of the gen- tleman from Iowa. There was no objection. The Clerk re-read the motion. Mr. SMITH of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, Ithink it is quite clear that there is more involved than just a matter of proce-dure. This involves a matter of substance. This is the opportunity for the Members of the House to show whether they wantthe stronger Senate bill or whether they do not want it. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I move the previous question. The SPEAKER. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on thepreferential motion. There was no objection. The SPEAKER. The question is on the preferential motion offered by the gen-tleman from Iowa [Mr. SMITH]. The question was taken; and the Speaker announced that the noes ap- peared to have it. Mr. SMITH of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER. Evidently a quorum is not present. The Doorkeeper will close the doors, the Sergeant at Arms will notify absent Members, and the Clerk will call the roll. The question was taken; and there were-yeas 166, nays 207, not voting 59, as follows: Addabbo Brademas Burke, Mass. Burton, Calif. Button Byrne, Pa.

AUTHORIZING SUBCOMMITTEE ON LABOR TO CONDUCT INVESTIGA- TIONS Mr. ANDERSON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 960 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: H. RES. 960 Resolved, That notwithstanding the pro- visions of H. Res. 218, Ninetieth Congress, the General Subcommittee on Labor of the Committee on Education and Labor, is au- thorized to send not more than six members (four majority and two minority), and not more than two staff assistants (one major- ity and one minority), of such subcommittee to conduct a full and complete investigation and study (1) of the circumstances sur- rounding the production in foreign nations of goods which are subsequently sold in the United States in competition with do- mestically produced goods, and (2) of the operation by the Federal Government of elementary and secondary schools, both at home and abroad, with a view to deter- mining means of assuring that the children of civilian officers and employees, and mem- bers of the Armed Forces, of the United States will receive high quality elementary and secondary education. For the purpose of carrying out this reso- lution the subcommittee is authorized to sit and act during the present Congress at such times and places within the United States, including any Commonwealth or possession thereof, or elsewhere, whether the House is in session, has recessed, or has adjourned, to hold such hearings, and to require, by subpena or otherwise, the attendance and testimony of such witnesses and the produc- tion of such books, records, correspondence, memorandums, papers, and documents, as it deems necessary; except that neither the committee nor any subcommittee thereof may sit while the House is meeting unless special leave to sit shall have been obtained from the House. Subpenas may be issued under the signature of the chairman of the committee or any member of the committee designated by him, and may be served by any person designated by such chairman or member. Notwithstanding section 1754 of title 22, United States Code, or any other provision of law, local currencies owned by the United States shall be made available to the Com- mittee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and employees en- gaged in carrying out their official duties under section 190d of title 2, United States Code: Provided, That (1) no member or em- ployee of said committee shall receive or expend local currencies for subsistence in any country at a rate in excess of the maxi- mum per diem rate set forth in section 502 (b) of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended by Public Law 88-633, approved October 7, 1964; (2) no member or employee of said committee shall receive or expend an amount for transportation in excess of ac- tual transportation costs; (3) no appropri- ated funds shall be expended for the pur- pose of defraying expenses of members of November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE said committee or Its employees in any coun- try where counterpart funds are available for this purpose. Each member or employee of said commit- tee shall make to the chairman of said committee an itemized report showing the number of days visited in each country whose local currencies were spent, the amount of per diem furnished, and the cost of transportation if furnished by public car- rier, or if such transportation is furnished by an agency of the United States Govern- ment, the identification of the agency. All such individual reports shall be filed by the chairman of the Commitee on House Admin- istration and shall be open to public in- spection. With the following committee amend- ment: On page 3, line 19, after the word \"Gov- ernment,\" insert the words \"the cost of such transportation, and\". The committee amendment was agreed to. Mr. ANDERSON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 minutes to the dis- tinguished gentleman from California [Mr. SMITH] and pending that I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, will the gen- tleman yield for a parliamentary inquiry? Mr. ANDERSON of Tennessee. I shall be glad to yield to the gentleman from Missouri for that purpose. Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to propound a parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. AL- BERT). The gentleman from Missouri will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, under our present legislative situation, is it possi- ble to amend this resolution at page 3, line 20, by inserting immediately after the word \"agency\" the following: \"Amounts of per diem shall not be fur- nished for a period of time in any coun- try if per diem has been furnished for the same period of time in any other country, irrespective of differences in time zones,\" without voting down the previous question? Mr. Speaker, my parliamentary in- quiry is whether or not there is a manner in which a simple and erstwhile amend- ment such as this might be received under our present legislative system? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. AL- BERT). The gentleman from Missouri asks in his parliamentary inquiry if under the present legislative situation it is possible to amend the resolution by in- serting additional language. The Chair will state to the gentleman from Mis- souri that that would be true only if the gentleman from Tennessee [Mr. ANDERSON] yields to the gentleman from Missouri for that purpose. Mr. HALL. I thank the distinguished Speaker. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman from Tennessee will yield further, I would like to inquire of the gentleman whether or not he will yield for that purpose? Mr. ANDERSON of Tennessee. I shall be glad to yield to the gentleman from Missouri for that purpose. Mr. HALL. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee. Mr. ANDERSON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 960 wouldauthorize not more than six members of the General Subcommittee on Labor- four majority and two minority mem- bers-and not more than one majority and one minority staff assistants to in- vestigate production in foreign nations of goods subsequently sold in the United States in competition with domestic goods. The resolution would further au- thorize the investigation of the opera- tion of federally operated elementary and secondary schools at home and abroad, with a view to finding out ways of assuring that the children of civilian officers and employees, and members of the Armed Forces, of the United States will receive high quality education. The Committee on Rules amended the resolution on page 3, line 19-after the word \"Government\" by inserting the words \"the cost of such transportation.\" With this amendment, the resolution is in conformity with similar resolutions reported by the committee during the 90th Congress, and is identical in pur- pose and scope to a similar resolution adopted last year. Mr. Speaker, we face increasing prob- lems relative to both subjects of this in- vestigation, and I urge the immediate adoption of House Resolution 960, as amended. Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, would the gentleman yield for the purpose of offer- ing an amendment ? The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman from Tennessee yield to the gentleman from Missouri for the pur- pose of offering an amendment? Mr. ANDERSON of Tennessee. I will be glad to yield to the gentleman for that purpose. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will state that the gentleman loses the floor when he yields for that purpose. AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. HALL Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I offer an amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. HALL: On page 3, line 20, immediately after \"agency.\" insert the following: \"Amounts of per diem shall not be furnished for a period of time in any country if per diem has been furnished for 'the same period of time in any other country, irrespective of differences in time zones.\". The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen- tleman from Missouri [Mr. HALL] will be recognized for 1 hour. Mr. PERKINS. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I will be glad to yield to the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor as soon as I make one statement. Mr. Speaker, I simply want to state to the Members of the House that the purpose of this amendment is obvious. It would simply provide for something which no Member, I am sure, would con- sciously allow to evolve, but which, from reading the record of disbursements, has actually happened-I am sure unwit- tingly in some instances-in the form of a practice whereby a Member or a staff member could collect their per diem in counterpart funds in one capital through the embassy of that foreign nation, and then travel to another foreign capital of another nation within the same day, andagain draw the per diem. As a matter of record, it has been done in three different capitals on the same day, and they col- lected their per diem in counterpart funds of those countries presumably by fast jet travel, from the embassies on three different occasions for the day certain. This would simply avoid duplication or triplication of this collection of per diem, which of course must mean what it says. The amendment is simply offered to clarify that arrangement in the Resolu- tion, and indeed in existing law. I understand the amendment will be accepted. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the dis- tinguished chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor. Mr. PERKINS. Mr. Speaker, I thankthe gentleman from Missouri for yield- ing. First, let me compliment the distin- guished gentleman from Missouri for of- fering the amendment, and further saythat we accept the amendment. We feel it is a good amendment and that it will serve a useful purpose, and we certainly want to comply with the spirit and theletter of that amendment. Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I certainly thank the distinguished chairman of theCommittee on Education and Labor, and the gentlemen who are members of the subcommittee. Also I do not want it to go unnoticed that a rather unusual pro- cedure has been allowed by the distin- guished member from the Committee on Rules, the gentleman from Tennessee [Mr. ANDERSON], in allowing this amend- ment to be presented at this time and inthis manner. Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. Mr. Speak- er, will the gentleman yield? Mr. HALL. I am delighted to yield to the gentleman from Colorado. Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. Mr. Speak- er, in order that we may have clarifica- tion of the amendment, as the gentleman from Missouri well knows, sometimes Members travel from country to country,and they are supposed to, at the end of the time they spend in a particular country, if they have currency left over, return that currency to the Embassy or to the consulate. Let us say, as an example, that I am a Member traveling in a country, andthat I would draw money for that par- ticular day, and then I leave that coun- try, say, at 10 o'clock in the morning, and I arrive in Rome at 5 o'clock in the afternoon. I have turned back all the currency that I had in that other coun- try, say Switzerland. Now, does the amendment offered by the gentleman from Missouri prohibit me from accepting currency when I ar- rive in Italy for that particular date? Mr. HALL. It does, if it is on the same date. Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. I beg the gentleman's pardon, what was that? Mr. HALL. If it is for per diem on the same date in two different countries, it clearly could not be done under this amendment. Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. But I would have returned that part that I had re- ceived that day in Switzerland when I34137 34138 CO left Switzerland. Now, say that I arrive in Italy, what do I do for currency at that time? Mr. HALL. The gentleman would draw all that he needed, for all of the per diem that he spent in the second country on the next day after his arrival. Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. What do you do for currency from then until the next day? Mr. HALL. This would apply ad seria- tim. Mr. GROSS. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. HALL. I yield to the gentleman from Iowa. Mr. GROSS. Let us look at the other side of the coin. Suppose you spend the first $50 per diem in the morning in country No. 1 and then go to country No. 2 in the afternoon or an hour later and collect another $50. Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. HALL. I yield to the gentleman. Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. The ques- tion that I propounded to the gentleman from Missouri is that according to the regulations and the rules, when you leave a country you turn back any currency that you may have. Mr. GROSS. Not necessarily. Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. You say that is not necessary? Mr. GROSS. Why is it necessary? Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. Under the so-called counterpart funds, they are supposed to be spent in the country where you are at the time and when you leave you return it to the consul there and go to the next country. Mr. HALL. I will say to the gentle- man from Colorado that the question is academic as a matter of fact, because ordinarily those excess or holdover funds are brought back to our own interna- tional bank here or at the point of de- parture, our own State Department or even the Pentagon bank, and cashed in. The intent of the amendment is sim- ply to prevent the drawing of double or triple per diem allowances on the same day in fact. Mr. GROSS. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. HALL] yield me some time? Mr. HALL. I am glad to yield to the gentleman from Iowa 5 minutes. Mr. GROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this amendment. It is long past the time that we did something to stop the flagrant practice of double per diem payments that are available to the junketeers who streak out of here about this time every year on one pretext or another. I am informed that on just one junket last year by five House Members-one of them being a lame duck who was defeated just a week before this world- girdling party took off-that each of those junketeers collected the equivalent of $50 in Japanese yen, plus $50 in Tai- wan dollars on November 23. The next day they got another $50 worth of Taiwan dollars and then col- lected $50 in Hong Kong dollars. Moving on they collected $50 Hong Kong dollars and $50 in Thailand cur- rency on November 27.NGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE Then they collected $50 in Thailand currency and $50 in Indian rupees on November 29. Then $50 in rupees and $50 in Egyp- tian pounds on December 1. Fifty dollars in Greek drachmas, and $50 in Egyptian pounds on December 4. Fifty dollars in drachmas plus $50 in Italian lire on December 6. One hundred dollars each on Decem- ber 8 simply by moving from Naples to Rome. Fifty dollars in liras plus $50 in Portu- guese escudos on December 10. Fifty dollars in escudos plus $50 in German marks on December 12. One hundred dollars each in German marks on December 14 simply by moving from Wiesbaden to Berlin. Then $50 in marks plus $50 in Danish kroner on December 15. Mr. Speaker, if the racetrack operators in this country offered a daily double like this one, they would all be busted or pretty badly bent in no time at all. The amendment of the gentleman from Missouri simply seeks to put an end to this kind of business and it ought to be inserted in every resolution that is adopted henceforth to provide for junketing abroad. As a matter of fact, in view of the financial condition of the U.S. Treasury, far fewer Members of Congress and Gov- ernment officials ought to travel at Gov- ernment expense to countries abroad. It seems that the more this country spends on foreign nations and the more Members of Congress and others who travel to foreign countries the worse the international situation becomes. It is time to call a halt. Mr. HALL. I will say to the gentleman from Iowa, I appreciate his contribution. I had intended not to instruct the Members in the complete technique. Mr. Speaker, I call for a vote. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The ques- tion is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. HALL]. The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The ques- tion is on the resolution. Mr. SMITH of California. Mr. Speak- er, a parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen- tleman will state the parliamentary in- quiry. Mr. SMITH of California. I was yielded 30 minutes a while ago by the gentleman from Tennessee [Mr. ANDERSON]. DO I not have that time? The SPEAKER pro tempore. When the gentleman from Tennessee [Mr. ANDER- sON] yielded to the gentleman from Mis- souri [Mr. HALL] for the purpose of of- fering an amendment, he surrendered all his time, and the Chair so informed the gentleman from Tennessee. Mr. SMITH of California. If the gen- tleman has agreed to yield 30 minutes to me, I lose it? The SPEAKER pro tempore. When the gentleman yielded for the purpose of amendment. Mr. SMITH of California. I thank the Chair. The resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.November 29, 1967 AUTHORIZING THE COMMITTEE ON POST OFFICE AND CIVIL SERVICE TO CONDUCT STUDIES AND IN- VESTIGATIONS RELATING TO CERTAIN MATTERS WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION Mr. ANDERSON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 971 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as fol- lows: H. RES. 971 Resolved, That, notwithstanding the provi- sions of H. Res. 209, Ninetieth Congress, the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service is authorized to send not more than fifteen members of such committee, not more than three majority staff assistants, and not more than two minority staff assistants to such Far Eastern and Western European countries as the committee may determine for the purpose of conducting studies with respect to the policies, operations, activities, and ad- ministration by the governments of such countries of matters in the following fields of activity of such governments: postal rates, postal operations, postal facilities and mod- ernization, research and development pro. grams, coding of mail, standardization of di- mensional characteristics of mail, and the organization of the postal service as a cor- poration. Notwithstanding section 1754 of title 22, United States Code, or any other provision of law, local currencies owned by the United States shall be made available to the Com- mittee on Post Office and Civil Service of the House of Representatives and employees en- gaged in carrying out their official duties un- der section 190(d) of title 2, United States Code: Provided, That (1) no member or em- ployee of said committee shall receive or ex- pend local currencies for subsistence in any country at a rate in excess of the maximum per diem rate set forth in section 502(b) of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended by Public Law 88-633, approved October 7, 1964; (2) no member or employee of said committee shall receive or expend an amount of transportation in excess of actual trans- portation costs; (3) no appropriated funds shall be expended for the purpose of defray- ing expenses of members of said committee or its employees in any country where counter- part funds are available for this purpose. That each member or employee of said committee shall make to the chairman of said committee an itemized report showing the number of days visited in each country where local currencies were spent, the amount of per diem furnished, and the cost of transportation if furnished by public car- rier, or if such transportation is furnished by an agency of the United States Govern- ment, the cost of such transportation, and the identification of the agency. All such in- dividual reports shall be filed by the chair- man with the Committee on House Adminis- tration and shall be open to public inspec- tion. With the following committee amend- ments: Page 1, line 3, strike the word \"fifteen\" and insert in lieu thereof the word \"eleven\". Page 1, line 4, strike the word \"three\" and insert in lieu thereof the word \"two\". Page 1, line 5, strike the word \"two\" and insert in lieu thereof the word \"one\"; strike the last word in the line and insert in lieu thereof the word \"assistant\". The committee amendments were agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen- tleman from Tennessee is recognized for 1 hour. November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, will the gen- tleman yield? Mr. ANDERSON of Tennessee. I yield briefly, for a question. Mr. HALL. A question only. I merely want to ask the distinguished gentle- man, a member of the Committee on Rules, if he will yield at the expiration of his time and that of the ranking mi- nority member of the Committee on Rules for the purpose of permitting an amendment identical, in fact, to the amendment offered to the last resolution to be offered to the present resolution. Mr. ANDERSON of Tennessee. May I come to that point a little later? We are giving some thought to the handling of the matter. Mr. HALL. That is agreeable. Mr. ANDERSON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 minutes to the dis- tinguished gentleman from California [Mr. SMITH] pending which I yield my- self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 971, as introduced would authorize the Commit- tee on Post Office and Civil Service to send not more than 15 members, not more than three majority staff assist- ants, and not more than two minority staff assistants to such Far Eastern and Western European countries as the com- mittee may determine for the purpose of conducting studies with respect to postal rates, postal operation, postal facilities, and modernization, research, and development programs, coding of mail, standardization of dimensional characteristics of mail, and the organiza- tion of postal services on a corporation basis. The Committee on Rules amended the resolution to authorize the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service to send a less number of members and staff- specifically not more than 11 members instead of 15, not more than two major- it\" staff assistants instead of three, and not more than one minority staff assist- ant instead of two. Mr. Speaker, all Members are acutely aware of the problems facing our own postal service. Other nations recently have made some excellent advancements in postal efficiency and we can learn a great deal from them. One example is in the standardization of envelopes and mailing cartons. Another critical need is to find out in detail the substance and impact of cer- tain goals being formulated by interna- tional postal employee organizations. Still another urgent need is to analyze and unravel the increasing problems re- lating to the fast and efficient delivery of mail to U.S. servicemen stationed in Southeast Asia and elsewhere. Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of House Resolution 971, as amended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California [Mr. SMITH] is recognized for 30 minutes. Mr. SMITH of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con- sume. Mr. Speaker, I concur in the state- ments made by the gentleman from Tennessee and urge adoption of the resolution. There is one part of this foreign travel CXIII- 2150-Part 25I wanted to read into the RECORD today. On September 18, 1967, we had a similar resolution pending before the House, House Resolution 838, which had to do with the Judiciary Committee's travel. Some questions came up at that time about the use of counterpart funds, with the result that subsequent thereto, I took it up with the officials in the administra- tion in an effort to try to clarify the situation as best we could. I want to read their memo into the RECORD. It may help clear up the confusion in the future. I am referring to House Resolution 838, but the same language would apply to House Resolution 971, which we are con- sidering today. The clause I am particu- larly referring to is on page 2, starting with line 3, the so-called notwithstand- ing section. In the language I am refer- ring to at this time, it refers to \"Judiciary,\" but in this resolution it will refer to \"Post Office and Civil Service.\" This is the memorandum written down- town: On September 18, 1967, several questions were raised about H. Res. 838 and, in partic- ular, the part which read: \"Notwithstanding section 1754 of title 22, United States Code, or any other provision of law, local currencies owned by the United States shall be made available to the Com- mittee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and employees engaged in carrying out their official duties under sec- tion 190(d) of title 2, United States Code.\" That language is identical with the language on page 2 of the resolution pending, excepting it is \"Post Office and Civil Service\" rather than \"Judiciary.\" With respect to the \"notwithstanding\" clause, no provision of a resolution passed by a single House of the Congress can change or waive a provision of law approved by the Congress and the President in accordance with the Constitution. The \"not aithstand- ing\" clause therefore can only operate as a regulation of the House within the limita- tions of law. It can only reduce amounts au- thorized, but not required, by law. Any \"local currencies owned by the United States\" would be in the Treasury of the United States and, as provided in the Con- stitution, \"no money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropria- tions made by law.\" There are, however, a humber of examples of withdrawal of money from the Treasury by a law which is not in the form of an appropriation act, and such an appropriation by law meets the require- ment of the Constitution. If statutory provi- sions require money to be withdrawn by an appropriation act, another law may modify or waive such a statutory requirement. One such law, and the one that is the legal basis for H. Res. 838, is section 502 (b) of the Mu- tual Security Act of 1954, as amended (22 U.S.C. 1754(b)). The pertinent provision is as follows: \"Notwithstanding section 1415 of the Sup- plemental Appropriation Act, 1953 [which generally prohibits use of foreign credits owed to or owned by the United States ex- cept as may be provided for annually in ap- propriation acts], or any other provision of law, local currencies owned by the United States, which are in excess of the amounts reserved under section 612(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, and of the requirements of the United States Gov- ernment in payment of its obligations out- side the United States .. (and any other local currencies owned by the United States in amounts not to exceed the equivalent of $50 per day per person ex- clusive of the actual cost of transportation)shall be made available to appropriate com- mittees of the Congress...\" This provision of law thus makes available to appropriate committees of the Congress without requirement for annual appropriation two classes of for- eign currency: First. Without monetary limitation, except as may be provided in the regu- lations of the House concerned or the appropriate committee, foreign curren- cies that are in excess of the normal requirements of U.S. agencies for pay- ment of obligations abroad; and Second. With a statutory limitation of $50 per day per person, any foreign cur- rencies that are not in excess of the agencies' requirements. House Resolution 838, which we are considering, specifically provides that no member or employee of the commit- tee shall receive or expend foreign cur- rencies at a rate in excess of the mini- mum set forth in section 502(b) of the Mutual Security Act, that is $50 per day per person. For this reason, the distinc- tion between excess currencies and other currencies in section 502(b) of the Mutual Security Act does not arise, and there are no different classes of author- ized currency available under House Resolution 838. I urge the adoption of the resolution. Mr. HAYS. Mr. Speaker, will the gen- tleman yield? Mr. SMITH of California. I yield to the gentleman from Ohio. Mr. HAYS. In other words, in view of the language the gentleman read, the amendment offered by the gentleman from Missouri merely reiterates what the House Rules Committee legislation already does, which limits it to $50 a day per person; is that not correct? Mr. SMITH of California. I had not seen that amendment before today. After the previous colloquy it took 2 or 3 days with some experts down there to piece this together, so I would not want to comment on what effect the amendment would have in connection with this. I just do not know. I know what this says and what this means. I am not certain of that language. Mr. HAYS. The Rules Committee reso- lution says $50 per day per person. It has happened in the past, and it has happened to a committee I was chair- man of, that inadvertently we were given $50 too much, because we were given $50 at the beginning of a 7-day stay in one country and that included the day we left, and when we arrived at another country we were given $50 for that day in the other country. But when we au- dited our accounts and put them in the record we caught this. I asked every member of the committee and every member of the staff-and this included myself-to submit a check for $50 made out to the Treasury of the United States, which we did. I do not remember how many days we were gone. We will say it was 13. So we reported $50 a day for 13 days. Although we received $50 a day for 14 days, we refunded $50 for the odd day. It seems to me the law is perfectly clear. If there is not a communication be- tween embassies, or if someone gets more34139 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 money than he should, when the account is audited that can be caught and taken care of. Each person knows he left on one day, and he knows what day he returned, and knows he is entitled to $50 a day for the number of days gone. That is what the resolution says. The Rules Committee brought that out. I have no objection to the gentleman's amendment, but I just say It simply re- iterates what the law already means, as I read it. Mr. SMITH of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. DERWINSKI]. Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I be- lieve we ought to emphasize that resolu- tions such as these are necessary for the effective functioning of the House of Rep- resentatives. It is essential that Members of Con- gress, regardless of their committee, have an opportunity to travel when the com- mittee jurisdiction is properly involved. Rather than overemphasize and picture as standard procedure the occasional abuse or complications, we ought to em- phasize the positive and point out that most trips conducted by our Mem- bers are practical, worthwhile, and in the Nation's interest. We know that in the course of travel abroad we uncover many situations which produce econo- mies at a later date. Members also acquire information which is practical in future legislative developments. I would like to see emphasis put by as many Members as will do so on the positive effects of committee travel. I happen to be a member of the Commit- tee on Foreign Affairs, and I do not see how we could possibly work in our field unless we traveled abroad. However, the same principle really applies to any other committee in the House. Mr. HAYS. Mr. Speaker, will the gen- tleman yield? Mr. DERWINSKI. I yield to the gen- tleman from Ohio. Mr. HAYS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman from Illinois and point out one specific instance for which I take no particular credit. I was asked to stop off on my way back from a trip abroad in a particular country to look at some property. Now, I happen to be the chair- man of the subcommittee of the Com- mittee on Foreign Affairs which deals with the authorization for the acquisi- tion and the building of foreign build- ings. They had been wrangling around about an ambassador's residence in this country. The present one was inade- quate, in the downtown section of the city, surrounded by high buildings which looked down on it. As a result of my stop- ping over there, I recommended and my subcommittee approved that they buy an ambassador's residence out in the suburbs, a short trip from downtown, which they did for $600,000. Then we recommended that they sell the present residence, which they did, for $1.8 mil- lion, which was a net profit to the United States of $1.2 million. Now, if I had gone directly from here to that country, in- cluding my air fare and that of the staff director of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and one other committee member who was with me, I suppose we wouldhave spent a total of maybe, I would say, $3,000 or $4,000. If the press had the occasion to report on it, they would have reported about this junket and the ex- penditure, but you can well imagine they would never have said anything about the recommendations which subse- quently came out of it which netted the Government $1.2 million. So, therefore, with that exact example, I want to con- cur in what the gentleman from Illinois just said and to say that I wish more Members would avail themselves of the opportunity to travel and find out where some of the money that is going abroad has been going. Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio. Mem- bers, of course, realize he is a very modest Member of the House. I am sure on many other instances his actions have resulted in practical savings of that nature. Mr. HAYS. Will the gentleman yield further? Mr. DERWINSKI. I yield to the gentle- man. Mr. HAYS. The gentleman knows that we recommended against the State De- partment's wishes, recommending that they not build an apartment building in Hong Kong and that they not build new housing in Australia and that they not build an apartment building in Thailand. And none of them was built. And why were they not? The testimony we had here was that they were badly needed, but when we got out there the local people said: We do not need them. We do not want them. We can rent property cheaper. Do not build them. Now, if somebody had not gone out there, then we probably would have taken in good faith the recommendations of the people downtown and gone ahead and built them. Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I re- emphasize that this record at the close of debate on these two resolutions will show the very positive nature of con- gressional travel. I would like to reem- phasize that at least in my dictionary that the word \"junket\" has a proper pos- itive connotation. It is unfortunate that the occasional abuse is the only thing that is ever noted. I would like to note from my personal experience at Inter- parliamentary Union meetings in and from the experiences of other Members there have been positive practical de- velopments from the inspection of mili- tary bases, overseas dependent schools, and from conversations with our ambas- sadors abroad that have enabled Mem- bers to do a more effective job on their committees. The United States is the world's most advanced country, is in- directly involved in every major global development, and the jurisdiction over all of our committees at least indirectly has international effect. Surely there are abuses, but these are not the standard procedure. They are the occasional rot- ten apple in the barrel. But, Mr. Speaker, as a whole, congres- sional travel is necessary, helpful, and certainly in the national interest. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman from Illinois has again expired.Mr. SMITH of California. Mr. Speaker,I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman fromIowa [Mr. OGoss]. Mr. GROSS. Mr. Speaker, I am sorrythat the people downtown who havesomething to say about buildings-andit may not be in the department of thegentleman from Ohio [Mr. HAYS]--ap. parently saw fit to build a $12 million palace for a potentate over in theAfrican area not long ago. Perhaps we ought to have a 6-month session of Congress and adjourn so that all Members of the House of Representa- tives can gad about the world and lookat the $12 million palaces that are beingbuilt. Mr. HAYS. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. GROSS. Yes, I yield to the gentle-man from Ohio. Mr. HAYS. The gentleman from Iowa has long been known as a great econo- mizer. The gentleman is also a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. The gentleman further knows that I have urged him upon many occasions to travel and, perhaps, if he would travel, the gentleman would know about thesethings before the fact instead of after the fact. And, Instead of talking about them after the fact, perhaps the gentle- man could stop them in the first place. I would like to see the gentleman from Iowa travel a great deal. Mr. GROSS. I will say to the gentle- man from Ohio that I am here to vote to cut down upon the spending of money that has gone far too often for wasteful and extravagant purposes overseas. I have been here to vote on all of those bills, but I do not seem to get very far for lack of help in voting against the many foreign handout bills. I would like to have more help in opposition to these multibillion dollar foreign aid bills and then it would not be necessary for so many Members of Congress to prowl around so many different countries. We would at least save that much money for the taxpayers of this country. Mr. HAYS. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield further? Mr. GROSS. Yes, I yield further to the gentleman from Ohio. Mr. HAYS. I think the gentleman Is too modest in saying that he has been a failure. Mr. GROSS. No. Mr. HAYS. He has been very good and he has been very successful. Mr. GROSS. I have just failed to con- vince the gentleman from Ohio that we should practice more economy. Mr. HAYS. Well- Mr. GROSS. Further, that the gentle- man ought to help by being here and voting to cut down on some of this spend- ing. The gentleman from Iowa has failed in that department. Mr. HAYS. Mr. Speaker, will the gen- tleman yield further? Mr. GROSS. I yield further to the gen- tleman from Ohio. Mr. HAYS. The gentleman from Iowa failed to convince me to vote against a $200,000 project that was not budgeted which would have provided certain benefits at Waterloo, Iowa. I voted for that and I was convinced by the gentle- man's silence that he went along with34140 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE it. So the gentleman from Iowa has not been a failure all the way. Mr. GROSS. I do not recall that the gentleman from Ohio voted for it. Mr. HAYS. I think if the gentleman from Iowa will check the record, the gentleman will find that I did. Further, it is my recollection that I recall talking this matter over quietly with the gentle- man, without being on the floor, as to why you were not up here opposing it. I understood why you were not opposing it. I think the gentleman from Iowa was doing his job, as I would have done for some of my constituents. Mr. Speaker, the only point I make is that the gentleman has not convinced me as to the subject of having been a failure. Mr. GROSS. We should have dras- tically cut these foreign aid bills and I failed to convince the gentleman from Ohio of that fact. Mr. HAYS. Mr. Speaker, will the gen- tleman yield further? Mr. GROSS. I am glad to yield to the gentleman from Ohio. Mr. HAYS. Does not the gentleman from Iowa recall that I offered an amendment or two to cut it in the com- mittee? Mr. GROSS. I understood that the gentleman was going to vote against it, but if my memory serves me correctly the gentleman did not vote against it on the House floor this year or last year. Mr. HAYS. Mr. Speaker, if the gentle- man will yield further, the gentleman from Iowa realizes that they brought the foreign aid bill up when I had made a commitment to be away, and I put first things first. In other words, I felt that my commitment was more im- portant that the foreign aid bill, to tell the gentleman the truth. Mr. GROSS. Mr. Speaker, in the time I have left I would like to return to this resolution. As a member of the Com- mittee on Post Office and Civil Service, I am not clear as to just what is proposed to be accomplished by sending 11 mem- bers of this committee and two staff members abroad. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman from Iowa has expired. Mr. SMITH of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman 3 additional min- utes. Mr. GROSS. Just what is to be ac- complished, if someone can tell me, and where the 11 members are bound for? Mr. OLSEN. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. GROSS. I yield to the gentleman from Montana. Mr. OLSEN. The gentleman was pres- ent in the committee the day that it was reviewed. The gentleman heard us discuss the accomplishments of two pre- vious trips of the committee to European countries where studies were made of the movement of GI mail to Europe, and where studies were made of moderniza- tion and mechanization of the postal systems there, and the fact that when we returned from these previous trips, one of them 5 years ago and one of them 2 years ago, we caused the Post Office Department in the United States to have increased impetus toward mod- ernization and mechanization.We caused to be passed by the Con- gress laws that expedited the delivery of GI mail. Now we find that our Post Office De- partment, from testimony taken yester- day and the day before, is not moving as rapidly as we anticipated they might, and that European countries are still exceeding us in mechanization, and we want to see firsthand how far ahead they are again. Mr. GROSS. Well, if I understand- Mr. OLSEN. And again give considera- tion to the Post Office Department in mechanization. The other part of the subject-- Mr. GROSS. The gentleman is taking all of my time. Mr. OLSEN. Just let me answer the gentleman insofar as reference to the East. We are having great problems about the movement of mail to the GI's in Vietnam. Mr. GROSS. Yes. Mr. OLSEN. And it has not been smoothed out, and I do not believe it will until we go down and see it. Mr. GROSS. Now, I believe I have the general idea. I suggest that the gentle- man will accomplish just as much if, in- stead of the taxpayers bearing the ex- pense of sending any part of an 11-man delegation out to Vietnam to look at the mail situation, that action be taken right here. I believe the cure is right here in Washington in the Post Office Depart- ment and in the Department of Defense. And for the price of a taxicab---- Mr. OLSEN. If the gentleman will yield further- Mr. GROSS. Just one moment, now. I have the time. For a price of a taxi- cab fare to the Pentagon and over to the Post Office Department, they would ac- complish far more toward the movement of mail out to Vietnam than they will by sending a delegation 12,000 miles across the Pacific. As far as Europe is concerned, delega- tions from the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service have been there before, and insofar as any results are concerned, our mail service has deteriorated since .they were last over there. I doubt very much that they are going to accomplish anything over there except to enjoy a nice junket to various countries, perhaps to the Scandanavian countries. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. SMITH of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. HALL]. Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. I want to say in the beginning that I would like to change the particular tone of the colloquy at this time, and get back to the question of the identical amendment to the one passed on House Resolution 960 in the imme- diate prior consideration in the well of this House. I especially appreciate the comments of all three of the gentlemen from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, one of whom is also on the Committee on House Administration. I was delighted to learn that where there had been double per diem charges in counterpart funds that it had been returned.The other two gentlemen are also on the committee pertaining to this bill, Post Office and Civil Service. Second, I believe it may surprise some of the Members to know that after years of hearings on the Joint Committee on the Organization of the Congress andRelated Agencies, I am thoroughly con- vinced that the surveillance, oversight, and review functions of the Congress, asfar as the bureaus downtown are con-cerned, are just as important as the su- pervision of an architect in the construc-tion of any given building is concerned.Therefore, I am not dogmatically againstthe educational travel or the supervision by the Members, whether it be here or overseas. Mr. OLSEN. Mr. Speaker, will the gen- tleman yield? Mr. HALL. I am glad to yield to thegentleman. Mr. OLSEN. The gentleman does notmean to insinuate that any member of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service had drawn per diem for morethan once on the same day? Mr. HALL. As a matter of fact, noth- ing could be further from my mind than insinuating that any individual Mem- ber or committee has done this as I amcertain rereading of the record will con- firm. Except, if you will read the record of the House's Clerk of these disburse- ments, you will see that on past occa- sions it has happened. Of course, these are open books and, therefore, they are open for the public to read. Mr. Speaker, this second amendment that I will propose, should I be yielded to for that purpose, would be identical to the one I offered on House Resolution 960. It simply inserts after the word agency on line 4, page 3 of this resolu- tion, House Resolution 971, this lan- guage: Amounts of per diem shall not be fur- nished for a period of time in any country if per diem has been furnished for the same period of time in any other country, irrespec- tive of differences in time zones. Mr. Speaker, I would now like to ask the gentleman who is handling the rule for the Committee on Rules again, if he would yield, after further delibera- tion, for the purpose of offering this amendment to this resolution. Mr. ANDERSON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. HALL. I yield to the gentleman. Mr. ANDERSON of Tennessee. I will say to the gentleman, the gentleman from Illinois and myself erred in this parliamentary procedure on the previ- ous resolution and that it requires spe- cial instructions from the Committee on Rules in order to yield for an amend- ment. I will say to the gentleman, I cannot yield for that purpose on this resolution. I cannot speak for the chairman nor for all the Committee on Rules members, however, I feel in accordance with past policy should the gentleman care to bring up such a proposal in the case of future travel resolutions, they certainly would be considered by the Committee on Rules. Mr. HALL. I thank the gentleman. I think that is most generous on his part. Would not the gentleman agree with34141 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 me that having had the House work its will and inserting the amendment in the previous resolution, as passed, that it would be meet and proper for its con- sideration by the Committee on Rules as a regular addition to the added on travel resolutions, as in the past. Especially since it was accepted by all who spoke to the amendment including the gentle- man, and the chairman of the subcom- mittee who handles such disbursements as well as the chairman of the parent Committee on Education and Labor. Mr. ANDERSON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. HALL. I yield to the gentleman, but first wish to state he did not err in good parliamentary procedure or accord- ing to the rules of the House. Perhaps according to tradition of the committee, but it served good purpose and was prudent. Mr. ANDERSON of Tennessee. I am fully confident in accordance with the policy of the Committee on Rules that certainly it would be meet and proper for such consideration. Mr. HALL. I appreciate the gentle- man's response and appreciate his posi- tion. Mr. Speaker, I simply want to add that the parliamentary situation then would be as determined on the prior resolution and the ruling of the Chair on that parliamentary inquiry, that in order to insert this amendment at this time it would be necessary to vote down the pre- vious question, at which time any amend- ment from the floor would be in order. I again propound that as a parliamen- tary inquiry. Would the Chair please con- firm that? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will state that amendments may be offered only if the previous question is voted down or if the gentleman from Tennessee yields for the purpose of offer- ing an amendment. Mr. HALL. I thank the distinguished Speaker. Mr. FRIEDEL. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. HALL. I yield to the gentleman. Mr. FRIEDEL. I wish to state to the gentleman from Missouri that these travel resolutions, the one that was pre- viously passed and the pending resolu- tion, do not come from the Committee on House Administration. They come from the Committee on Rules. They in- volve the use of counterpart funds over which we have no jurisdiction. Mr. HALL. I appreciate the gentle- man's correction. I accept it and it will be corrected in the RECORD. I am glad that the gentleman from Maryland has brought that out for the RECORD. Mr. ANDERSON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentle- man from Pennsylvania [Mr. DENT]. Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker and Members, due to the peculiar parliamentary situa- tion that we found ourselves in I was not permitted to take the floor to talk when the resolution on the travel of the Com- mittee on Education and Labor was be- fore us. This committee has made two very ex- tensive trips, something like 37 days and 38 days. Prior to that a trip of about 11 or 12 days was made. Trips were gener-ated from the desire on the part of the chairman of the committee and others to see if we could develop somewhere near the truth on the question of wages paid relating to the cost of production of foreign goods that enter this country in competition with American goods pro- duced under the Fair Labor Standards Act, which is within the jurisdiction of this committee. On all of these occasions of travel, in order that the House may be acquainted with the procedures as I have learned and found them to be since I have been a Member of the Congress and traveling with various groups in Congress, is that once an agenda has been made up, the State Department takes over. They make the reservations, and outside of special requests for special types of investiga- tions in certain types of industries, the State Department usually makes up the itinerary for the entire trip. They also give you a stipulated amount, varying in some countries, in counterpart funds. Any days that the committee travels that are not in countries that have coun- terpart funds, the committee chairman usually makes payments out of funds ap- propriated by the Congress. It so happens that this committee has never had to use the funds, or has never agreed to use any of the funds appropri- ated by the Congress, and the chairman has never drawn any moneys over and above those given by the State Depart- ment. Upon returning from the trips, we have cataloged for all to see in public view, in the public record, the amounts of money received. I doubt that any trip has even amounted to more than the stipulated $50 a day for the days that we were gone. However, in recent days there has been a sort of display put on by certain writers on the question of travel by Members of Congress. I say to the House of Representatives that I am not so disturbed over the fact that there has been some charge made that some $50 of rupees or money had been overpaid to a committeeman as I am over the fact that this particular committee has prob- ably done more than any committee in the history of this Congress in search- ing out the weaknesses in our interna- tional trade policies and theories. We are not always welcome in many countries to which we go, and we have been talked into a nice quiet hour of sitting in a Japanese plant without ever getting out of the front office, because they did not want us to see their opera- tions. We have had to take our cameras, if we had them with us, and set them aside before we were even permitted into the production areas of any of these plants. And, I want to tell you, you travel in those plants at the hours they decide, and they could be mornings, af- ternoons, or evenings. If anyone thinks that these so-called junkets are a pleasure, I will gladly give my place to any one of them on any trip I am scheduled to make by resolu- tion of this Congress, and I will assure them that no matter how many counter- part funds they draw, they will be out- of-pocket for expenditures they will make, because, you cannot go into manyof these countries without paying outadditional money. We have found, in our school investi.gation, primary-grade children in afourth-floor garret with the sanitaryfacilities down in the basement-in ef-fect, what would be the fifth floor down.We found science books from which ourchildren were being taught that were 16 and 18 years old. We have foundteachers with 80 kids in one classroom. We corrected, we thought, some of these situations by getting through thisHouse three pieces of remedial legisla-tion for overseas schools. The reason this committee is asked totravel now-and I will do a great deal ofthinking before I accept the obligation oftraveling, and I think any man who travels on his own time, what little time we get off denies himself what little time there is to be with his family, and he ismaking sacrifice enough, without having somebody question the honesty of these men over 50 rubles or 100 rubles. To try to picture these trips as great big luxurious sojourns in foreign coun- tries is an injustice to the membership of this House and to the Members whotravel. I traveled many more miles be- fore I ever came to the Congress than I have traveled since I have been a Mem- ber of Congress. For many years my favorite and only vacation was to take a tramp steamer and travel to foreign countries. I travel now only because Ithink this Nation needs the information that travelers bring back. Here is a letter, received on October 13, addressed to the chairman of my com- mittee: The situation in the Overseas Dependent Schools, thanks to your committee, has Im- proved considerably over the last two years. The action of the House and Senate appro- priations committees in deleting the per pupil limitation and substituting a line item appropriation should have, by all stand- ards of sound administrative practice, elim- inated many of the frustrations which arise from overcrowded classes. It appears, how- ever, that such is not the case. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman from Pennsylvania has expired. Mr. ANDERSON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have re- maining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen- tleman from Tennessee has 19 minutes remaining. Mr. ANDERSON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 additional minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I will continue to read the letter: We are informed that many elementary grade classes in the European area have over 40 pupils. In the Frankfurt area, one reading class had 90 pupils at the beginning of the school year. Some high school English teach- ers, we are told, must handle as many as 180 different pupils a day. These children are the sons and daugh- ters of your American servicemen who are stationed overseas not by their own choice. These kids have had to come back to this country and lose a whole year's schooling because they were downgraded in their educational attainment. Leaving the school situation, let us take a look at this. U.S. firm affiliates34142 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE abroad are spending $10,200,000,000 this year in additions. This committee has discovered there are over 500 American- owned plants and facilities in Holland and Belgium alone, with over 300 joint ventures. No person in the United States can tell how many dollars worth of former ex- ports to these countries has now been taken by these American affiliates. No one can tell how many millions of dol- lars of U.S. imports are produced by American-owned plants, displanting American production and labor. No per- son in this room can tell or even attempt to tell to what degree the penetration of these foreign countries is going to take place by American industries unless some relief comes to the steel industry and to the textile industry. We discovered where some of the larg- est textile units in the entire United States were already buying textiles from India, where labor is paid 7 to 15 cents an hour. I do not travel on a 22-year-old air- plane because I want to go for a pleasure trip. I would much rather go and sit on a stream in the beautiful Ligonier Moun- tains near my hometown of Jeanette than to cover approximately 40,000 miles in a little over a month, which I have done, until I did not care whether I ever saw another plane. I have not seen any- thing or anyplace that could take the place of my State of Pennsylvania or my county of Westmoreland. I am sure that only because of these trips was I able to convince the House to pass H.R. 478, the one piece of legislation that can save millions of U.S. jobs in the disastrous trade wars about to break all around us. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman from Pennsylvania has expired. Mr. ANDERSON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentle- man from Montana [Mr. OLSEN]. Mr. OLSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise just to emphasize what has already been said, that there is not any amendment neces- sary to this resolution of the Rules Com- mittee concerning per diem pay to each person. He can get only 1 day's pay for each day abroad. The resolution very well states that. All the prohibitions against getting more than 1 day's pay for 1 day will not make the prohibition any stronger than is already in the resolu- tion. The resolution speaks for itself. The law speaks for itself. There cannot be and there has not been drawn by any member of the Committee on Post Of- fice and Civil Service more than 1 day's pay for a day's travel. I submit that the rule ought to be voted just as it is. Mr. SMITH of California. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Iowa would like to have 1 more minute, and I yield the gen- tleman 1 minute. Mr. GROSS. Mr. Speaker, I wonder how many committees of Congress have already investigated the school situation in Europe, as just one item of this travel business? I suspect the Armed Services Committee has been sending committees over these ostensibly to investigate theschools. I know the Post Office and Civil Service Committee had a contingent in Europe looking into teachers' salaries. It has long been my contention that there is far too much duplication in the claimed purposes of these junkets. And on the subject of hardship of for- eign travel about which we have just heard, I suggest that perhaps the House ought to give consideration to hardship pay for Members of Congress who take these trips abroad. Mr. ANDERSON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to correct a typographical error in the res- olution: On page 2, line 17, delete the word \"of\" and insert in lieu therefor the word \"for.\" The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. AL- BERT). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? The was no objection. Mr. ANDERSON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move the previous question on the resolution. The previous question was ordered. The resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 13706, INTEREST RATES ON LOANS BY FEDERAL LAND BANKS, PRODUCTION CREDIT AS- SOCIATIONS, AND BANKS FOR COOPERATIVES Mr. O'NEILL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 987 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as fol- lows: H. RES. 987 Resolved, That upon the adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to move that the House resolve itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 13706) to amend the Federal Farm Loan Act and the Farm Credit Act of 1933, as amended, and for other purposes. After general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and shall con- tinue not to exceed one hour, to be equally civided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Agriculture, the bill shall be read for amendment under the five-minute rule. At the conclusion of the consideration of the bill for amendment, the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted, and the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit. After the passage of H.R. 13706, it shall be in order in the House to take from the Speaker's table the bill S. 2565 and to move to strike out all after the enacting clause of said Senate bill and insert in lieu thereof the provisions con- tained in H.R. 13706 as passed by the House. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen- tleman from Massachusetts is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. O'NEILL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, at the conclusion of my remarks I will yield 30 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. ANDERSON]. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 987 provides an open rule with 1 hour of gen- eral debate for consideration of H.R. 13706 to amend the Federal Farm LoanAct and the Farm Credit Act of 1933, as amended, and for other purposes. The resolution further provides that after passage of the House bill it shall be in order to take S. 2565 from the Speaker's table, move to strike out all after the enacting clause and insert the House- passed language. At present the applicable acts of Con- gress prohibit a higher rate of interest than 6 percent on loans made by Federal land banks and banks for cooperatives. These limitations make further legisla- tion necessary in order that the lending may continue on a self-sustaining basis. This is because when the cost of loan funds approaches or exceeds 6 percent, it will not be feasible for the banks and associations to lend the funds so obtained under 6 percent loan interest rate limi- tations and continue on a self-sustaining basis. The purpose of H.R. 13706 is to permit interest rates on loans made by Federal land banks, production credit associa- tions, and banks for cooperatives to be determined as provided in the Federal Farm Loan Act and the Farm Credit Act of 1933, as amended, to cover the cost of loan funds and other expenses and re- serves so that the lending may continue on a self-sustaining basis. The bill would remove the 6-percent maximum loan interest rate limitations in such acts of Congress which now apply to loans made by Federal land banks and banks for cooperatives. By again including in the Farm Credit Act of 1933 a sentence that was in that act from 1933 to 1956, the bill would clarify how interest rates on loans made by production credit associations are to be determined. Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of House Resolution 987 in order that H.R. 13706 may be considered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen- tleman from Illinois is recognized for 30 minutes. Mr. ANDERSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I think the only thing I would add in addition to what the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. O'NEILL] has said about the rule under which we would consider this bill is that it would be in order after the passage of this bill, H.R. 13706, to take from the Speaker's table a similar Senate bill, S. 2565, and to strike out all after the enacting clause in that bill and insert in lieu thereof the bill as passed by the House. Some of you who were here earlier this afternoon know that our session today opened with a colloquy between myself, the chairman of the Committee on Bank- ing and Currency, and other Members over the fact that we are facing some- thing of a crisis in this country because of high interest rates which are in some instances higher than they have been at any time since the Civil War. Of course, this bill to remove the 6-percent ceiling on the lending done by the Farm Credit system is absolutely necessary unless we desire, as the report makes clear, the lending operations of that farm credit system ultimately to expire. I had not realized, frankly, myself until the hearings before the rules com- mittee the extent to which farmers and34143 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 ranchers in this country depend on the lending operations of the Farm Credit System. The sum of $10.4 billion was outstanding at the end of the current fiscal year and a total of $8.3 billion was loaned to farmers and farm cooperatives during the fiscal year 1967. This bill comes to us in a somewhat unusual sit- uation because of the emergency I have described, the crisis brought on by these high interest rates. There were actually no public hear- ings held by the Committee on Agri- culture. However, the bill did come out of the committee unanimously. It is sup- ported not only by the majority side of the aisle, but there are several bills of an identical nature which were sub- mitted by members of the minority. So, in the interests of making sure that this very necessary adjunct to our credit sys- tem not be permitted to expire because of spiraling interest rates, we should enact this legislation which would au- thorize the removal of the present 6- percent ceiling. As the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. O'NEILL] made clear, the farm credit loan banks depend on the deben- tures and bonds they sell on the open market to get the money they lend to thefarmer and the rancher. Obviously, with obligations of the U.S. Government, some of them backed by the full faith and credit of this Government, bringing an interest rate of 5% percent, they can- not go out and borrow money in the money market without paying in excess of 6 percent today. Therefore, they have to charge more than 6 percent if they are going to make these loans to the farmers and ranchers of America. So, Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption ofthe rule. Mr. O'NEILL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I move the previous question. The previous question was ordered. The resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on thetable. INTERSTATE SHIPMENTS OF INTOXICATING LIQUORS Mr. ANDERSON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 956and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as fol- lows: H. RES. 956 Resolved, That upon the adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to move that the House resolve itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 5754) to amend section 1263 of title 18 of theUnited States Code to require that interstate shipments of intoxicating liquors be ac- companied by bill of lading, or other docu-ment, showing certain information in lieu of requiring such to be marked on the pack- age. After general debate, which shall beconfined to the bill and shall continue not to exceed one hour, to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary, the bill shall be read for amend- ment under the five-minute rule. At the con- clusion of the consideration of the bill for amendment, the Committee shall rise and re- port the bill to the House with such amend- ments as may have been adopted, and theprevious question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit. Mr. ANDERSON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 minutes to the dis- tinguished gentleman from Illinois [Mr. ANDERSON] and pending that I yield my- self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 956 provides for an open rule with 1 hour of general debate for the consideration of H.R. 5754 to amend existing law to re- quire that interstate shipments of in- toxicating liquors be accompanied by a bill of lading showing certain infor- mation. Mr. Speaker, under existing law, a package containing intoxicating liquors being shipped in interstate commerce must contain an outside label indicat- ing the name of the consignee and the nature, bottler, and quantity of the con- tents. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5754, if adopted, would amend title 18, United States Code, section 1263, to provide that a bill of lading or other document accompany- ing an interstate shipment of intoxicat- ing liquors identify the consignee rather than requiring that the consignee be identified on each individual box. Mr. Speaker, no cost to the Govern- ment is involved in this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of House Resolution 956 in order that the bill H.R. 5754 may be considered. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ANDERSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I think the distinguished gentleman from Tennessee [Mr. ANDER- SON], my distinguished colleague, has adequately explained the 1-hour rule un- der which, if adopted, we would consider the legislation. H.R. 5754 represents a change in the law, a change which would make it unnecessary for those engaged in the shipment of liquor in interstate commerce to designate the consignee on each individual carton or the package. Mr. Speaker, one other point which I would like to make is that there are sep- arate views which accompany this report. Mr. Speaker, one member of the com- mittee, the gentleman from North Caro- lina [Mr. WHITENER] feels that the adop- tion of this legislation would hamper Government law enforcement by reliev- ing shippers of that particular respon- sibility to so label the package. The gen- tleman from North Carolina also ex- pressed the view that the passage of this bill might indicate the intent of the Congress to preempt the State field with reference to the regulation of the sale of intoxicating liquors within its bound- aries. Mr. Speaker, I merely call those argu- ments to the attention of the Members of the House this afternoon as they are contained in the separate views appended to the report. Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. ANDERSON of Illinois. I yield to the gentleman from Colorado. Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I have consulted with the dis-tinguished gentleman from North Caro-lina [Mr. WHITENER] and the gentleman does have an amendment which makesclear that the States are not deprived ofthe power to enact additional prohibi-tions with respect to intoxicating liquorswhich is acceptable to the committee,It is my understanding that the amend-ment will be presented by another mem-ber of the committee. Mr. ANDERSON of Illinois. I thankthe gentleman from Colorado for thatexplanation. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requestsfor time and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ANDERSON of Tennessee. Mr.Speaker, I move the previous question onthe resolution. The previous question was ordered. The resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on thetable. Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I move that the House resolve itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 5754) to amend section 1263 of title 18 of the United States Code to require that inter- state shipments of intoxicating liquors be accompanied by bill of lading, or other document, showing certain information in lieu of requiring such to be marked on the package. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The ques- tion is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Colorado. The motion was agreed to. IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE Accordingly the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the con- sideration of the bill H.R. 5754, with Mr. HAMILTON in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. By unanimous consent, the first read- ing of the bill was dispensed with. The CHAIRMAN. Under the rule, the gentleman from Colorado [Mr. ROGERS] will be recognized for 30 minutes, and the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. McCULLocH] will be recognized for 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado [Mr. ROGERS]. Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. Mr. Chair- man, under existing Federal law-18 U.S.C. 1263-a package containing intox- icating liquor which is shipped in inter- state commerce must be labeled on the outside cover to show the name of the consignee, the nature of its contents and the quantity therein. Failure to comply with this requirement is punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprison- ment of not more than 1 year, or both. The purpose of H.R. 5754, as amended, is to provide that the information re- quired by statute be set forth in a bill of lading or other document accompany- ing the shipment in lieu of a label on each package. The change proposed by this bill is designed to facilitate the handling and transportation of liquor in light of mod- em methods of interstate shipping. Un- der present day shipping practices when 40 or 50 boxes of liquor have been pack- aged they are placed on a single pallet and stored in a warehouse awaiting or-34144 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE ders for shipment. To comply with the provisions of existing law each box on the pallet must be removed and stenciled with the name of the consignee and then repacked on the pallet whenever an order is received. By permitting the identifica- tion of the consignee in documents which accompany the shipment the needs for rehandling individual packages will be considerably reduced. This, in turn, should result in substantial savings in labor and cost. As a practical matter, enactment of H.R. 5754, as amended, will only result in eliminating the marking of the con- signee's name on the shipping container. It will not repeal, impair or in any way interfere with existing labelling require- ments under the provisions of the Fed- eral Alcohol Administration Act. Under the regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to his author- ity under the Federal Alcohol Admin- istration Act (27 U.S.C. 205(e)), and the Internal Revenue Code, each case of liq- uor is required to bear an individual serial number and other markings-in- dicating the kind of liquor, name of bot- tler, quantity, alcoholic content, et cetera-which enables complete identifi- cation of each individual case or pack- age. H.R. 5754 will not change these reg- ulations. The section of existing law which H.R. 5754 amends is one of several enact- ments passed by Congress in 1909 de- signed to assist the States in enforcing their prohibition laws. At that time States were powerless to prevent intoxi- cating liquors from being shipped into their borders and sold there by the orig- inal importers in the package in which imported. But today, by virtue of the 21st amendment to the Constitution, States now have full authority to pro- hibit or regulate the importation of liq- uor into their borders. Moreover, the committee is advised that the National Conference of State Liquor Administra- tors and the National Alcoholic Bever- age Control Association, Inc., which in- clude in their membership the liquor ad- ministrators of most of the States, have no objection to the enactment of H.R. 5754. Finally, Mr. Chairman, the Depart- ment of Justice as well as the Treasury Department have informed the commit- tee that the change proposed by H.R. 5754 will not adversely affect any Federal interest and, accordingly, they do not object to the enactment of this legisla- tion. In order to afford States which may Possibly rely on present label require- ments of section 1263 of title 18, United States Code, the committee has amended the bill to delay the effective date and thereby give the States ample opportu- nity to adjust to the proposed change. Mr. Chairman, I believe the bill, as amended, will serve all State and Federal enforcement purposes and at the same time facilitate handling and transporta- tion of interstate shipments of intoxicat- ing liquors and result in substantial sav- ings in labor and costs. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. WYMAN. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield?Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. I yield to the gentleman. Mr. WYMAN. Was it the intention in recommending this legislation to remove the statutory requirement that a pack- age that has whisky in it is not to be marked on the outside of the package that it is whisky instead of removing solely the requirement that the name of the consignee should not be on each package. Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. May I make it clear to the gentleman from New Hampshire that it is not the intention of this legislation to eliminate from any package that may contain whisky, wine, or other intoxicating liquors the require- ment under the Federal Alcohol Admin- istration Act that there be appropriate labels placed on that particular package. The only thing this bill does is to provide that where a consignee's name has been required to be placed on the shipping container, that his name be placed in the bill of lading-and not on the package. This bill only amends section 1263 of title 18, United States Code, in dealing with intoxicating liquor. Mr. WYMAN. I would like to call the gentleman's attention to the committee's report on page 5 where the section of the present statutory law that is being amended by this bill is set forth, with the sections that are deleted in parentheses. In the center of that section, it shows the requirement that the package \"be so labeled on the outside cover as to plainly show\" is removed so there is no longer any statutory requirement under this section of the United States Code that such packages shall show that they con- tain liquor. The gentleman earlier referred to reg- ulations of the department that require this. May I inquire whether, should this bill be passed, it would not be true that there will then be no affirmative statu- tory requirement that whisky shall be marked as whisky in Interstate com- merce? Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. It is not true because under the present provi- sions of title 27, United States Code, sec- tion 205(e), and I pointed this out in my \"statement. The Secretary of the Treasury is obliged to prescribe regulations gov- erning the labelling of interstate ship- ments of intoxicating liquors. Such labels are required by statute to fully identify and describe the contents and quality of the package. We do not change that statute in any manner whatsoever. Mr. WYMAN. But that authority is by regulation; is it not? It derives from an enabling statute empowering the Sec- retary of the Treasury to provide for labeling by regulation? Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. No, this is statute. It is the Federal Alcohol Admin- istration Act, title 27, United States Code. title 27, United States Code, section 205 (e). Mr. WYMAN. But is not the labeling at the present time done under regula- tions prescribed by the administrative officials? Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. It is pro- vided by regulation and also pursuant to the statute-the Federal Alcohol Ad- ministration Act. Mr. WYMAN. But this statute, ifamended in the form that the gentleman proposes, would no longer require this labeling? Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. This bill does not amend the Federal Alcohol Ad- ministration Act. All H.R. 5754 does is to amend section 1263 of title 18 of the United States Code to provide that the information there required to be marked on the package may be set forth instead in a bill of lading or other document. We do not intend, and it is not the pur- pose of this legislation in any manner whatsoever, to eliminate any marking or label required on any container by other Federal statute or regulation. Mr. WYMAN. No matter what the in- tention may be, I submit that the way the bill that is before us is worded you are removing the statutory requirement for labeling whisky packages as well as the name of the consignee. I am trying to find out why the bill goes this far when all that is projected is a need to remove the requirement that the consignee's name be on each package. If you will look at page 5 of the re- port, you will observe that we would not remove the requirement that the descrip- tion of the contents of the package must appear on the package. The contents of the package, a label showing that it is whisky, must be on the package. You are also requiring that the name of the con- signee be on the bill of lading. But why was it necessary to take out the middle part of the parenthesis of the bracketed material at the bottom of page 5? It would have been relatively simple to in- sert before that parenthesis the lan- guage, \"unless such package is so labeled on the outside as to plainly show,\" and insert at the end of the parenthesis, \"and the shipment,\" and so forth, as described by the bill of lading, the name of the consignee, so you do not have to put the name of the consignee on each package. Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. May I point out to the gentleman from New Hamp- shire that the provisions of section 205(e) of title 27, United States Code, which I cited heretofore, pertain to the labeling of intoxicating liquors. We do not dis- turb that section in any manner whatso- ever. We would not amend that section. In addition, the committee has received a report from the Treasury Department in support of the bill, and stating they do not believe the Federal Government's in- terest would be affected in any manner whatsoever. We also have a letter from the De- partment of Justice approving the bill. As a practical matter the only thing H.R. 5754 does is to remove the name of the consignee from the outside of the particular shipping container. If it con- cains whisky, it is marked \"whisky.\" If it is wine, it is still marked \"wine\"-not under title 18, but under title 27 of the United States Code which we would not disturb. Mr. WYMAN. On the box as well as on the bottle? Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. Yes. Mr. WYMAN. And not by regulation? Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. What is that? Mr. WYMAN. And not by regulation alone? Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. It is pur-34145 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 suant to the authorization contained in title 27, United States Code section 205 (e). Mr. WYMAN. But that is authority to an administrative officer to provide for this by regulation. I agree with the gen- tleman it is apparently covered by regu- lation at the present time, but what I am trying to find out is the policy behind this proposal to remove the statutory marking requirements for the interstate shipment of whisky in packages. It seems to me that it is in the interest of law enforcement to know what is in the packages as a matter of affirmative law, and it should not be left solely to admin- istrative regulation by discretion. Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. May I say to the gentleman that the Treasury De- partment, which has jurisdiction over this subject, is fully satisfied that they would not lose anything by the enact- ment of this legislation. If the gentleman will read the section on labeling require- ments for interstate shipments of intoxi- cating liquors in section 205(e) title 27, United States Code, he will see that we would not be losing any labeling or iden- tifying of any intoxicating liquor ship- ment as a result of the enactment of the proposed legislation. Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. HUTCHINSON. Let us assume that if this bill is enacted and becomes law, a State law would still require the name of the consignee to be placed on the outside package. Suppose the State law would still require it. In view of the provisions of the 21st amendment, which state that: The transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof is hereby prohibited. In view of that amendment, State law would still apply here, would it not, and the principle of the supremacy of Fed- eral law in this field would not apply in this particular area? Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. The gen- tleman is eminently correct. In order to make that clear we have agreed to ac- cept an amendment which will be offered on behalf of the gentleman from North Carolina which would make it explicit and that the States are not deprived of any power to enact additional prohibi- tions with respect to the shipment of in- toxicating liquors. Mr. HUTCHINSON. The State could still require the name of the consignee on every package of liquor? Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. The gen- tleman is correct. The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Colorado has consumed 14 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. McCLoRY] for 30 min- utes. Mr. McCLORY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I want to point out very emphatically that this bill does not re- lieve the shipper or manufacturer of any requirement to mark and identify cases of liquor so as to indicate the name of thebottler, the quantity of liquor, and the kind of liquor that is contained in each package shipped. It should not in any way affect any regulations which the Secretary of the Treasury has prescribed pursuant to the Federal Alcohol Admin- istration Act, section 205(e) of title 27, United States Code. In the present state of the law, there is a duplication in the requirement that the liquor package be properly labeled. By amending title 18, we leave untouched the protection in title 27. The purpose of the legislation is to fa- cilitate the handling of packages and to decrease costs for those who deal in these products. It is not intended to interfere in any way with law enforcement action with regard to any illegal or improper shipment. I would not want to support this leg- islation in any way if it might be inter- preted otherwise. I want to assure the members of this committee that it has been represented to the subcommittee upon which I serve as the ranking minority member, and to the House Judiciary Committee, and, I am confident, to the Members on both sides of the aisle that this legislation is not going to impair or interfere in any way with the action or duties of the At- torney General or anyone else charged with enforcement of the laws of our Nation. It appears to me this legislation is logi- cal and appropriate, regardless of what attitude we may have with regard to the liquor industry itself. It is for that rea- son I am supporting this legislation. H.R. 5754 would facilitate commerce while preserving Federal and State regu- lation over shipments of intoxicating liquors. Section 1263 of title 18 presently makes it a crime to fail to place the consignee's name on each package of liquors shipped. This means that the manufacturer who by virtue of title 27, United States Code, section 205 (e) must mark on each pack- age the kind of liquor, the name of the bottler, the quantity and quality of the contents, and so forth, must also, after negotiating a consignment, go back to mark each package again-this time with the name of the consignee. That extra step is a needless cost, both in labor and time. Placing the consignee's name on the bill of lading is sufficient. H.R. 5754 would allow just that. Thus the bill would eliminate such un- necessary costs. Consequently, the indus- try favors this bill. The Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury have indicated that law en- forcement would not be affected by the bill. The National Conference of State Liquor Administrators and the National Alcoholic Beverage Control Association indicate that they have no objection to this legislation. The bill is very narrow in scope. It is not controversial. I therefore urge the House to pass this measure. Mr. WYMAN. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. McCLORY. I yield to the gentle- man from New Hampshire. Mr. WYMAN. Mr. Chairman, at the time the subcommittee had this under consideration, was the point brought upthat the statute as it was proposed to beamended here today would leave the mat-ter of labeling of contents of boxes thatcontain liquor, which will go into inter.state commerce, to regulation by Secre-tary of the Treasury? Mr. McCLORY. No. I can say veryemphatically it was not represented thatway, but that there was existing adequateFederal law for requiring the appropriatelabeling of every case of liquor. Mr. WYMAN. The existing adequateFederal law to which the gentleman hasreference, I take it, refers to the sentence on page 2 of the committee's report, thatsays in part: Under regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to his authority under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (sec. 205(e), title 27, United States Code),require that each case of liquor bear an in- dividual serial number and other markings (indicating the kind of liquor, name of bot- tler, quantity, etc.) which enable complete identification of each individual case or package. There is this affirmative requirement. Is that not so? Mr. McCLORY. Yes, and it says: Pursuant to his authority under the Fed- eral Alcohol Administration Act (sec. 205(e), title 27, United States Code). Mr. WYMAN. But the requirement that the package show the nature of the con- tents is because the Secretary of the Treasury, acting pursuant to that act, says this is the case, and not because the act requires it? Mr. McCLORY. As I understand it, every case of liquor must bear the serial number, and mark indicating the kind of liquor, the bottler, and so on, requiring important identification of the contents, and it is that requirement under law which would be continuing and would not be affected by this legislation. As I interpret section 205 (e) of title 27, the Secretary of the Treasury is required to prescribe regulations which require labeling. He has no choice in the matter. He may have some discretion in working out the details. But he is not free to re- peal completely the regulations now in force. Mr. WYMAN. I thank the gentleman. Mr. McCLORY. Mr. Chairman, I have no further requests for time. Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. Mr. Chair- man, I have no further requests for time. The CHAIRMAN. There being no fur- ther requests for time, the Clerk will read. The Clerk read as follows: H.R. 5754 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That section 1263 of title 18 of the United States Code is amended to read as follows: \"Whoever know- ingly ships into any place within the United States any package containing any spiritu- ous, vinous, malted, or other fermented liquor, or any compound containing any spirituous, vinous, malted, or other fermented liquor fit for use for beverage purposes, un- less such shipment is accompanied by copy of a bill of lading, or other document show- ing the name of the consignee, the nature of its contents, and the quantity contained therein, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.\"34146 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will re- port the committee amendment. The Clerk read as follows: On page 2, after line 5, add the following new section 2: \"SEC. 2. This Act shall become effective ninety days after the date of its enactment.\" The committee amendment was agreed to. AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. DOWDY Mr. DOWDY. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. DOWDY: On page 2, line 6, insert the following new Sec- tion 2, and redeslgnate the remaining sec- tion accordingly: \"SEC. 2. Nothing contained in this Act shall be construed as indicating an intent on the part of Congress to deprive any State of the power to enact additional prohibi- tions with respect to the shipment of in- toxicating liquors.\" Mr. DOWDY. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 5754 should not be enacted unless this amendment is written into the bill. The interstate shipment of intoxicat- ing liquors presents many problems which are not apparent to the casual observer. Most of these problems are met head on by local law enforcement officers who seek to stamp out the illegal trans- portation of intoxicants. H.R. 5754 would greatly hamper good law enforcement because it would relieve the shipper of intoxicating liquors of the responsibility of labeling the outside cover of the package containing the liquor as is now required by law. Under H.R. 5754 the shipper would merely be required to make up a bill of lading or other document and see that it \"accom- panied\" the shipment of liquor. The un- happy results that could come from this change of the law should be apparent to any person who has had connection with law enforcement. The bill does not contain any lan- guage which would make it clear that by its enactment the Congress did not in- tend to preempt the field in which it is legislating. This, in my opinion, could result in the courts holding that many State statutes, which rigidly regulate the transportation of intoxicating beverages and liquors, are no longer enforceable because of congressional preemption of the subject. This amendment conforms to the posi- tion taken by myself in other legislation which would or could be interpreted to preempt State laws. This concept has been joined by Mr. WHITENER, Mr. ASH- MORE, Mr. TUCK, as well as other of our colleagues, and I am of the opinion that H.R. 5754 should be defeated unless this amendment is adopted. We should not in any action taken here, handicap or interfere with the efforts of any State to enforce its liquor control laws. Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. Mr. Chair- man, will the gentleman yield? Mr. DOWDY. I yield to the gentleman from Colorado. Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. I have had an opportunity to examine the amend- ment offered by the gentleman from Texas, and I believe it would help to CXIII- 2151-Part 25improve the bill. Therefore, we will accept the same. Mr. DOWDY. I thank the gentleman. Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. DOWDY. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. HUTCHINSON. I should like to state that I certainly have no objection to this amendment, but in my opinion it is absolutely unnecessary in view of sec- tion 2 of the 21st article of amendment to the Constitution of the United States, because under no circumstances could the Congress take away from the States their own power in this field. Mr. DOWDY. I hope the gentleman is correct, but it is out of abundance of caution that we offer this amendment. We do not know what the courts would say about it. The CHAIRMAN. The question is onthe amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas [Mr. DOWDY]. The amendment was agreed to. The CHAIRMAN. Under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly the Committee rose; and the Speaker having resumed the chair, Mr. HAMILTON, Chairman of the Com- mittee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that that Commit- tee having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5754) to amend section 1263 of title 18 of the United States Code to require that interstate shipments of in- toxicating liquors be accompanied by bill of lading, or other document, showing certain information in lieu of requiring such to be marked on the package, pur- suant to House Resolution 956, he re- ported the bill back to the House with sundry amendments adopted by the Com- mittee of the Whole. The SPEAKER. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment? If not, the Chair will put them en gros. The amendments were agreed to. The SPEAKER. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read thethird time. The SPEAKER. The question is on the passage of the bill. The bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. INTEREST RATES ON LOANS BY FEDERAL LAND BANKS, PRODUC- TION CREDIT ASSOCIATIONS, AND BANKS FOR COOPERATIVES Mr. POAGE. Mr. Speaker, I move that the House resolve itself into the Com- mittee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 13706) to amend the Federal Farm Loan Act and the Farm Credit Act of 1933, as amended, and for other purposes. The SPEAKER. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas. The motion was agreed to.IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE Accordingly the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the con- sideration of the bill H.R. 13706, with Mr. HAMILTON in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. By unanimous consent, the first read- ing of the bill was dispensed with. The CHAIRMAN. Under the rule, the gentleman from Texas [Mr. POAGE] will be recognized for 30 minutes and the gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr. BEL- CHER] will be recognized for 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. POAGE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes. Mr. Chairman, this legislation is the type of legislation which none of us like to bring before the House. Yet it is a type of legislation we must deal with at this time. We are faced with a condition here and not a theory. Two of the three farm credit institutions are faced with statu- tory limitations upon their lending rights. That limitation is 6 percent in each case. These institutions cannot bor- row money for less than 6 percent at the present time and probably their next issue of debentures or bonds will have to move at approximately 6.2 or 6.25 per- cent. That would mean they would lose a quarter of a percent on every loan made if there were no expenses. The expense of operating these institutions normally runs from three-quarters of a percent to 1 percent for overhead. That means there must be approximately a 1 per- cent greater interest rate charged by the institutions than the interest rate which they can sustain on their obligations. I have been speaking of their obliga- tions, and I think I should explain to the House that the three farm credit insti- tutions, which are the land bank, the intermediate credit banks, and the banks for cooperatives, are not using Federal funds. They are using money that they borrow in the money market by the issu- ance of their own debentures or bonds. Those debentures are sold to whomever will buy them at the best deal they can get or the lowest interest rate they can get. With that money they finance the local cooperative associations. In the case ot the land banks, these are the national farm loan associations. In the case of the intermediate credit banks they are the PCA's or the production credit as- sociations. Of course, the banks for co- operatives lend only to cooperatives of various kinds. Those institutions all must pay a somewhat higher rate, or course, than the basic institution pays to get its money. For a couple of years these basic insti- tutions have been taking a loss. They have been borrowing money at rates which were so high that they could not lend it at 6 percent and break even. They have been able to go along for possibly a couple of years because they had some reserves. They have reached a situation today where they simply cannot go on much longer-probably not more than another issuance of debentures. Every one of us wishes we could keep34147 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 this interest rate down. We would like to keep it well below 6 percent. Six percent is a lot of money to pay on land loans if you are trying to pay them out. For a long period of years it was possible to borrow from the land banks for 5\u00bd per- cent interest, and some other old loans are now outstanding at 41/2 percent. I would call your attention to the fact that throughout the history of these farm credit institutions they have never raised the rate of interest on a loan once it was made. In fact, they cannot do so under the law, because once having made an obligation at 4Y2 percent, they have to continue it. They cannot call that loan simply because their rate of interest goes up. Speaking personally, I borrowed some 5-percent money from the land bank long before I came to Congress. They cannot raise those old loans. But at any time that the interest rate has gone down on their debentures the banks have con- sistently lowered the interest charges to their borrowers. They have a right to lower this interest and they have done it throughout their history. Unless we give them the leeway pro- vided in this bill there is no way they can continue to operate and give the farmers the advantage of this kind of setup. We think it is highly advantageous to farmers to have this credit. We believe that the land banks have enabled thou- sands of U.S. farmers to become home- owners throughout the United States. The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen- tleman from Texas has expired. Mr. POAGE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 additional minutes. Mr. Chairman, we believe that the Bank for Cooperatives has made it possi- ble for a great many farmers to continue to sell their milk, their livestock, and other products, at a reasonable price. Now, Mr. Chairman, it is said-\"Well, that is all fine and good; we want to con- tinue to do that by fixing this interest rate.\" When you fix this interest rate and dry up all sources of money, you simply do not render any assistance to our farmers. It will never do the farmer any good to be told that the rate is only 4 percent, if there is no money available for him to borrow at 4 percent. I have seen the day, my colleagues, when I, personally, have paid 10 percent for land money. I have paid it in my lifetime. It will break you if you keep at it very long. Yet, I would rather pay 10 percent and get the money at all, because with me it has al- ways been a question of either paying the 10-percent interest rate or losing the equity that I had in the land. That is usually the case with everyone who bor- rows in that manner. Mr. Chairman, the land banks have been able to bring down the interest rate on real estate loans all over the United States. They represent the great stabiliz- ing influence of lowering that interest rate. They have kept it down because they provide competition. The insurance companies cannot charge very much more, but if you make it impossible for the land banks to get money and to lend money, they cease to be a stabilizing in- fluence. On the other hand, the private lending institutions provide competitionfor the farm credit institutions so that they simply cannot charge the excessive rates which my colleague from Texas en- visions even if there were any incentives for them to do so-which I think I can show there is not. Therefore, as much as our Committee on Agriculture does not like this increase in interest rates, it is but placing the land banks and the banks for cooperatives upon exactly the same basis as that on which the intermediate credit banks have always been-they have never had this limitation and yet they have never overcharged anyone whom I know during the 30-odd years oftheir experience-and there is no reason for these institutions to make these overcharges because they are owned by the very people to whom they make loans. If, In fact, they loan money for 5 percent and if there were no profit, there simply would not be any dividends to be paid to the borrowers. If they loan the money for 15 percent and realize a 10-percent profit, that profit would come back in the form of dividends to the very same bor- rowers. Any profit which the associations might make is paid back to the same peo- ple who pay the interest in exactly the same proportion. So, Mr. Chairman, there is no incen- tive and no inducement in the case of these farmer-owned institutions-and these are farmer-owned institutions-- there is no inducement as exists with the private banking institutions, to raiseinterest rates. That is a fact that we haveoverlooked-that they do not operate upon the basis of private lending agencies, because they are institutions belonging to the farmers, and there is no reason for raising the interest rates. Mr. GROSS. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. POAGE. I yield to the gentleman from Iowa. Mr. GROSS. Do I understand that these lending institutions have had a ceiling of 6 percent upon the money thatthey have loaned, but that they have loaned it for less than 6 percent? Mr. POAGE. Only two of them havehad occasion to do so, the land bank and the banks for cooperatives, but theintermediate credit banks, for instance,have not had any ceiling. Mr. GROSS. Mr. Chairman, if the gen-tleman will yield further, these bankshave done so, the land bank and theproduction credit banks? Mr. POAGE. No; the production creditassociations are the institutions that are financed by the intermediate creditbanks. You see, there is a central institu- tion in each case. These central banks do not make the loans to individuals. They loan only to these cooperative associations. The land bank at Houston lends to theNational Farm Loan Association at Waco, who lends money to me. The Intermedi-ate Credit Bank of Houston lends moneyto the PCA, which in turn lends moneyto farmers. Mr. GROSS. But with the enactment of this bill there would be no ceiling?Mr. POAGE. That is right, there would be no ceiling on any of the three central institutions. Mr. GROSS. I thank the gentleman. Mr. POAGE. All of them would be inthe same position that the IntermediateCredit Bank is in today, and that is allthat this bill would do-would be to re- move that ceiling. Mr. EDMONDSON. Mr. Chairman, willthe gentleman yield? Mr. POAGE. I yield to the gentlemanfrom Oklahoma. Mr. EDMONDSON. Mr. Chairman, Iwould like to compliment the gentleman for a very clear explanation of the rea- soning behind this bill. I also wish tocongratulate the Committee on Agricul. ture. The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen. tleman from Texas has expired. Mr. POAGE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 additional minute. Mr. EDMONDSON. As I started to say, I also wish to congratulate the Com- mittee on Agriculture for moving so rap- idly to move upon this matter upon the receipt of the request from the Gover- nor of the Farm Credit Administration, I understand that request came in in the middle of October. Mr. POAGE. Actually, our committee did not move as promptly as we might have. We waited until the Senate com- mittee passed the bill. The Senate com- mittee has passed a similar bill. Mr. EDMONDSON. Again I want to thank the gentleman for presenting this legislation, and to commend the gentle- man. Mr. HALL. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. POAGE. I yield to the gentleman from Missouri. Mr. HALL. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me. Mr. Chairman, I would ask the gentle- man if the bill, H.R. 13706, and the Sen- ate bill, S. 2565, are identical? Mr. POAGE. They are not identical. The House bill simply removes the ceil- ing. The Senate bill places in the bill a formula whereby the interest rate will go up and down. The ceiling on the interest rate will go up and down as the deben- tures go up and down. We feel that this is a very impractical situation because debentures have been sold at about five or six different levels within the last year, and the interest rate to the farmer would have to be changed each time the deben- ture rate changed, if we were to followthat policy. We believe this is confusing and disruptive of good, sound banking for the farmers. Mr. HALL. If the gentleman will yield further, then the gentleman's bill, H.R. 13706, that we are now considering, would have no fixed limit- Mr. POAGE. No, sir. Mr. HALL (continuing). As the gentle- man from Iowa had asked the gentleman, but we would still have the policy with the Federal farm loan, and the bank for cooperatives, they could go up unlim- ited, but they could also reduce like the credit bank does, and always has done? Mr. POAGE. For 35 years the inter- mediate credit bank has done this. They have not had this limitation, but there has been no gouging of the farmers as a result thereof. Mr. HALL. I would also ask the gentle- man if it is not true that the cooperative bank, at least, during the last year of the tight money market, as we refer to34148 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE it, was actually paying 6'/2 percent for money that it would be lending out at 6 percent? Mr. POAGE. It did. I believe, it was actually 61/4 as I pointed out. They can- not continue to do that sort of thing. Mr. HALL. What effect do the partici- pation sales certificates have, for ex- ample, that were voted on yesterday? The Government is paying 6.35 percent on those. Mr. POAGE. It is, of course, going to make it more difficult for these Institu- tions to sell their debentures. When in- vestors can buy Government participa- tions at 6.35 percent, they are very re- luctant to buy those debentures. It may even force the interest rate to 6.5 per- cent for these banks. Mr. HALL. Does the gentleman not feel that there should be some ceiling, if there is a sort of a widening spiral that will increase inflation, even though, as the gentleman previously and well explained the fact, that he is against the formula which would be unwieldy? Mr. POAGE. I do not feel there should be a ceiling. Mr. HALL. That is because we are loaning to our own participators? Mr. POAGE. That is right. Mr. HALL. I thank the gentleman, and I support the bill. Mr. HOLIFIELD. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. POAGE. I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. HOLIFIELD. Mr. Chairman, as I understand, the gentleman and the com- mittee have felt it wise to bring this matter up because of the rising cost of money on the market? Mr. POAGE. That is right. Mr. HOLIFIELD. Unless they are al- lowed to sell these debentures on the market they would be without funds to loan to the farmers? Mr. POAGE. They do not use Govern- ment money. The only money they can get is what they sell of their own indebt- edness in the public market. Mr. HOLIFIELD. Then in voting for this, it is not a matter of endorsing high interest rates. It is a matter of necessity in relation to the source of money and the need to lend money to farmers. Mr. POAGE. That is exactly right. Mr. HOLIFIELD. In other words, we are accommodating ourselves to the situation that exists in the marketplace and it is not the purpose to vote for high interest rates as against low interest rates. Mr. POAGE. Not at all. It is a ques- tion of voting to provide some money to meet these requirements-or of not pro- viding it. Mr. BELCHER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas [Mr. DOLE]. Mr. DOLE. Mr. Chairman, I think the chairman of our committee, the gentle- man from Texas [Mr. POAGE] has very well explained the bill. Mr. Chairman, I support H.R. 13706 and strongly urge its passage. This bill will make it possible for agen- cies supervised by the Farm Credit Ad- ministration to continue offering farm lending services on a sound business basis by removing the 6-percent interest ratelimitation now provided for in the Fed- eral Farm Loan Act on loans made by the Federal land banks and the banks for cooperatives. During fiscal year 1967, the 12 Federal land banks made 45,600 long-term, farm real estate mortgages totaling $1.4 bil- lion. Loans outstanding total more than $5.5 billion to some 495,000 farmer bor- rowers. The land banks are presently furnishing over 20 percent of the long- term farm real estate mortgage demand in the United States and Puerto Rico. In their 50 years of existence the land banks have, as intended by Congress, provided a stable and consistent supply of long-term mortgage credit at a rate of interest representing its own cost of money plus reasonable operating ex- penses and reserves. The system, com- pletely owned by stockholder-members since 1947, is a stabilizing influence in American agriculture and a model for other mortgage lenders. H.R. 13706 will assist it to fulfill its traditional role to the continuing benefit of farmers and ranchers. Although the 6-percent interest limita- tion has been in effect for the land banks since the adoption of the original Farm Credit Act, there have been but a few times that it was necessary for any of the land banks to charge farmers and ranchers the maximum rate. This was for brief periods when money market rates were unusually high. The land banks determine their interest rates in light of the cost to them of funds obtained from the sale of their bonds in the investment market, and taking into account the necessity of providing sufficient margin to cover expenses and provide reasonable reserves. The cost of recent sales of land bank bonds has approached the 6-per- cent level and it becomes obvious that if the banks are to continue to operate on a sound basis, it will be necessary for loan contract rates to exceed the present legal limitation. Otherwise, they may be forced to curtail their operations and be placed in the untenable position of lending at a rate equal to or less than the cost of money obtained from the market. .Historically, it should be noted that the banks have reduced their interest rates to new borrowers as soon as cost of loan funds in the money market made this feasible. Furthermore, there have been several occasions when they also volun- tarily reduced below the contract rate interest charged existing borrowers. H.R. 13706 provides that the interest rate charged by a farm credit bank or asso- ciation shall be determined by the farm- er-elected boards of directors with the approval of the Farm Credit Adminis- tration. I am fully in accord with this provision, since it will allow the land bank system to continue its long-term agricultural lending on the same sound basis as has been practiced in the past. In discussing the provision of the bill which affects the bank for cooperatives, many of the same facts apply as have been related about the land banks. The 13 banks for cooperatives-12 district banks and the central bank located in Washington, D.C.-make loans only to farmer cooperatives. About 60 percent of the borrowed capital used by farmer co- operatives in the United States is fur-nished by the banks for cooperatives. Last year the banks extended credit totaling nearly $1.7 billion. The primary source of loan funds for the banks for cooperatives is the sale of debentures in the investment market and, in a manner similar to the land banks, they determine their lending rates after considering the cost of debentures in the market plus reasonable operating expenses and re- serve amounts. Interest rates on out- standing loans are adjusted up or down whenever interest rates charged on newloans are changed because of the effect on earnings of material changes in the cost of debentures. Net earnings are re-turned to the borrowers on a patronage basis. In this way, the cost of credit to borrowers is equal to the current cost of funds plus operating expenses and nec- essary reserves of the banks. It is interesting to note that pursuant to the provisions of the Farm Credit Act of 1955 six of the district banks for co- operatives are now wholly owned by thefarmer cooperatives they serve. It is esti- mated that the $32 million Government investment remaining in the other banks will be retired by 1971. The maximum in- vestment of the Federal Government in these banks was nearly $180 million. As the cost of the banks' recent deben- ture sales have steadily increased, the cost to the system is rapidly reflected in the weighted average cost of debentures outstanding, which now stands at 5.60 percent. The banks for cooperatives must operate on an earnings basis which will allow them to charge interest rates con- sistent with the cost of borrowed funds and sound business practice. The removal of the present 6-percent interest rate limitation, as it affects both the Federal land banks and the banks for cooperatives, will permit these credit institutions to continue to function as was intended by Congress even in times, as we are now witnessing, when the cost of their loan funds as obtained from the money market approaches or exceeds 6 percent. To permit this flexibility in their operations will result in a continuation of their valued service to our farmers and ranchers. Mr. BELCHER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I am in wholehearted support of this legislation. As the gentle- man from California said, none of us like to vote for higher interest rates. But that is not what we are doing in this particular case. We are merely making it possible for the loan agencies to continue in oper- ation. The events that raised interest rates were the higher interest rates pre- vailing throughout the Nation and infla- tion. Therefore, there is nothing we can do except to raise these rates or put these people out of business. For that reason I am in support of the legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POAGE. Mr. Chairman, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gen- tleman from Texas [Mr. PATMAN]. FEDERAL LAND BANKS, FEDERAL INTERMEDIATE CREDIT BANKS, AND BANKS FOR COOPERATIVES ENTITLED TO RELIEF, BUT SHOULD NOT TAKE OFF 6-PERCENT RATE INDEFINITELY-2 YEARS ENOUGH FOR TRIAL PERIOD Mr. PATMAN. Mr. Chairman, I share the views of my good friend, Chairman34149 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 POAGE, in everything that he said about the Federal land banks, the Federal in- termediate credit banks, and the banks for cooperatives. I know they are fine in- stitutions. I am very much in favor of what is being done for the farmers through these fine organizations. There is only one thing about this bill that I just cannot tolerate from a per- sonal standpoint if I can help it. Of course, if the House votes it and the Sen- ate votes it and it becomes law, there is nothing I can do. But I can at least pro- test. NO HEARINGS BEFORE COMMITTEE I did not know this bill was before Con- gress until it was up here for considera- tion. If I had known it was before the committee, I would have gone before the committee and presented an amendment. The only amendment I would propose is all right. I know that interest rates have gone up. I know who is to blame. There is no use talking about it here. I know that you are in a bind. The Farm Credit Administration people are. We must rec- ognize the situation. We must give them some relief. But let us not take the 6- percent limit off from now until kingdom come and not have any limit at all. Let us have at least a 2-year limitation and try it out. Then if it is just as bad, we can consider an extension of time or we can take it off entirely if the situation should require it. But let us not open it entirely and have no limitation of any kind whatsoever. The gentleman from Texas [Mr. POAGE] made a good statement about the borrowers actually getting this money back; that is, in excess of 5 percent. He said that if they paid 15 percent, 10 per- cent of it would come back to them, and, from his standpoint, all of it would be the same. That is correct. But it affects the whole market. When we raise these interest rates, other interest rates are raised too, and others. So we should not be doing any- thing here that would affect the whole market and the whole economy without looking into the future and having some limitation somewhere. I did not get to appear before the com- mittee because I understand they did not even have hearings on the bill. I am not criticizing the committee for that. That is up to them. If they are satisfied to re- port it out without hearings, that is up to them. But I am saying that to let the Members know this is the first chance I have had to offer this 2-year limitation. I am going to offer an amendment re- stricting it to a 2-year period from the time it is enacted. I hope the chairman of the committee and the ranking mi- nority member will accept this amend- ment, because I have not had a chance before, and I would not feel too good about it if I did not have a chance to get it in for fair consideration. I just hope the gentlemen will accept it. INTEREST PAYMENTS NO. 1 CLAIM ON TREAS- uRY-VETERANS NO. 3 Remember this, my friends, we have on the revenues of the Nation from individ- ual tax sources certain liens upon the money that is accumulated in the Treasury of the United States. The No. 1 lien is interest on the national debt. Thatcomes first, right off the top. High in- terest is paid first, and after interest, of course, comes national security and the cost of war. That comes next. The third lien holders are the veterans of Vietnam and all other wars, and their dependents, and the aged and the people who might have different benefits for different pur- poses. They have a third lien. Remember, every time we put more cost on this first lien, we damage the chances of these veterans and aged and others ever getting anything. The other day I noticed in the other body a very liberal amendment was adopted on old age security. I thought certain people voted for that amend- ment I could hardly believe could sin- cerely vote for it in view of what they have stood for in the past. I began to wonder if some people are taking the attitude-and I am not criticizing any particular body or any particular per- son-that this cannot be paid anyway, so why should not they save their own political seats and vote for these amend- ments, knowing eventually, not long from now, these interest rates are going to take so much money we will not have money even to pay these bills. Of course, that would be a terrible attitude to take, but a lot of folks take an attitude now and then that cannot be explained. The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentleman from Texas has expired. Mr. POAGE. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman from Texas 1 additional minute. Mr. PATMAN. Mr. Chairman, right now we are paying $14.2 billion a year interest on the national debt. That is $7 billion too much. That can be docu- mented. When these new interest rates, just established within the last 30 days, are reflected in the funding of the in- terest on the balance of the debt, we are going to be paying $21 billion a year interest on the national debt. When we add to that national security and the cost of a war, how much will be left for veterans and dependents, and aged, and people like that? So I suggest and hope that we adopt this amendment and let it go to the Senate, and to conference, and at least consider it. I hope I am entitled to that much consideration, since it is the first time I have had a chance to present it. I did not have a chance to present it before the committee. I feel considera- tion should be given. Mr. POAGE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Califor- nia [Mr. HOLIFIELD]. Mr. HOLIFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of the committee for yielding to me. I am supporting this bill because I face the realities of the money market, just like the gentleman from Texas [Mr. POAGE] regardless of what caused the realities. I do hope that the Committee will see fit to put a time limitation of 2 years on the bill, such as suggested by the gentle- man from Texas [Mr. PATMAN] for 2 years. If at the end of 2 years it is neces- sary to do something about this, I can pledge that I will do just as I am doingtoday. I will vote on the merits of thesituation, and if necessary, vote tochange the situation. As I understand it, these debentureswhich are sold are backed by Govern-ment credit. Mr. POAGE. No, they are not. Mr. HOLIFIELD. They are onlybacked by collateral? Mr. POAGE. They are the joint obli-gation of all the banks, but the Govern-ment does not guarantee them. Mr. HOLIFIELD. There is no guaran-tee of the debentures from the FederalGovernment at all? Mr. POAGE. None whatsoever. Mr. HOLIFIELD. I am glad to knowthat. I do want to call attention-and this isreally the reason why I asked for thistime-to the fact that we have in Cali-fornia not only a great agricultural in- dustry but also a tremendous construc- tion business for the construction of homes, because of an incoming popula-tion of possibly 600,000 to 700,000 a year. We are faced with pressure on the money market also. Last year, in 1966, wehad almost a complete cessation of build- ing. The reason why we had that cessa- tion of building was the savings and loan institutions, who go into the money market to obtain savings deposits, were outbid by the banks with their cer- tificates of deposit and by Federal fund- ing. Savings and loan associations will be in competition with these debentures which we are considering in this legisla- tion, for they will probably pay higher interest on their debentures. At the present time we have an arbi- trary administrative limit on paying over 5 percent to get money into the savings and loan institutions in Cali- fornia. This is not in the statute, but required on the administrative level. I should like to see us keep it there, provided we can get money into the savings and loan institutions to build houses for the people of California. I bring this up because I believe it is a parallel situation. If we cannot get money and if an arbitrary limit is put upon us at 5 percent in the money mar- ket, as to the building of homes, and yet we have to compete with 61/4 percent or 61/2 percent or 63/4 percent debentures in the market, it is easy to see what will happen to the construction business. I bring this to the attention of the Members of the House to show the situa- tion of pressure which is occurring as a result of higher interest rate competition for funds. I am going along with this legislation but I hope the time will come when some consideration will be given to other facets of the money market which in my opin- ion are also important. I refer particu- larly to the construction business of homes in America and the plight of sav- ings and loan associations and other thrift institutions competing for dollars in the marketplace. If arbitrary ceilings on deposit interest are maintained by administrative fiat the savings and loan associations and other thrift Institutions will face with- drawals of deposits and therefore be un- able to furnish dollars for the construc- tion of homes.34150 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE Congress has recognized the need for housing loans just as they have recog- nized the need for farm loans. Both are important to the people of our country whether they are homeowners in the city or on the farm. Mr. BELCHER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. I certainly agree with the gentleman from California. There are lots of people who are going to be terribly hurt by high interest rates. I certainly know the condition which exists so far as the building and loan as- sociations and the building industry are concerned. In my own particular district, the building industry was almost at a standstill about a year ago. I was not aware that California had a 5-percent limit. I saw several advertise- ments in the paper which advertised for 5/2-percent money. Mr. HOLIFIELD. There was a time when a long-term deposit was given a little higher interest rate in order to com- pete with the certificates of deposit in the banks. My understanding is that that has been removed and that now the gen- eral level of deposits has a requirement that they can pay only 5 percent. I am not exactly saying this was wrong. I am saying that unless there is some flexibility in allowing us to compete in the money market with other debentures, such as these farm loan debentures and the other items of Treasury bills and so forth, the effect is as I have stated. If we are arbitrarily prevented from compet- ing in the marketplace, there will be a complete cessation of the construction business again this coming year, as there was in 1966. Mr. BELCHER. I would certainly say to the gentleman that if any industry in this country is being held down because of an interest ceiling and is not permit- ted to do business, I would go right along with the gentleman in raising that ceil- ing, just the same as on these things today. Mr. HOLIFIELD. That is right. If the gentleman will yield further, the Con- gress provided charters for building and loans just as they provided charters for these banks. Each one of them has a service to a particular segment of our society. What I am pleading for today is that consideration should be given to equity in the servicing of these different programs which the Government set up. Mr. BELCHER. Mr. Chairman, I will go along with the gentleman on any one of these that finds itself in the same sit- uation as these. I will say to the gentle- man from Texas [Mr. PATMAN] that by taking the ceiling off here we are not raising the interest rates but are merely permitting these institutions to stay in business by obtaining money at the mar- ket level. Of course, I know that the gen- tleman from Texas runs for a storm cel- lar every time the interest rate is raised, but at the same time 2 years or 4 years or any other limitation on this will not hold down the interest rates to any other institution. I say that for this reason: The directors of these banks will not pay any more interest than they have to pay in order to sell these debentures. If at the end of 2 years we put the ceiling back on them, we will either put them out ofbusiness or, if we remove it, they will still continue in business, but as far as I am concerned personally, I do not see that the 2-year limitation would be too serious a proposition. If it would salve the conscience of the gentleman from Texas to take this to conference, know- ing of his fear of the term \"interest,\" then I will be willing to go along with it. Mr. PATMAN. Mr. Chairman, may I ask the gentleman a question? Mr. BELCHER. I yield to the gentle- man. Mr. PATMAN. Did the gentleman say he would not oppose the 2-year limita- tion? Mr. BELCHER. I would say that as far as I am concerned personally, if your side of the aisle did go along with it, I will not object to taking a 2-year limita- tion to conference. I do not think it serves any purpose whatsoever, but if it would cause the gentleman from Texas [Mr. PATMAN] to sleep a little sounder at night, I would be willing to do that. Mr. GATHINGS. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to extend my re- marks at this point in the RECORD. The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Arkansas? There was no objection. Mr. GATHINGS. Mr. Chairman, the Farm Credit Act of 1933, as amended, sets up a 6 percent per annum limitation on the rate of interest on loans made by the Federal land bank and the Bank for Cooperatives and production credit as- sociations. This legislation seeks to strike the 6-percent limitation since the inter- est rates which must be paid to market the bonds and debentures are approach- ing the 6-percent level. Farmers are worried and rightfully so that this most significant source of credit may not be available to them unless the limitation is removed. The banks and associations are part of the cooperative farm credit system which includes 37 banks and 1147 associations. There are 460 production credit associations. There were 394,000 Federal land bank loans totaling $5.3 billion outstanding at the end of 1966. 687 local Federal land bank associations 'serviced these loans. The borrowers, who are farmers, be- come members of the association by the purchase of stock of 5 percent of the principal amount of the loan. The Gov- ernment made capital available to the banks when the system was established. This borrowed money has practically all been paid back. The Government does not guarantee or stand behind any of these loans. The funds are borrowed by the banks and made available to the farmers in the form of loans at a reason- able rate of interest. The object of this bill is to permit farmers the privilege to raise or lower interest rates for and on behalf of themselves when it becomes necessary to keep the banks on a solvent basis. They will not raise the interest rate on themselves unless it is absolutely necessary to do so. The legislation is urgent as money becomes tighter and harder to get which will of itself have the effect of increasing interest rates. Should the rate of interest on bonds or debentures be sold for more than 6 percent and the Federal land bank pro-duction credit associations, and the Bank for Cooperatives are unsuccessful in obtaining legislation to remove the 6- percent limitation, farmers would lose this most valuable source of credit which is so vital and necessary to their operations. The cotton farmer has suffered in 1966 and 1967, 2 years in a row, most calami- tous disasters. The 1966 yield was re- duced in certain parts of the belt due to an early freeze, late plantings, and a wet spring. The 1967 disaster was even worse in that the low yields covered an area from the Carolinas to north Texas, which was due again to inclement weather conditions throughout the growing sea- son and at harvest time. These farmers must have a source of credit to stay in the business of farming. I trust that the legislation will be speedily approved and enacted before the adjournment of the first session of the 90th Congress. The CHAIRMAN. There being no fur- ther requests for time, the Clerk will read. The Clerk read as follows: H.R. 13706 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Federal Farm Loan Act and the Farm Credit Act of 1933, as amended, are amended as hereinafter provided to remove the 6 per centum interest rate limitations therein on loans made by Federal land banks and banks for cooperatives; and to permit interest rates on such loans and on loans made by pro- duction credit associations to be determined as provided in such Acts of Congress to cover the cost of loan funds and other expenses and reserves so that the lending may con- tinue on a self-sustaining basis. SEC. 2. Section 12 of the Federal Farm Loan Act, as amended (12 U.S.C. 771), relating to loans made by Federal land banks, is amended by substituting \"such rate of in- terest as the board of directors of the bank shall from time to time determine with the approval of the Farm Credit Administration\" for \"6 per centum per annum\" in paragraph Third thereof and for \"6 per centum per annum\" in the first and second sentences of paragraph Ninth thereof. SEc. 3. The Farm Credit Act of 1933, as amended, is amended- (a) by inserting the following sentence be- tween the present first and second sentences of section 23 thereof, relating to loans made by production credit associations (12 U.S.C. 1131g): \"Such loans shall be made on such terms and conditions, at such rates of inter- est, and with such security as may be pre- scribed in such rules and regulations.\"; and (b) by deleting from each of the second sentences in sections 34 and 41 thereof (12 U.S.C. 11341 and 1134c), relating to loans made by banks for cooperatives, \", but in no case shall the rate of interest exceed 6 per centum per annum on the unpaid principal of a loan\". Mr. POAGE (during the reading). Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered as read, printed in the RECORD, and open to amendment at any point. The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. PATMAN Mr. PATMAN. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The Clerk read as follows:34151 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 Amendment offered by Mr. PATMAN: On page 2, after line 23, insert the following new section: \"SEC. 4. The provisions of the preceding sections of this Act shall be effective only during the two-year period which begins on the date of enactment of this Act. Upon the expiration of such period, each provision of law amended by this Act is further amended to read as it did immediately prior to the enactment of this Act.\" Mr. PATMAN. Mr. Chairman, I ap- preciate the comments of the gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr. BELCHER] and also the comments of the chairman of the committee, the gentleman from Texas [Mr. POAGE]. I realize that the farm agencies are in a bind here, but if some proposition is made by way of a limi- tation that will protect the public in- terest, I would feel better about it. You see, this could have an effect upon the market and the economy and in- crease interest rates still higher. If they can do the same thing and get the farm- ers their money, which all of us want to do, and at the same time provide some protection 2 years from now, that is one question. In other words, if it goes back and if you do not need it, we would not have to extend it another time. But if we need it, as the distinguished gentle- man from California [Mr. HOLIFIELD] pointed out, we would be willing to ex- tend it at that time, and I would be willing to do the same thing. Mr. Chairman, we are not trying to hurt the banks or the farmers. We are trying to be helpful and therefore, I say let the matter go to conference. The other body has an amendment to its bill of which the members of the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives do not approve. How- ever, you can work it out in conference and at least give yourselves an opportu- nity to do so. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I hope that the gentleman from Texas [Mr. POAGE] will be willing to accept the amendment which I have offered. Mr. POAGE. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. PATMAN. I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. POAGE. Mr. Chairman, in answer to the gentleman from Texas [Mr. PATMANI, it seems that this is my day to get in the position of accepting things that I do not think are very sound. How- ever, I feel that as chairman of the Com- mittee on Agriculture I should try to represent the views of the committee. I had not really understood that the members of the committee wanted to ac- cept this amendment. But in view of the position which has been taken by the ranking minority member, the gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr. BELCHER], I do not feel that I would want to interpose too much of an objection. However, I do want to point out to the Members of the House the fact that be- fore they accept this kind of thing, the story of a little boy one time who had a puppy and who wanted to have its tail cut off. So, the little boy took the puppy down to the veterinarian. The veteri- narian started to cut off the puppy's tail real short. The little boy said, \"No; do not cut too much off.\" The veterinariansaid, \"Well, do you want 3 or 4 inches cut off the tail of the dog?\" The little boy said, \"Yes, but do it just a half inch at a time; it will not hurt him as much.\" Mr. Chairman, it is my opinion that this is going to hurt every time you cut the tail off. It is my opinion that within the next year or two you will be right back here doing the same thing. Personally, Mr. Chairman, I do not see the reason for doing this sort of thing, other than to say that we are opposed to high interest rates. I am opposed to high interest rates. I do not want high interest rates. But, we are faced with high interest rates which we have to pay on money or stop these institutions from operating. Mr. Chairman, there has been no rea- son offered as to why these two segments of the farm credit institutions would be more vicious than the Intermediate Credit Banks which have operated for some 31 or 32 years. I believe the gentle- man from Texas [Mr. PATMAN] told me that he went out to Houston with the chairman of the committee at that time, Mr. Jones, to inaugurate the Intermedi- ate Credit Banks. They did not have any such limitation at that time such as this. Mr. Chairman, just 2 years ago we passed a participation bill to sell Gov- ernment securities, and it did not have any such provision contained in it. Mr. Chairman, I saw an advertisement around here this afternoon indicating that you could buy shares of Govern- ment obligations and get 6.35 percent upon them. These are not Government obligations. These are obligations of individual banks and have no Government guarantee. It seems to me that we are going a long way if this approach is followed. However, I am not going to stand in the way of any kind of progress. I recognize that we do operate for 2 years. But if the gentleman wants to tie us down to the period of 2 years, insofar as I am concerned I am not going to interpose any objection to it. Mr. BELCHER. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. PATMAN. I yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma. Mr. BELCHER. I will say to my chair- man, the gentleman from Texas [Mr. POAGE] that undoubtedly the only con- ceivable reason I can think of why the gentleman from Texas [Mr. PATMAN] wants to make it for the period of 2 years is because the gentleman thinks there might be a change of administra- tion and the Republicans within that pe- riod of 2 years might get it back to 6 percent. Mr. PATMAN. If they come in, I hope they do. That is one reason I have been trying to keep the gentleman from Okla- homa [Mr. BELCHER] on my side al- though I am not afraid the Republicans will come in next year. Mr. TEAGUE of California. Mr. Chair- man, will the gentleman yield? Mr. PATMAN. I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. TEAGUE of California. Is this nol a correct statement? It does not seenr to me that these farm credit institution. and banks are in a position to gouge the farmers if they want to charge 7 percentFor instance, in that case the farmerscan go to the First National Bank inTexarkana and get the money for 6 per- cent or 6.5 percent? In other words, isnot the farmer going to do that? The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen.tleman from Texas has expired. (By unanimous consent, Mr. PATMANwas allowed to proceed for 1 additionalminute.) Mr. TEAGUE of California. Mr. Chair-man, will the gentleman yield further? Mr. PATMAN. I yield further to thegentleman from California. Mr. TEAGUE of California. Does notthe law of competition prevail here sothat the farmer who wants to borrowmoney is not going to be gouged by theseinstitutions, but he can go and get themoney from commercial banks at inter-est rates lower? Mr. PATMAN. It will not bother themfor a period of 2 years. They can do any-thing they want to for 2 years. Mr. TEAGUE of California. They can do this for 200 years. Mr. PATMAN. But it comes back, letus not repeat it from now on until king- dom come, let us say there will never be a limitation. This places a limitation for 2 years. Let us try it out for 2 years, seehow it works, and if it works all right we will not change it, but leave it. But 2years from now, if it is working out satis-factorily, I will vote for it along with thegentleman from California [Mr. Hou- FIELD] and the rest of the Members who have spoken here, but let us consider itthen on its merits at that time. Mr. TEAGUE of California. If the gen-tleman will yield further? Mr. PATMAN. I yield to the gentleman. Mr. TEAGUE of California. Merely for the purpose of stating that I agree with the gentleman from Texas [Mr. POAGE] that there is no purpose in a 2-year limi- tation, I believe we ought to make this a permanent lifting of the ceiling. Mr. PATMAN. They are both the same. The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas [Mr. PATMAN]. The question was taken; and on a di- vision (demanded by Mr. ABERNETHY) there were-ayes 3, noes 24. So the amendment was rejected. The CHAIRMAN. Under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly the Committee rose; and the Speaker having resumed the chair, Mr. HAMILTON, Chairman of the Commit- tee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 13706) to amend the Federal Farm Loan Act and the Farm Credit Act of 1933, as amended, and for other purposes, pursuant to House Resolution 987, he reported the bill back to the House. The SPEAKER. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill .-as ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the Sthird time. MOTION TO RECOMMIT e Mr. PATMAN. Mr. Speaker, I offer Sa motion to recommit.34152 November 29, 1967 The SPEAKER. Is the gentleman op-s posed to the bill? Mr. PATMAN. I am, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. PATMAN moves to recommit the bill (H.R. 13706) to the Committee on Agricul- ture with instructions to report the same back immediately with instructions to ac cept the insertion of section 4, as follows:, \"SEC. 4.

Upon the expiration of such period, each provision of law amended by this Act is further amended to read as it did immediately prior to the enactment of this Act.\" The SPEAKER. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the mo- lion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker announced that the noes ap- peared to have it. Mr. PATMAN. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present, and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER. Evidently a quorum is not present.

Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Hampshire? There was no objection. Mr. WYMAN. Mr. Speaker, the Amer- CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 ican people want action now to meet the tremendous challenges to the preserva- tion of the Union that confront us. Ac- tion is needed from all three branches of our Government, the executive, the Con- gress and the judiciary. What is needed? Courage, leadership, and responsibility. To do what? To restore fiscal stability, to get the war over in Vietnam on an honorable basis, to stop our alarming in- crease in crime, to end ruinous permis- siveness, and to achieve both self-respect and respect from abroad for Americans and the United States once again. How? The guidelines are simple. They are basic. We must- First. Establish the precept that Fed- eral spending shall not exceed Federal revenues in the absence of war. Second. Create and operate within a legislative budget in the Congress. Third. Drastically reduce or eliminate outright, all nonessential Federal spend- ing as long as we are committed to such tremendous sums on the war in Vietnam. Fourth. Authorize the military to proceed to take such military action as may be necessary to win a military vic- tory in Vietnam without the use of atomic weapons. They say they can do this. They should have full opportunity to protect the lives of our fighting men over there in this way. Fifth. Direct the prosecution of those who deliberately break the law in the United States no matter who they are, their occupation or their motivation. By way of illustration, if John Doe burns his draft card he should know that this will mean swift and certain prosecution for himself and for those who may be accessories either before or after the fact. Those who want a police record or a criminal record to carry with them throughout later life should have their wish granted and the full significance of such a record on their future employ- ment, character references and personal relationships ought to once again be the deterrent it used to be. The Attorney General should enforce our criminal laws across the board, which he is not doing at the present time. In connection with the problem of achieving action now, I urge the reading of the following excellent editorial by the distinguished columnist David Law- rence in U.S. News & World Report, issue of December 4, 1967: IT's TIME FOR COURAGEOVS LEADERSHIP (By David Lawrence) It's time to stop passing the buck between the federal and the State governments. It's time to use the police power of the na- tion to enforce the laws of the land. It's time to put an end to the riots, \"demonstrations\" and violence which are plunging us into anarchy. It's time to abandon the excuses and polit- ical alibis which argue that the outbursts of looting, arson and vandalism In the cities are due to lack of education or conditions of poverty. We have had poverty for many decades. We have long had inadequate educational facili- ties for a growing population. But, ostensi- bly to achieve reforms, irresponsible groups have adopted a guerrilla type of tac ic-a rebellion which never would have gone un- checked if it were not for the indifference of our law-enforcement authorities.It's not merely that the streets of the cities are unsafe because of the boldness of the criminal elements, but that disorders are deliberately planned in the name of political expression and freedom of speech. Certainly it is true that the maintenance of law and order is primarily the responsi- bility of the States. But while racial prob- lems have always existed in some areas, they now are being intensified and exploited on a national basis. Presidents in the past have not been timid about using federal powers to prevent the breakdown of either communications or transportation. They have not hesitated to assist local governments in preserving order. But today we find the President con- fronted with a collapse of authority in many parts of the country. Congress within the last few years has passed a law, under the \"interstate com- merce\" clause of the Constitution, invoking federal authority against a restaurant owner who asserts his right to choose whichever customers he pleases. He now can be pun- ished for interfering with \"interstate com- merce.\" The Federal Government, on the other hand, is not using this power to regulate \"interstate commerce\" as a means of pro- tecting the people against violence. Disturbances are rampant. Property dam- age amounting to millions of dollars has been inflicted and many lives have been lost in riots which were plotted outside as well as inside the State where the \"demonstra- tions\" occurred. National organizations were behind several of these tragic episodes. \"Tar- get cities\" were announced in the press long before the disturbances broke out. More than 100 cities have been the victims of insurrec- tion. Defiance of authority is common on college campuses. It is, of course, insisted that all this comes under the head of \"freedom of speech.\" But there's a difference between speech-making in arenas or auditoriums or other meeting places and the use of the city streets to cham- pion a cause while actually stirring up trouble. It's easy enough to quibble about the limits of the federal authority and to say that responsibility for maintenance of order is just a local affair. The Supreme Court has ruled that, while the Constitution grants freedom of speech, this does not take away the power of government to punish trespass on private property and acts of violence. Why, therefore, doesn't the Department of Justice enforce these principles? It has gath- ered plenty of evidence of instigated dis- orders, and some of this Is now being re- vealed in testimony before congressional committees. Why aren't the organizations which fomented the various \"demonstra- tions\" exposed to public view and brought to court to answer for the lawlessness they have created by their conspiracies? Is mobocracy in America to take the place of democracy? Shall we condone injuries to Innocent people just because reforms to help the poor or the uneducated haven't yet been fully achieved? The Constitution, as stated in its Pre- amble, was established to \"insure domestic tranquillity.\" Also, the Fifth Amendment declares that no person \"shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due proc- ess of law.\" What furtiher definition of fed- eral authority to deal with crime is needed? When will the President and the Congress carry out the mandate of the Constitution which the members of both the executive and legislative branches of our Government have taken an oath to preserve, defend and support? The American people want the anarchy ended. The Federal Government and the States must act together. It's no longer merely a local problem when even the Presi- dent and his Secretary of State have had toavoid addressing some meetings in personbecause of a fear that \"demonstrations\" might interfere with their freedom to speakwithout interruption. Is this free America?It's time for courageous leadership. HOW LORETTO ADULT EDUCATION. AL ADVANCEMENT PROGRAM ISPAYING OFF Mr. O'HARA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, Iask unanimous consent to address theHouse for 1 minute and to revise and ex- tend my remarks. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mr. O'HARA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, it is with a sense of pride that I call the attention of my colleagues to an inspir- ing broadcast over station WBBM in Chi- cago by William C. O'Donnell, vice presi- dent of CBS Radio Division and general manager of WBBM since Loretto Acad- emy before the last reapportionment was in the district I was privileged to repre- sent and still services many of my con- stituents. To Mr. O'Donnell I extend the thanks of the people of the South Side of Chicago and of the many friends and beneficiaries of the urban opportunity programs. By this broadcast Mr. O'Don- nell has made a contribution of note to the crusade against poverty and ignor- ance in which our Nation is engaged and has left a message of encouragement that cannot fail to have lasting and favorable repercussions. His broadcast follows: Do Urban Opportunity Programs really pay off? Now there's a question that can start heated arguments in almost every com- munity. But in Chicago, we have dramatic evidence that Urban Opportunity Programs really do pay-off. Perhaps a primary example of this is the Loretto Adult Educational Advance- ment Program. It's being conducted by Loretto Academy at 1447 E. 65th St. In a recent class of 188 persons, 15 of them satisfactorily completed high school equiva- lency examinations ...3 others went into manpower training programs ... another 6 were able to get jobs because they had in- creased their skills ...5 persons entered regular college classes ..and most of the 159 others in the class were able to obtain better jobs than the ones they held origi- nally. In another recent program which involved 400 persons, just 27 of the members of that class are now earning salaries that amount to $162,000 a year. And the total cost of the 22 month long program for all 400 persons in the first place came to only $85,000. Now that's what we .all a really good return on an Investment-especially on a human invest- ment. The Urban Opportunity Programs in Chi- cago are not simply job-training schools. These programs engage in basic education... counseling is offered ...there is individual tutoring ...and assistance in finding gain- ful work. There are no restrictions in the Urban Opportunity Programs in Chicago. We suggest that the next time you hear someone knocking the Urban Opportunity Programs as worthless and wasteful, you re- call some of what we've just been talking about. Instead of merely speaking about helping people in need, you can mention that Urban Opportunity Programs are really doing something to help. And Chicago offers all the proof you need to back up that statement.34154 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE STRONG LOBBYING BILL INTRO- DUCED BY BENNETT Mr. BENNETT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to address the House for 1 minute, to revise and extend my remarks, and to include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. BENNETT. Mr. Speaker, for the last several Congresses, I have intro- duced legislation to strengthen the lob- bying laws, adding teeth and better po- licing measures to the legislation now on the books. It has always been my thought that lobbying is a right derived from freedom of speech and the right to petition. My interest in this legislation is not for the prevention of pressures, as some are proper, but the disclosures of who do lobby, and whether such pressures in- clude resort to bribery, corruption or other improprieties. In most cases lobbying is an honest and respectable pursuit and a proper function of democratic government. Lob- byists not only provide pressures, but provide information and facts which help legislators arrive at decisions in the best interest of our country. Earlier in this session, I introduced a bill, H.R. 12332, to provide more effec- tive control of lobbying activities. The thrust of this legislation transferred the administration of the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act from the Clerk of the House to the Comptroller General of the United States. This bill had Administra- tion approval. The bill I am introducing today broadens the coverage of the Lobbying Act. It has the vigorous support of the President, who said after the Senate pas- sage of the legislation containing the bill introduced today: I strongly endorse the Senate's action in strengthening Federal regulation of lobby- ing as an important step toward better gov- ernment, and I urge the House to take simi- lar action. The Department of Justice has rec- ommended enactment of my bill, H.R. 12332, with the amendments included in the bill I am today introducing. Mr. Speaker, this bill is important and necessary to the continuation of good government, and I am hopeful the House of Representatives will act quickly to enact it into law. A copy of the bill follows: H.R. 14211 A bill to provide more effective control of lobbying activities Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of Amer- ica in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. Section 302(d) of the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act (2 U.S.C. 261(d)) is amended to read: \"(d) The term 'Comptroller General' means the Comptroller General of the United States.\" MULTIPURPOSE CONTRIBUTIONS AND EXPENDITURES SEC. 2.

CONGRESSMAN HORTON PRAISES EASTMAN KODAK FOR COMMU- NITY LEADERSHIP IN PROPOSING PLAN TO PROMOTE INDEPENDENT BUSINESS IN ROCHESTER, N.Y., INNER CITY Mr. HORTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to address the House for 1 minute, to revise and extend my re- marks, and to include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. HORTON. Mr. Speaker, we have been encouraged recently by the increas- ing indications that American industry is anxious to participate in the great task of rehabilitating our cities. The hopes of many cities have been raised with the knowledge that industry plans to assist in financing housing and commercial projects. But we realize, Mr. Speaker, that the basis for continuing prosperity in any area is business, and the jobs created by thriving businesses. During my service on the Small Busi- ness Committee of the House, I have seen many instances where the growth of small businesses has revolutionized the economic health of communities. The Eastman Kodak Co. of Rochester, N.Y., has a long record of creative, re- sponsible participation in community affairs. Recently Kodak announced a for- ward-looking traning and employment program which will provide skills for untrained residents of Rochester's inner city, and which will include participa- tion by the Rochester inner-city groupFIGHT. In its constant concern with the prob- lems of urban blight of the 1960's in central Rochester, Eastman Kodak made a typically thorough examination of the need for creating jobs and promoting en- treprenurial experience in the inner city through small businesses, and followed that examination with a typically gen- erous and pertinent proposal to help un- derwrite the establishment of small businesses in the center of Rochester. The plan urges formation of a Com- munity Development Corporation to pro- vide financing for small businesses that would be set up in the inner-city area. It also describes, as practical examples, four potential businesses: wood product manufacture, production of vacuum- formed plastic items, camera repair service, and microfilming of public docu- ments.Kodak's involvement in the plan would take several forms. The company would- First, take the initiative in organizing and assist in the financing of the Com- munity Development Corp., which would be a source of funds and management advice for various new inner-city busi- nesses; Second, consider itself a potential cus- tomer for those products and services of the new businesses that could be used by Kodak; and Third, offer to provide training, as well as advice and consultations in such areas as production and marketing to the four enterprises suggested in the plan. William S. Vaughn, chairman of Kodak's board of directors, said: The plan is designed to augment programs existing at Kodak and in the community which are providing jobs for inner-city un- employed people. However, the plan goes a step beyond the conventional approach of a directly-dependent, subsidiary-type opera- tion. Instead, it will promote independent businesses intended to develop individual initiative and a stronger economy in the inner city.If a start can be made on these new busi- nesses, a new dimension would be added to the opportunities Rochester offers its inner- city residents. The benefits, of course, include the crea- tion of jobs, the motivation of hard-core un- employed people to seek jobs, training for in- dividual progress toward more-skilled jobs, and the pride and satisfaction that can come from participation in a business. Vaughn also pointed out that this plan augments several existing Kodak pro- grams which benefit inner-city residents. Three examples are: First, in 1962 the company was one of the first firms to volunteer for President Kennedy's plan for progress, a program for equal em- ployment opportunity for members of all races; second, several special training programs are run by Kodak whereby new employees who are undereducated may receive training in basic communication skills as well as in the jobs they have taken; third, Kodak aided in forming Rochester Jobs, Inc., which has been highly successful in finding jobs for many inner-city residents in local busi- ness and industry. The new plan to promote inner-city businesses was conceived by Kodak and was developed with the aid of suggestions obtained from meetings held over the past several months with representa- tives of Rochester inner-city groups, es- pecially the FIGHT organization. The company also has consulted authorities on urban problems at the local, State, and National level. The Kodak plan will be a very valuable supplement to the model cities program in Rochester. The 62 cities which were chosen with Rochester for initial model cities grants may well use Kodak's ex- ample to stimulate similar programs on the part of their industry. Much more is involved than financial support. Interwoven with Kodak's plan to promote independent business in the Rochester inner city is the kind of imagi- nation and foresight this Nation will need in order to include all citizens in our abundance and prosperity.This plan analyzes the need for small business, how to finance it, and how toselect and train employees. The Kodakplan concludes with four detailed ex- amples illustrating the proposal. Mr. Speaker, I would like to share theKodak plan with you and our colleagues as an example of community leadership by a major industrial concern: A PLAN To PROMOTE INDEPENDENT BUSINESSE IN THE ROCHESTER INNER CITY BACKGROUND Over the past several years many new pro- grams have been developed in the Rochester community to assist people living in poverty, especially to provide jobs for the \"hard-core\" unemployed in business and industry. There is no reason for complacency, despite the factthat there is considerable evidence thatRochester is headed in the right direction and making progress. All business, govern- mental, and social institutions in the com- munity must continue to concentrate on thisfundamental task. One problem that still has not been dealt with on a sufficiently imaginative scale, how- ever, is the development of a sense of eco-nomic independence on the part of manyinner-city residents. To help correct this situation, it appears practical and desirable for established busi- nesses to assist in the development of inde-pendent inner-city-enterprises. Such stimula- tive action would not only add new jobs, but also provide a wide range of business experi- ence for those who would be associated with successful and profitable enterprises. The Greater Rochester community offers a variety of opportunities for new enterprises. Kodak has been conducting a series of studies to determine how it could assist in the establishment of certain types of busi- ness in the Rochester inner city. Advice has been sought from many federal, state, andlocal authorities as well as from others who have special knowledge in this field. During the past several months meetings also have been held with the FIGHT organization on this subject. Many suggestions have been brought forth, and some of the more promis- ing ones have been pursued to determine such things as capital investment and man- power requirements, size of potential market, degree of competition, etc. Analyses of sev- eral of these suggestions are developed inthis Plan. Perhaps the most novel aspect of the Plan is that it does not limit itself simply to the creation of a directly dependent subsidiary- type operation. Rather, what is suggested isthe opportunity for personal initiative and growth within several independent compa- nies, each of which has its own prospects for expansion. This concept reflects the feeling that independence, dignity and opportunity, more than jobs, are needed at this time. The Plan also accords with practical realities re- lated to the poverty area of Rochester's inner city, the current and prospective employ-ment situation in this area, and the nature of Kodak's own operations. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS Whatever business is embarked upon, it should be able to stand on its own merits within a reasonable period, perhaps a year or two. In addition to jobs as such, the business should provide an opportunity for people to learn the skills required to run a business. The business should not be intended to function just as a training center. Neverthe- less, it seems reasonable to expect that when people develop proficiency in various skills they can take advantage of the marketa- bility of these skills and move to other jobs if they wish. In so doing, opportunities for others are provided.34156 November 29, 1967 CON It is assumed that such a business would ti begin like thousands of others-relatively small and reasonably competitive, and with Slabor force consistent with sales volume. In this context, it is well to consider that on a national average among manufacturers about $27,000 in annual sales of a product must be generated to support each worker and provide for the various other expenses of doing business. Using this yardstick, sales of roughly $2,700,000 per year would be re- quired to support a work force of 100 people. In fact, over 80 percent of all manufacturers in the United States employ less than 50 people. What characteristics are favorable to the success of an inner-city business? Some guidelines on these matters are: 1. The first product need not require a high level of technical skill to manufacture, but the type of skill required initially should lead to the acquisition of higher levels of skill. 2. The product should be marketable to a range of customers. An exclusive depend- ence on just one customer is undesirable. Such dependence limits the growth possi- bilities of business while increasing its risks. 3. The initial capital investment should be relatively small. A product or service with a high labor content in its manufacture tends to generate more jobs. Thus, a product that requires a $250,000 boring mill to pro- duce it is not likely to be desirable, since such a complex, highly automated piece of machinery would result in heavy investment of capital for a single job. The wood products manufacturing business described in Ex- ample A (attached) would provide employ- ment for 12-15 people at a capital invest- ment of only 20% of the cost of that one boring machine. 4. The extent to which employees of exist- ing businesses-particularly local ones- would be hurt by new competition must be considered. To create a new enterprise which would only replace existing jobs in success- ful and established business would not be desirable. This would negate one of the major goals: that is, the creation of new job opportunities and new wealth. 5. A single enterprise might ultimately have several product lines. This would spread the business risk and enhance the oppor- tunities. Thus, it is conceivable that there might be one section devoted to subassembly work on electronic components, another to repair and service, and another to the fabri- cation of a finished product. SOME POTENTIAL BUSINESSES Taking into consideration the factors just outlined, Kodak people conducted a broad' study of the various products and services utilized in the company's own Rochester fa- cilities or related to its business to determine if any might appropriately be supplied by a new inner-city enterprise. Four such items are discussed in detail later in this Plan (Examples A, B, C, and D). These, of course, are only examples. Both Kodak and other Rochester firms might well find additional Items which would be suitable as time passes. FINANCING The critical question of how an inner-city enterprise could best be organized and fi- nanced has been examined as well. In this regard, it was recognized that the capital which might be available from inner-city people might be quite limited. The approach that seemed most appropri- ate involved the establishment of a Com- munity Development Corporation which, in turn, would assist in the financing of various independent, inner-city businesses. Details are described in the Financial Requirements section of the Plan. WHAT OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE SHOULD THERE BE? It is to be expected that during the forma- tion period and in the initial stage of opera-[GRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE on, a considerable amount of professional, technical, and business counsel and advice will be required. The ultimate goal is to at- tain an independent status for the new en- terprise; and, the involvement of outside as- sistance should be designed, therefore, to be reduced and ultimately to be eliminated. WHAT KODAK WILL DO (1) Eastman Kodak Company will take the initiative in organizing a Community Devel- opment Corporation and will assist in its financing. Others in the community and else- where will be encouraged to participate in the financing. The purpose of the Commu- nity Development Corporation will be to pro- mote and help finance various inner-city enterprises. (2) With respect to the products and serv- ices described in examples A, B, and C at- tached, Kodak considers itself a potential customer and would be prepared to place orders for a portion of its requirements within its normal purchasing practices. (3) Kodak also is willing to provide fi- nancial, production, employment, marketing and training advice and consultation within reasonable limits. HOW OTHERS MIGHT BE INVOLVED Some considerations on the subject of in- volvement of parties other than Eastman Kodak Company are suggested below. Others are spelled out in the later sections of this report. (1) Certainly, there is a wealth of business advice available which should be utilized whenever it can be helpful. The U.S. De- partment of Labor, the U.S. Department of Commerce, other federal government agen- cies, the N.Y. State Department of Com- merce, the Intere te nracial Council for Business Opportunity, the National Business League, the Negro Industrial and Economic Union, the local educational institutions can offer much useful advice based on both research and experience. Local banks also maintain staffs which offer business counseling. The opportunity to obtain assistance, in areas of their expertise, from Rochester area busi- ness and Industry should not be overlooked. (2) It may be desirable initially to re- tain an organization which can offer a com- plete on-the-job training service for all per- sonnel-from president to assembly worker. Several universities have developed a capa- bility In this line, as have a number of man- agement consulting and training firms. The cost of such a contract might be partially or fully funded under the federal Manpower Development and Training Act. (3) Consideration should be given by the management of each inner-city enterprise to the possibility of involving some young management people from major Rochester firms in the business. The participation of such people could result in their knowledge and experience becoming helpful to their respective firms as time goes on. (4) Formation of a Business Advisory Committee might be undertaken by the Community Development Corporation. This committee would be available to consult with the various enterprises and would con- tribute to the practical involvement of nu- merous local companies both as customers and as supporters of such innter-city enter- prises. FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS The initial financing of any business usu- ally Involves three elements-(1) the money invested by the owners of the enterprise (equity capital); (2) loans, at various inter- est rates and terms depending on the degree of risk involved to the lender; and (3) credit extended by suppliers of materials and serv- ices.34157 tion. These owners are, of course, the persons who stand to gain or lose the most from success or failure of the enterprise. Undoubt- edly some portion of the capital to be raised for any of the enterprises we are considering should come from those most directly con- cerned with its success or failure. The per- sonal incentive resulting from such com- mitment can contribute strongly to business success. Also, participation in financing by those most directly involved is required to convince potential creditors of the serious- ness of management's commitment to the success of the business. The extent of the investment of capital by management and by investors not part of management are matters to be resolved as the requirements for the raising of money-and the possibil- ities for raising it-are studied further. 2. Debt capital Loans to a new business enterprise are often provided by investors or banks which are sufficiently interested to support the enterprise. They may wish to be more as- sured of a return on their investment over a specific period of time and are, therefore, content to limit the amount of this return to an agreed interest rate and repayment of principal. In the type of enterprise we are consider- ing, however, support programs have been created by both the Federal and State gov- ernments specifically to advance money on terms which are more favorable than those provided by commercial bank loans and which are available in situations where the risks involved would not normally be accept- able to banks. The federal program is ad- ministered by the Small Business Adminis- tration, and in New York State it comes within the jurisdiction of the New York Job Development Authority. Such programs in- volve loans by the SBA to stimulate and support economic activity and to create jobs in a particular community. This portion of the financing may be accomplished by a loan to a Community Development Corporation, which is nonprofit and which in turn lends the money it has received from SBA to the business to be financed. The creation of the Community Development Corporation is es- sential if certain types of debt financing are to be available, and it will also provide a ve- hicle for broad community participation in prospective projects. Under the Small Business Administration program, loans can be used only for the pur- chase of land, plant or equipment, or for modernization of plant and equipment. The money cannot be used for working capital. The maximum loan to the local development corporation is $350,000 for each business the company wishes to finance. The interest rate 51/2% for periods as long as 25 years. Loans for such purposes available from the New York Job Development Authority are some- what different in their requirements and may-but do not seem to at this point- offer more attractive possibilities than SBA loans. 3. Credit from suppliers The third component of initial financing is the establishment of normal credit ar- rangements with suppliers of materials and services. The foundations upon which such lines of credit are established and upon which one is permitted to receive materials and supplies without immediate cash out- lay are usually (1) a satisfactory financial position, and (2) the confidence of the cred- itors that in the normal course of business they will be paid promptly and in accordance with their expectation. The role of a Community Development Corporation 1. Equity capital An example of how the Capital structure of Equity financing is usually represented by an operating business is developed through the stock issued to the owners of the corpora- a Community Development Corporation can CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 be seen by considering the requirements for the manufacture of vacuum-formed plastic items, which is analysed in Example B. In this situation it is estimated that $100- 000 must be available to finance the opera- tion. The financing requirements for equip- ment are estimated to be $50,000. In line with SBA requirements, it is suggested that 40 to 45% of the total requirement be pro- vided through a loan from the SBA through the development company as a supporting organization. The balance of the financing, $55,000, must then come from other sources. In order not to burden the enterprise with heavy interest charges, it is desirable that this $60,000 be obtained in the form of equity capital. A fundamental consideration is that a portion of this equity capitalization should be raised by those persons directly involved in the operation of the enterprise, that is, those persons who are ultimately to succeed to the total ownership of the business. It is assumed in this example that 10% of the total requirement would come from this source. It is suggested that the development company raise $45,000 to $50,000, which rep- resents the balance of the equity financing. A further item in the financing might be to provide that the portion of equity supplied by the development company would be con- sidered a temporary participation. In this way, the stock owned by the development company could be made available for pur- chase by the ultimate owners, managers and employees of the enterprise after a profitable operation has been achieved. The amount required for any one of the other programs would vary depending upon the particular program and the extent of the operation. Organization of inner city business One or more New York business corpora- tions is contemplated. The initial share- holders are assumed to be the persons di- rectly involved in the management of the business as well as the Community Develop- ment Corporation, which would assist in the financing of the enterprise. Perhaps a wider public subscription is possible. A board of directors to be elected by the shareholders should be composed of persons able to par- ticipate in the decisions to be made and to bring to the management of the corporation the talent and background requirement. EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING In starting every business, it is critical that key positions be filled by the most com- petent people available. The specific talents required will vary with the nature of the business. An illustration of these require- ments is spelled out in Example B in refer- ence to a vacuum-formed plastics business. The recruitment of key people in the cur- rent Rochester labor market may be difficult and may require considerable time. Arrange- ments would then have to be made to pro- vide training in the operation of the business. In the case of the attached examples, Kodak would be willing to provide such training within reasonable limits. An important purpose for the contem- plated inner-city business should be to pro- vide jobs for inner-city residents who lack the education and experience needed to qual- ify for other job opportunities. The business, therefore, should seek out these people for employment. To accomplish this, it would be necessary to provide training in the basic communica- tive skills. It would also be necessary to provide an industrial orientation with respect to such matters as job responsibility, rela- tionships between persons on the job, and regular attendance. Of course, training in normal vocational skills would also be essen- tial. Federal funds are presently available under the Manpower Development and Train- ing Act to support this kind of training ac- tivity.The proposed enterprises should include some higher skilled jobs so that there would be opportunities for advancement within the organization. However, these businesses could also perform an important social pur- pose by preparing people for higher skilled jobs with other employers. More job oppor- tunities in the inner-city enterprises would thereby be created. Thus, the number of jobs available in the course of a year could be substantially more than the number avail- able at any particular time. Another purpose of the proposed inner-city enterprises should be to develop the kind of managerial skills which could enable people either to develop their own business or to qualify for jobs elsewhere. The principle of upgrading described above would therefore apply to management people as well. In this way, the skills developed in the proposed companies would gradually spread through the inner city. It is understood that Depart- ment of Labor funds are also available to support such management training and de- velopment. EXAMPLE A-WOOD PRODUCTS BUSINESS General This projected company would specialize Initially in the manufacture of wooden pal- lets and attempt later to expand its operation to include other widely marketable wood products. The present study assumes that the company would initially be able to manufacture and sell 50,000 wooden pallets and offer repair service for 27,000 pallets annually. Summary of report Based on a volume of 50,000 pallets and current prices for both open and solid deck pallets, sales would amount to almost $230,000 annually. In addition, an antici- pated volume of 27,000 pallets would be repaired annually by the replacement of 2.6 boards per pallet on the average. Sales for this repair work are estimated at $47,500 annually. In combination, the two operations would be expected to return an operating profit of $7,000 per year. Employment would be provided for about 12-15 people. There are two large elements of cost- lumber and labor. Lumber costs for 50,000 new pallets are estimated at $165,000 or 72% of the sales dollar. For purposes of this analysis, direct labor was priced at $2.00 per hour plus statutory benefits of 7%. (Wage rates used are not necessarily the rates for the job. They are assumed for this estimate. Also, these estimates have not in- cluded consideration of what might be re- quired for payment of interest upon debt.) Market potential While this study is based on an assumed sales volume of 50,000 pallets per year, it is estimated that the total market for pallets annually in the Greater Rochester area sub- stantially exceeds this figure. It is also as- sumed that this business would expand into the manufacture of other wooden products, such as packing cases, etc. The more significant details of the study are set forth below. Sales estimates are based on a volume of 50,000 pallets a year. Of this amount about V3 are solid deck and % are open deck. Cost of sales Lumber At present, 2 x 4's cut to 8', 12' and 16' lengths are available at $87.00 per thousand board feet. These would be used for the stringers and waste of 5% has been assumed. Stock for the decks and soles of the pallets is also available at $87.00 per thousand board feet. This would be of random widths, 4\" to 8\" wide, and random lengths with shipments heavy in the 10' and 14' lengths. Waste expectancy is about 20%.Several lumber brokers have been con. tacted, and the foregoing appears to be aboutthe best offering. The lumber content of a pallet is Open specifications call for \"-a 2%o\" No. 6 wire gage, diamond point helical thread drive screws.\" These cost $29.81/Cwt., and count out to about 125 per pound. Approxi. mately 108 nails are used in open deck pal- lets and 117 are in solid deck pallets. Labor Direct labor for new pallets: The nature of the estimated labor requirements are: 1. Unload lumber and stack. 2. ut 2 x 4's. 3. Cut deck and sole boards. 4. Plane deck boards. 5. Bevel one edge-2 sole boards. 6. Bevel two edges-2 sole boards. 7. Assemble pallet. 8. Stencil name, date and manufacturer. 9. Paint stringer ends on solid deck pal- lets. 10. Stack 17 high for storage and trucking. 11. Load into trailers-24 stacks per trail- er. Indirect labor: One supervisor will be need. ed who would perform the necessary super- visory functions, purchasing, contact cus- tomers, and perform payroll, bookkeeping and control functions. His salary is estimated at $8,000 per year. Statutory benefits are estimated at 7% of the total payroll. Rent: Minimum space requirements are estimated at 3,000 square feet. The cost Is estimated at $1.00 per square foot per year. This is thought to be minimal. Utilities: Electric and telephone costs are estimated at $2,000 per year. Supplies: This expenditure is primarily for the sharpening and replacement of cut- ting tools ($3,500). Other supplies are placed at $500. Equipment: It is assumed that used equip- ment would be purchased, and the estimated installed cost for this equipment is shown below.

Summary of report The following table represents a projec- tion of the results which might be antici- pated if successful operation were achieved34158 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE achieve normal operations. The low level of taxes during the second and third years is due to the loss carry-over from the first year of operation. Personnel, including the manager, will total about nine people by the end of the second year. These will include a clerk, a pattern-maker, a setup man, and about five production workers. Substantial knowledge and skills are required and it is believed that these can best be learned by an appren- ticeship arrangement in another plastic shop.Upon receipt of an order (together with molds and such fixtures as are available), the manager should put together an estimate of the job. This would list out the molds and fixtures required and a sketch of what each will be, as well as an estimate of what it would cost to make those not available. He 'would determine each operation to be per- formed, the setup, and run time. Material requirements and waste would also be de- termined.

Hiring of the manager ........ 1 2 Manager starts...............Description and comment Assume the decision has been made to enter the vacuum-formed plastics business. A sales volume of about 5200,000 will be the initial goal and capital funds of $100,000 have been made available. Estimate cost of incorporation, registering, and issuance of stock, etc., $250. A capable mature man, 30 to 40 years old, is to be selected. He should have a B.S. in mechanical engineering, with some chemis- try. He should have an understanding of the business skills, and some experience in plastics is desirable. He should be aggres- sive, yet able to get along well with people. His salary is estimated to be $12,000 per year, or $1,000 per month. The manager should be provided with appren- ticeship type of training in a going vacuum- forming plastic shop. He should spend time on all of the shop operations to acquire knowledge and skill. He should be coached by an expert, who later will serve as a consultant when the proposed company begins to take form.Year Month 1 2 Open bank account_-........ 1 2 Ordering equipment.....-.... 1 2 Renting of space.............Description and comment Deposit funds and empower the manager to write checks. At the earliest possible date, the vacuum- forming machine should be ordered, as delivery time lags about 6 months after placing an order. Delivery time on the other pieces of equipment is about 3 months. It is estimated that about 3,000 square feet of space will be required as a minimum. This space, heated, should cost about $1.50 per square foot It should be in a fireproof sprinkled building, on a 1st floor and with a loading dock. It should allow for moving in large heavy pieces of equipment and for ease in handling large heavy sheets (54 by 94 in.) of plastic. Heavy floor loads will be experienced. A small office to accommodate 2 persons would be a convenience. The rental agreement should provide or allow for heavy service electric (440 v., 100 kw.) connection and high water consumption (6 in supply line). Occupancy in the 6th month should be stipulated.November 29, 1967 could then estimate his costs and set up operational procedures to be followed. Molds and fixtures would be made or ordered as required, and the plastic sheeting would be ordered if it is not in inventory. The work of making the plastic item could be commenced when all of the necessary molds, fixtures and materials are on hand. The usual operations are: (1) Cutting blanks-Large plastic sheets (usually 54 x 94\") are cut down to a smaller predetermined size. (2) Forming-The cut black is Inserted into a frame, and this in turn is heated and vacuum formed over a mold. Upon cooling, the formed plastic is expelled, and the cycle is repeated. (3) Rough Trimming-A band saw is used for a rough trimming of the formed piece. This is usually performed by the vacuum forming machine operator during the time the vacuum forming machine is going through its automatic cycle. (4) Finish Trimming-With the aid of fix- tures, a precise job of trimming away un- wanted portions of the part is done, usually by a Veneer saw. Then the part is deburred. Holes may be drilled, etc. (5) Assembly-Two or more plastic parts are frequently cemented together for a unit. (6) Inspection and Packing-The final product is inspected-either visually or with gauges-and either approved or rejected. The approved items are packed for shipment. Associated with the basic operations set forth above are many related functions. As with most small companies, one or more per- sons must develop skills to carry out these functions. The more important of these are listed under the job title of the person most likely to have them. Manager (1) Technical knowledge and skill to han- dle all technical problems found in a vacuum formed plastics shop. (2) Supervisor of people. (3) Customer contact and selling. (4) Credits and collection. (5) Purchasing. (6) Production scheduling and inventory control. (7) Accounting, cost accounting and esti- mating. Clerk (1) Accounting and cost accounting. (2) Typing. (8) Production scheduling and inventory control. Pattern and Fixture Maker (1) Make molds from product prints and knowledge of the shrinkage characteristics of plastics. (2) Make fixtures, designed for maximum operator speed and minimum waste. CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 CHRONOLOGICAL SEQUENCE OF ANTICIPATED EVENTS WITH BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS AND COMMENTS-Continued Year Month Event 1 3 Plant layout ........ .... 1 3 Hire patternmaker........... 1 4 Hire setup man.............. 1 4 Selection of a clerk...._...... 1 5 Hire clerk..............Description and comment When the lease agreement on space has been signed, a floor plan layout should be started by the manager, assisted by the plastics consultant It is unlikely that a patternmaker, experienced in molds and fixtures for vacuum-formed plastics, can be obtained. It will probably be necessary to hire a skilled cabinetmaker, and train him in the art of making and re- pairing molds and fixtures. The requisite training would be provided in a vacuum- formed plastics shop under the tutoring of a skilled patternmaker. The pattern and fixturemaking capability is a very essential function in the proposed business; upon the product of this man's hands depends good product and low waste. These skills will not be used full time initially, and he will be expected to fill in his time as an operator. It is estimated that he be paid a patternmaker's rate of $3.50 per hour for all time worked. Training would be for 3 months. It is again unlikely that a skilled setup man, ex- perienced in setting up all operations es- sential to the proposed business, can be obtained. Therefore, a skilled setup man with production woodworking or machine shop experience should be selected and trained in a plastics shop. Again this is a key operation for the proposed business and skill is required for good product and low waste. These skills will not be used full time, and hewill be expected to fill in as an operator. It is estimated that he be paid $3.50 per hour. Training will be for 2 months. A clerk should have some background in accounting and some chemistry. He should be capable of assisting the manager in business affairs and acting for the manager in the latter's absence. His salary is esti- mated at $500 per month. The clerk would be given a month's experience in a vacuum-forming plastics shop, in order to gain some knowledge of the operation.Year Month Event 9 Setting up shop..._........ 1 6 Production begins.....-..--. 1 10 Increasing volume; improving effectiveness. 1 11 1 12S...do...-.............

The many aspects of this are too great for elaboration. Business and technical consultants are available toradvice. Actual production at about 10 percent of normalis expected to be turned in the 1st month.The work will be done by the manager and his 3 employees. 2 operators will be hired and their training started. Material usage isapt to be double what it should be due to high waste. Technical and business consul-tants are available for advice. Volume should be doubled in the 2d month of production. Waste, reflected by high mate- rial usage, is expected to continue high. The operating loss is anticipated at a peak of $4,200 per month. Production should increase to 30 percent of normal. Waste should decrease. Production should stay at 30 percent, and waste should have stabilized, though still at a high level. 1 more production operator will be hired to allow for growth. Effective- ness of labor is still expected to be low. Less for 1st year is estimated at $37,800. Volume of production is expected to be up to 40 percent of normal. Excess material usage should decrease, and labor should become more effective. With a good foundation established, volume should now increase, reaching the 100 per- cent of normal in month 5 of year 2. Even though labor effectiveness is still expected to be low and waste high, a profit should be shown for the 1st time. By yearend the effectiveness of labor should have reached a plateau of normal effective- ness. Labor cost per sales dollar should be $0.25; material costs should be normal at $0.35 per sales dollar, overhead costs should be in line at $0.20 per sales dollar and proit before taxes is estimated at $0.20 per sales dollar. The sequence of events outlined above and the estimates are to be read only as esti- mates made in good faith to present an idea of how such a business might be estab- lished and begin to operate. Many conditions which might affect such a business cannot be anticipated. EXAMPLE C-EQUIPMENT SERVICE BUSINESS All durable goods manufacturers must find a means of assuring that there are adequate repair facilities for their products once they have been sold. In our expanding economy, there are an increasing number of \"hard- ware\" items which require service and repair. Such items include automobiles, large and small appliances, lawn mowers, cameras, and many other items. For several reasons, this type of operation seems to be well suited to an inner-city busi- ness: (1) It meets one of the principal require- ments for a service facility: it should be con- veniently located for the customer. (2) It requires the kind of skills which can be acquired relatively quickly through train- ing and yet provide considerable challenge and satisfaction as well as the opportunity to progress to higher skills which are trans- ferable to other jobs. It can also lend itself to \"on-the-job\" training, where workers can produce while learning. (3) The capital requirements are small in relation to the number of jobs to be provided. (4) The labor component is a high per- centage of the total sales volume. As an example of the potential for this kind of activity, Kodak is giving considera- tion to the possible establishment of an in- dependent inner-city camera repair shop in Rochester. Kodak already has a number of independent warranty shops in other com- munities which service our products for our customers.While our thinking is not final, there fol- lows a general outline of how such a facility might operate: Assumptions (1) Cameras to be repaired would be re- ceived from dealers and consumers by Kodak and entered into the Company's present han- dling system. That is, Kodak would perform the normal receiving, editing-billing, and filing functions. (2) Cameras would be transported dally to the inner-city facility for actual repair. (3) After repair, cameras would be trans- ported back to Kodak for final inspection and return to customers. (4) If a repaired camera fails to pass final inspection, it would be returned to the shop for reworking. (5) The inner-city facility would be paid for its services by Kodak and would purchase parts and needed special service tools from Kodak. (6) The number of cameras to be repaired would have considerable seasonal fluctua- tion. Shop requirements (1) Personnel: Servicemen 6 to 8, super- visor 1, clerical 1. The supervisor also would perform fol- lowing duties: Instructing; purchasing sup- and handling. (2) Facilities: Space-150 sq. ft. for each employee. This space allowance includes space for common facilities such as: parts cabinets, aisles, etc. Building should be heat- ed and have relatively clean atmosphere. Lighting equal to that recommended for office work (50-100 ft.-c. at desk level) would be desirable. If a loading dock at approxi- mately truck bed level is not available, de-liveries and pick-ups would require use of a truck with a power tailgate. Pressured air at each work place is desir- able. This could be obtained by installing a small commercial air compressor with a self- contained air tank (similar to paint spray compressor). Air line pipe could be attached from one workbench to the next. Electrical power (110 volt) should be available at each workbench. (3) Equipment: Workbenches (30 by 60 inches approxi- mately) (could be used desks or tables) ---------------------------- 8 Bench lights------------------------ 8 Desk (for supervisor) -- 1------------- 1 Tables (30 by 60 Inches approximately) -- 3 Chairs ----------------------------- 10 File cabinet------------------------- 1 Adding machine--------------------- 1 Parts cabinets (12 sections 3 inches high, 9 sections 4 inches high, 12 sec- tions 6 inches high)---------------- 4 Shelving for drawers (24 inches deep sec- tions) ---------------------------- 4 Shelving (sections with shelves 3 feet by 2 feet by 7 feet)-------------------- 6 (4) Test equipment: Mlliwatt second transfer meter-------- 1 Tool No. 1135 adapter for transfer meter 1 Shutter speed checker----------------- 1 (5) Hand tools (expendable): Jeweler's screwdriver handle (tool No. 30) ------------------------------ 16 Phillips screw bit (for handle) ...---. 16 Flat blade bit (for handle)------------ 8 Large diameter hand Jeweler's style mag- netic screwdriver----------.---.--- 8 Small knife-------------------------- 8 Squeeze bottle (for cement) ------------ 8 Miscellaneous additional hand tools--..- .-34160 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE (6) Material: Small stock of spare parts for each camera model. (7) Miscellaneous supplies: Cement (MMM 1357), solvents, hand soap, paper towels, tis- sue, shop clothes, etc. Capital requirements It is estimated that the amount of capital required to establish this type of facility should not exceed $50,000, including work- ing capital.Sales volume It is estimated that, with a volume suffi- cient to provide jobs for 8-10 people, sales would amount to approximately $125,000 per year. EXAMPLE D--MICROFILMING SERVICE BUSINESS An inner-city company could be formed to offer a microfilm service and to seek contracts for this type of business. The enterprise would be responsible for operating the busi- ness and meeting all customer requirements. The federal, state, and local governments are potentially the largest customers for this type of operation. The sales volume, job opportunities and profit potential would vary with the size and nature of the job to be done. Because Kodak has had considerable ex- perience with this kind of business, we would be in a position to offer assistance in such areas as: 1. Training employees. 2. Designing the appropriate microfilming system to meet a particular customer's re- quirements. 3. Providing technical aid in such mat- ters as setting up the facility, quality con- trol, etc. The capital requirements for such a busi- ness are not excessive because the facilities and equipment could be rented. A major appeal of microfilming is that it drastically reduces storage space require- ments for records while effecting long-range cost savings. A substantial number of jobs could be provided for inner-city residents and the long-term government cost of storing documents and retrieving information could be substantially reduced. Because the government is a large poten- tial customer, we have discussed the concept with government representatives in Washing- ton. Our idea was summarized in a letter sent on October 27, 1967, to one of these officials and the pertinent portions of that letter are quoted below. \"The microfilming idea we have been dis- cussing came to us several weeks back when we were considering questions involved in creating new business enterprises in ghetto areas. As we understood the problem, the requirements for such enterprises would give preference to creating jobs of relatively little skill (training requirements of weeks rather than months or years), jobs which avoid the unfavorable connotations of menial service (a 'job with dignity,' as one of our Rochester Negro leaders has put it), and jobs which might be more appealing to men but which would not exclude women. Beyond that, we saw as desirable criteria an enterprise which would require low capital cost and a large labor content in its product or service. These thoughts led us back in our own experience to consideration we gave several years ago to a job overseas for the Patent Office. They then asked us to consider setting up estab- lishments in several foreign countries to in- stitute microfilm systems involving substan- tial numbers of foreign patents. The advan- tage at the time was the proposed use of counterpart funds available in those coun- tries. We would have been required to train and use local labor and ultimately decided that the problems of language and the diffi- culties to be anticipated in producing a sat- isfactory result were beyond reasonable ex- pectation. As we remembered this expe- rience, it impressed us that if this kind of project could be justified on its merit andcould be supported by American funds abroad, a parallel could be developed for that type of activity within the ghetto area of various American cities. This led to other thoughts. \"Over the years we have had conversations with various agencies of the Federal Gov- ernment in regard to record-keeping prob- lems. A number of those agencies have adopted microfilming systems, achieving greater efficiency and reducing costs. Those systems vary, of course, but microfilming techniques are flexible enough to meet many of the needs put forth by agencies required to maintain large numbers of printed records for extended periods. To give you some idea of the manner in which microfilming sys- tems have been used, I am enclosing re- prints of articles which have been written about several installations. \"In the past few years we have talked with other governmental agencies which have ex- pressed a desire to establish microfilm record retention systems but have not been able to do so for reasons of budget. In the Vet- erans Administration, for example, we did a test program which demonstrated the ac- ceptability and feasibility of reducing clinical records to microfilm form and the savings in cost which could be achieved ultimately. The adoption of the program was deferred, how- ever, for budgetary reasons, although re- quests for funds continue to be made and the weight of opinion seems to be that such a program will be necessary for the Veterans Administration later if not sooner. There are a number of other similar situations with the records involved located in various places throughout the country. \"We suggest that it may be desirable for many of these governmental agencies to un- dertake microfilm retention programs now rather than later. We suggest further that such programs can be established and run in poverty-stricken areas and can provide new jobs for people who live there. \"Roughly two-thirds of the total cost of the microfilming portion of any one of these jobs Is direct labor. Microfilming programs seem also to meet the job criteria we thought desirable. The skills involved in using micro- filming machinery, while not considerable, are nevertheless significant. It took us about three weeks, for example, to train the people involved in our present Patent Office job microfilming U.S. patents. And on that job, by the way, we have a balance between men and women of about 50-50. There is also an industry where a market for such skills ex- ists. Twelve thousand banks have microfilm- ,ing installations, for example. \"We were talking yesterday about estab- lishing an independent company to do this work, a company which might be owned and run by people from the ghetto. You asked us the extent to which Eastman Kodak might be willing to become involved in supporting the management of such a new enterprise and you asked also the degree to which Kodak might be willing to contribute training and consulting services or other resources. We were unable to give you sharp answers on those questions. Until we all really know better the nature of the particular problem, that is, what is expected, where and with whom, it is difficult to go further than our discussion of yesterday. Very obviously all of us will have to be satisfied that the or- ganization created can do the job effectively and properly. \"You asked what the next step might be. I think we were agreed that it should be some determination on whether or not there are opportunities within any governmental agency for new microfilming programs which could be adapted to these particular needs. If we knew of such an agency we could start the process of working with them to define and draw specifications for the job to be done. Once we have that determined, the problem then becomes one of how to do that job in the ghetto setting.\"In addition to the various government agencies' requirements, there are industrial applications for microfilm services. More im- portantly, the skills that the employees of this projected company acquire are directly applicable to existing industrial and gov- ernmental microfilming operations. Micro- filming, even though well established, is still one of the new arts with growth potential for the future. Mr. Speaker, this detailed explanation of the Kodak plan shows the thorough- ness which went into its preparation, and the promise it holds for bright economic days ahead for Rochester's inner city. Rochester's two daily newspapers were quick to praise Kodak for its enlight- ened proposal. I would like to conclude by quoting their editorials: [From the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle, Nov. 18, 1967] HOPE POR INNER CITY Eastman Kodak Company's proposal to promote the establishment of new, independ- ent small businesses in the inner city opens up some exciting prospects. It offers hope where it's needed most and it strengthens the faith of all who believe that Rochester, with its wealth of resources, can indeed be- come a \"model city.\" Over the years, it has been the flight from the inner city that has threatened its sta- bility, and consequently the stability of the entire community. If new businesses can be set up, there is a chance that the trend can be reversed. What's particularly important about the plan is that it does not contemplate any \"make-work\" enterprises. The four suggested areas of business development all carry promise of financial success, with Kodak it- self as a potential customer. \"Whatever busi- ness is embarked upon,\" notes the proposal, \"it should be able to stand on its own merits within a reasonable period, perhaps a year or two.\" A lot depends now, of course, on commu- nity reaction, on how quickly the chance is seized. There are opportunities here that go beyond the immediate future. The forma- tion of a Community Development Corpora- tion, for example, would provide a vehicle, one that has been too long lacking, for par- ticipation by the Small Business Administra- tion. As far as Kodak is concerned, public In- terest coincides with self-interest. Invest- ment on sound business lines in the inner city is investment In the community as a whole. [From the Rochester Times-Union, Nov. 20, 1967] KODAK URGES NEW AID TO THE POOR Many U.S. businesses have talked about helping to spur economic opportunity among the poor where they live, in the inner city. But Eastman Kodak Company is one of the first to try to plan something concrete. The company is urging the formation of a Community Development Corporation to provide financing and advice for small busi- nesses to be established in the inner city. It volunteers a leading role as fund-raiser, counselor and customer. Management and workers would be drawn largely from the inner city poor. Their firms would be run not as charitable organizations but as profit-making enterprises which could lead to further development. There are great resources of energy, talent and ambition among Negroes, Puerto Ricans and others who live in the inner city. But these abilities have long been locked in by prejudice, lack of education, a defeatist out- look, lack of capital, and too much depend- ence on slow-moving government programs. Kodak's plan could provide a private en-34161 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 terprise key to open more quickly new doors toward fuller opportunity. OPERATION GASBUGGY Mr. SAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to address the House for 1 minute, to revise and extend my remarks, and to include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. SAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, in early December a nuclear bomb 30 percent more powerful than the one dropped on Hiroshima will be exploded 4,200 feet beneath the surface of the Carson Na- tional Forest, 175 miles north of Albu- querque, N. Mex. I would like to submit for the RECORD two articles dealing with this experiment taken from the pages of the Wall Street Journal of November 15, 1967, and U.S. News & World Report of November 20,1967. This explosion, a part of \"Operation Gasbuggy,\" is designed to test the use of nuclear bombs to free large quantities of natural gas from underground reserves. It is also a part of the effort of the Atomic Energy Commission to find peaceful uses for atomic energy and thus perpetuate itself. There are many reasons to question the wisdom of this program. First, it will cost the taxpayers of this Nation some $2.8 million. At a time when fiscal re- straint is vital and when the economic viability of this Nation requires the cur- tailment of every nonessential govern- mental expenditure, it would seem logi- cal and prudent to forgo luxuries such as Operation Gasbuggy. But, of far more significance is the effect of the Gasbuggy project upon the health and safety of the American people. The use of a nuclear bomb in this way will certainly entail a great risk, a risk from the actual explosion and its after- math. For example, one of the great un- knowns of this test is whether radio- active tritium, an isotope of hydrogen, will combine with the hydrogen-carbon atoms of the natural gas. To measure the impact, should this occur, we need only consider the fact that radioactive tritium has a half life of 12 years. One further note, Mr. Speaker. This explosion in New Mexico is but a part of a long-range scheme of the Atomic Energy Commission to explode nuclear bombs all over the world for supposedly peaceful purposes. Several other projects in the United States are under study, in- cluding the use of nuclear power for blasting a huge cavern for natural gas storage in Pennsylvania. Also, the AEC wants permission to use nuclear bombs to blast a new canal across Central America. It is obviously in the public interest for Congress to look closely at the role of the Atomic Energy Commission in our Nation and the desirability of per- mitting that agency to bring the threat of radiation-induced injury to every corner of the United States before such a proliferation of nuclear power is per- mitted. The articles mentioned above follow:[From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 15, 1967] BLASTING FOR BUCKS-INDUSTRY SET To EX- PLODE ITS FIRST ATOMIC BOMB IN COMMER- CIAL VENTURE-EL PASO NATURAL GAS HOPES To TAP NEW FIELD; SHALE On, COPPER PLANS STUDIED-AEC COOPERATES IN PROJ- ECTS (By Herbert G. Lawson) FARMINGTON, N. MEx.-American industry is ready to trigger its first nuclear bomb. Next month, if all goes well, El Paso Nat- ural Gas Co., in partnership with the Atomic Energy Commission and the Interior De- partment, will explode a hydrogen device equal to 26,000 tons of TNT. The shot will be touched off at a desolate site beneath the rugged canyons of Carson National Forest 55 miles each of here. Unlike the blast that opened the atomic age at Alamagordo, N.M., on July 16, 1945, no mushroom cloud will rise from next month's event. In fact, observers near ground zero may feel only a slight tremor from the explosion, buried 4,240 feet below ground in a sandstone formation. But it will echo around the world as the first in- dustry-Government nuclear explosion for commercial purposes. El Paso Natural Gas is betting that the thermonuclear bang will unlock vast natural gas deposits now trapped in rock forma- tions too dense to be tapped by normal drilling methods. It and other gas com- panies see nuclear devices opening up gas fields that could more than double all pres- ent known U.S. reserves-at a cost at least competitive with present supplies. THRESHOLD OF AN ERA Results won't be known for five months or more. But if the gas output from \"Proj- ect Gasbuggy\" confirms pre-shot studies, many nuclear experts believe atomic energy will have entered a new and more produc- tive age. \"It appears we're really on the threshold of an era when nuclear explosions will do what we've always hoped they would-serve peaceful purposes,\" says Wil- liam Trenholme, director of the Arizona Atomic Energy Commission, a state agency. Already, companies are scrambling to win AEC approval for other experiments that nuclear engineers believe would yield stag- gering stores of mineral wealth. Among them: Projects Dragon Trail and Rulison, two separate proposals to explode nuclear de- vices in Colorado to unlock trapped natural gas. Continental Oil Co. and Austral Oil Co. are the sponsors. Project Sloop, a Kennecott Copper Corp. plan for an explosion near Safford, Ariz., that might result in nearly doubling U.S. supplies of copper. Project Bronco, a plan being pushed by 18 oil companies, including Texaco, Mobil, Shell and Continental, to test whether a hydrogen blast could turn Rocky Mountain oil shale beds into huge underground ovens. The tech- nique, they believe, might make economical the recovery of much of the estimated $3.5 trillion of oil in shale deposits. Project Ketch, a Columbia Gas Systems Inc. proposal to blast out a huge under- ground storage reservoir for gas in north- central Pennsylvania. It might result in lower energy costs for consumers. Project Thunderbird, a plan not yet pro- posed to the AEC but being pushed among coal companies by a group of Wyoming en- gineers who control coal leases. They believe a nuclear blast could help gasify thick beds of coal in a 100-square-mile area of Wy- oming, making available in the 20 billion tons of coal there more than twice the en- ergy in all proven U.S. oil reserves. An Arizona State project-still unnamed- that would use the bomb to create a network of underground water storage reservoirs to trap rainfall that now evaporates. Mr. Tren-holme of the Arizona Atomic Energy Comi. mission envisions a series of blasts even. tually doubling Arizona's water supply. ONLY A BEGINNING? These projects could be just a beginning. \"If Gasbuggy is successful, all the oil and gas companies will descend on Washington to push for more testing,\" predicts H. H. Aron- son, vice president of CER Geonuclear Corp., Las Vegas, a joint venture formed by Conti- nental Oil Co. and Edgerton, Germeshausen & Grier Inc., the company that has triggered all atomic tests for the AEC. CER Geonuclear is project manager for Dragon Trail, Rulison and Bronco. Mr. Aronson says he hopes the Dragon Trail shot-a 40-kiloton blast in Rio Blanco county, Colo.-will be ready in August or September next year. He believes that Ruli- son-a pair of 50-kiloton devices that would be fired simultaneously 1,000 feet apart in Garfield County, Colo.-could come in 1968 or early 1969. Rullson is particularly impor- tant \"because we're shooting it for money,\" he says. \"For the first time the gas produced should pay for the cost of the shot.\" The oil shale explosion could also come within a year or so, he believes. But it may take another three years or more before oil companies prove out the economics of recov- ering oil from the shale by the underground process. The optimism exuded by managers of these many nuclear projects could be premature of course. Gasbuggy is the only industry-Gov- ernment nuclear explosion that is definitely scheduled. The others await negotiation of contracts between industry and the AEC, followed by Congressional appropriations for Uncle Sam's share of the cost. SOME POLITICAL PROBLEMS Government funds may be a major hurdle if nuclear tests are to meet the timetables that industry has set. \"Government research money is tight,\" says one company planner, \"If LBJ doesn't get his 10% surtax, he's going to crucify us on these nuclear projects.\" Other political problems vex industry planners. \"Don't call it a bomb,\" pleads one nuclear engineer discussing his company's project. \"There are still people in Govern- ment who would like to ban the bomb and forget we ever discovered atomic energy.\" An AEC official, who asks for anonymity, agrees that \"there is a fair amount of feel- ing among high Administration officials that there shouldn't be any peaceful explosions.\" He notes that the Arms Control and Disarm- ament Agency, now at work on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, is concerned that the projects might interfere with treaty ne- gotiations. \"They argue that, if the world's survival depends on banning the bomb, you have to treat all nuclear explosives as weap- ons,\" says the AEC official. Fears of radiation and other destructive effects of nuclear blasts cloud prospects for some tests. Columbia Gas faces irate citi- zens in and near Renovo, Pa., a town of about 4,000 people some 12 miles from the site of its proposed reservoir. \"There is some concern (among townspeople) and in some cases outright opposition,\" concedes a Co- lumbia Gas spokesman. Bennett Shaffer, editor of the Renovo Daily Record, puts it more strongly. He says the testing will require construction that \"will destroy the forest\" in that popular hunting and fishing area. He worries that a hunter will eat an irradiated rabbit or deer. The borough councils of Renovo and South Renovo share his concern and have passed resolutions opposing the test. AEC and company officials argue that there will be no public exposure to radiation from the underground nuclear tests. All will be buried deeply enough to prevent the ex- plosions from \"venting\" or breaking the surface. The only problem, they insist, stems from the unknown amount of residual radia-34162 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE tion that will remain in the gas, copper, oil or whatever is being recovered or stored. REMOVING RADIATION The \"best guess\" of experts, according to sam Smith, director of exploration for El paso Natural Gas, is that radiation can be removed from gas at reasonable cost. One way would be to dilute it with gas from other sources. The gas also would be left in the ground long enough for radioactivity to decay. Chemical treatment to remove radia- tion is also possible. The same approach could be used with shale oil or copper, experts note. \"If we had a strong feeling that radiation was going to be a major problem, we prob- ably wouldn't come up with money of this magnitude,\" says Henry Vermillion, an AEC public information official. The AEC is foot- ing $2.8 million of the $4.7 million cost of Gasbuggy, with El Paso contributing most of the remainder, Mr. Aronson of CER Geonu- clear estimates that private companies have spent more than $20 million thus far pre- paring for nuclear explosive tests. Radioactive tritium, an isotope of hydro- gen, is the object of concern in most pro- posed experiments. It could combine easily with the hydrogen-carbon atoms in gas, oil or coal. It decays slowly, losing half its ra- dioactivity every 12 years. In the copper ex- periment, however, another radioactive ele- ment, ruthenium, may be most troublesome because it is difficult to remove from copper, experts say. CONSIDERING WORLD OPINION Political maneuvers have a far more im- portant effect on the planned nuclear shots. The AEC had hoped to prove that the bomb could be used for excavations on a grand scale-cutting a canal through Central Amer- ica, for example. But the first nuclear ditch- digging experiment in hard rock, a key step in this series, has been stalled and postponed repeatedly. Excavation explosives would dump radioactivity into the air, raising the possibility of violations of the U.S.-Soviet test-ban treaty and also, some Administra- tion men fear, jarring world opinion during negotiations for a nuclear nonproliferation treaty. Nevertheless, the AEC continues to push for its hard-rock excavation test and even is talking with Australian officials about pos- sible nuclear shots to create harbors in West- ern Australia to serve the newly booming minerals industry there. El Paso Natural Gas is the first to admit that it once worried about public relations problems of nuclear testing. \"One of our senior executives expressed serious concern when Gasbuggy was proposed four years ago,\" says Mr. Smith. \"Too many people relate nu- clear explosives to Hiroshima, Nagasaki and war in general.\" Another major gas company canceled its early planning for a nuclear test for just such a reason, he adds. But, to El Paso's relief, public opposition or unfavorable customer reaction hasn't ap- peared. \"Our success in publicly selling our project is encouraging others to come for- ward with their own,\" Mr. Smith maintains. SECOND TEST PROPOSED El Paso is confident enough of the eco- nomic soundness of Gasbuggy that a few weeks ago it proposed a second company ex- periment to the AEC-this time a shot two or three miles below the surface in Wyoming gas field. El Paso's Gasbuggy shot is typical of planned underground explosions. Assuming the scientists are correct, here's what will happen: The rubble-filled cavity formed by the blast almost a mile below ground will be 350 feet high and 160 feet in diameter. This \"chimney\" will be surrounded by fractures in adjoining rock extending outward 850 feet. The fractures will bring gas into the chimney where the pool of gas can be tapped easily by conventional wells,Researchers calculate that this nuclear fracturing will produce seven times the amount of gas that could be freed by the usual nitroglycerine or high-pressure-fluid fracturing now used. The U.S. Bureau of Mines estimates that the \"nuclear stimula- tion\" technique could add about 300 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to the nation's proved recoverable reserves-doubling pres- ent reserves estimated at 289.3 trillion cubic feet. Such an increase would go far toward meeting the nation's growing appetite for gas, a need estimated at 30 trillion cubic feet of new reserves each year. Mr. Smith of El Paso believes that nuclear costs \"already are commercial in certain (gas field) areas of the Rockies\" and should be- come even more attractive if the Govern- ment cuts proposed prices for nuclear ex- plosives for commercial purposes. FIFTY-EIGHT MILLION TONS OF COPPER Other nuclear projects vary somewhat from Gasbuggy in the recovery technique. Kenne- cott's aim is to create a large deposit of crushed ore underground through which acid will be poured to leach out copper. The solu- tion will then be pumped from a pool at the bottom of the ore to the surface and the copper recovered from the solution. The Bureau of Mines estimates that about 58 million tons of copper in low-grade ore bodies not now recoverable might be mined using the nuclear technique. That's a nine- year world supply at current consumption levels and not much less than the 75 mil- lion tons of proven commercial-grade reserves of the scarce metal in the U.S. Oil companies eying the multitrillion-dol- lar bonanza in oil shale in the Rockies pro- pose to inject air into the rock-filled chim- ney created by a 50 kiloton explosion. The air would aid combustion in the ready-made nuclear oven, or \"retort,\" turning the solid kerogen into liquid oil. The oil would be collected at the bottom of the chimney and pumped to the surface. \"Experimental retorting tests indicate as much as 80% of the oil may be recovered by the in-place retorting of a nuclear chim- ney,\" the oil companies said in a summary of the Bronco feasibility study. Much the same approach as in Bronco would be followed in the proposed coal ex- periment in Wyoming. Wold & Jenkins, a Casper Wyo., coal exploration firm, is seek- ing coal company sponsors for a plan to burn thick beds of coal in an underground hole formed by a nuclear explosion. Combustion would turn the coal into gas, which would be brought to surface plants at the test site ,to be turned into gasoline or heating gas. FIRMS HOPE AEC WILL CUT NUCLEAR EX- PLOSIVE PRICES If you're shopping for a nuclear bomb, wait awhile. The price may be coming down. The cost of nuclear explosives is a very real worry for companies hoping to put them to work on everything from mining copper to building gas and water reservoirs. The Atomic Energy Commission now has, in ef- fect, a \"suggested price list\" for its bombs. It isn't selling them to anyone yet, of course, but it issued the price schedule as an aid to companies planning nuclear projects. Prices range from $350,000 for a low-yield shot of 10 kilotons (half the size of the Hiroshima bomb) to $600,000 for a mighty two-megaton bomb (equal to two million tons of TNT). In the 50-to-100-kiloton grade of explosives that most private companies are considering, the cost is $425,000 to $460,000. But it's widely assumed among industry engineers and AEC staffers that the Gov- ernment eventually can and will cut those prices. One AEC official says, \"I assume the price will come down, but I can't guaran- tee it.\" Grumbles one nuclear engineer of a private company, \"The devices should cost$50,000 to $100,000 each. The AEC is try- ing to amortize the whole atomic energy program since Los Alamos in the present price list.\" [From the U.S. News & World Report, Nov. 20, 1967] MINING BY ATOMIC EXPLOSION: A 4.5-MILLION EXPERIMENT (A 46-billion-dollar prize is at stake in a test of atomic explosives about to take place in New Mexico. (Natural gas worth that much or more may become available if the experiment is a suc- cess. And other mineral riches may yield to the same technique.) EL PASO, TEX.-A sliver of land in northern New Mexico is due to shake and heave from an underground atomic explosion tentatively set for early December. Minerals experts around the world have been waiting for this experiment, named \"Gasbuggy\" by the Atomic Energy Commis- sion. It has been delayed several times by technical problems. The idea, briefly, is to pulverize a buried formation of rock containing natural gas and thus liberate more gas, at less cost, than conventional methods could bring out. If all goes as planned-if the liberated gas flows freely and is not radioactive, and if there is no lasting damage to the area- enormous fields of similar gas-bearing rock in the U.S. and elsewhere can be made pro- ductive. The estimate is that 44,400 U.S. wells similar to Gasbuggy could employ atomic fracturing, as the technique is called. Most of these wells are in New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and Arizona. They would add 317 trillion cubic feet to the nation's gas reserves, more than doubling them. Each well would yield about 1 million dol- lars' worth of gas, indicating a total of about 46 billion dollars' worth of additional gas to be obtained by atomic-explosive mining. How Gasbuggy would work. At a site in the Carson National Forest about 175 miles north of Albuquerque, N.M., an atomic charge equal to 26,000 tons of TNT-30 per cent more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima-is to be placed in a steel casing that pierces a layer of gas-bearing rock known as the Pictured Cliffs Formation. The rock lies about 4,000 feet below the surface, and the atomic device will be lowered to a point 40 feet under that. When exploded, it will crush, melt and vaporize surrounding material. In one tenth of a second a rounded cave will be created, about 160 feet in di- ameter and more than half a mile under- ground. Observers, stationed less than 2 miles away, are not expected to see anything, but will feel a movement of the earth and hear a rumble. For safety, roads and airspace will be closed to traffic for miles around the site. As the underground cavity cools and pres- sure inside it drops, the vaporized and melted rock will sink to the bottom. Solidifying there, it will trap most of the radioactive fission products. When the pressure drops further, the roof of the cave is expected to collapse, forming a chimney-shaped column of broken stone, 350 feet from top to bottom and 160 feet wide. Radiating from this will be large fissures and hairline cracks extending up to 425 feet from the detonation point. Natural gas is expected to pour through these cracks into the \"chimney.\" When there has been enough cooling and settling, within a few days or weeks, a new well will be bored into the chimney, and months of testing will begin. Besides measuring the quality and quan- tity of gas, scientists will check to see if the explosion cracked a dam 23 miles away, or damaged gas wells and pipelines within a 5-mile radius, or made nearby ground water34163 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 radioactive. It will be about 18 months before results are fully evaluated. THE \"IFS\" One of many \"ifs\" concerns the high cost of each atomic explosion. The Gasbuggy proj- ect will cost about 4.5 millions. To be com- mercially profitable, atomic shots would have to cost not more than a half million dollars each, industry experts say. Too, Congress would have to approve the use of nuclear explosives for commercial use. C. H. Atkinson of the U.S. Bureau of Mines says it is \"doubtful that nuclear fracturing will be in widespread use before 1980,\" unless technology advances faster than Is foreseen. The New Mexico experiment, when it comes off, will be the nineteenth explosion in the AEC's Plowshare program, aimed at finding ways to use the atom's power peacefully. Many more shots are being planned. An oil-shale explosion in Colorado, named \"Bronco,\" is under study. An explosion tagged \"Sloop\" would fracture rock in a low-grade copper deposit near Saf- ford, Ariz., to see if the copper can be dis- solved underground and drawn out in a liquid solution. In Pennsylvania an explosion named \"Ketch\" has been proposed, to create an un- derground cavity for storage of natural gas. Explosions to develop marginal reservoirs of oil may be attempted, but scientists doubt that much can be done in this way for oil. A major hurdle is the tendency of liquids to absorb radioactivity. FUTURE FARMERS OF AMERICA Mr. POFF. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani- mous consent to address the House for 1 minute, to revise and extend my re- marks, and to include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. POFF. Mr. Speaker, I was most concerned to hear the remarks of the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. RUMSFELD] last week in which he pointed out an unhealthy relationship between the U.S. Office of Education and the Future Farmers of America Foundation. The Future Farmers of America came into being after the Future Farmers of Virginia had been organized on the cam- pus of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute at Blacksburg, Va. This superb organiza- tion has provided a training ground for young people interested in agriculture over the years. It was therefore particu- larly upsetting to me to learn that the fundraising arm of the Future Farm- ers of America has been utilizing office space provided at the expense of the Federal Government. Not only has this been documented, but the gentleman from Illinois has reported that the part- time services of at least four Federal Government employees have been uti- lized by the Future Farmers of America. One of these Federal employees who holds the title of chief of Agricultural Education is also president of the Future Farmers of America Foundation Board, chairman of the Future Farmers of America Governing Committee, chair- man of the Future Farmers of America National Board of Directors, and adviser to the National Board of Student Officers of the Future Farmers of America. It ap- pears that this one man who wears five hats is the principal policymaker for an organization whose members properlypride themselves in their independence of thought, word and deed. I also understand that the Future Farmers of America has a professional fund raiser who is quartered in Fed- eral Government space and who has as his primary mission the solicitation of contributions for the Future Farmers of America Foundation awards program. I find this sort of covert subsidy an insidious beginning to Federal Govern- ment domination of a private organiza- tion which has in the past proven its mettle by asserting its independence. The Future Farmers of America owns 35 acres of land near the Woodlawn plantation at the intersection of US. Routes No. 1 and No. 235 in Fairfax County, Va. On this land there are build- ings estimated to be worth one-half mil- lion dollars and there is no legitimate reason why the Future Farmers of America Foundation should not occupy these privately owned quarters. Only in this way can this organization once again be really free and independent as it has been in the past. I hope that Secretary Gardner will conduct a meaningful investigation aimed not at covering up facts but re- vealing them. I hope that the FAA Foun- dation will move with dispatch to vacate the Government quarters it now oc- cupies, thus removing the unfortunate taint which threatens to soil the superior record of an organization and a founda- tion which has served so well the Na- tion's agriculture and the Nation's youth. Mr. Speaker, I am anxious to see the FFA endure as it began, private, inde- pendent and unsubsidized. I trust the Secretary will take to heart the deep concern which motivates my comments. This unhealthy situation can be cured only if there is action and those of us who are concerned intend to persist until that action is taken. VIVA LE DICTATOR Mr. MULTER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend my remarks. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. MULTER. Mr. Speaker, when I learned Latin in school I was taught that Gaul was divided into three parts. That was in Caesar's day. Today all gall is united and imbedded in De Gaulle, the self-proclaimed worldwide dictator, who having solved all of the problems of France-at least he thinks so, although few Frenchmen agree-he now orders a solution of all the problems of the world. Mr. Speaker, rarely have we seen such an impudent and impertinent or exten- sive attempt at aggrandizement of power. He would dare to tell Israel, Canada, Great Britain, and the United States in one fell swoop what to do and how to live. Mr. Speaker, this grand pretender talks glibly about honor and the duty to live up to commitments, and then pro- ceeds to dishonor his and his country'scommitments and urges other countriesto follow his dishonorable and anarchic course. Mr. Speaker, President de Gaulle, nothaving enough to do at home, urges theCanadians to rebel against their dulyconstituted government, and tells Israelthat he will no longer keep his commit-ment to that country. He courts the friendship of the Arabs by reprehensible denunciation of friendly Israel. The \"great economist\" would also tell Great Britain how to operate its econ- omy. Instead of inviting the British into the Common Market, he pursues his iso- lationism by trying to get Europe to turn its back on a staunch ally. He ignores and refuses to talk about all this country has done for France. He obviously thinks commitments are uni- lateral and not reciprocal. He ignores entirely the $6 billion debt of France to the United States, a demand for payment of which we have for too long forborne making. Mr. Speaker, it is high time that we told him, \"Pay your debts before you tell us what to do in our economy.\" The United States let him withdraw $2,264,000,000 in gold, without once say- ing, \"Stop, you cannot have that gold until you pay what you owe us.\" Even now we need not say, \"Pay that debt in gold.\" Let us say, \"Pay it to us in the 'goldless' dollars you abhor so much.\" If American dollars are so worthless, if they do so much harm to your country or to its economy, send them back to the United States. We will give you full credit dollar for dollar against what you owe us. We will even do it without compounding the interest. But let us go further and say, Since you do not like our money and do not want any more of it, we will relieve you of that burden. Until you think better of it, we should ask Americans to stay out of France and to cease buying French goods. To give Americans ample incentive to comply with our request, we should im- pose a 500-percent ad valorem duty on all French products. We should impose a small visa tax of a measly useless $1,000 on each American who wants to go to France, just to be sure he does not spend it there. To evidence our good intentions, we might give each such American a credit of $1,000, spendable anywhere except in France. We will even learn to get along without French wines made from fruit grown in vineyards devastated by World War II and revitalized by cuttings from American vineyards. Viva le dictator! We can get along without you. Let us see how long you can get along without us. UNITED NATIONS STAND ON RED CHINA Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to extend my re- marks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Speaker, al-34164 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE though our unofficial administration policy seems to be shifting more and more toward a stand which will even- tually allow two China members in the United Nations, we have again stood firm against further demeaning of this body. I point out that this is the 16th time Red China has been turned away since the question first arose in 1949. For the record, I insert a compilation of the votes on this issue from today's Washington Post. The reasons why the answer continues to be \"No\" were amply given in an issues and answers statement prepared by the Republic of China which I inserted into the RECORD on November 3, of this year. At this point I include the Post article: How U.N. STANDS ON CHINESE ISSUE UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., November 28.-Mem- bership in the United Nations for Communist China first became an issue in 1949, when the Peking government initially raised it. Neither the Security Council nor the Gen- eral Assembly acted on the matter in 1950. Since then the Assembly in one form or an- other has turned down the proposal 16 times, including today's vote (no votes were taken during the 1964 Assembly because of a dis- pute over finances). From 1951 through 1960 the votes were on a proposal not to consider the question of Chinese representation at the session. Actual votes were as follows: U.N. Absten- Year member- For Against tions ship 1951.....-..... 60 37 11 4 1952 ----------- 60 42 7 11 1953--...-... .. 60 44 10 2 1954...------. 60 43 11 6 1955--....-... 60 42 12 6 1956.--..----.. 79 47 24 8 1957 ----..- -82 47 27 7 1958 -.....- .. 81 44 28 9 1959..---.---. 82 44 29 9 1960...------. 98 42 34 22 In 1961, when the membership was 104, the Assembly adopted an American resolution to consider Chinese representation an \"im- portant question,\" on which change would require two-thirds approval by those present and voting. The vote on the \"important ques- tion\" resolution 61-34, with 7 abstentions. Subsequently the Assembly voted 48-26 against a resolution to seat Peking and expel the Chinese Nationalists (Taiwan), with 20 abstentions. In 1962, when the membership stood at 110, the Assembly voted 56-42, with 12 ab- stentions, against seating Peking and expel- ling Taiwan. In 1963, with the membership at 111, the vote on the same resolution was 57-41, with 12 abstentions. In 1965, with membership at 117, the As- sembly again approved the \"important ques- tion\" resolution 56-49, with 11 abstentions. The vote on the proposal to seat Peking and expel Taiwan was 47-47, with 20 abstentions. In 1966, with 121 members, the vote on the \"Important question\" resolution was 66- 48, with 7 abstentions, The vote against seat- ing Peking was 57-46, with 17 abstentions. A SAD CONTRAST Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to extend my re- marks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio?There was no objection. Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Speaker, while Negro soldiers in Vietnam display true American citizenship by their fine record in battle, a Negro attorney and civil rights worker, Calvin Cobb, of Long Is- land, N.Y., according to the New York Daily News of November 22, has re- nounced his citizenship and has stated that he wants to have nothing to do with the United States. This, of course, is his right. However, his statement to a court in Tanzania, before which he is fighting extradition to the United States, that he had \"tried to organize the poisoning of 50,000 white policemen in New York\" is truly shocking. Furthermore, the Daily News account states that he claims to have trained Negroes to kill whites. Al- though his extradition to the United States is in the hands of Tanzania, I am hopeful that it will be successful and that an investigation will be made of the circumstances surrounding these ex- treme statements. I include the Daily News article in the RECORD at this point: BRAGS: TAUGHT NEGRo KILIERS DAR Es SALAAM, TANZANIA, November 21.- Disbarred Negro attorney Calvin Cobb of North Babylon, L.I., renounced his American citizenship today and said he is a man who has trained Negroes to kill whites. \"Try me for being a killer and not a thief,\" he said in an emotional appeal to an African court not to allow his extradition to the United States to face charges stemming from a grand larcency conviction. He said he wanted to have nothing to do with the United States. Cobb, 42, a Long Island civil rights figure, was convicted last year in the theft of $27,500 from the Second Baptist Church in Rockville Centre. Sentence was waived in favor of probation, but now he is wanted in the U.S. for probation violation. He was to appear be- fore the Suffolk County Court Sept. 8, but left for Africa the previous day with his wife and three daughters. The 10-week-old extradition case was re- ferred to the vice president's office for a final ruling. Cobb shocked the court with the admis- sion he had \"tried to organize the poisoning of 50,000 white policemen in New York.\" ROBERT V. FLEMING Mr. FEIGHAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend my remarks. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. FEIGHAN. Mr. Speaker, the Cap- ital and the Nation suffered a severe loss by the passing of Robert V. Fleming, who was a great American. Mr. Fleming dis- tinguished himself in numerous civic and cultural activities which inured not only to the city of Washington, but to the en- tire Nation. Mr. Fleming was possessed of a pleas- ing personality and his geniality en- deared him to all who had the privilege to know him. I join with his many friends in extending to his family my sincere sympathy. Under leave granted, I insert in the RECORD an article from today's Washing- ton Post of Mr. Fleming's dynamic and meteoric career:ROBERT V. FLEMING, BANKER, Civic LEADER, DIES (By John Carmody) Robert V. Fleming, who died yesterday, was the city's best-known banker and for decades, perhaps its most influential public- minded citizen. Mr. Fleming died at his home at 2200 Wyoming ave. nw. after a long illness. He was 77. In a career once described as \"the kind that Horatio Alger would have loved, al- though he might have hesitated to write.\" Mr. Fleming rose from messenger in the Riggs National Bank in 1907 to its presidency in 1925 at the age of 35. Since he stepped down as board chairman in 1963, he has served as advisory chairman of the board and chairman of the executive and trust and investment committees of Riggs. In the 42 years Mr. Fleming was at the helm of the bank its resources climbed from about $40 million to $786.5 million. His brilliance In the profession led to his election in 1935 as president of the American Bankers Association. Over the years he had offers to head banks In Chicago and New York much larger than Riggs. RAN THIS TOWN But Mr. Fleming preferred to remain in Washington where his roots were. And it was as a private citizen deeply concerned about Washington that he first earned the reputa- tion in the 1930s as the \"man who pretty much ran this town\"-in the words of his long-time friend, Benjamin M. McKelway, editorial chairman of the Evening Star. Mr. Fleming was the first chairman of the Citizens' Advisory Council of the District government, a past president of the Metro- politan Washington Board of Trade and for nearly 22 years, chairman of the board of George Washington University. For many years, Mr. Fleming was widely regarded as the \"man to see\" in Washington about legislation concerning the District and key municipal appointments. In his posi- tion as a leader in banking and on the Board of Trade, Mr. Fleming served as a vital bridge between the business and finan- cial worlds of Washington and the power centers on Capitol Hill and in the White House. For three decades the appearance or ab- sence of the name of Robert Fleming on a committee roster or sponsors' list could mean the difference between success or fail- ure of a civic enterprise. ACCESS TO WHITE HOUSE A Republican who was chairman of Presi- dent Elsenhower's 1957 Inaugural Commit- tee, Mr. Fleming nevertheless enjoyed access to the White House under both Presidents Roosevelt and Truman. He was a close personal friend of Mr. Eisenhower for many years. McKelway recalled yesterday that Mr. Fleming \"wasn't very partisan. Everybody respected him-he was a very wise man. No matter what kind of committee he was on. pretty soon he took charge. And he never undertook any job, no matter how relatively unimportant, that he didn't absolutely carry through.\" In the 1930s Mr. Fleming carried the fight for national representation for the District and subsequently played a key role in re- organization of the local government some 20 years ago. But beyond Mr. Fleming's reputation as a leading banker and citizen was his capacity for warm friendships and helpfulness. A big, pink-faced man who stood 6 feet 10 and weighed in the low 200s, he smoked ten cigars a day and played better than aver- age golf at his favorite course-Burning Tree Country Club-which he headed from 1937 until 1945. He was remembered yesterday by friends as a man who never broke a promise and34165 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 always acted the next morning on the little favor exacted during an evening of con- geniality among friends. LAUDED AS BANKER Yesterday, industry and other leaders joined in mourning his passing. The American Banking Association in New York called Mr. Fleming \"a banking states- man of the first rank ...For his leadership and counsel during six decades of distin- guished public and professional achievement, the banking (and) American community will remain in grateful debt.\" Melville Bell Grosvenor, chairman of the board of the National Geographic Society said that in the death of Mr. Fleming \"the country, this city and the National Geo- graphic Society have suffered a sad and griev- ous blow.\" Mr. Fleming was elected a trustee of the Society in 1929 and at the time of his death was also serving as vice president and treasurer. Robert K. Koontz Jr., president of the D.C. Bankers Association, said: \"The banking fra- ternity of the District of Columbia will sorely miss the wise counsel and guidance of Mr. Fleming as will the entire community. \"His astute knowledge of the intricacies of modern financial techniques played a most important role in the development and growth of private enterprise in the Federal City.\" BORN IN WASHINGTON Mr. Fleming was born here Nov. 3, 1890, the son of Col. Robert Isaac and Bell Vedder Fleming. His father, a widely known archi- tect, served as a Confederate Army officer during the Civil War and was later a colonel in the D.C. National Guard. The younger Fleming attended Friends School and Western High School and later specialized in political economics and commercial law at George Washington Uni- versity. In 1912 he married Alice Listen Wright, youngest daughter of Daniel Thew Wright, a former Justice of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. Mrs. Fleming died in February, 1958, while visiting Santiago, Chile, with Mr. Fleming. As a boy, he considered becoming a surgeon but the death of his father when he was 17 caused Mr. Fleming to join Riggs as a mes- senger. Within six months he was promoted to runner. By 1920 he had become cashier and secre- tary of the board at Riggs; in 1924 he became vice president and cashier. He was promoted to first vice president that same year and to president in 1925. Ten years later he be- came board chairman. Riggs today is the largest bank in the Washington area. During his early years in the bank, Mr. Fleming had established a system to settle Clearing House balances in the District whereby cash payments between banks were eliminated and telegraph transfers substi- tuted, using reserve accounts at the Rich- mond branch of the Federal Reserve. This system was later adopted all over the Nation. HEADED BANKING GROUP Mr. Fleming was appointed to the Ameri- can Bankers Association Legislative Commit- tee in the early 1930s and was instrumental in adjusting conservative financial practices to reforms under President Roosevelt's Administration. On becoming president of the ABA in 1935, he toured the Nation to urge better relations between bankers and the general public that was still recovering from the bank holiday of 1933. Over the years as an adviser to several Administrations, Mr. Fleming served on the Federal Advisory Council of the Federal Re- serve System, the advisory committee of the Reconstruction Finance Corp.'s Richmond loan agency and as a member of the Federal Housing Administration's Housing Advisory Council.In addition to his service for the National Geographic Society and George Washington University, he was a member of more than 50 charitable, banking and civic organiza- tions during his lifetime. Mr. Fleming was a member of the Board of Regents and chairman of the executive committee of the Smithsonian Institution and served for many years on the boards of the Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co., the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., Pan Ameri- can World Airways, the Potomac Electric Power Co., the Southern Railway, Julius Gar- flnckel & Co. and the Hotel Waldorf-Astoria Corp. u.s. CHAMBER OFFICIAL Mr. Fleming also served as treasurer of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States and chairman of the board of trustees of the endowment fund of the American Red Cross. He was a member of the Alfalfa Club, the Burning Tree Country Club, the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick of the city of Washington, Chevy Chase Club, the Metropolitan Club, the National Press Club, Rotary (honorary), the Brook Club of New York and Omicron Delta Kappa and Kappa Alpha social fraternities. Mr. Fleming saw service in both World Wars with the Office of Naval Intelligence and was a retired member of the US. Naval Reserve at his death. Mr. Fleming leaves a son, Robert W. Flem- ing, partner in the investment banking firm of Folger, Nolan, Fleming & Co. Inc. here; a daughter, Mrs. William S. Renchard, of New York: six grandchildren and four great grandchildren. Funeral services are scheduled for 2 p.m. Thursday at St. Margaret's Episcopal Church, 1820 Connecticut ave. nw. Burial will be private. The family has asked that in lieu of flowers expressions of sympathy be made to the George Washington University Robert V. Fleming Memorial Fund. HONORS ABOUND FOR NO. 1 CITIZEN Among the many citations and honors that have reinforced Mr. Fleming's reputation as the city's No. 1 citizen over the years: A Cosmopolitan Club medal in 1933; the Society of Natives Award in 1937; the Dis- trict American Legion's citation for citizen- ship in 1938; an honorary degree from George Washington University in 1939; a citation from the District Commissioners for his role as first Advisory Council Chairman in 1953; the Washington Board of Trade selection as the \"Man of the Year\" in 1956. And in 1964, the Riggs National Bank's new 12-story building was named the Fleming Building. CONCERN REGARDING WATER AND SEWER ASSISTANCE PRO- GRAM IN MICHIGAN Mr. CHAMBERLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to address the House for 1 minute, to revise and extend my remarks, and to include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. CHAMBERLAIN. Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, on November 7, 1967, 13 members of the Michigan congres- sional delegation, myself included, joined in addressing a letter to the Secretary of Agriculture expressing our deep concern about the operation of the Farmers Home Administration's water and sewer assist- ance program in our State. To date we have not received either an acknowledg- ment of or reply to our inquiry fromSecretary Freeman. Regrettably this isall too illustrative of the unresponsive way in which many Michigan communi- ties have been treated under this pro- gram. They have been led down a prim- rose path by the practice of FHA officials of soliciting and approving more projects than can be funded. What is more, the Farmers Home Administration has, in the view of the Michigan State Depart- ment of Public Health, insisted on the acceptance of substandard engineering designs. It was the clear intent of Congress in setting up this program to encourage and promote the orderly development of water and sewer facilities in communi- ties with populations of 5,500 or less. However, there is all too much evidence suggesting that the very opposite is the case in too many areas in Michigan; and I am advised that other States are having similar problems. Consequently, today, together with other members of the Michigan delega- tion, I am joining in sponsoring a com- panion bill to one being introduced in the other body by Senator ROBERT P. GRIFFIN, of Michigan, which would amend section 306 of the Consolidated Farmers Home Administration Act of 1961, as amended, to require water sup- ply and waste disposal systems con- structed in any State with funds under such section to comply with health and safety standards prescribed by the ap- propriate agency of such State. Mr. Speaker, in view of the fact that it has ever been the argument for Federal standards in any field of endeavor that they are needed to improve conditions throughout the 50 States, it is appalling to find a Federal agency asking our hard- pressed communities who are trying to do their part to fight water pollution, to accept substandard facilities. Here again we have a situation that bears the all too familiar ring of the extravagant prom- ises of Federal aid on the one hand, the hard reality of bureaucratic redtape and inflexibility on the other. Hopefully, the proposal contained in this bill, as well as the overall operation of this program, will be given early and careful scrutiny by the House Agriculture Committee, if not in the remaining days of this session, then as soon as possible in the next. Mr. Speaker, I include a copy of the letter of November 7, 1967, to Secretary Freeman, together with a copy of the bill introduced today, at this point in the RECORD: CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, Washington, D.C., November 7, 1967. Hon. ORVILLE L. FREEMAN, Secretary of Agriculture, Washington, D.C. MY DEAR MR. SECRETARY: A matter of deep concern has come to our attention relating to the implementation in Michigan of the Farmers Home Administration's water and sewage assistance program for communities and districts of 5,500 population and under. As you are aware, Section 3 of the au- thorizing legislation, Public Law 89-240, states in its pertinent part, that no grant shall be made unless the Secretary of Agri- culture determines that a project: \"(ii) is designed and constructed so that adequate capacity will be or can be made available to serve the present population of the area to the extent feasible and to serve34166 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE the reasonably foreseeable growth needs of the area, or (ii) is neecssary for orderly community development consistent with a comprehensive community water or sewer de- velopment plan of the rural area and not in- consistent with any planned development under State, county, or municipal plans ap- proved as official plans by competent au- thority for the area in which the rural com- munity is located.\" The Department of Public Health of the State of Michigan has in recent months re- peatedly expressed its dissatisfaction to the FHA over the administration of several aspects of this program. These include not only the practice of soliciting and approving more projects than can be funded but also questionable regulations covering bond ar- rangements and standards of engineering design as well. In a letter to FHA Adminis- trator Howard Bertsch dated July 6, 1967, John F. Vogt, Chief, Division of Engineering, Michigan Department of Public Health con- cluded: \"Once again we would urge that the Farm- ers Home Administration critically review its standards of engineering design for both water supply and sewerage systems with a goal of bringing them into conformity with commonly accepted good engineering prac- tice and latitude for exercising professional engineering judgment. Consideration should be given to seeking advice from state health departments, engineers in private practice and others and include representation from various areas in the country. Further we would strongly urge that practices and pro- cedures be discontinued which tend to dis- courage local initiative.\" A similar view has also been expressed in a resolution adopted March 31, 1967, by the Great Lakes-Upper Mississippi River Board of State Sanitary Engineers, copy of which is enclosed. It is apparent from the authorizing legis- lation cited above that the intent of Congress with regard to this program was to facilitate rather than frustrate and complicate the or- derly development of water and sewer facil- ities. It is equally clear that the criticisms here expressed reach to questions consider- ably more fundamental than simply the matter of the availability of Federal money. Consequently, we the undersigned members of the Michigan Congressional Delegation strongly urge that you give this matter your earliest and most careful review. Further, we request a full report on FHA's water and sewage program in Michigan, including the number and current status of each applica- tion received to date and indicating where problems have been encountered concerning Federal and State engineering standards. Sincerely yours, ROBERT P. GRIFFIN, U.S. Senator; WIL- LIAM S. BROOMFIELD, 10th CHARLES E. CHAMBERLAIN, Sixth Dis- trict; MARVIN L. ESCH, Second District; GERALD R. FORD, Fifth District; JAMES HARVEY, Eighth District; EDWARD HUTCHINSON, Fourth District; JACK H. MCDONALD, 19th District; DON- ALD W. RIEGLE, Jr., Seventh District; PHILIP E. RUPPE, 11th District: GUY VANDER JAGT, Ninth District, Members of Congress. GREAT LAKES-UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER BOARD OF STATE SANITARY ENGINEERS, RESOLUTION REGARDING WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SYSTEMS Whereas, the Farmers Home Administra- tion, U.S. Department of Agriculture, under Federal act is authorized and does make financial assistance grants to communities and districts of 5,500 population and under for the construction of water supply and sewerage systems, and Whereas, The construction plans and spec-ifications for the systems are reviewed and must be approved by the FHA, and Whereas, The basis of design used by the FHA for the review and approval of engineer- ing plans for the systems are very low with respect to such items as pipe sizes, fire pro- tection and materials for construction, and Whereas, The systems under consideration are public systems which come under the supervision of state departments of health, and Whereas, The low standards of design of PHA which are different from those of the state departments of health has caused con- fusion and can and does result in the con- struction of substandard water and sewerage systems, and tend to compromise the health and fire protection afforded the people served. Now, therefore, be it resolved, That the Great Lakes-Upper Mississippi River Board Meeting in annual conference in Chicago on March 30 and 31, 1967, requests that the FHA immediately review its standards of engi- neering design and that they be made to conform with good engineering practice and further that in each state, the standards of design be in conformity with those of the respective state departments of health, and Be it further resolved, That copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Secretary of Agriculture, the Administrator of the Farmers Home Administration, and the Di- rector of the Bureau of the Budget. Adopted March 31, 1967. H.R. 14203 A bill to amend section 306 of the Consoli- dated Farmers Home Administration Act of 1961, as amended, to require water sup- ply and waste disposal systems con- structed in any State with funds under such section to comply with health and safety standards prescribed by the appro- priate agency of such State Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That sec- tion 306 of the Consolidated Farmers Home Administration Act of 1961, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1926), is amended by adding at the end thereof a new subsection as follows: \"(d) No loan shall be made or insured under this section and no grant shall be made under this section for the construc- tion of any public water supply or waste disposal system in any State unless the pro- posed system has been submitted to the ap- propriate State agency and such agency has determined and certified to the Secretary that such proposed system complies with the standards for health and safety pre- scribed by such agency for the type of fa- cility to be constructed.\" AMERICAN ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE OF SOUTH VIETNAM Mr. GIBBONS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to extend my re- marks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. GIBBONS. Mr. Speaker, the de- bate over American assistance to the people of South Vietnam continues. One of the claims most often made by those who would reverse our present policy is that our efforts in Vietnam not only lack support in the rest of the world, but are in fact isolating us within it. Quotations from Europe and Africa are offered as proof of this disapproval. But what of the Asians? Mr. RobertS. Elegant, head of the Los Angeles Times bureau in Hong Kong, has rightly pointed out that when Asians contem- plate the war in Vietnam, \"they are not considering abstractions, but their own survival.\" To the many people safely here in America, the Vietnam war has become a fashionable \"whipping boy\"- to the Asian nations on the periphery of China, it is a hard reality. That is why, as Mr. Elegant demonstrates, \"with the somewhat equivocal exception of Cam- bodia, all those nations support the American presence either openly or tacitly-and a number have contributed armed units to the war.\" This is not sur- prising, when one considers that, as Mr. Elegant also points out: \"Almost with- out exception, the Asian countries acknowledge their fear of Communist Chinese ambitions, and almost all have had brushes with China.\" I urge all those who have heard that we are alone in the war, or that the danger of Chinese Communist expan- sionism is some sort of new ploy cooked up last month by the U.S. State Depart- ment, to read Mr. Elegant's article, and, most especially, the remarks of the leaders of Asia which are cited in it. Mr. Elegant's excellent article from the November 19, 1967, issue of the Los An- geles Times follows: CRUCIAL ARC OF COUNTRIES ON PERIPHERY OF CHINA FAVOR UNITED STATES IN SOUTH VIETNAM (By Robert E. Elegant) HONG KONG.-Masochism is a \"perversion in which a sufferer derives pleasure from pain or humiliation.\" There are certainly elements of masochism in the invariably spirited and often surprising violent attitudes and be- havior of those Americans who totally reject the country's role in South Vietnam. In feeding their apparent passion for glee- ful suffering, they assert that the United States has become isolated by its interven- tion in Vietnam. Since most foreign coun- tries condemn our actions, they argue, our moral stature has declined radically. The peace movement is by and large right about the countries of Western Europe. Most display no enthusiasm for the American pres- ence in South Vietnam, in good part because they fear, as the late Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of West Germany often observed, that Washington is being diverted by the side issue in Southeast Asia from the main issue in Europe. Most of Western Europe dis- approves of the American involvement in Southeast Asia because the two quarters of the globe are so far apart that Europeans feel their fate is not involved in Vietnam. Even the veteran observer of Asian affairs, however, is surprised when he surveys the attitudes of the arc of non-Communist coun- tries on the periphery of Communist China from South Korea in the northeast to Burma and, even, India in the southwest. With the somewhat equivocal exception of Cambodia, all those nations support the American pres- ence either openly or tacitly-and a number have contributed armed units to the war. When one recalls the vehement domestic reaction to the recent Administration con- tention that a chief purpose of the action in Vietnam is the containment of Com- munist China, astonishment grows. Almost without exception, the Asian countries ac- knowledge their fear of Communist Chinese ambitions, and almost all have had brushes with China. Their implicit assumption- often stated-is that South Vietnam is, as Peking itself has avowed, a testing ground for the Maoist doctrine of \"world liberation through peoples war.\" They see Peking,34167 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 rather than Hanoi, as the chief danger, and they feel the danger threatens them directly. ASIA'S SURVIVAL AT STAKE The Asian viewpoint certainly deserves a hearing-precisely because they are so closely involved and because they are not consider- ing abstractions, but their own survival. A quick tour around the arc of Asia may clarify the positions of the different countries involved: South Korea, itself preserved from Com- munist ingestion by an earlier American in- tervention approves so whole-heartedly of the war that it has contributed 56,650 of its own troops. It has two full infantry divisions, and marine brigade, and an engineer battalion in Vietnam, in addition to support troops and a hospital unit. Their military repre- sentation is .2% of their population, while the U.S. forces represent .23% of the Ameri- can population. The Japanese government is debarred from direct support by its active pressure groups, and by hard memories elsewhere of the im- perial Japanese attempt to conquer all Asia. Nonetheless, Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato has just completed a tour of major Asian capitals which was, quite deliberately, most helpful to the American position. Be- sides lending his implicit support to the new South Vietnamese government by stopping in Saigon, Sato stressed time and time again that it would \"not be productive\" of peace for the United States to suspend the bomb- ing of the North without obtaining reciprocal concessions from Hanoi. The Nationalist Chinese Government on Formosa has not been invited to send troops to South Vietnam, since no responsible non- Communist leader wishes to extend the Chinese civil war to Vietnam. That govern- ment, which claims to rule all China, is of course violently anti-Communist and totally supports the war. In addition to verbal sup- port, Formosa has sent pilots and technical advisers to South Vietnam. The Philippines has 2,100 soldiers in South Vietnam, largely engineers and their integral security forces. The Filipinos have also pro- vided a large measure of medical and other humanitarian assistance over the years. Thailand, itself disturbed by Communist insurrection, provides bases for American bombers attacking targets in both South and North Vietnam, as well as the bombers striking infiltration routes through Laos. Besides providing a major naval base at Sattahip, the Thais have 2,500 military per- sonnel In South Vietnam. SANCTIONS AMERICAN BOMBING Last week, Thailand announced it will in- crease Its combat contingent In Vietnam to a full division, about 10,000 to 12,000 men. Laos, under its formerly neutralist Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma, sanctions American bombing of Viet Cong supply routes through the long panhandle of that country. Laotian air and ground forces assist in harassing the Ho Chi Minh trail. Souvanna, who has just visited the United States, ob- served early in the conflict: \"When the United States took its decision to take a more active role in the war, China decided that the U.S. was not a paper tiger, but a real tiger!\" Noting that North Vietnam maintains 40,000 regular troops in Laos, Souvanna last week opposed a bombing pause. \"If there is a halt in the bombing, it could aggravate the military situation for Vietnam as well as Laos ... At present one does not know exactly what is happening. Therefore in the face of this unknown quantity, we are very skeptical.\" Souvanna then summed up the broader implications of the war: \"Should South Viet- nam become Communist-that is to say, should all Vietnam become Communist-it would be difficult for Loas to exist. The same goes for Cambodia and other countries.\" The Malaysian government, having en-dured Its own war against Communist guer- rillas, is highly sympathetic to the American effort and has contributed advisers on anti- guerrilla strategy as well as training South Vietnam police in Malaysia. The Malaysian Prime Minister, Tengku Abdul Rahman, who says flatly that he is \"no neutral in this struggle,\" commented earlier this year: \"My own country's experience with Communist guerrillas shows that the Vietnam war must be fought to the finish. The Communists will never make peace ...When we fought the Communists, we used every weapon to defeat them. We bombed the jungle to destroy their hiding places.\" Lee Kwan Yew, himself an overseas Chinese and the highly talented prime minister of the small nation of Singapore, has also supported the American involvement, though he has reserved the right to criticize aspects of American strategy. He is also providing rest and recreation facilities in Singapore for American troops on leave from South Viet- nam. PAYING ENORMOUS PRICE \"If the big powers stop competing with each other,\" Lee said earlier this year, \"the under-developed countries of Southeast Asia could remain under-developed till the end of time. Thus, all the region can thank Communist China for first threatening the area and the United States for responding to the threat. At the moment, the United States is paying an enormous price to main- tain its position in South Vietnam and is therefore willing to bolster the free nations surrounding the conflict.\" During his visit to the United States in October. Lee Kwan Yew amplified his posi- tion. He said in an interview in Los Angeles that he did not believe the people of South Vietnam would choose communism in a free election. He advised the United States to continue its efforts in Vietnam with \"resolu- tion, stamina, perseverance, and, most im- portant of all, infinite patience.\" In private discussions he stressed that the will to resist communism would be destroyed in Asia if the United States pulled out of Vietnam. Australia and New Zealand, Asian nations geographically if not ethnically, have both provided troops. The Australians have 6,000 men In South Vietnam-two infantry batta- lions, an engineer battalion, an artillery bat- talion, a squadron of B-57s, and the destroy- er Mobart. New Zealand has sent 400 artil- lerymen. Both countries also provide tech- nical assistance and civilian advisers. Two Asian nations whose positions are not clearcut are Indonesia and Burma. However, senior Indonesian officials in private conversations with diplomats and correspondents have expressed their convic- tion that a continuing American presence is essential to their interests. Some senior officials feel that their own repression of the Peking-directed Partal Komunis Indonesia would not have been successful if the United States had not stood firm In South Vietnam. The general Indonesian attitude was, per- haps, best summed up by an Indonesian diplomat of the anti-American Sukarno re- gime in Saigon some years ago. After the obligatory formal denunciation of American policy, he told me: \"The nearest islands of Indonesia are not more than 250 miles from the top of South Vietnam. For God's sake don't abandon the Vietnamese.\" Burma's attitude is shrouded in self-im- posed obscurity and isolation. Nonetheless, as was reported in The Times recently, Prime Minister Sato of Japan was told by Ne Win in Rangoon that the Burmese hoped the United States would win in South Viet- nam and thus block further Chinese Com- munist subversion against China's Asian neighbors. U.S. INTERVENTION DEPLORED Finally, India officially deplores the Ameri- can intervention. But Indian officials and in-tellectuals, smarting from their own brusheswith the Maoists, privately note that the United States is buying time for all Asiansby its resistance to the Viet Cong-and theViet Cong's sponsors in Hanoi and Peking.The remarkable thing is not New Delhi's reluctance to make an official statement insupport of the American intervention in Viet-nam, since such a statement could do Indiano conceivable good and might result in diplomatic embarrassment. The remarkable thing is their candor in private. Prince Norodom Sihanouk, chief of state of Cambodia, is, with complete justification, seeking to advance his country's interests. It appears to him that he can best keep Cambodia independent by maintaining amicable relations with both the Hanoi regime and the National Liberation Front,the Viet Cong's political facade. He may or may not be correct. Nonetheless, Sihanouk himself wrote in 1965: \"Last month I wrote in the monthly review Kambuja: I have never had the slightest illusion on the fate that awaits me at the hands of the Communists, as well as that which is reserved for my government, after having removed from our region the in- fluence, and especially the presence, of the 'free world,' and the U.S.A. in particular. SHARES ASIAN FEARS \"In an editorial which will appear shortly in this same review, I concede again that after the disappearance of the U.S.A. from our region and the victory of the Communist camp, I myself and the Peoples Socialist Community that I have created would in- evitably disappear from the scene.\" It is apparent that Sihanouk shares the Asian apprehension of the Asian \"Communist camp,\" inspired and sustained by Peking. Only recently, he denounced Chinese inter- vention in Cambodia's internal affairs and threatened to break off diplomatic relations with Peking. The persistent American masochists may, of course, reject the nearly unanimous Asian attitude because the countries concerned support the American involvement in one way or another and because their govern- ments are, obviously, not completely repre- sentative of their entire populations. No illogical excess on the part of the obsessed anti-Vietnam forces can any longer surprise- even to the extent of Groucho Marx' observa- tion that he would not join any club whose standards were so low that it would accept him as a member. It may, however, be difficult for anyone less doctrinaire to reject the evidence of the nations most closely concerned with the Maoist movement in Asia. DMSO: STILL THE PERSECUTED DRUG-PART I Mr. WYMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. WYATT] may extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Hampshire? There was no objection. Mr. WYATT. Mr. Speaker, previously I explained how thousands of people in this country are needlessly suffering be- cause of the Food and Drug Administra- tion's arbitrary holdup on clinical test- ing of the drug DMSO. This holdup is pure futile arrogance on the part of a Government agency that is supposed to hold the good of the people as its trust. DMSO has not been rejected as harmful. If that were the case then there would be no problem. Rather the34168 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE FDA has chosen to reject over 2 years of intensive clinical testing in this country prior to the ban. It has, further, rejected out of hand the research done on DMSO in foreign countries-research which has resulted in DMSO becoming a commer- cial prescription drug in Germany and Austria. It has been said by authoritative medi- cal experts that if aspirin or penicillin had been treated in the manner in which the FDA has treated DMSO neither would be available to the public today. Dr. Stanley Jacob, of the University of Oregon Medical School, a codiscoverer of the therapeutic properties of DMSO, has kept careful and accurate records of all studies, both here and abroad, con- ducted with DMSO. In not one case has there been any serious adverse effect on man. In thou- sands of documented clinical cases suffer- ing has been alleviated, pain reduced, and symptoms have disappeared after treatment with DMSO, but in not one case has a serious side effect caused by DMSO been discovered. The material that follows includes a summary of the properties of DMSO by Dr. Jacob, a letter to me from the doctor, and a clipping from a recent New York Times concerning the beneficial effects of DMSO, even when not used as a drug alone: [From the New York Times, Nov. 5, 1967] SOLVENT IS USED To AID NUTRITION-DOCTORS SAY DMSO HELPED DELAY PATIENT'S DEATH SAN ANTONIO, TEX., November 4.-Dimethyl sulfoxide can be used to transport nutrients through the skin Into the body, a team of physicians at Wilford Hall Air Force Hospital have found. The Air Force doctors reported on a seven- week use of DMSO in mid-1965 on a 7-year- old boy who was dying of malnutrition in the hospital. DMSO Is a commercial solvent derived from wood. It has been much discussed because of its ability to carry other compounds with it as it penetrates human skin. It has been placed under rigid testing restrictions by the Federal Food and Drug Administration because of eye disorders reported in test ani- mals. In their report the doctors-Lieut. Col. Robert E. Smith and Capts. Andrew M. Hegre Jr. and Clement N. Reiffel Jr.-said the boy's small bowel had been removed in emergency surgery at another hospital. They said he was treated with intravenous feeding at Wil- ford Hall but he continued to lose weight and his condition progressively deteriorated. The physicians said they first tried apply- ing a mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide and glucose to his skin. Then, to increase calories supplied, they applied a mixture of DMSO, glucose, fat, protein and vitamins. The re- port said the boy's gain of weight and chemi- cal analyses of feeding effects \"left little doubt that the nutrients crossed through the skin barrier in usable form.\" Fluid replacement through the skin, how- ever, was inadequate, the report added. The doctors said the patient received 3,000 milliliters (a little over three quarts) of 100 per cent DMSO over the seven-week period \"without evidence of toxicity.\" Despite efforts to save him, the boy died of acute bronchopneumonia, the report said. \"Neither the patient's course nor the autopsy findings indicated that DMSO played any role in the patient's demise,\" the report said. \"The authors believe that without the sup- plemental feedings this patient would have died sooner, although it cannot be proved.\" The report concluded that \"supplementalfeeding through the skin with DMSO does seem to be possible in patients similar to the one reported.\" Representative WENDELL WYATT, Washington, D.C. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE WYATT: It is now two years since the U.S. FDA halted scientific studies on DMSO In the U.S. Fortunately for mankind, studies were not halted overseas and continued on an accelerated scale in Germany and Austria. Dimethyl Sulfoxide Is now a prescription drug in these two coun- tries and is well received by the medical profession. It should be noted that three American pharmaceutical firms-Merck, Sharp & Dohme, Syntex and Squibb sub- mitted data to our FDA in the spring of 1965 stating that DMSO was ready to be a pre- scription drug in the U.S. The real reason behind the FDA cessation of DMSO testing on November 10, 1965 is known only to them. Among the reasons given by the FDA was the fact that lower animals on large dosages developed destruc- tive changes in the lens of the eye. Before FDA halted studies, over 25,000 pa- tients in the U.S. who were receiving DMSO were evaluated. No serious toxicity occurred. Since FDA stopped scientific investiga- tion, a select group of 287 patients have been carefully studied before, during and after DMSO treatment. The additional evaluations included exhaustive studies of the human eye. 240 of these patients were checked in Germany and Austria. 47 of these patients have been studied at the Cleveland Clinic. Not a single patient who has been examined has shown the change which occurs in lower animals on large dosages. At the time FDA halted studies on DMSO there was no evi- dence for serious toxicity in man. There is still no evidence for serious toxicity. If DMSO were merely another drug used for the treatment of diseases for which we already have treatment I would not be writ- ing this letter, but DMSO is of value in the treatment of untreatable entities such as scleroderma and intractable pain problems. DMSO has shown potential value in cancer, stroke and heart disease as described in the New York Academy of Sciences Symposium on the Biological Actions of Dimethyl Sul- foxide, Article 1, Volume 141, 1967. In the two years since FDA halted scientific testing on DMSO they have thrown roadblock after roadblock at investigations of this compound. Patients and physicians alike during the last two years have written to the FDA and to Congress to protest the situation. The standard reply from FDA is that they will permit a given patient to be treated by a physician who has to apply to the Interested pharmaceutical firm which will then make the drug available. In actual fact this is an attempt by FDA to shift responsibility from themselves. Despite persistent pleas from suffering patients an infinitesimal number of people throughout the U.S. have been able to obtain DMSO. The FDA has created a climate which to date has made it impossible for the inter- ested pharmaceutical firms to reinstitute studies. The FDA created this climate by sending their inspectors on a massive witch hunt throughout the U.S. following cessa- tion of testing. These inspectors harassed investigators and the drug firms alike who had evaluated DMSO. FDA threatened \"crim- inal prosecutions\". There may have been minor infractions of procedure as is true in all experimental drug evaluation but after two years of harassment and investigation the FDA in spite of its threats has dropped possible \"criminal prosecutions\" against in- vestigators and pharmaceutical firms. I have recently written a review article on the current status of DMSO. It is published in September American Journal of Surgery. It is enclosed for your interest. Over 500 re- lated articles have appeared in the worldscientific literature since the first report on the use of DMSO as a drug was published in 1964. No impartial scientific group could look at these data without the conclusions of safety, efficacy and immense potential. Unfortunately, FDA remains more inter- ested in defending a position than in the public welfare. Millions of Americans are suf- fering needlessly. Sincerely yours, STANLEY W. JACOB, M.D. [From the Department of Surgery, Univer- sity of Oregon Medical School, and the De- partment Research, Providence Hospital, Portland, Oreg.] DIMETHYL SULFOXIDE (DMSO)-TOXICOLOGY, PHARMACOLOGY, AND CLINICAL EXPERIENCE (By Stanley W. Jacob, M.D. and Don C. Wood, Ph. D., Portland, Oreg.) No drug of modern times has excited the interest or stirred as much controversy as dimethyl sulfoxide. Since the appearance of the first reports in 1964 [1,2] more than 500 related articles have been published or are in press in the world's literature. Clinical studies on dimethyl sulfoxide com- menced In the United States in October 1963. In 1964 six American pharmaceutical firms, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Syntex, Squibb, Schering, Geigy, and American Home Prod- ucts, began clinical investigations. A Euro- pean symposium on DMSO was held in Ber- lin in July 1965. On November 11, 1965, clinical testing was halted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In March 1966, a second international conference on the Bio- logical Actions of DMSO was sponsored by the New York Academy of Sciences. In No- vember 1966, a third international confer- ence on DMSO was held in Vienna, Austria, under the auspices of the University of Vienna. A partial resumption of clinical test- ing was permitted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on December 23, 1966. This paper will attempt to summarize the current status under five categories: (1) ani- mal toxicology, (2) side effects In man, (3) fate and metabolism, (4) primary pharma- cology, and (5) clinical experience. ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY A review of the toxicology of dimethyl sulfoxide has been recently published mucous membrane [3], and into the urinary bladder [9]. The following species have been studied: mouse and rat [I0], guinea pig [7], The longest period of follow-up study in ani- mal experiments is twenty months [3]. The question of toxicity in the lens of the eye in experimental animals has received the greatest attention. Administration of large doses of DMSO to dogs, rabbits, and pigs, particularly by the oral route, results in a change in refractive index of the lens with progressive myopia in the lens nucleus and an increasing hyperopla in the lens cortex. From serial biomicroscopic studies, Wood et al. [8] described the progressive develop- ment of \"lines of discontinuity\" after DMSO treatment in rabbits. Chemical analyses of these lenses revealed a reduction in the usual lens concentration of soluble proteins, urea, glutathione, and uric and amino acids. The albuminoid fraction of the lens was in- creased in the treated animal. A variation by species of DMSO has been observed. In monkeys treated with 5 gm./kg. orally for a hundred days these changes in the lens failed to develop [13]. In another study no lenticular changes resulted after topical administration of DMSO for six months to rhesus monkeys at a dosage of 11 gm./kg./day [14]. In addition to a variation by species of the lenticular change, there appears to be a34169 34170 CC dosage effect as well. In dogs treated orally with 1 gm./kg./day of DMSO, as a 25 to 50 per cent solution, lenticular change did not develop after one year [14]. Rats failed to show lens alterations when treated orally for one year with 1 gm./kg. [14]. Pigs did not have changes in the lens after 1.5 gm./ kg. of DMSO was applied topically for Rabbits did not dem- onstrate retinoscopic, biomicroscopic, or chemical changes when treated with topical DMSO at 0.1 to 0.5 gm./kg./day for twelve weeks. However, a topical dosage of 1 gm./ kg. produced a very slight \"line of discon- tinuity\" in the rabbit. This could be de- tected only with the blomlcroscope and was not reflected by retinoscopic or chemical change [15]. The average topical human dosage is 0.1 to 0.2 gm./kg./day. The reversibility of this lesion of the lens has been incompletely evaluated. In pigs changes in the lens will develop after 2.7 to 4.5 gm./kg. of DMSO is topically adminis- tered for twenty-seven weeks. Two months after cessation of DMSO therapy, the lens alterations have regressed [14]. Kleberger [16], on the other hand, has treated dogs with 5 gm./kg. orally and demonstrated that eight months after cessation of the therapy, the lesion was still present. Uramura and Kenkyu [10] reported the exposure of two groups of rabbits to DMSO in mist form. The animals inhaled either 25 or 50 ml./hr. one hour per day with a two week resting period after the fifth week, followed by three additional weeks of treat- ment and a two week rest period. The ani- mals were observed for five months. The rab- bits inhaling 50 ml. of DMSO showed symp- toms of chemical pneumonia plus hepatic and renal toxicity. The rabbits inhaling 25 ml. of DMSO had cloudy swelling and fatty infiltration in the liver and some round cell pulmonary infiltration. The authors con- cluded that \"to inhale DMSO in large amounts\" is dangerous. In the study by Willson, Brown, and Tim- mens [6], dogs were given 1.2 gm./kg. in- travenously per day for twenty-four days. A reversible hemolytic anemia was noted in dogs receiving repeated intravenous injec- tions of DMSO. The authors concluded, how- ever, that DMSO seemed to have a relatively low order of systemic toxicity. The question of teratogenicity always has to be considered with any drug. Ferm [17] in- jected 0.5 ml. of DMSO intraperitoneally into hamsters on the eighth day of gestation and reported varying degrees of exencephaly and anencephaly. Caujolle and co-workers [18] gave DMSO orally in 50 per cent concen- tration at a level of 5 gm./kg./day to male and female rats for four days prior to mating. Fertility was judged to be normal. The pregnant females were then given DMSO throughout the gestational period. All litters were regarded as normal and the young rats developed in a normal fashion. Wood [15] re- ported that rabbits receiving DMSO orally in a dose of 10 gm./kg./day were successfully bred and had litters of normal size. The prog- eny of such treated female rabbits showed neither gross nor microscopic pathologic dis- turbance. Among the miscellaneous data relating to toxicology of DMSO, is an article by Greiff and Myers [19] showing that mitochondria exposed to 30 per cent glycerol were inac- tivated. Suspensions exposed to 30 per cent dimethyl sulfoxide retained their capacity for oxidative phosphorylation, but at a great- ly reduced level. The study indicated that DMSO was less toxic to mitochondria than glycerol. Monder and Takayanagi [20] dem- onstrated that nuclei of liver cells of the rat could be isolated in high yield with ap- parently satisfactory morphology in DMSO. The nuclei thus isolated were able to incor- porate glycine C\" more rapidly than those obtained Rammler [21] showed that enzymatic ac-)NGRESSIONAL at least three enzymes could essen- tially be completely recovered after incuba- tion in 40 to 60 per cent DMSO for varying periods of time at 37\u00b0 c. One enzyme, alka- line phosphomonoesterase, was 98 per cent inhibited in 60 per cent DMSO. Ninety per cent of its initial activity could be restored by dialysis. Schrek, Elrod, and Batra [22] studied the leukemic bating suspensions at 37\u00b0 c. with and with- out 2 per cent DMSO. Viability was judged by the morphologic integrity of the cells. Two per cent DMSO was not toxic to normal lymphocytes during the first two days of in- cubation; however, a cytocidal effect was observed on the third day and increased to 32 per cent on the seventh day. Leukemic lymphocytes exhibited an appreciable cytoci- dal effect when incubated with DMSO after one day and an average effect of 90 per cent after seven days. Peterson and Robertson [23] in an excel- lent pharmacodynamic study found no sig- nificant physiologic changes in dogs treated with single intravenous dosages of DMSO as high as 1 gm./kg. of body weight. Gottlob [24], from experiments performed on the vascular endothelium of the aorta of the rat, demonstrated that intravenous or intra-arterial injection of more than 30 per cent DMSO produced endothelial damage. SIDE EFFECTS IN MAN Few troublesome side effects have been ob- served in man after administration of DMSO. John and Laudahn [25] reported on the side effects of topically applied DMSO in 4,180 patients, some treated for longer than one year. The incidence of local dermatitis was 3.5 per cent; generalized dermatitis, less than 0.1 per cent; and headache and nausea, 1.6 per cent. Patients have been followed up at the Uni- versity of Oregon Medical School by one of us (S.W.J.) with batteries of hematologic and chemical tests, alkaline phosphatase, and prothrombin No sig- nificant abnormalities were demonstrated [3]. In twenty-five patients treated by one of us (S.W.J.) ophthalmologic examinations were performed both before and after treat- ment with DMSO. The longest duration of treatment was twenty-one months. The max- imal dosage per patient was 30 ml. admin- istered topically per day. No toxicity to the eye attributable to dimethyl sulfoxide was seen. Ophthalmologic examinations were com- pleted on patients before and after DMSO therapy. Kutschera [26] studied eighty-four such patients with an average treatment period of two and one-half months and an average daily dosage per patient of 18.5 ml. of 90 per cent DMSO; no toxicity to the eye was observed. Scherbel [27] reviewed results with sixty- one patients with scleroderma treated with DMSO. Forty-seven of these patients had serial ophthalmologic examinations. The longest any of these were treated was two and one-half years; no evidence of toxicity to the eye was noted. Kligman [28, 29] treated human subjects with DMSO administered topically and he observed that: 1. The enchancement of penetration through human skin was not dependent on irreversible damage to the horny layer. 2. Dimethyl sulfoxide possessed potent histamine-liberating properties at the site of application. The circulating basophils de- creased after extensive topical use but re- mained within normal limits. 3. Dimethyl sulfoxide administered topi- cally was mildly antifungal and antibacterial.JSE November 29, 1967 Concentrated solutions reduced the residentmicroflora by 95 per cent. The histamine release effect shown by Kligman [28, 29] developed swiftly and was manifested by a wheal and flare when con- centrations higher than 70 per cent wereapplied in cups or under occlusion. Merely swabbing the skin with 90 per cent dimethyl sulfoxide often caused transient histamine reddening, rarely accompanied by whealing. This response occurred in the first week or two if it was used once or twice daily, anddisappeared thereafter when the mast cell stores of histamine had been depleted. Swabbing of the skin once or twice daily with 90 per cent dimethyl sulfoxide for twenty-one days produced a mild erythe- matous, scaling dermatitis in some subjects This exposure produced mild subclinical and mainly epidermal damage in probably all subjects. The dermatitis, which is ac- companied by only a moderate inflammatory reaction in the dermis, invariably regressed as treatment continued, with the skin even- tually becoming histologically normal. Kligman [28, 29] concluded that none of the cutaneous effects produced by topically administered 90 per cent dimethyl sul- foxide constituted a contraindication to theuse of DMSO in the treatment of musculc- skeletal and connective-tissue disorders. FATE AND METABOLISM The fate and metabolism of DMSO have been studied in the rat, rabbit, dog, andman by Kolb and associates [30]. After cutaneous application, the maximal concen- tration of DMSO in the blood occurs in rats after ten minutes; in dogs and rabbits, after less than one hour; and in man, after four to six hours [30]. Studies of distribution in rats, rabbits, and dogs after single applica- tions as well as applications repeated for several weeks did not reveal any accumula- tion of the labeled compound in organs. The DMSO concentration at the site of treatment and in the underlying muscle was increased. Whole body autoradiography of rats aftercutaneous and oral application of DMSO showed similar findings. The main route of elimination of DMSO is via the urine [30]. Unchanged dimethyl sulfoxide and sulfone have from the urine. Kolb et al. [30] have shown that the excretion rate of DMSO de- pends on the species and the route of admin- istration. In rats there is no significant dif- ference of half time elimination when intra- venous and cutaneous routes are compared (six to eight hours in both). In rabbits the half time for elimination is less than one day irrespective of the route. In dogs half the applied dose was eliminated in one and a half to two days, also independent of the route. In man half of the applied dose was eliminated within fourteen days after cuta- neous application and within eight days after intravenous administration. Dimethyl sul- fide can be identified in expired air by gas chromatography and represents about 3 per cent of the administered dose [30]. PRIMARY PHARMACOLOGY The following primary pharmacologic ac- tions sulfoxide been the (1) (2) nerve blockade (analgesia); (4) bacterlo- stasis; (5) diuresis; (6) enhancement of effectiveness other drugs; (7) chollnes- terase inhibition; (8) collagen solvent; (9) nonspecific enhancement of resistance to in- fection; (10) vasodilation. Membrane Penetration. Dimethyl sulfoxide readily crosses most membranes of the body of the animal without apparently destroying the integrity of these membranes. In its pas- sage it permits a number of other compounds to move along with it. The phenomenon is reversible. DMSO will not rapidly penetrate either the nail or the enamel of the tooth. Studies on the membrane penetration November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE principle have now been carried out in agri- culture, basic biology, animals, and in man. Kell [31] in field tests under relatively severe disease conditions demonstrated that oxy- tetracycline satisfactorily controlled bacterial spotting in peaches. This control was signifi- cantly enhanced by adding DMSO to the anti- biotic spray. DMSO was applied in 0.25 to 0.5 percent with 66 parts per million of oxytetra- cycline. This gave similar control of disease as would have been produced by 132 parts of DMSO per million of oxytetracycline and sug- gested the value of substituting part of the relatively high priced antibiotic with the inexpensive DMSO. Leonard [32] studied different concentra- tions of several water soluble iron sources ap- plied as foliar sprays to orange and grape- fruit trees with leaves showing visible symp- toms of iron deficiency. Each Iron solution was applied with and without dimethyl sulf- oxide. DMSO showed a marked ability to carry iron into citrus leaves. This was demon- strated by a more rapid and more extensive greening of leaves as well as higher concen- tration of chlorophyll in the chlorotic leaves sprayed with or dipped in various iron solu- tions containing DMSO than in those sprayed with the same solutions without DMSO. Amstey and Parkman [33] evaluated the question of whether or not DMSO might in- crease the infectivity of viral nucleic acid. Dimethyl sulfoxide was tested for its ability to enhance cellular infection by polio ribo- nucleic acid (RNA). The experiments re- ported demonstrated that DMSO enhanced polio RNA infectivity for primary mono- layers in kidney cells from African green monkeys. Enhancement was present in all concentrations from 5 to 80 per cent. It was optimal at 40 per cent DMSO with a twenty minute absorption period at room tempera- ture. A significant percentage of nucleic acid infection was absorbed in the first two minutes. Gunberg and Djan [34] studied the per- cutaneous absorption of two steroids dis- solved in dimethyl sulfoxide in the immature female rat. Cortisone acetate and 17 beta- estradiol were administered to Immature female rats. The steroids were given to the animals in an aqueous solution subcuta- neously or were applied topically in DMSO. Vaginal and uterine weight increases result- ing from estrogen stimulation and thymic, splenic, resulting from the exogenous cortisone were compara- ble to results obtained in animals to which the drugs were administered subcutaneously. Franz and Van Bruggen [35] employed the frog skin model to study the influence of DMSO. They demonstrated that DMSO pro- duced a marked change in frog skin insofar as it represented a barrier to diffusion. This effect seemingly involved two different mechanisms. The first appeared to be the re- sult of the application of a hypertonic solu- tion to the outside of the skin. This aspect is not unique to DMSO but can be produced by other agents at equivalent concentrations. The result of hypertonicity is a nonselected increase in the permeability of the skin. The permeability to all molecules studied is increased and if this were the only effect, a tracer species should move across the skin in either direction at the same rate. This would give a flux ratio of 1, as is seen in the normal untreated skin. The second mecha- nism of DMSO action is less clear. Its effect was to increase the rate of movement of molecules across the skin in an inward direc- tion only. This becomes progressively larger as the size of the tracer molecule increases, a greater change being seen with mannitol and sucrose than with urea or thiourea. The resultant is a flux ratio above 1. A flux ratio greater than 1 is sometimes taken as evi- dence for an active transport process. How- ever, it was suggested that the cause of this additional increase in influx was an inter- action between the movement of DMSO CXIII-- 2152-Part 25across the skin and the movement of the tracer species. In other words, the movement of DMSO through the skin in some way in- fluenced the movement of other molecules through the skin. It is this second mecha- nism which may partially explain the uniqueness of DMSO. The more permeable the hypertonic agent, the greater will be the effect. DMSO has a relatively high permea- bility coefficient in frog skin. As a conse- quence of the permeability change there is a decrease in the electrical potential differ- ence which normally exists across the skin. This decrease appears to be due entirely to an increase in chloride conductance across the skin, there being little change in the rate of active sodium transport. The authors con- cluded that there could be little doubt that the main effect of DMSO on frog skin was related to permeability changes. Smith and Hegre [36] have shown that antibodies to bovine serum albumin devel- oped when a mixture of DMSO and bovine Serum albumin was applied to the skin of rabbits. Finney and his associates [37] have studied the influence of DMSO and DMSO hydrogen peroxide on the myocardium after acute coronary ligation with subsequent myocar- dial infarction in pigs. The authors ligated approximately 50 per cent of the anterior de- scending branch of the left coronary artery and ligated the right coronary artery at its root. The addition of DMSO to this model system seemed to assist in the diffusion of oxygen into the ischemic myocardium as shown by the nitro BT staining technic. Maddock, Green, and Brown [38] designed experiments to demonstrate the usefulness of DMSO as a carrier for antitumor agents. The agents were dissolved in concentrations of DMSO varying from 85 to 100 per cent. One of the tumors studied was the L1210 leu- kemia. Survival time without treatment was approximately eight days. The standard method of employing Cytoxan\u00ae intraper- itoneally produced a survival time of 15.5 days. If Cytoxan was applied topically in water over the tumor, the survival time was 12.6 days. If Cytoxan was applied topically in DMSO, a survival time of 15.3 days was ob- tained and compared favorably with the results obtained by intraperitoneal admin- istrations. DMSO itself produced a survival time comparable to that obtained by giving no chemotherapy at all. Kligman [28,29] showed that various dyes, steroids, and antiperspirents dissolved in con- centrated solutions of DMSO of 70 per cent strength or greater showed enhanced pene- tration through human skin. Malbach and Peldmann [39] studied penetration of hydrocortisone and testosterone in man. Maximal excretion of both steroids occurred within thirty-six hours. The authors concluded that DMSO increased penetration of these steroids three- fold. Sulzberger and co-workers [40] studied the penetration of DMSO into human skin by employing methylene blue and iodine and iron dyes as visual tracers. Biopsy showed that the stratum corneum was stained throughout with each of the tracers which had been applied to the skin surface with DMSO and that there was ittle or no stain- ing below this area. The authors confirmed that DMSO was able to carry these sub- stances rapidly and deeply into the horny layer and suggested the possible usefulness of DMSO as a vehicle for therapeutic agents in inflammatory dermatoses and superficial skin infections such as pyodermas. Particular interest was expressed in the possible value of forming a depot in the horny layer for such prophylactic agents as sun screens, insect repellants, and antiseptics. Perlman and Wolfe [41] have demon- strated that allergens of small molecular weight such as penicillin-0 potassium mixed with 90 per cent DMSO will readily be carriedthrough intact human skin. Allergens hav- ing a molecular weight of 3,000 or greater will not penetrate the human skin with DMSO within a prescribed hour's time; however, Smith and Hegre [36] previously observed that antibodies to bovine serum albumin developed when a mixture of DMSO in bovine serum albumin was applied to the skin of rabbits. In addition to permitting passage through the human skin, DMSO will carry a substance such as hydrocortisone [42,43] or hexachloraphene [44] into the deeper layers of the stratum corneum, pro- ducing a reservoir. The steroid reservoir re- mains for sixteen days and is resistant to washing of the skin surface with soap, water, and alcohol. Anti-inflammation. In the laboratory DMSO exhibits anti-inflammatory activity against the Baker's yeast granuloma in the guinea pig [1]. Formanek and Kovac [45] demonstrated that DMSO exerted a signifi- cant effect on edema produced in the rat's paw by either a steel stamp or an injection of autologous blood. DMSO was administered topically immediately after trauma or in- jection, producing reduction of both types of edema. Miller and Ward [46] induced the localized Shwartzman phenomenon in rabbits. Di- methyl sulfoxide applied to the skin or in- jected intravenously at the time of the pre- paratory injection of ilpopolysaccharide failed to influence the local hemorrhagic necrosis induced by the intravenous lipopolysac- charide. In contrast, application of 90 per cent DMSO to the site of preparatory in- jection at the time of intravenous injection of the lipopolysaccharide either abolished or greatly reduced the local hemorrhage or necrosis; 70 per cent DMSO had only a minimal inhibitory effect on the localized Shwartzman phenomenon. In understanding the mechanism of action of DMSO and its anti-inflammatory effects, the work of Weissmann, Sessa, and Bevans [47] deserves special mention. The authors documented that lysosomes can be stabilized against a variety of injurious agents by corti- sone. However, the concentrations of these stabilizing agents when dissolved in ethanol are all at 10-4 M which is above the physiolog- ic or pharmacologic range. In direct contrast, when corticolds are dissolved in DMSO, stabilizing effects can be discerned at con- centrations of 10-8 or 10-7 which is more physiologic. Studies with monolithic mem- branes indicate that DMSO acts to render steroids available at the phospholipid choles- terol membrane which binds cells to their organelles. These authors conclude that since inflammation can be provoked by enzymes released from lysosomes in skin and synovl- um and since cortisol and its analogues antagonize these effects, it is possible that DMSO permits endogenous steroids to be more effective at their sites of action on the lysomal membrane. Nerve Blockade (Analgesia). Immersion of the sciatic nerve in 6 per cent DMSO de- creases the conduction velocity by 40 per cent. This effect is totally reversible by washing the nerve for one hour in a buffer [48]. Shealy [49] has studied feline periph- eral small fiber after discharge. In concen- trations of 6 to 10 per cent, DMSO elim- inates the activity of C-fibers within one minute. After washing, the activity of the C fibers returns [49]. Shealy believes feline peripheral small fiber after discharge to be a good experimental model for determining the efficacy of some substances influencing pain in man. A means of extending the duration of re- versible nerve blocks to several days without associated nerve destruction has been the subject of many investigators. Local anesthet- ics have been dissolved in oils or fats in the hope that such a solution would form a depot from which local anesthetic would be slowly released. Although nerve block for34171 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 weeks to months has resulted from injection of such mixtures, prolonged duration of effect has been shown to be the result of nerve destruction by the oil solvent. Recently, Brechner and co-workers [50] studied this problem using twenty-six healthy mongrel dogs. During administration of general anesthesia each animal received an epidural injection of the test drug prepa- ration. The preparation consisted of DMSO alone or DMSO in a local anesthetic base. In some instances the test preparation was injected into an epidural space previously infiltrated with 10 ml. of normal saline solu- tion or 2 ml. of bicarbonate. The authors produced prolonged nerve blocks by the epi- dural injections of various solutions of local anesthetic base and DMSO. The physical presence of one anesthetic base, procaine, was demonstrated for at least four days after such an injection. No neurohistologic evi- dence of damage could be demonstrated in animals which had received injection of DMSO, procaine, and a bicarbonate solution. Bacteriostasis. DMSO is bacteriostatic in 20 per cent concentration against Escherichia coll, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas [1]. A possible explanation for the antibac- terial effect has been suggested by Tsuchiya, Irlyama, and Umezawa [51] to result from the methylmethanthiosulfinate from DMSO. Seibert, Farrelly, and Shepherd [52] studied the highly pleomorphic bacteria regularly isolated from human tumors and leukemic bloods. DMSO in 12.5 to 25 per cent concen- trations caused complete inhibition of growth in vitro of all twenty-seven such isolated organisms without effecting the intact red blood cells. One of the intriguing possibilities with DMSO is indicated in studies which show that resistant bacteria become sensitive after pretreatment with this material. Pottz [53] gave preliminary evidence that the tubercle bacilli resistant to 2,000 ug. of streptomycin or isoniazid became sensitive to 10 \u00b5g. of either drug by pretreatment with 0.5 to 5 cent DMSO. Kamiya Wakao, and Nishioka [54] evalu- ated the effect of 5 per cent DMSO on the increase of sensitivity of bacteria to anti- biotics. In this study the difference of more than 2 mm. of growth inhibitory circle be- tween DMSO and the control medium was re- garded as the increase in sensitivity. DMSO restored the sensitivity of antibiotic-resistant strains and increased the sensitivity of anti- biotic-sensitive strains. Restoration of sensi- tivity was found in some strains of Pseudo- monas and E.coli. In particular the sensitiv- ity of Pseudomonas for colistin was restored when the medium contained 5 per cent DMSO. All four strains of colistin-reslstant Pseudomonas then became sensitive. The au- thors recorded that antibiotics which were not effective on certain bacteria, such as peni- cillin for E.coli, showed growth inhibitory effects DMSO. Diuresis. Suckert admin- istered topically to rats five times daily in a dosage of 0.5 ml. of 90 per cent DMSO per animal. This increased the urine volume ten- fold. Together with an increase in urine vol- ume, there was also an increase in both so- dium and potassium excretion. Enhancement of Drug Action. Rosen et al. [56] employed dimethyl sulfoxide and waterfor determining the LD,, in rats and mice using quarternary ammonium salts as test compounds administered orally. Toxicity was increased by DMSO with pentolinium tartrate in rats and hexamethonium bitartrate in rats. No change in mouse toxicity was noted with the foregoing two compounds. DMSO decreased toxicity of decamethanium Cholinesterase Inhibition. Sams, Carroll, and Crantz [481 studied the effects of di- methyl sulfoxide on skeletal, smooth, andcardiac muscles employing concentrations of 0.6 to 6 per cent. DMSO strikingly depressed the response of the diaphragm to both direct (muscle) and Indirect (nerve) electrical stimulation, and caused spontaneous skeletal muscle fasciculations. On the other hand, DMSO increased the response of the smooth muscle of the stomach to both muscle and nerve stimulation. The vagal threshold was lowered 50 per cent by 6 per cent DMSO. Cholinesterase inhibition by DMSO could reasonably explain fasciculation of skeletal muscle, increased tone of the smooth muscle, and lower vagal threshold observed in this series of experiments. In vitro assays showed that 0.8 to 8 per cent DMSO inhibited 16 to 80 per cent, respec- tively, of bovine erythrocyte cholinesterase [48]. Collagen Solvent. It has been found in biopsy specimens taken from the skin before treatment and at three weekly intervals in patients with scleroderma that there was a dissolution of collagen with the elastic fibers remaining intact [57]. Gries, Bublitz, and Lindner [58] studied rabbit skin before and after twenty-four hours in vitro with 100 per cent DMSO. They evaluated the fraction of collagen soluble in neutral saline solu- tion, the fraction soluble in acid the insoluble fibrous collagen. After immersion with DMSO, the fraction extract- able with neutral salt solution decreased sig- nificantly. The authors mentioned that top- ical DMSO in man exerted a significant effect in human pathologic deposition of col- lagen in human postirradiation subcutane- ous fibrosis but did not appear to change the equilibrium of metabolism of collagen of normal tissue. In patients with scleroderma, increased hydroxyproline content of the urine has been demonstrated after topical treat- ment with DMSO [58]. Nonspecific Enhancement of Resistance. Raettig in a recent study [59] of antigen- antibody reactions showed that DMSO did not disturb the immune response. In fact, the oral administration of DMSO to mice for ten days prior to an oral infection with murlne typhus produced in itself an en- hanced resistance to this rickettsial infection. Vasodilation. Adamson and co-workers [60] have demonstrated that when di- methyl sulfoxide is applied to a three to one pedicle flap raised on the back of rats, it will decrease the anticipated slough by 60 to 70 per cent. The authors suggested that the primary action of DMSO on the pedicle flap circulation was to evoke a histamine- like response. Kligman [28, 29] had previ- ously demonstrated that DMSO possessed potent histamine-liberating properties at the site of application. Microphotographs taken by Adamson and his associates show dilatation of vessels beneath the skin of the rabbit ear when it is topically treated with DMSO. CLINICAL DATA More than 125 clinical studies with topi- cal DMSO and/or DMSO mixtures have been reported or are in press to date. Ninety per cent of these indicate efficacy. The handful of negative papers are for the most part centered around the use of DMSO in rheu- matoid arthritis, a notoriously difficult dis- ease to evaluate. A critical review of the lit- erature on rheumatoid arthritis indicates that topical dimethyl sulfoxide is at least a useful adjunct in the treatment of this entity. The initial \"clinical impression\" types of reports have been confirmed with con- trolled studies. One of the better controlled studies in rheumatoid arthritis was performed by the Committee of Clinical Drug Testing of the Japanese Rheumatism Association [61] on 274 patients (55 male and 219 female pa- tients) with rheumatoid arthritis. Fifty or 90 per cent DMSO was applied topically and propylene glycol was used as a control twicea day to the involved joints for four weeksin single-blind evaluation. The following parameters were examined: (1) articularsymptoms and signs (spontaneous pain, painon palpation, pain on motion, heat); (2)strength of grip (mm. Hg); (3) circumfer. ence of joint; (4) range of joint motion.Patients were examined before trial, aftertwo weeks, and after four weeks of therapy. Records of the entire series were sent to acentral office and statistically analyzed. Both 50 and 90 per cent DMSO were found to be effective and no difference was discerned be- tween the two concentrations. They were both significantly better than the propylene glycol control. DMBO relieved joint pain and increased the range of motion and grip strength. Studies primarily relating to the interest of the general surgeon and some surgical specialties will now be discussed. Brown [62] has completed a controlled double-blind study to evaluate the thera- peutic efficacy of dimethyl sulfoxide in acute musculoskeletal disorders. Those treated in- cluded patients with acute post-traumatic soft tissue injury to the cervical, dorsal, and lumbar areas, sprains and strains of the larger joints of the extremities, acute post- traumatic soft tissue injuries associated with subcutaneous and intramuscular bleeding involving trunk or extremity surfaces of more than a few square inches, and acute bursitis involving the large joints of the body in contradistinction to that involving the fingers and toes. It had been previously determined that a 70 per cent aqueous solu- tion of DMSO in volumes ranging from 8 to 12 ml. applied topically at least three times daily to a wide area covering the site of dis- ease would provide effective therapeutic re- sponse in 80 per cent or more of the non- controlled cases and would yield substantial therapeutic benefit within twenty-four hours. Preliminary and prior testing of the same patients with a 10 per cent solution of DMSO indicated no clinical benefit during this time. In this manner the effective dose for the condition treated was established and the non-effective nature of the 10 per cent solution was determined and identified for use as the control group. Before treatment, physical parameters were recorded as to severity in each case. These in- cluded pain, edema, fluctuation, ecchymosis, local tenderness, and limitation of motion. The medication was applied to clean, dry, and unbroken skin, any excess oil or per- spiration having been removed. In establishing the protocol for the dou- ble-blind series DMSO was provided by a pharmaceutical house in numbered bottles, the code and strength of the solution in the containers being known only to those who supplied the drug. Ninety-two patients were included in the double-blind series. In sixty of these, 60 to 90 per cent DMSO was given. The over-all good [1] and excellent [2] re- sults varied between 70 and 90 per cent. Re- sults for the thirty-two patients in whom 10 per cent DMSO was applied were all rele- gated into the fair or no benefit categories. Tenderness and pain were evaluated by Brown [62] prior treatment and at intervals thereafter. Within one to two hours, there was almost complete relief of pain and tenderness in those patients treated with 60 to 90 per cent solutions of DMSO and at the end of seventy-two hours there was rela- tively no pain and tenderness. In patients treated with the placebo (10 per cent DMSO solution) there was little response, even after seventy-two hours, to medication for pain and tenderness. Penrod, Bacharach, and Templeton [63] studied the use of DMSO for control of pain after posterolateral thoracotomy. Twenty- four patients were selected for this study. Besides being painful this operation is also associated with complications which cften occur as a result of the patient's unwilling- ness to cough because of pain. Operations34172 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE were performed for a variety of intrathoracic lesions. Most of the patients had carcinoma of the lung, others had hiatal hernia, pul- monary tuberculosis, or thoracic aortic aneurysm. All patients were operated on by the same two surgeons so that the technical aspects of the Incisions and details of the patient's care were uniform. The following procedure for the topical ap- plication of DMSO was followed. At the end of the operation 10 ml. of an unknown con- centration of DMSO was directly applied to the closed wound and to an area extending 10 inches on either side. The skin was then permitted to dry for ten minutes and a sterile dressing was applied. Six hours later the dressing was removed and 10 ml. of DMSO from the same bottle applied. No dress- ing was used after this time. The applica- tions were repeated every six hours there- after. For the initial twelve applications (that is, for the first three days) the unknown concentration was used exclusively. On the fourth, fifth, and sixth postoperative days, a known concentration of 70 per cent DMSO was applied to the healing wound. Patients were instructed to ask for analge- sics in the postoperative period if they ex- perienced pain. The usual analgesic pre- scribed was morphine sulfate in a dose of 8 to 10 mg. given intramuscularly every three hours as needed. After the first three or four hours patients were encouraged to sit upright in bed, to cough, and to practice deep breathing. This is ordinarily a painful experience for any such patient. Three unknown concentrations of DMSO were used. Seven patients received 10 per cent DMSO, nine patients received a 60 per cent concentration, and eight patients were treated with an 80 per cent concentration. Because of the characteristic odor DMSO imparts to the patient's breath, it was de- cided to use 10 per cent concentration as a control rather than a completely inert aqueous solution. The patients in the control group, those receiving the 10 per cent concentration, re- quired an average of five doses of morphine sulfate during the first three postoperative days. Individual requirements varied from one injection to as many as eight injections during this three day period. Those patients receiving 60 per cent concentration required an average of four doses of morphine sulfate during the same postoperative time. The in- dividual doses In this group of patients ranged from two to eight injections over the three days. The patients in the third test group, those receiving 80 per cent concen- tration, required an average of only three doses of morphine sulfate through the first three postoperative days. Individual num- bers of doses ranged from one to five in this group. It became apparent early in the study that each of the patients receiving 60 or 80 percent concentrations of DMSO enjoyed some relief of pain after every application. In most patients the degree of relief from pain was significant. If there was delay in providing another application of DMSO after the final application of the test concentra- tion, patients frequently demanded contin- uation of the topical application. Postoperative analgesia is a variable which lends itself easily to subjective interpreta- tion by the patient and the attending per- sonnel. For example, the authors found that in some cases narcotics had been admin- istered by the nurse for restlessness and inability to sleep. In spite of these limi- tations both the surgeons involved in the patients' care and the nurses providing the daily treatments were impressed with the apparent effectiveness of DMSO in reliev- ing the usual pain after thoracotomy. These patients as a group were able to cough more effectively, move more easily both in and out of bed, resume early motion of the arm and shoulder in the operative side, and in general enjoy a more rapid and less complicated postoperative course thanpatients who had not had the drug. With fewer narcotics required, there were fewer gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, ileus, and constipation. Wounds healed without complication. Preliminary experience with DMSO for the relief of postoperative incisional pain was said by the authors to be encouraging. It was con- cluded that DMSO topically applied can play a useful role in the postoperative management of patients undergoing thoracic surgery. Engel [64] studied ten patients with keloids, applying 40 to 80 per cent DMSO concentration two to three times daily. After several months there was a flattening of the scar with microscopic changes seen in the dermis characterized by a loosening of the collagen bundles. Paul [65] presented a study comparing loss of time due to injury among profes- sional baseball players during the year he used DMSO in 28 cases with loss of time during the previous year when he did not have this drug (42 cases). Time loss was three times greater with conventional ther- apy than with DMSO. Frommhold [66] studied the of with sub- cutaneous fibrosis induced by supervoltage irradiation of deep seated malignant lesions. DMSO application was followed by a gradual softening and reduction in the size of the indurated areas. Brechner, Cohen, and Pretsky [67] showed that intense anesthesia of the intact hu- man skin could be achieved by the topical application of a solution of five to 33 per cent tetracaine base dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Ochs [68] employed DMSO for topical an- esthesia prior to myringotomy. The author used a 5 per cent solution of cocaine and 4 per cent tetracaine in pure dimethyl sulfox- ide. These were applied to the ear drum with a cotton-tipped applicator. Anesthesia re- sulted after one minute of application and persisted for a sufficient time to accomplish the procedure. Ochs pointed out that these materials should not be dropped into the auditory canal to avoid a severe burning pain which would radiate into the neck. He stud- ied sixty patients and found it equally ef- fective in treating acute otitis media with a bulging drum or a chronic case of serous otitis. In ophthalmology Gordon [69] applied DMSO intraocularly and reported benefit in the treatment of corneal edema. In the field of urology, Persky and Stewart [70] employed DMSO in the treatment of a number of patients with various genitouri- nary disorders, including Peyronie's disease and acute epididymitis. Six of thirteen patients with Peyronie's disease were signifi- cantly improved and were able to resume rea- sonably normal intercourse. In one patient a complete disappearance of the fibrous plaque resulted and three others showed definite evi- dence of resolution of the fibrosis. Applica- tions from the time of presentation had varied from eight to twelve weeks. In seven of twelve men with acute epididymitis, topi- cally applied DMSO was associated with relief of local discomfort and pain. In gynecologic surgery DMSO was employed by Ayre and LeGuerrier [711. The authors previously experimented with hormones ap- plied directly to localized carcinoma of the cervix in situ. Neither the hormone alone nor pure DMSO produced alterations. When DMSO with dexamethasone was applied to the lesion of carcinoma in situ, cytologic changes of a regressive nature appeared within two to three weeks. The friability of the lesion was no longer evident. The findings were inter- preted as showing regressive growth in- fluences in a small series of six cases. Recently a symposium on dimethyl sulf- oxide was held at the University of Vienna. Data on 9,521 patients were presented and areview of the meeting has been published [72]. The conclusions of the conference were that DMSO was effective therapy in a wide variety of acute traumatic conditions, in acute and chronic subacromial bursitis, osteo- arthritis, gouty arthritis, and in some patients with rheumatoid arthritis. DMSO was shown to be of value when applied topically for the treatment of early Dupuytren's contracture and of benefit in improving the cutaneous manifestations of scleroderma. It might be worthwhile to point out that a number of studies of its efficacy have ap- peared in the literature of veterinary medi- cine. Teigland and Saurino [73] demonstrated benefit in more than 80 per cent of horses treated for bursitis and synovitis. Dake [74] reported that the intravenous administration of DMSO to cats together with conventional therapy represented effective therapy for feline panleukopenia (an overwhelming viral infection). Koger [75] showed that topically applied DMSO was the first successful treat- ment for sacroiliac luxation in the cow. SUMMARY 1. In subacute and experi- ments, dimethyl sulfoxide administered top- ically, subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, orally, into the eye, and to the mucous membrane Is generally well tolerated and rates as an agent of low toxicity. 2. Subacute and chronic administration of DMSO in relatively high concentrations to dogs, rabbits, and swine by either the oral or the topical routes results In alterations to the lens. These alterations do not occur when the average dose given to human subjects is applied. The rhesus monkey is much more resistant to this phenomenon than the dog, rabbit, or pig. 3. Human subjects have now been ex- amined ophthalmologically after as long as two and a half years of DMSO therapy with- out ocular toxicity. DMSO is clinically well tolerated, with few troublesome side effects. 4. Fate and metabolism of DMSO have been studied in man by radioactive technics. After cutaneous application half of the ap- plied dose is eliminated within fourteen days. After intravenous application half of the applied dose is eliminated within eight days. Most of the dose is excreted as unchanged dimethyl sulfoxide in the urine. Dimethyl sulfone also appears in the urine. Dimethyl sulfide has been identified as the breath odor which follows DMSO treatment. 5. Dimethyl sulfoxide has a wide range of primary pharmacologic actions penetration, anti-inflammation, local analgesia, bacteriostasis, diuresis, chol- inesterase inhibition, enhancement of the action of a concomitantly administered drug, solvent for collagen, nonspecific enhance- ment of immunity, and vasodilation. Clinical usefulness in surgery and the sur- gical subspecialitles has been shown in the treatment of acute trauma, postoperative in- cisional pain, certain urologic disorders such as early Dupuytren's con- tracture, and subcutaneous fibrosis associated with Dimethyl sulfoxide will effectively carry local anes- thetics into the deeper layers of the skin and into the ear drum, permitting incision with- out pain.

[From the Hospital Tribune, June 19, 1967] DMSO PUT ON SALE AS Rx DRUG IN WEST GERMANY AND AUSTRIA PRINCETON, N.J.-Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) has gone on sale as a prescription item in West Germany and Austria, Dr. Gerhard Laudahn, director of clinical re- search for Schering A.G., told Hospital Tribune while attending the Conference on Drug Information for Health Professions here. Hundreds of thousands of persons have used DMSO in the United States and Europe, and no serious untoward effect has yet been substantiated, he said. The prescription sale of DMSO in Austria is its first public availability in that coun- try, he said. It had been on prescription in West Germany before, from October until November, 1965, and was withdrawn when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration re- quested further testing. The drug will be available for topical treatment of such acute ailments as muscu- loskeletal injuries and other muscle distortions and sprains and strains, he said. It is not yet available for such chronic conditions as arthritis, \"but we are quite sure,\" said Dr. Laudahn, \"that DMSO will also prove valuable in chronic conditions. Before we recommend its widespread use in such conditions, we will follow the request of the German health authorities that we wait for the outcome of the treatments of the acute conditions.\" Restrictions on the prescription use of DMSO, he said, are that it not exceed maxi- mum dose of 10 Gm. daily and not exceed the maximum time period of two weeks. \"We do feel completely satisfied,\" said Dr. Laudahn, about the drug's safety. \"We think topical applications of DMSO, as we are using it at the moment, is only the beginning. Because we think that DMSO together with other substances will be proved valuable in the treatment of other diseases later on.\" \"It might go together with the cortico- steroids and especially with anticancer drugs in such instances that the cancer or tumor may be reached by topical application to skin or mucous membrane,\" he suggested. He said that animal experiments reported at the November, 1966, international sym- posium on DMSO in Vienna already showed beneficial results on animal tumors with combinations of DMSO and other drugs. FEDERAL REVENUE SHARING-THE KEY TO COOPERATIVE FEDERAL- ISM Mr. WYMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from New York [Mr. GOODELL] may ex- tend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter.The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Hampshire? There was no objection. Mr. GOODELL. Mr. Speaker, if one reads the history of the U.S. House of Representatives, it becomes obvious that the old maxim that new Members should be seen and not heard had some validity. I am happy to say that such is no longer the case. It is to the advantage of the entire Nation that this legislative body, more than any other in the world today, is blessed with energetic, thought- ful, and creative young minds who are promptly assuming their burden with dignity and distinction. Happily for us and for the Nation, they have spoken out on the issues that face us. The world and the country has the advantage of their ideas and their plans. The distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin, the Honorable WILLIAM A. STEIGER, is a prime example of what I mean. On November 13, 1967, before the Na- tional Municipal League's 73d National Conference on Government in Milwau- kee, he spoke out on a topic that has attracted the attention of many of us here. His subject was \"Federal Revenue Sharing-The Key to Cooperative Fed- eralism.\" As with so many issues, he has placed the matter in perspective. I invite the attention of the Members and the coun- try to his comments which I am pleased to place at this point in the RECORD: FEDERAL REVENUE SHARING-THE KEY TO CO- OPERATIVE FEDERALISM One of the most vital and dynamic di- chotomies of American history has been the changing nature of our federal system-the partnership between the national govern- ment on the one hand and the states which form it on the other. The conflict and the concert between the states and the national government is one of the most creative, as well as one of the most discordant features of federalism. To me the friction of federal- ism is both fruitful and healthy when prop- erly channeled. It is disruptive only when the balance is lost. When either end of the tug of war that is federalism fails to pull its share, the other side over balances. The strength which comes from a competitive partnership then is lost. Let's be honest and admit that the states have not been fully pulling their share, and the federal government has not been wholly doing its job either. Today, we witness the ever-increasing cen- tralization of power and responsibility at the national level, a growing state and municipal dependence on largesse from Washington and a weakening of the abili- ties of states and local units of government to meet their responsibilities. The reason is not-as some would have us believe-the inertia of inaction on the part of the states, nor is it simply the momentum of bureau- cratic growth on the federal level. It is not that simple. Many factors have combined to bring this situation about. None of these factors, how- ever, has more impact than the imbalance in revenue sources available to the several levels of government. As a practical matter, the national government has pre-empted the graduated income tax as a major revenue source. For the most part, state and local gov- ernments have been left to rely on three major sources for the bulk of the revenues they need to operate. These three sources-property taxes, sales taxes, and income taxes of flat or only mildly progressive rates-have tended only slightly to keep pace with inflated prices, and the mush- rooming demands of a growing population for improved governmental services. In an era of economic growth, revenue and credit sources available to state and local gov- ernments have not increased at a rate com- mensurate with demands and prices. Thus, the financial plight of governments in America today is one of increased revenue at the national level, but fiscal poverty at state and local levels. This has had an in- evitable impact on governmental and politi- cal leaders. At the state and local level, the pinch caused by insufficient funds has created a reluctance to embark upon new programs demanded by an increasingly so- phisticated population. At the national level, the predicament is reversed. The availability of funds leads to approval of new programs and commitments without sufficient examination of the desirability or efficacy of national governmental action. It is certainly a fact of life that many of the ills of our society are not now being solved at the local and state level. Many of our cities are suffering; poverty, unemploy- ment and crime abound in many areas; ur- ban ghettos are a national disgrace; trans- portation is being strangled. Who among us needs a catalog of these ills? We are all familiar with the problems. We are all searching for the best solution to those problems. The crucial question is: Why are these problems not being solved effectively at the local and state level? The present approach to solving these problems has been tried and tested in In- creasing degrees for a number of years. In 10 years, federal grant-in-aid expenditures on a categorical basis have increased by $10 bil- lion from approximately $4 billion in 1956 to more than $14 billion in 1966. This approach is simply not working. Proponents of today's \"creative federalism\" seek to solve these problems with special or categorical federal grant-in-aid programs. The Department of Health, Education and Welfare alone put out a book containing some 527 pages, entitled \"Grants-in-Aid and Other Financial Assistance Programs Admin- istered by the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare.\" That 527-page book merely lists and de- scribes briefly the grant-in-aid programs ad- ministered by this single department of the federal government. In all, there are 190 programs listed. They account for expenditures of some $7 billion annually, which represents less than half of the more than $14 billion in annual federal expenditures on such programs administered by the federal government. Each of these programs has its own ad- ministrator and its own army or regiment or platoon of personnel. Many of the programs have field personnel in regional offices and many, of course, have personnel in each state. The simpliest way I know of bringing home to the individual person in practically any city in the United States just how deeply the federal government is involved in one way or another in his community and state is to refer him to the telephone book. The 1966 Milwaukee telephone book contains 240 separate telephone listings for the federal government and only 166 for the state gov- ernment. During the past 10 years, programs of aid to the states have increased substantially. New health, labor and welfare programs established between fiscal 1956 and 1966-21 in number-will have required outlays of $8.3 billion by the end of fiscal 1968. The first-year cost of these 21 programs was $44 million; they are budgeted for almost $3.0 billion in the current fiscal year. Programs added in 1967 and proposed in 1968 will bring34175 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 the total of new programs to 27 and the asso- ciated 1968 expenditures to $4.1 billion. Of the 21 programs initiated during the 1956-1966 period In the health, labor and welfare field, 18 have been enacted since 1962. I would be saying nothing new if I at- tempted to catalog the list of federal require- ments, the redtape involved in obtaining ap- proval, the man-years spent by state and local officials in connection with these programs, the interagency and intraprogram rivalries that exist among federal programs, and so on. In Wisconsin, it has been estimated that the taxpayers contribute $1.46 toward the cost of grant-in-aid programs for every grant-in-aid dollar they get back from the federal government. A good part of that 46 cents goes for overhead and administrative costs of the federal government. The rest goes to so-called disadvantaged states through a number of equalization formulas. In 1966 Wisconsin ranked 48th in per capita federal aid going to the states. Perhaps no state would really complain if the categorical grant-in-aid programs admin- istered by the federal government were ac- complishing the job. With more than 200 categorical grant-in- aid programs expending more than $14 billion annually, we see our problems, particularly In the metropolitan areas, persist and grow. All of our communities, as you well know, have the same general problems in the sense that there may be poverty, unemployment, inadequate educational and job training op- portunities and other problems of this kind. But the same solution to water pollution or poverty, or for that matter any other problem, in one community Is very well not an appropriate solution in another com- munity. In one it might be a training pro- gram or sewage treatment facilities and in another it might be a transportation pro- gram or storm sewer separation construc- tion. It is obvious, however, that we are not going to make a major change in the dis- tribution of federal dollars until such time as the Vietnam war has ended. It is also apparent that before the fed- eral government moves to a revenue sharing system some basic policy decision will have to be made as to: (1) the basis for deter- mining the amount available for distribu- tion to the states; (2) the extent of controls over the distribution and use of shared funds; (3) the formula for distributing funds, including the weight that should be given to such factors as population, state and local tax effort, and income to the states; (4) the extent to which shared funds would have to be passed on by the states to their local political subdivisions and the formula for such distribution; and (5) whether re- form of state and local governments and their tax systems should be a prerequisite to par- ticipate In shared revenues and, if so, what kind of reforms. In order to move toward a more meaning- ful system of aid to the states, I would hope that as we have done In the 90th Congress, we can begin to go to the so-called \"block grant\" approach and point to what the President said when he proposed the Com- prehensive Public Health Service Act last year: \"I recommend to Congress a program of grants to enable states and communities to plan the better use of manpower facilities and financial resources for comprehensive health services.... Our purpose must be to help redirect and reform fragmented pro- grams which encourage inefficiency and con- fusion and fail to meet the total health needs of our citizens.\" My colleague Congressman Henry Reuss is an outspoken advocate of the concept of governmental reform at the state and local level. There is, however, a further question which is: Can the national government be indifferent to the manner in which state andlocal tax collectors separate $61 billion an- nually from individuals and business firms. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, of Harvard, out- lined some of the problems facing our pres- ent system when he said: \"... liberals must divest themselves of the notion that the nation, especially the cities of the nation, can be run from agen- cies in Washington ... we must attend to what the federal government is good at... (it) is good at collecting revenues, and rather bad at disbursing services.\" Governor Terry Sanford, of North Carolina, in his aptly titled book Storm Over the States described the problems existent in present federal programs when he wrote: \"Federal programs are uncoordinated, leading to overlapping, duplication, tripli- cation, conflicting goals, cross-purposes, lack or consistency and loss of direction.\" Sanford also wrote: \"As the crisis has risen, it is obvious that the states have not done enough, the cities have seemed paralyzed, and the national government has inaugurated as many wrong approaches as right solutions. The answers, however, will not be found by assessing blame, but by drawing together all our re- sources.\" States and local governments continue to struggle to meet the challenges presented to them. From 1946 to 1966, state and local government spending increased by 525 per cent, from $13 billion to $81 billion. But at the same time, state and local tax receipts rose by only 432 per cent, from $11 billion in 1946 to $58 billion in 1965, and gross state and local debt ballooned from $15 billion to $107 billion, an increase of 575 per cent. There are a number of reasons why these heavy spending burdens have been placed on state and local governments in the past two decades. The most obvious reason is the increase in population. During the decade from 1930 to 1940 the population rose from 122.8 million to 131.7 million persons, an increase of 7.2 per cent. By 1950, the popula- tion had grown by 19 million persons, or more than 14 per cent; and by 1960, an addi- tional 27.8 million persons had been added to the population, a further increase of 18.4 per cent. Not only has population grown ab- solutely, but the rate of increase has risen significantly. What then is the answer for our local gov- ernments and eventually for the people they govern and care for? Tom Wicker, New York Times writer, re- cently described one answer: \"Thoughtful men in both parties think the time has come to begin turning back both federal revenues and federal responsibilities to the states, not merely as theoretical fed- eralism but also in the interests of meeting more effectively the great diversity of prob- lems Washington has taken on since the New Deal.\" Tax sharing is an answer that was first broached by Walter W. Heller, the idea that the federal government should share some of its revenues with the 50 states and over 90,000 local units of government. Revenue sharing is intended to allocate to the states and local governments on a per- manent basis a portion of the very produc- tive and highly \"growth-elastic\" receipts of the federal government. Most federal reve- nues come from income taxes that rise at a faster rate than income as income grows. By contrast state-local revenues barely in- crease in proportion to income. Ninety per cent of the taxes that are levied on incomes of individuals and businesses in this country goes to the federal government, although 35 of the 50 states tax incomes. States are gen- erally reluctant to increase taxes on incomes, for, among other reasons, fear of losing busi- ness to other states. Stripped to essentials, the revenue sharing plan I have drafted would operate as follows: 1. 3% of the federal personal income taxwould be allocated for the first year. Over aperiod of 4 years this would be raised to 5%. The President's budget for fiscal 1968 esti- mates personal income tax revenue at 732 billion dollars. 3% of this would be about 2.2 billion dollars for tax sharing. 2. 10% of the 212 billion dollars would first be allocated to the 17 states with the lowest per capita income, as a form of equalization. 3. The other 90% (approximately 2 billion dollars) would be distributed as follows: a. 50% to the states for any purpose they desire. b. 5% to the states for strengthening state and local administration. In the sole discre- tion of a state, this 5% could be transferred to the 50% general fund described in (a) above. c. 45% to local subdivisions of the state. The state would have sole and complete au- thority to designate how much of this fund would go to education and how much to other functions of local government. The state would have sole and complete author- ity to allocate the money within the state to its subdivisions. Subject to the above two state powers, the 45% money allocated to the state subdivisions would be administered exactly like money raised from local tax sources. (This means the money would be subject to the same general controls, fiscal and otherwise, which apply within the state to local tax revenue.) Constraints on the use of the funds would be much less detailed than those applying to conditional grants. However, the funds would not be available for highway construction, since there is a special federal trust fund with its own earmarked revenue sources for this purpose. An audit of the actual use of the funds would be required, as well as certification by the appropriate state and local officials that all applicable federal laws, such as the Civil Rights Act, have been complied with in the activities financed by the grants. In addition, the revenue sharing bill I have introduced, H.R. 4090, calls for the inclusion of a bonus feature for those states like Wis- consin, that are doing an adequate job of raising revenues on the state level. This would penalize those states with poor tax structures and encourage tax reform. The concept contained in this bonus fea- ture aimed at making states come to grips with three critical issues-regressivity, reve- nue productivity and equalization-is de- scribed in a thought-provoking paper by John Shannon, Assistant Director, Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, before the National Association of State Budget Officers. Shannon said It would be \"designed to help those states that help themselves, or to be more specific, to reward those states that are willing to go the extra mile in constructing an equitable and pro- ductive revenue system. For example, last year the State of Wisconsin spent approxi- mately $5 million granting relief to home- owners found to be carrying extraordinary property tax burdens in relation to their in- come. That state also exempted food pur- chases from its retail sales tax and made rela- tively intensive use of the personal income tax. Thus, under this reimbursement plan, Wisconsin would receive $2.5 million for its property tax effort, $18.7 million as sales tax reimbursement (table 2), and $74.8 million (table 3) for its income tax effort-or a reim- bursement total of approximately $95 million with no expenditure strings attached. \"By contrast, its neighbor Illinois would receive nothing because in 1966 Illinois made no effort to help those property owners carry- ing extraordinary burden, it did not exempt food from its 3.5 percent state sales tax, nor did it impose a personal income tax. There is every reason to believe, however, that Illi- nois would be encouraged by these plans to exempt food and impose a personal income tax. Illinois state sales tax reimbursement would approximate $56 million (table 2); and34176 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE assuming that it made an average personal income tax effort of 3 percent, it would be entitled to $96 million personal income tax reimbursement. \"To put the matter more sharply, while tax sharing arrangements would tend to re- duce the pressure on states to 'shape up' their revenue systems, these reimbursement grants would hurry state tax reform efforts along.\" The sharing of tax revenues has been done for some years in Wisconsin. Under the Wis- consin formula, 26.38% of the income tax dollar goes to the community In which the taxes are raised; 4.4% of that amount goes to the county in which that community is located; and the remaining 73.62% goes to the state government. In addition, Wiscon- sin shares other revenue sources such as motor vehicle fees and in all cases the shar- ing of revenue has been successful. Wisconsin has a good record in state gov- ernment and a good record in providing services for its residents. Its tax sharing pro- cedure plays a significant role in maintain- ing the quality of its state and local govern- ment. So long as the present grant-in-aid sys- tem continues, it is imperative that we re- verse the trend now operative which has the federal government basically drafting and considering the legislation without ade- quate consultation with states which have to live with the program. There is a critical need for close cooperation between legisla- tures and executive branches of our states and the Congress so the views and recom- mendations of the states can be known prior to passage of legislation. The key to all of this is that the present method of operation is not working effec- tively. Unless we give an incentive-and there are states now assuming this respon- sibility-you'll not just continue the Imbal- ance, you may destroy the system. Revenue sharing, I believe, offers an opportunity to create a truly balanced system. In brief, revenue sharing will provide the states with a growing source of income from taxes that are much more equitable than those now available to them. The states can in turn pass those revenues on to local gov- ernments for solving specific problems. This is, I believe, a better way to help finance the urgently needed public services, and at the same time, to strengthen our federal sys- tem of government. Revenue sharing offers meaningful and ef- fective \"cooperative federalism,\" rather than dominant federalism. THE LEGALIZATION OF COURT-AP- PROVED WIRETAPPING AND ELEC- TRONIC SURVEILLANCE NEEDED Mr. WYMAN. Mr. Speaker, I askunanimous consent that the gentleman from Florida [Mr. GURNEY] may extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Hampshire? There was no objection. Mr. GURNEY. Mr. Speaker, legisla- tion to legalize court-approved wiretap- ping and electronic surveillance is badly needed to bring an overdue all-out attack on the national crime problem. In the first 6 months of this year, crime in the United States, as revealed by the \"crime index\" of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, has risen 17 percent over the same period in 1966. The violent crimes as a group increased 18 percent, with robbery up 30 percent, murder 20 percent, aggravated assault 11 percent.The voluminous property crimes rose 17 percent as a group. As of 1966, crimes of violence had increased by 49 percent from 1960; crimes against property had increased by 64 percent. The bill that I am introducing today would allow Federal and State investi- gators to use wiretapping and electronic surveillance devices under court order. At present, information gathered by wiretapping is not admissible as evidence in U.S. courts. Yet, in attempting to insti- tute a balance between individual and societal rights, the bill prohibits elec- tronic surveillance by private citizens. I believe that this legislation satisfies the requirements of constitutionality, as spelled out in the Berger Supreme Court decision of June 1967. The decision de- manded that an eavesdropping statute meet the fourth amendment search-and- seizure standards. Legislation to allow judge-approved wiretapping and electronic surveillance in the investigation of serious crime is supported by the Judicial Conference of the United States. This organization is formed by ranking Federal judges across the Nation and is headed by the Chief Justice of the United States. The Na- tional Association of Attorneys General and the Association of Federal Investi- gators endorse the legislation. The three previous Attorneys General of the United States favored legislation of this nature. Yet, the present President and Attor- ney General of the United States insist that wiretapping and surveillance devices are of no value in dealing with crimes involving anything other than national security. The Attorney General has for- bidden use of electronic eavesdropping by U.S. officials although the practice is not outlawed by present Federal statutes. Conversely, I believe that surveillance devices are of invaluable aid in dealing with such very serious crimes as graft, bribery, murder, and espionage-when there are careful controls on use of the devices, as there are in this bill. I feel, as do many of my Republican colleagues, that with regard to dealing with orga- nized crime, this legislation is essential. * Effective and powerful forces must be used to combat the most sophisticated and hardened of criminals. Swift enactment of this legislation is crucial. I call upon the House Judiciary Committee to take action with haste. I would hope that the President would re- move his opposition, the obstacle to bi- partisan support of a measure that is of critical national importance. FARMERS, STRIKES, AND BARGAINING Mr. WYMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. LANGENI may ex- tend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Hampshire? There was no objection. Mr. LANGEN. Mr. Speaker, today I received the following article published by the Cooperative Extension Service of the College of Agriculture, University ofIllinois at Urbana, Ill. This article was sent to me by Dr. Louis A. Kopple, of Chicago, Ill. I appreciate Dr. Kopple's alertness in calling this article to my at- tention, since the responsible observa- tions which appear in this publication are of interest to all Americans and, in particular, the farmers of our country. This article by L. H. Simerl, extension economist, serves as a good reminder to all Americans that too often the farmer has not received income that has been commensurate with his increased pro- duction costs. This means farm income has not risen while other sectors of our economy have received increased income. I heartily recommend the following ar- ticle to my colleagues. It sets forth with clarity the present farm dilemma: FARMERS, STRaIES, AND BARGAINING Farmers have a big interest in the many strikes and bargaining battles between labor groups and employers. When new contracts raise the cost of labor, farmers are struck in three ways: 1. An increase in the expenses of process- ing and distributing farm products, which reduces the share of the consumers' dollar received by farmers. 2. An increase in the prices that farmers must pay for farm equipment and supplies. 3. An increase in the prices of the products and services that are required by farm families. Marketing Costs Rise: In 1966, consumers spent $83.4 billion for food produced by U.S. farmers. Of this amount, marketing costs took $55.3 billion-$2.6 billion more than in 1965. Of each $1.00 spent for food produced in the U.S., marketing expenses took 67 cents, leaving only 33 cents that could be paid to the farmers who produced it. Farm Operating Costs Rise: In 1966, farm- ers spent $33.3 billion to produce food and other farm products. This amount was $2.4 billion (8 percent) more than in the previous year. Production expenses ate up two-thirds of all cash received by farmers from the sale of farm products. Only one-third ($16.1 billion) remained as income for the farmer and his family. Farm Living Costs Climb, too: In earlier years, farmers produced much of the food, fuel, and other items required by the family. Now, however, most farmers specialize in the production of one or two products-corn and soybeans, for example. Hence, they must buy practically all of the food and other products and services needed by the family. The average prices of products and services purchased by farm families increased 3 per- cent from mid-1966 to mid-1967. Wages High, and Going Up: Labor is by far the biggest cost in the marketing of farm products and in the production of products and services required for farm operation and family living. Last year, wages, salaries, and other compensation to employees in this country totaled $436 billion. Corporate prof- its (after taxes) totaled $49.3 billion, but only $21.5 billion was paid out as dividends to investors. The remainder, $27.8 billion, was needed and used for modernization and ex- pansion of facilities. Thus, the income from wages and salaries was 20 times the income from dividends. In 1966, the compensation of employees was 49 percent greater than in 1960. The present round of wage increases will tend to hold down farm prices and farm income. Higher costs for the transportation, processing, and distribution of farm products will increase the spread between what the consumer pays and what the farmer receives. At the same time, rising prices for farm equipment and supplies will increase farm operating expenses. Finally, rising prices for34177 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 the products and services that farm families need will shrink the purchasing power of each dollar of net income received by farmers. Clearly, farmers have a big stake in wage rates and labor costs. But, so far as we know, farmers have little or no representation at the bargaining tables where labor costs are established. LOSS OF ABLE COLLEAGUE HEIGHT- ENS NEED FOR CONGRESSIONAL REFORM Mr. WYMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from New Hampshire [Mr. CLEVELAND] may extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Hampshire? There was no objection. Mr. CLEVELAND. Mr. Speaker, for several months now, many colleagues and I have been strongly urging enact- ment of the Congressional Reorganiza- tion Act of 1967, which has been bottled up in the Rules Committee since it passed the other body by a 75-to-9 vote last April. There have been many recent in- cidents, such as those involving Bobby Baker and Mr. POWELL, Congressman- elect from New York, which have led to public cries for congressional reform and reorganization. If these incidents and the many calls for action by the House Republican con- ference have failed to sway the Rules Committee to action, maybe one little in- cident earlier this week will cause them to \"see the light.\" I speak of the decision of my young, able, and respected colleague, the gentle- man from North Carolina [Mr. KORNE- GAY] not to seek reelection in 1968. My colleague, the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. KORNEGAY], re- spected by many of us on both sides of the aisle, regretfully concluded that he must leave the Congress to spend more time with his family; and that our year- round sessions were depriving him of this obligation, as well as the obligation we all face as U.S. Representatives to truly represent our constituents by seeing them on a regular basis. Mr. Speaker, his most thoughtful and touching statement, which I present at the end of my remarks, struck especially close to home. His oldest son is the same age as my oldest daughter; his second- born is the same age as my son, David. And I share his regret that I do not see enough of my children in these formative years in their lives, either. Mr. Speaker, there is no need for this. The final report of the Joint Com- mittee on the Organization of the Con- gress, issued July 28, 1966, discussed this question and its obvious solution. It said, in part: Both Houses should schedule committee and floor sessions on a 5-day workweek, sothat the business of a session may normally be completed by July 31, the time for con- gressional adjournment as provided by law. A session shall be extended beyond that date only by a resolution adopted by a majority rollcoll vote in each House. In no event, how- ever, shall any meetings of either House beheld during the month of August, except in time of war as declared by Congress. The 1946 act provided that Congress should adjourn no later than July 31, except in time of national emergency. The \"national emer- gency\" clause has been used to avoid the provision in every session since 1946. The section provides for adjournment sine die on July 31 unless otherwise provided by the Congress. Every effort should be made to encourage more expeditious handling of legislative business in order to meet the legal adjourn- ment date. Committees have grown accus- tomed to transacting business on a Tuesday- to-Thursday basis, rather than a 5-day work- week. With a requirement for a majority vote in each House to extend the session, com- mittees might work a longer schedule early in the session, realizing that the session's business might be completed by July 31 if they did so. Whether or not the business of the session can be completed, no session should be held during the month of August other than in time of war as declared by Congress. The individual Member has great difficulty in scheduling his own time because he cannot determine with any degree of certainty the schedule for the business of the session. This results in inadequate opportunity to plan for visits in the State or district to work with constituents on their problems or to plan family trips which do not conflict with the school term. If a long session were necessary, an August break would furnish a period during which the Member could \"feel the pulse\" of his con- stituents on major issues. This would also cause the session to conform more nearly to the school year and work less hardship on Members with school-age children. Implementation of this recommendation cannot, of course, lessen the Member's work- load. This will continue to increase. Nor would the recommendation necessarily re- duce the length of sessions of Congress. But it will allow the Member to discharge his duties more effectively-both in Washington and in his home district. Mr. Speaker, I was not quoting from any partisan report or publication. The final report of the committee was adopted unanimously by six Republicans and six Democrats. And my distinguished colleague, the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. KcRNEGAY], whose plight I share in and sympathize with, is not a member of my own party. But I feel compelled to once again ask my colleagues, how many good men we must lose, how long we must continue to dilute our functions as true Repre- sentatives of our districts, before some action is taken to halt this needless drain of both time and talent. I present the full text of the state- ment made by my colleague, the gentle- man from North Carolina [Mr. KORNE- GAY] this week, with the fervent hope that some action be taken before this be- comes commonplace: STATEMENT OF HON. HORACE R. KORNEGAY, MEMBER OF CONGRESS, SIXTH DISTRICT, NORTH CAROLINA, NOVEMBER 27, 1967, GREENSBORO, N.C. Thank you all for coming this morning. I have a statement that I would like to make and following that I will be glad to submit to any questions you might have. On the completion of my present term in Congress, I will have spent 20 years in public service-as a soldier, a prosecuting attorney, and a Congressman; and after much thought and soul searching I have come reluctantly to the decision that it is time for me to re- turn home to my family-my wife and our three children. I will therefore not be a can- didate for reelection to Congress.The primary reason for my decision to notseek reelection is that the Congressional ses-sions have become practically year 'round,and for the past seven years I have been de-prived of the normal relationship with myfamily and with my growing children. Theseare the years when my children most needthe presence of a father, and I am sorry tosay that my duties in Washington have made me a father in absentia. I reached this decision, the most difficultone of my life, a number of weeks ago andplanned to make it public upon my returnhome after the adjournment of this sessionof Congress. It is now apparent that this ses-sion will not conclude until shortly beforeChristmas, if then. And I feel it would not befair to wait any longer to inform the peopleof the 6th District of my decision. Now thatyou know of my decision not to seek reelec-tion, I want to emphasize that it is final. In less than three years my son Roble will, I hope, enter college, and two years there-after my daughter Kathy will do likewise.And, the way time flies, it will not be manyyears before little Martha will reach college age. I feel very strongly the obligation tospend as much time as possible with mychildren before they leave home. Some may ask why I have not moved myfamily to Washington? My answer is thatmy Congressional duties extend into theevening and often into the late evening. Thisnaturally conflicts with a normal family life. Also, I feel that I have rendered a greater service to the constituency by returning tothe District on a weekly basis to talk with the people and to aid them with their problems. I am grateful for the confidence the people of the Sixth District have placed in me and feel that I have been fortunate in the re- districting process-I have made so many friends I shall always value in the Counties of Durham and Orange and Davidson, as well as Alamance and my home County of Guil- ford; and I appreciate the kind offers of sup- port which have already been made to me by Caswell and Rockingham Counties, which will be a part of the new 6th District in 1969. This wonderful Piedmont area of North Carolina is the best place in the United States, and I would rather have had the privilege of representing these Piedmont Counties than any other area under the sun. There are so many to thank for their sup- port and confidence that it would take me years to get around to the individual expres- sion of my appreciation and of my humility in the trust which has been reposed in me through these years. Let me now say to all my good supporters and to my loyal staff and to all who have borne so patiently with my heavy and rushed schedule: Thanks a million, and may you have the representation you deserve in the future. I have given to you the best of my ability, but I have given you no more than you deserve. I am confident in the hope that our area will continue to progress and to be a shining part of our state and of our nation. I thank you for letting me be your spokesman in the House of Representatives for eight years. I was elected in 1966 to serve a fourth term in the Congress and I want everybody to know that I intend to continue to repre- sent this district, this state and nation to the very best of my ablliy for the remainder of my term. I intend to stay on the job for 13 more months and be of the greatest service possible until January, 1969, when some other fortunate person will be sworn in as Repre- sentative from the Sixth District in the 91st Congress. Thank you for coming and I will now open the floor to questions, but I must leave with- in a few minutes to return to Washington and get back on the job. There is some important legislation coming up in the House this af- ternoon and I must be there.34178 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE ANGER IN APPALACHIA-UNFAIR COMPETITION BY ECONOMIC DE- VELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION Mr. WYMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from New Hampshire [Mr. CLEVELAND] may extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Hampshire? There was no objection. Mr. CLEVELAND. Mr. Speaker, on No- vember 15, 1967, in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, volume 113, part 24, page 32714, I related that hearings held that day by the Special Subcommittee on Economic De- velopment Programs addressed them- selves, in particular, to the administra- tion by the Economic Development Ad- ministration of section 702 of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1985. This section, which I introduced as an amendment to the Economic Develop- ment Administration Act, was designed to prevent unfair competition. I stated on November 15 and I repeat now that there has been much confusion over EDA's in- terpretation of this section. Its adminis- trative procedures to enforce it appear faulty and unfair. As if to further assure me that such confusion does exist, on November 21, 1967, there appeared in the Wall Street Journal an article entitled \"Anger in Appalachia: A Federal Move To Help Depressed Region Runs Into Local Oppo- sition,\" authored by Burt Schorr, which relates another example of an EDA loan which may have resulted in the viola- tion of the congressional intent of this statute. I place in the RECORD this article and call it to the attention of my colleagues, as follows: ANGER IN APPALACHIA: A FEDERAL MOVE To HELP DEPRESSED REGION RUNS INTO LOCAL OPPOSITION-UNITED STATES FINANCES CRUSHED-STONE VENTURE OF PRIVATE FIRM, AND RIVALS RAISE A FUSS--THE UNFAIR COMPETITION ISSUE (By Burt Schorr) PIKEVILLE, KY.-High on an Appalachian ridge near here, hard-hatted workers tamp dynamite into newly drilled holes, preparing to blast the underlying limestone. Below them, other crews ready a site for heavy stone-crushing machinery and assemble a 600-foot conveyor belt capable of moving over 500 tons of crushed stone an hour. Farther down, growling earth-movers level an area where crushed stone will be stored. This mountainside bustle heralds the com- ing of another of Uncle Sam's economic aid projects for needy Appalachia-a highly mechanized quarry that will produce crushed limestone from the steep flank of Pine Mountain for use in highway and other con- struction. Proponents say the project is creating need- ed jobs and eventually will supply materials to aid local economic growth: on these grounds the Government's Economic Devel- opment Administration is putting up most of the cash. But close examination of this arrangement is raising questions about the EDA's methods in ladling out more than $50 million annually in loans to business in dis- tressed areas around the country. CXIII- 2153-Part 25NOTEWORTHY OMISSIONS Among other things this scrutiny shows, past business woes, including one outright fiasco, do not necessarily disqualify a private entrepreneur from sharing in the EDA's lar- gess. In this case, a \"feasibility study\" pre- pared to guide the agency omitted mention of these troubles. The facts in the case: The president and majority stockholder of Elkhorn Stone Co. Inc. of New Market, Tenn., which is developing the quarry here, is John Will Ruth. Another stone company that he heads ran into a lawsuit for allegedly failing to make proper payments on leased equip- ment: That company settled up in Septem- ber by agreeing to pay over $50,000. Still another Ruth-led company lost $1 million when a geological fault caused the roof to cave in on an underground limestone mine it was developing in 1965. (Says Mr. Ruth: \"There's no way to determine these faults. Let's say our engineer made a mistake.\") Examination also confirms that a private entrepreneur can share in the profits of this Federal-aid program without risking any big stake of his own. Of the $1,175,000 Elkhorn Stone is pouring into the quarry project here, only $175,000 comes from Mr. Ruth and his fellow-investors (though they have also put up $35,000 in working capital). The EDA is taking the biggest risk, lending Elkhorn $1,137,500 for 10 years at a bargain rate of 4% % and guaranteeing 90% of a private bank loan of $250,000 for working capital. JUSTIFICATION QUESTIONED Extra benefits from the project, along with possible dividends, will flow to the chief sponsor. The company figures the quarry will require a 58-man payroll-including Mr. Ruth at $15,000 a year and his son as gen- eral manager at $18,200. (The quarry is also expected to provide jobs for 120 truckers and maintenance workers; this will be an obvious gain for surrounding Pike County, where un- employment has been running more than twice the national average.) Meantime, the stated justification for the quarry project has come under challenge. Though Elkhorn insists the quarry is needed to help supply crushed-stone demand in this region, the two companies already established in the market argue otherwise. They have gone to court charging that the Elkhorn ven- ture is just the sort of \"unfair competition\" prohibited by the 1965 law that created the EDA. (On that ground and others, the agency at first rejected Elkhorn Stone's aid appli- cation.) Whatever the outcome of this challenged Sventure, some not-too-encouraging returns have come in on the $275 million in indus- trial and commercial loans made since 1961 by the EDA and its predecessor agency to more than 540 companies. Of this sum, about $14.4 million has been repaid and $6.7 million written off as lost. In addition, $11.9 million in loans gone sour are now being liquidated by sale of the assets put up as collateral; the EDA expects to recover at least 60% of this amount. No one is predicting that the quarry proj- ect will meet any similar fate, but opinion hereabouts is sharply divided on the benefits that will flow once Elkhorn starts marketing its stone. ELKHORN'S ARGUMENT To overcome EDA objections that the proj- ect represented unfair competition, Elkhorn stressed its estimate that the Appalachia highway program will require an estimated 5 million tons of crushed stone in its pro- jected Virginia-Kentucky-West Virginia mar- ket area, starting around mid-1968. The com- pany also argued that this market can't get all the crushed stone it now needs and must pay higher stone prices than other areas in the same general region. Some local business spokesmen backed this view. \"Users of construction aggregates are having to close down their operationsfor days at a time simply because they can- not get deliveries of crushed stone,\" Robert Holcomb, then president of the Pike County Chamber of Commerce, wrote the EDA in June, a few weeks before the agency finally approved the loan. But to Levisa Stone Corp. and Johnson Bros. Limestone Co., the two local firms that have brought suit against EDA officials and Elkhorn Stone, the situation looks very different. Levisa Stone of Pikeville, the larger of the concerns, quarries its limestone near Jen- kins, Ky., about 15 miles southwest of the Elkhorn site. L. J. Bryant, executive vice president, says Levisa could produce more than 415,000 tons of crushed limestone an- nually by operating its usual 50-hour week the year-round, but current market demand warrants operation at this rate, only 60% of the year. Because the Elkhorn site lies 15 miles closer to the proposed market area than does Levisa's stone-crushing operation, some transportation savings (usually figured at 5 or 6 cents per ton per mile) undoubtedly would result for Levisa customers who switched to the new supplier. However, this disadvantage would not apply to the second competing firm, John- son Bros. Limestone, whose quarry site is only two miles along the mountainside from Elkhorn's location. \"We can hear their bull- dozers at work,\" says partner James B. John- son. Johnson Bros.' crushed stone sales cur- rently run around 42,000 tons annually, or less than half the company's existing ca- pacity, Mr. Johnson asserts. But in view of highway construction plans, the firm has been working on an expansion program for the past three years and has contracted to buy more than $150,000 worth of new and used quarry machinery. As a result, capacity will rise to 250,000 tons annually by the middle of next year and ultimately could be expanded to 500,000 tons-\"more than sufficient to meet any reasonably foreseeable future demand for crushed limestone in the area,\" the suit alleges. DIVERGENT REPORTS Material submitted to EDA by Elkhorn in- cludes several questionable assertions about the Johnson Bros. firm. Consider the 60-page feasibility study prepared last October by John A. Stokley, a Lexington, Ky., geologi- cal engineer who has been retained by Elk- horn \"to assist (EDA) in evaluating the com- pany's loan request. Listing Elkhorn's com- petitors, the Stokley study dismisses John- son Bros. Limestone as \"having limited its production to about 75,000 tons per year and there is no plan to expand according to present information.\" Mr. Johnson, for his part, produces a land purchase contract to prove that his expan- sion program began over three years ago. Displaying Federal income-tax returns and suppliers' statements, he shows how monthly equipment payments caused Johnson Bros. profits to slide from nearly $30,000 in 1965 to $2,100 loss last year. Mr. Stokley never con- tacted him or his brother to discuss their plans, he asserts. Mr. Stokley, for his part, now says he \"must have been mistaken\" when he prepared the study. \"I know absolutely nothing about the Johnson Bros. operation,\" he concedes. \"We only used the data supplied us by Pike County business sources.\" A trial would presumably bring EDA offi- cials to the witness stand and permit a glimpse at the way they approve and reject loans. Recent court rulings suggest, however, that the Levisa-Johnson Bros. complaint may never be heard on its merits. Last year, W. S. Dickey Clay Mfg. Co. of Kansas City filed a similar action to bar a $975,000 EDA loan to a rival clay pipe concern. A lower court dis- missed the case, holding that the EDA's deci-34179 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 slons on what represents unfair competition \"are not judicially reviewable.\" An appeals court upheld the decision, noting that Con- gress didn't provide for any appeal to the courts. Now Government lawyers are asking dis- missal of the Johnson Bros.-Levisa suit on the same grounds; a hearing has been sched- uled for early next month. Coleman Stein, EDA's business develop- ment director and the man who takes re- sponsibility for approving Elkhorn's applica- tion, says the Small Business Administration, which conducts credit investigations on EDA loans, didn't inform his office of certain prior crushed limestone ventures undertaken by Mr. Ruth and other Elkhorn principals. A LEASING TRANSACTION In August 1960, for example, Cherokee Stone Co., a closely held concern headed by Mr. Ruth, contracted to lease a stone crusher, dump trucks, electric motors and other equip- ment to produce stone and sand from a Loudon County, Tenn., quarry. The equip- ment was valued at around $1.6 million, ac- cording to Richard Trippeer Jr., vice presi- dent of Trippeer Organizations Inc. of Mem- phis, which owned another company actually Involved in the leasing transaction. By Mr. Trippeer's account, Cherokee Stone Co. \"just walked away\" from the machinery at a quarry site, leaving it in a \"very, very bad state of repair.\" No one bothered to close the cover panels on heavy generator units, he says, and they rusted in wet weather. Trippeer's net loss was more than $500,000. \"It was a costly lesson,\" Mr. Trippeer laments, although he acknowledges that Cherokee Stone was under no legal obligation to continue using the leased equipment. In October 1965, however, Trippeer Organi- zations did charge in a Knox County (Knox- ville) court suit that Cherokee had failed to provide proper accounting of its quarry pro- duction, on which the lease payments were based. Trippeer claimed at least some $100,000 due in additional payments and interest but finally settled for about $50,000. Mr. Ruth, a rumpled 62-year-old, has had 40 years' experience in the construction and crushed stone business, four of them in Costa Rica managing Pan American Highway con- struction projects for a Frankfort, Ky., firm. During a recent interview at Elkhorn's sparse- ly furnished quarry office, he impatiently dismissed the Trippeer suit and a second legal fight involving a Cherokee quarry operation as routine hazards that almost any business- man may encounter. MAKING A LITTLE MONEY Of the Trippeer litigation, Mr. Ruth says: \"There's always two sides to a contract.\" As for criticisms of his management made by ad- versaries in the other case, \"That was a law- yer who wrote that up.\" Were those two ventures at least profitable for Cherokee Stone Co. \"We paid our bills and made a little money,\" Mr. Ruth answers. \"But knowing what I know, I wouldn't want to go through that kind of deal again.\" Mr. Ruth is more precise about the fate of an underground limestone mine that Ruth- controlled Gainesville Stone Co. sought to operate on property owned by Big Run Coal & Clay Co. at Princess, Ky. Big Run agreed to complete an access tunnel to the limestone bed some 600 feet below the surface; Gaines- ville was to dig and sell the stone. In February 1965, a few months after Gainesville's crew began digging into the limestone, a massive roof fall occurred. There was sufficient warning for the men to get clear, but a newly installed underground stone crusher, heavy trucks and other costly gear were buried or blocked in the mine. The final net loss to Gainesville, by Mr. Ruth's reckoning: $1,018,000. A LACK OF FORESIGHT Under \"competency of proposed manage- ment,\" the Stokley feasibility study omitsany reference to the disputed quarry opera- tions or the mine cave-in, while giving an impressive list of limestone mining quali- fications held by Elkhorn's key executives. Such details are unnecessary, Mr. Ruth suggests, because Gainesville Stone Co. is a successful company with sales now running at around $3 million annually. How Gaines- ville's profits have been affected by the cave- in losses, Mr. Ruth won't say. What Mr. Ruth will say, though, is that Elkhorn really didn't need Uncle Sam's $1,- 137,500 loan in the first place. He could have raised the money from other sources, he in- sists, but decided to seek Washington's aid because the Federal interest rate was cheaper. IS THAT A SUN PEEKING OVER THE HORIZON? Mr. WYMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. ZWACH] may ex- tend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Hampshire? There was no objection. Mr. ZWACH. Mr. Speaker, since 1952, 15 long years, farm prices have been on a general decline, despite the fact that we have a proliferation of farm organiza- tions, farm experts, and a Department of Agriculture all dedicated to the prop- osition of making life more prosperous down on the farm. One of the troubles with our farm or- ganizations is that they have been pull- ing at cross purposes. One organization believes that the law of supply and de- mand will solve all of the problems. An- other believes that all of the farm prob- lems can be corrected by the Govern- ment in Washington. Another believes that withholding actions will bring the needed relief. Lately, in the Minnesota Sixth Con- gressional District, these diverse-think- ing farm organizations have been hold- ing joint meetings in an effort to come up with a consensus, a common goal, a single solution. Mr. Speaker, not long ago such a joint meeting was held in Renville County, and more recently one was held in Lincoln County at which not only the major farm organizations but community clubs, chambers of commerce, and even the clergy were represented. One of the leading exponents of rural development in Minnesota is Don Olson, editor of the Marshall Messenger. At this time I insert in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD a recent editorial written by edi- tor Olson on the subject of joint farm organization meetings. Is THAT A SUN PEEKING OVER THE HORIZON? Since 1952 ...that is 15 long, wearisome years ago ...farm prices have been on a general decline while prices of almost every- thing else have been generally up. In the mid and late 50's, we were told this was a tem- porary thing. Huge stored surpluses of grain, an over- production of hogs and cattle and a declin- ing per capita consumption of dairy products were blamed for this situation. Production must be brought into line with consumption, we were told, In order for farm prices to rise. This was a cruel hoax. In years when less beef was produced in this country than was consumed, for example, beef prices fell to the farmer and rose to the consumer.It has become crystal clear that thereisn't even a kissin' cousin relationship be-tween the price the farmer received and thequantity he produces. The long-standing, well-established hoaxwas so successfully perpetrated on farmersthat: Farm Bureau members steadfastly be.lieved that the only thing wrong with agri.culture was that the law of supply and de-mand was not allowed to operate freely. Cetthe government out of agriculture, they said,and after an adjustment period, the freemarket period will work to the farmer'sadvantage. Farmers Union members steadfastly be-lieved that if anything was wrong with agri-culture, it could be corrected in Washington. GTA officials long have argued that \"farm prices are made in Washington.\" But attitudes and ideas are changing onthe farm front. If there is a sun peeking overthe horizon in rural America, it is the under- standing that farmers must change with the times. They must change in a dozen different ways, but the most basic change they mustaccept is the concept of cooperation ...par- ticularly in the marketplace. Agriculture has been fragmented inten- tionally and easily as farm organization has been pitted against farm organization. They have fought and hurt each other at every turn. But this also is changing. Many people may not realize it, but here in Southwestern Minnesota an experiment of inter-organization cooperation has been going on. Leaders of Farm Bureau, Farmers Union and NFO in Lincoln County have been meet- ing for over a year. On Nov. 27 these leaders will help host a \"Farm Price Forum\" at Ivanhoe that may es- tablish a pattern of cooperation for other farmers in other areas. In addition to farm- ers, business people, clergy and the Extension Service will participate. This afternon and evening meeting may be one of the most significant moves farm- ers in Lyon, Lincoln and Yellow Medicine Counties ever have made. It may signal the long awaited dawn! THE SOVIET UNION'S MILITARY DRAFT LAW Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani- mous consent that the gentleman from South Carolina [Mr. RIVERS] may ex- tend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Missouri? There was no objection. Mr. RIVERS. Mr. Speaker, at a time when certain malcontents in our society are making every possible effort to ob- struct the orderly administration of the Selective Service Act, it behooves all of us to ask what our potential enemies are doing in respect to compulsory military service. On October 13, 1967, Pravda carried the complete text of a report made by Deputy A. A. Grechko, U.S.S.R. Minister of Defense, on recent changes made in the Soviet Union's draft law. The report of the Soviet Defense Min- ister places great emphasis on the Soviet Union's traditional contention that it is \"surrounded by people, classes and gov- ernments that openly express extreme hatred for us,\" and consequently main- tains that every Soviet citizen has an obligation to perform military service. The Soviet Union's draft law not only requires military service from all its male citizens, but also requires military service34180 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE from women with medical or other spe- cialized training. It is significant that conscientious ob- jectors are not among the basis for de- ferment from military service in the Soviet Union. I find it particularly significant that, in addition to tightening its draft law, the Soviet Union has now directed that all young men, prior to their actual con- scription, will be exposed to a compul- sory period of introductory military training. This preliminary military training, to be conducted at the sec- ondary or high school level, will be under the direction of regular military instructors and, in the words of the Soviet Defense Minister, is intended to provide these young men with \"the pre- liminary military knowledge they need.\" The actions taken by the Soviets in respect to their draft law and the in- creased military training of all its citi- zenry, is merely a reflection of the heightened emphasis being given by the Soviet Union toward increasing its mili- tary capability. The terrible dangers implicit in this stepped-up military effort by the Soviet Union to the peace of the world and the security of the United States needs no elaboration. In view of these circumstances, I find it absolutely inconceivable that any knowl- edgeable American could fail to support the equitable provisions of our draft law and the reasonable efforts that we have made, in the draft law, to insure the security of the United States. I am sure that every Member of Con- gress will be interested in reading the full text of Soviet Defense Minister Grechko's report and I, therefore, in- clude it at this point in the RECORD: GRECHKO REPORT ON NEW MILITARY SERVICE LAW On draft law on universal military service- Report by Deputy A. A. Grechko, U.S.S.R. Minister of Defense. Pravda, Oct. 13, pp. 5-6; Izvestia, pp. 7-8. Complete text: Comrade Deputies! The Soviet government has submitted the draft of the new Law on Universal Military Service for consideration by the third session of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet. I have been instructed to report on the substance of this document. This question is of extremely great im- portance in the activities of our party and government in strengthening the country's defense capacity. As is known, the Law on Universal Mili- tary Service now in effect was adopted back in September, 1939, i.e., 28 years ago. Much has changed during this time. Enormous transformations have taken place in all spheres of our country's life. Demands for ensuring the security of the Soviet state and preparing the country's entire population for armed defense of the socialist homeland have increased still fur- ther in present-day conditions. Adoption of the new Law on Universal Military Service will deal with the changes that have occurred and will conform to the spirit of the Party's demands that our atten- tion be constantly focused on questions of the country's defense. The strengthening of the country's se- curity is an indispensable condition for suc- cessful implementation of the tasks of build- ing communism. This is conditioned by the presence in the world of aggressive im- perialist forces hostile to our system. Vladi- mir Ilyich Lenin pointed out that as longas society is divided into antagonistic classes, as long as there is imperialism, the threat of military adventures against the Land of the Soviets will persist. \"The first commandment of our policy, the first lesson all the workers and peasants must learn,\" V. I. Lenin said soon after the end of the Civil War, \"is to be on guard, to re- member that we are surrounded by people, classes and governments that openly express extreme hatred for us.\" In the years of Soviet rule our people have more than once had to take up arms to re- pulse the imperialist invaders, to defend the great accomplishments of October. Though the positions of imperialism have weakened considerably in the past half cen- tury, its aggressive essence has remained un- changed. \"The deepening of the general crisis of capitalism and the exacerbation of its contradictions,\" the decisions of the 23rd Party Congress state \"are increasing the ad- venturism of imperialism and its danger to the peoples, to the cause of peace and social progress.\" 1 This conclusion drawn by the 23rd Con- gress has been convincingly confirmed by the events of recent times. Under cover of talks about peace and co- operation, ruling circles in the United States of America are intensifying military prepara- tions against the Soviet Union and the other socialist countries and are creating danger- ous hotbeds of war in various areas of the world. The imperialists do not hesitate to use any provocations in their attempts to change the balance of forces in the world, to check the mighty stream of the liberation movement. American imperialism Is increasingly ex- panding the aggressive war against the Viet- namese people and is impudently interfer- ing in the affairs of other states by support- Ing antlpopular, reactionary regimes. In the last few months a dangerous hotbed of war has emerged in the Near East. Israel's attack on the Arab countries was the result of a conspiracy of international reactionary forces, first and foremost the United States of America, aimed against one of the detach- ments of the national-liberation movement, against the freedom-loving Arab states, which are pursuing an anti-imperialist policy. The American imperialists, acting in con- cert with the revanchist forces of the F.R.G., seek to complicate the situation in Europe as well. They are doing everything possible to keep the aggressive NATO bloc and their military bases on European soil. Ruling circles in Bonn have made the core of their policy their revanchist demands for a revi- sion of existing frontiers and the arming of the Bundeswehr with nuclear weapons. The policies of the imperialist powers, hostile to the cause of peace, freedom and the independence of peoples, and their ag- gressive actions in various parts of the world have exacerbated the international situation and are increasing the danger that a new world war will break out. Sincere champions of peace, Marxist-Lenin- ists have never been pacifists. They have al- ways supported just wars, on the premise that it is necessary to use all resoluteness and all available means to defend from im- perlalist aggression the achievements of the Revolution and the homeland's freedom and independence. The Communist Party and the Soviet gov- ernment are taking all necessary measures for further strengthening the country's de- fense capacity, for increasing the might of our armed forces. In the past few years alone a number of important decisions were adopted on mili- tary construction, which were aimed at fur- ther perfecting the organization of the SCurrent Digest of the Soviet Press, Vol. XVIII, No. 15, p. 4.troops, supplying them with new types of weapons and combat equipment, improving the training of military cadres and political- upbringing work in the army and navy, and other measures. Thanks to this, the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union have at their disposal everything necessary to carry out the task of defending the socialist father- land, the homeland of Great October. The soldiers of the Soviet Army and Navy, devoted to the Communist Party and their people, are persistently acquiring combat skill and increasing their combat readiness; through their selfless service to their home- land they have earned the appreciation and respect of all Soviet people. The Party, in all its activities in the sphere of military construction, proceeds on the premise that the strengthening of the country's defense capacity and the Armed Forces' combat strength is a task for all the people, for every citizen of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Present-day war, if unleashed by the im- perialists, will be a cruel war with extremely decided goals. It will cover an enormous amount of territory and will draw into its or- bit not only the armies, but also the popu- lations of the warring states. At the same time, it has become increas- ingly important to prepare the country's en- tire population to repulse the aggressors. This presupposes further improvement in the work of military-patriotic upbringing and the molding in the Soviet people of the nec- essary moral and psychological qualities to enable them to withstand the grim test of war. It also presupposes perfecting the en- tire matter of training young people for military service in the army and the navy. The new US.S.R. Law on Universal Mili- tary Service, the draft of which has been submitted for consideration by the present session, is aimed at further increasing the country's defense capacity and strengthening the U.S.S.R. Armed Forces. Leninist principles of building the armed forces, the foundation of the law now in effect, have withstr'od the test of time and demonstrated their force and viability. However, as already mentioned, great events and extensive changes have taken place over the past 28 years. Our people had to fight the Great Patriotic War, one of the grimmest wars mankind has known. The Soviet people and their Armed Forces won a world historic victory in this war. The rout of the fascist forces in Europe and also of Japanese militarism had an enor- mous effect on the entire course of world events, on the balance of power between socialism and capitalism. On the eve of the Great Patriotic War the Soviet Union was the only socialist power, and in fact its armed forces alone stood guard over the gains of socialism. Now the situation Is entirely different. In the postwar years the world socialist system took shape and was consolidated. Close co- operation in all spheres, including the mili- tary sphere, was established among the fra- ternal socialist countries. In response to the creation by the im- perialists of the aggressive NATO bloc, in May, 1955, the Warsaw Treaty was signed; it was an important contribution to the cause of ensuring the security of the coun- tries in the socialist commonwealth, of con- solidating peace in Europe and throughout the world. On the basis of common aims, tasks and historical missions, friendly rela- tions were established among the armies of the states participating in the Warsaw Treaty. The united forces of the imperialists are now opposed not only by the Soviet Un- ion and its armed forces, but also by the fraternal socialist countries and their armies. This circumstance has in turn confronted our state and its army with new tasks of an international nature.34181 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 After the adoption of the Law on Univer- sal Military Service now in effect, great changes took place within our country as well. The complete and final victory of social- ism was won. In the course of the construc- tion of socialism and communism, the al- liance of the working class and the collective farm peasantry was strengthened, as was the friendship among the peoples of the U.S.S.R. The Communist Party's leading role in So- viet society was enhanced still further. Immense growth took place in the Soviet state's economy. Soviet industry, the founda- tion of the homeland's might and prosperity, made great strides forward. Major successes were achieved in the development of agricul- ture. Science and technology soared enormously. Our country is approaching the 50th jubilee of Soviet rule in the prime of its strength, having reached great heights in all spheres of communist construction. This has been vividly and convincingly de- scribed at this session. The present-day level of the country's economic development is immeasurably higher than what it was on the eve of the Great Patriotic War, when the Law on Uni- versal Military Service was adopted. This year, for instance, the Soviet Union's industry will produce more than 5.5 times as much steel, more than nine times as much petroleum and almost 12.5 times as much electric power as it produced in the prewar year of 1940. Here it should be stressed that in recent years the greatest development has taken place in the branches of present-day industry, science and technology that are of primary importance in strengthening the country's defense capacity: power engineer- ing, metallurgy, electronics, machine and tool building, the chemical industry and other branches. The colossal growth of socialist industry and the structural advances in its develop- ment have made it possible to provide our army and navy with the latest military equipment-nuclear weapons, rockets for various purposes, supersonic aircraft, new tanks, atomic submarines and many other modern means of warfare. The technical equipment and combat po- tential of the Soviet Army and Navy differ substantially from what they were in 1939. The motorized infantry division of today, for instance, has 16 times as many tanks, 37 times as many armored carriers and armored cars, 13 times as many automatic weapons and five times as many radio communications instruments as the 1939 division; in quality too today's equipment is incomparably su- perior. The increase in the division's technical equipment has substantially strengthened its combat potential. For example, one mortar- artillery salvo in the 1939 division weighed 1,700 kg., while a salvo in today's division is equivalent to 53,000 kg. This does not include nuclear weapons, whose power is several hun- dred times greater. The division's motor pow- er looks like this: In 1939 per capita motor power came to three horsepower, while today it exceeds 30 hp. The same is true of every type of troops, of every branch of the Armed Forces. The Air Force has advanced during these years from aircraft with piston engines to today's jet aircraft flying at speeds of 2,500 to 3,000 km. an hour. The bomb salvos of jet aircraft are five times greater than the po- tential of the 1939 aircraft. The air force is armed with aircraft capable of making inter- continental flights in any weather and of striking powerful blows with rockets carrying nuclear warheads. Our navy is also qualitatively new. Atomic submarines have become its principal force. The motor power of today's submarine, as compared with its prewar forerunner, has in- creased almost 100-fold, the depth of sub- mersion has increased more than five fold, and its underwater speed has tripled to quadrupled-Submarines armed with ballistic rockets can destroy ships at distances of hundreds of kilometers and strike from beneath the water at strategic enemy targets thousands of kilo- meters away. As for the newer branches of the Armed Forces-the country's strategic rocket troops and anti-aircraft defense troops, which are armed with the latest combat technology and weaponry, with first-class equipment and ex- tremely complex apparatus-their striking power is colossal, and their combat potential is indeed incalculable. Comrade Deputies, from this high tribune allow me, on behalf of the army and navy personnel, to convey profound gratitude to the Party and the government for their con- stant concern for the country's armed forces. We thank the workers, scientists, engineers, technicians and the entire Soviet people for entrusting to us such formidable weapons, and we assure them that the Soviet fighting men will, if necessary, skillfully use these weapons for the defense of their homeland. (Prolonged applause.) Comrades The armed forces and their combat strength have been and continue to be greatly influenced by the profound social transformations effected in our country. Socialism has immeasurably enhanced and enriched the spiritual life of the Soviet peo- ple. In the time that has passed further ad- vances have been made in the spheres of peo- ple's culture and education. According to the 1939 census, 12.6% of our country's pop- ulation between the ages of nine and 49 were illiterate; now the Soviet Union is es- sentially a country without illiteracy. There has been a considerable increase in the num- ber of people with higher and secondary (complete and incomplete) education. In the period from 1939 to 1967 their number per 1,000 of the population increased from 83 to 360, i.e., almost 350%. The rise in the educational level of Soviet people produced a great change in the per- sonnel of the armed forces. I shall cite some data: In 1939 about 12% of the servicemen in army and navy cadres had higher or sec- ondary educations, 27.5% had incomplete secondary educations, and approximately 60.5% had elementary educations. At present the number of people among armed forces personnel with higher or secondary educa- tion has increased almost fourfold and amounts to about 46% of the total person- nel. The number of servicemen with incom- plete secondary education has increased to 54%, i.e., it has doubled, while the number of those with elementary education has de- creased by several dozen times and now ac- counts for fewer than one per cent. As for the officers, the level of their edu- cation has risen even more. Every fourth officer now has a military or other special- ized higher education. The proportion of en- gineering and technical personnel has more than tripled in comparison with 1945. The ranks of Communists and Young Communists in the army and navy have in- creased noticeably. In 1939 11.5% of those in the army and navy were members or can- didate members of the C.P.S.U., and about 41% were members of the Y.C.L. At present Communists account for 22% and Y.C.L. members for more than 60% of army and navy personnel. The enormous changes that have taken place in our country, the army and the navy, and the increased demands made on the training of people for armed defense of the homeland have made it necessary to revise a number of provisions in the Law on Uni- versal Military Service now in effect. It has become urgently necessary to bring all the provisions of the law into full conformity with the Party's present-day demands re- garding organization of the defense of the socialist fatherland.The draft Law on Universal Military Serv-ice will introduce a number of fundamen.tally new provisions into the system where-by U.S.S.R. citizens fulfill their honorableobligations. These provisions include suchimportant questions as reducing the termof active military service for soldiers, sail-ors, sergeants and master sergeants; estab-lishing a single conscription age for allcitizens; conducting two ayear instead of one; cutting down on de- ferments for citizens of conscription age;introducing elementary military training for young people; and other measures. Allow me to dwell briefly on the major provisions of the draft law. The draft law is entirely based on the re- quirements of Art. 132 of the U.S.S.R. Con- stitution, which reads: \"Universal military service is a law. Military service in the ranks of the U.S.S.R. Armed Forces is the honorable obligation of U.S.S.R. citizens.\" On this basis, it is established that active military service is obligatory for all male citizens of the U.S.S.R. regardless of racial or national origins, religion, education and social or property status. The draft law also provides for military service by women with medical or other specialized training. In peacetime they can be registered for military service, taken for training sessions and accepted as volun- teers for active military service between the ages of 19 and 40. On changes in the terms of active mili- tary service for soldiers, sailors, sergeants and master sergeants.-Reduction in the term of service is one of the most impor- tant changes being made in the law. It has a direct bearing on other questions con- nected with the performance of military service by U.S.S.R. citizens. The terms of active military service es- tablished by the 1939 law were changed a number of times for various reasons. In 1950, for instance, the term of service for privates in the ground and security troops was set at three years instead of two. In 1955 the length of military service was reduced from four years to three for air force sergeants and soldiers and or shore defense units and border guard ships, and from five years to four for chief petty offi- cers and sailors in the navy. Sailors and chief petty officers in the navy now serve four years, while all other soldiers and ser- geants in the armed forces serve three years. In addition, in 1965 a one-year term of service was established for those with higher education. The substantial increase in the general- education and technical level of Soviet young people and their high moral and physical preparation enable them to master military specialties, weaponry and combat technology more rapidly. In this connection it is proposed to re- duce the term of active military service by one year and establish the following terms: -two years for soldiers, sergeants and master sergeants in the Soviet Army and Naval Air Force, border guards and security troops; -three years for sailors and chief petty officers on navy warships, vessels and shore units and for border guard naval units. It is proposed to preserve the one-year term of service for those with higher educa- tion, since with higher education they can master military affairs and prepare to take the reserve officer examinations within this period. On the conscription age.-According to the law now in effect, citizens are called up for military service who become 19 in the con- scription year, whereas those who have gradu- ated from secondary schools or their equiv- alents are called up at 19. Thus there are ac- tually two conscription ages in our country- 19 and 18. Whereas there were grounds for this in the 1940s, when a minority of young people graduated from secondary schools, now34182 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE the situation has changed. The time is near- ing, moreover, when all our young people will receive secondary education. This circum- stance makes it necessary to have a single conscription age-18-since most young men graduate from secondary school at this age and their physical development enables them to perform their military duties successfully. The possibility of reducing the conscription age from 19 to 18 is corroborated by the prac- tice followed in admitting young men for in- struction at military academies. For many years boys of 18 have been admitted to mili- tary academies. All of them successfully mas- ter military affairs and, after graduating from the military academies, serve as officers in the armed forces for many years. On the basis of these data and taking into account the improvement achieved in the health of conscripted young people, the draft law provides that conscription for active mili- tary service should be established for young people who are 18 on conscription day. In having finished military service by the age of 20 and having gone through the army's school of upbringing and training, they will have more favorable conditions for continu- ing their education, finding jobs and arrang- ing their personal lives. It can confidently be said that reduction of the term of service for soldiers, sailors, ser- geants and master sergeants by one year and also establishment of 18 as the conscription age will be received with approval by our peo- ple. (Applause.) On conscription schedules.-According to the law now in effect, the main conscription of citizens for active military service takes place in November and December, and for units stationed in remote areas or abroad, in June and September. The tour of duty for all servicemen is calculated from the January 1 following the year of conscription. As a re- sult of such a procedure for conscription and calculation of tours of duty, many servicemen are actually compelled to serve longer than established by law. The draft law provides that conscription of citizens for active military service take place twice a year, at equal intervals: In May to June and November to December. All aspects of this question were thoroughly examined in preparing the draft law, and it was estab- lished that such a conscription procedure would create more favorable conditions for maintaining the troops' combat readiness at the necessary level. In addition, conscription at these times takes into account the inter- ests of our agriculture, since spring plowing is finished everywhere between May and June, and harvesting is completed between Novem- ber and December. The transfer of servicemen to the reserves will accordingly be conducted at the same time, i.e., twice a year. Those discharged from the armed forces in May and June will be able to go actively to work in the busiest period of agriculture, or prepare to enter edu- cational institutions. In connection with the introduction of the new conscription procedure, provision has been made to establish a new way of calcu- lating terms of active military service. Serv- iceman called up in the first half of the year (from May to June) will have their tours of duty calculated from July 1, while those called up in November-December will serve from the January 1 following the year of con- scription. This procedure will eliminate the existing gap between conscription and the be- ginning of the term of active military service. On training young people for service in the U.S.S.R. Armed Forces.-The interests of the country's defense and the changes that have taken place in providing the army and navy with the latest equipment and armaments require that more attention be paid to the young people conscripted for active military service and that they be really trained to de- fend the socialist homeland. Introductory, pre-conscription military training of young people in secondary andequivalent schools beginning with the fifth grade, which was established by the 1939 law, was abolished after the Great Patriotic War for a number of reasons. At the same time the increased demands made on soldiers and the reduction in the terms of military service make it necessary to train young people for service in the armed forces even before con- scription. Therefore, the draft law provides for establishing a system of introductory military training for young people. This training must be conducted on a compul- sory, planned basis for all young men of pre- conscription and conscription age, every- where, without interrupting their work in production or their schooling. In the process of introductory military training for boys of pre-conscription and con- scription age, our young people will be reared in the spirit of discipline and organization and will receive the preliminary military knowledge they need. All this will create the conditions in which the young people drafted into the armed forces will be able to master modern weapons and combat equipment more rapidly and become full-fledged soldiers. Introductory military training of young students is to be conducted by regular mili- tary instructors at general-education second- ary schools beginning with the ninth grade, and also at vocational-technical schools. Boys who do not attend daytime (non-cor- respondence) schools will receive Introduc- tory military training, without interrupting their work in production, at training points set up at enterprises, institutions, organiza- tions and collective farms. The interests of the troops' constant com- bat readiness and the strengthening of the country's defense capability require, along with introductory military instruction, the training of a number of specialists for the army and navy from among the conscripts. In this connection the draft law provides for training these specialists from among young people who have reached the age of 17, at the training organizations of the Voluneteer So- ciety for Cooperation With the Armed Forces and in vocational-technical schools. The number of specialists to be trained will be es- tablished by the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers. In the cities the training of specialists for the U.S.S.R. Armed Forces is to be conducted without interrupting production work. The young trainees are to receive leave of five to seven days, with average pay, from their jobs to take their examinations. In rural areas the training of such specialists can be conducted at sessions that interrupt production work during the autumn and winter periods. The list of these areas will be established by the Councils of Ministers of Union republics without province divisions, autonomous-re- public Councils of Ministers and territory and province Soviet executive committees. Conscripts recruited for training entailing interruption of production work are to keep their jobs and posts and receive 50% of their average earnings. On military service deferments for contin- uation of education. Under the 1939 law, no military service deferments were established for students at higher schools. Later, a decree of the Presidium of the U.S.S.R. Supreme So- viet granted deferments for continuation of education to all students at higher schools, including evening and correspondence schools. The draft law envisages deferments for ed- ucation only for students at daytime (non- correspondence) higher schools. This is a more expedient approach to the granting of education deferments to students at higher schools, since evening and corre- spondence schools have longer terms of study than daytime schools and no military train- ing is conducted in them. It should also be borne in mind that the evening and corre- spondence schools were created mainly for older citizens who in their time had been unable to enter daytime (non-correspond-ence) schools. It would be quite legitimate, therefore, for citizens to enter evening and correspondence higher schools after serving in the ranks of the armed forces. As to deferment for graduating from sec- ondary school, this remains just as stipulated in law now in effect, i.e., it will be granted up to the age of 20. At the same time, the draft law specifies deferments only for receiving one form (general or specialized) of second- ary education. Boys entering specialized sec- ondary schools after graduating from gen- eral-education secondary schools are not, under the new law, entitled to deferments for finishing these schools. This measure is aimed at seeing that draftees with secondary education are conscripted to serve in the ranks of the armed forces at the proper time. On deferments for family reasons.-Under the 1939 law, a conscript whose labor sup- ports a disabled parent, a wife with two or more chlidren, or brothers or sisters up to 16 years of age, in the absence of other persons or organizations who could assume their sup- port, is exempted for family reasons and is not conscripted for military service. In addition to the existing provision, the draft law envisages also granting a deferment for family reasons to a conscript whose labor supports a single, able-bodied mother with two or more children up to eight years of age if she has no other children able to work. Deferments will also be granted to con- scripts who, in connection with the deaths of their parents, were supported by other per- sons for ten or more years if the latter are unable to work. The range of those entitled to deferments for family reasons will thus be enlarged. On the maximum conscription age.-The law now in effect does not set a maximum conscription age. It merely says that those eligible for military service can be called up for a period of five years from the time they were transferred to the reserves. The new law defines this provision more precisely and establishes that persons who have received deferments or for other rea- sons were not called up for active duty within the established time limits can be conscripted into the ranks of the armed forces up to the age of 27. This creates more favorable conditions for all U.S.S.R. citizens to fulfill their military obligations. On active service of officers.-In the sphere of military construction the training and upbringing of military cadres devoted to the cause of communism and capable of skillfully commanding troops have been mat- ters of special concern to the Communist Party and the Soviet government. The draft of the new law in the main pre- serves the existing system of active service for officers. The changes and additions in- troduced on various questions respond to the needs of the armed forces' development at the present stage and ensure the solution of tasks in improving work with the officer cadres. On the basis of many years of practice, provision has been made to raise the maxi- mum age for active duty from 30 to 40 years for junior lieutenants and lieutenants, from 35 to 40 years for senior lieutenants, from 40 to 45 for majors and from 45 to 50 for colonels. This is aimed at reducing the transfer of officers to the reserves when they are com- paratively young and efficient. Provision has been made to settle the important question of calling up reserve offi- cers to the armed forces. Every year our armed forces are in need of specialists trained in civilian higher schools. In this connection, in recent years such specialists, by decisions of the government, have been called up to serve as officers in the armed forces. How- ever, their term of service has not been defined. The draft law makes provision for young specialists who are officers in the reserve to be called up for active duty in peacetime for34183 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 two to three years, after which they will re- turn to the national economy. The number of specialists subject to call-up will be deter- mined by the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers, on the basis of the interests of both the armed forces and the national economy. The call up of these persons for military service will enable them to fulfill their mili- tary obligations, as established by the law for all U.S.S.R. citizens, and to receive the necessary experience of serving as officers, which will be of great importance in in- creasing the country's defense capability. On the length of stay in the reserves for officers, sergeants, master sergeants, soldiers and sailors.-The length of stay in the re- serves for officers, sergeants, master ser- geants, soldiers and sailors is to be preserved in the new law just as established by the law now in effect, except for certain cate- gories of higher-ranking officers. It is proposed to reduce the length of stay in the reserves for women registered as eligi- ble for military service under the Law on Universal Military Service. According to the law now in effect, they must stay in the re- serves up to the ages set for men. Taking the hardships of military service into con- sideration, the draft law establishes the maximum age for women in the reserves at 50 years of age for officers and 40 years for sergeants and soldiers. On refresher training periods for reserv- ists.-The draft law in the main preserves the existing procedure for recruiting reserv- ists for refresher training in troop unit. At the same time it has been found expedient to reduce refresher training periods during the entire period in the reserves from 36 to 30 months and to reduce their number from six to four for the first [age] group of Cate- gory I reservists, and from nine to six for the first group of Category II reservists. On the rights of servicemen and reserv- ists.-The draft law provides that service- men and reservists called up for refresher training enjoy the full rights and bear all the responsibilities of Soviet citizens, as stipulated by the U.S.S.R. Constitution. Housing belonging to reservists on active military duty is to be retained for them, and they cannot be crossed off the waiting lists for housing. It is incumbent upon local Soviet execu- tive committees and directors of enterprises, institutions, organizations, collective farms and schools to provide servicemen transferred to the reserves from active or extended serv- ice with work no later than a month from the day of application, with due regard for their specialties and work experience. Those conscripted for active military serv- ice while studying at educational institutions retain the right to be enrolled, upon transfer to the reserves, to continue their studies at the same schools and in the same courses where they studied prior to conscription for military service. There is to be an increase in the material supplies for reservists called up for refresher training periods. Workers, employees and collective farmers called up for such training are to retain their jobs during the training periods and receive 75% of their average pay from their places of work, instead of the 50% stipulated by the law now in effect. Comrade Deputies! The draft Law on Universal Military Serv- ice fully serves the interests of the Soviet people and is fresh evidence of the concern of our party and its Central Committee for implementing Lenin's behests on defense of the socialist homeland. And we hope that the highest agency of state power-the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet-will favorably con- sider and will approve the submitted draft law. Implementation of this law poses great tasks for state and public agencies, minis- tries, departments and commanders and po- litical workers in the armed forces. It willbe necessary, first of all, to explain the im- portance of the new law and its contents to the entire civilian population and to army and navy servicemen. The new law will oblige all of us to pay greater attention to the work of training young people to serve in the armed forces and of improving the military-patriotic up- bringing of the population. There is much to be done in connection with the establishment of introductory mili- tary training. In a short period of time we shall have to create the material base, elab- orate the appropriate programs and prepare cadres of instructors to put it into effect. Adoption of the new Law on Universal Military Service will increase the responsi- bility of directors of enterprises, institutions, organizations, collective farms, state farms and educational institutions to see that all young men of pre-conscriptlon and conscrip- tion age receive good training for active mili- tary duty. In connection with the reduced terms of service, the role of the training organizations of DOSAAF, the technicums and vocational- technical schools in training specialists for the armed forces will be enhanced. The time required to put a young soldier into the line and give him mastery of complex materiel largely depends upon the quality of this training. The draft law provides a clearer definition of the obligations of the local Soviets to conduct the registration and conscription of citizens. As is known, conscription of citizens for active military service has been entrusted to local military and civilian agencies. In this connection the new law establishes that the Soviets' executive committees are obliged to take measures to ensure the appearance of citizens for registration and conscription, to provide premises equipped for this at the specified times, to assign doctors and service personnel, to organize festive send-offs of draftees to active military service and to dis- play the necessary concern for their families. Our people have profound respect for the armed forces. They have affectionately dubbed them the mighty shield of the home- land. The invincible strength of the Soviet state lies in the unity of the people and the army, in the wise leadership of the Leninist party. We do not doubt that the new law will be accepted with approval by all Soviet peo- ple. (Applause.) Comrade Deputies! Less than a month remains before the glorious jubilee-the 50th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution. The Soviet peo- ple approach this momentous date fully re- solved to give all their strength and energy to the cause of our great homeland's further prosperity. They will continue to display tireless concern for strengthening the defense capability of the country and our armed forces. Only growing military might brought to the highest point can cool the bellicose passion of the aggressors and can guarantee our country against any contingency. The Armed Forces of the Soviet Union have always been loyal guards of the achieve- ments of October. The personnel of the army and navy are day by day improving their combat mastery in difficult military labor, in order to be prepared at any moment to carry out with honor the orders of the homeland. At the recently completed large-scale exer- cises, which constituted the army's report to our people, to the Communist Party and to the Soviet government, the soldiers, ser- geants, officers and generals displayed lofty moral spirit and profound understanding of their tasks and demonstrated their readi- ness to perform their military duties with honor. Allow me to assure you, Comrade Deputies, and in your persons, the entire Soviet people, that our army and navy will continue to provide reliable watch over the constructivelabor of Soviet people, over the great causeof communism. (Prolonged applause.) FOREIGN AID FIZZLE Mr. GROSS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-mous consent to extend my remarks atthis point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Iowa? There was no objection. Mr. GROSS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to call attention to an article in Mon- day's Wall Street Journal by the eminent Washington economic consultant, Elgin Groseclose, of the firm of Groseclose, Williams & Associates. Mr. Groseclose reviews the tragic re- sults our foreign giveaway artists have brought to India by their mad rush to throw away the wealth of this Nation. He concludes-very correctly-that these handout experts have \"destroyed the Indian economy with their short- sighted programs.\" Of course, one of the prime examples of this flagrant waste is the $4 million AID junk deal in which these do-gooding bureaucrats allowed Napco Industries of Minneapolis to unload a wornout gear- making plant on the Indians at the ex- pense of the American taxpayers. Our foreign aiders have painted a truly dismal picture of failure on top of failure. When are we going to come to our senses and end this farce? The article follows: FOREIGN AI FIZZLE (By Elgin Groseclose) India, the largest recipient of foreign assistance with a total from all sources of some $10 billion, is today in its worst plight- economic, social and political-since it achieved independence. Some observers- though not this commentator-think India is on the brink of political dissolution, un- able to stand the strains of a diversity of language, religion, race and geography. The immediate tragedy, however, is the hunger and starvation. In many areas rice is not on sale two days a week, wheat one day a week; sugar is rationed and other commod- ities are also scarce. Foreign aid proponents attribute this condition to two short mon- soons, and no doubt conditions will improve this year with prospects of good harvests. Nevertheless the improvement can be only marginal. Agricultural output declined be- tween 1964-65 and 1965-66 by about 17% and has stayed about unchanged in 1966-67. The real income of farmers has generally de- clined. The country is in the grip of inflation with an increase of 19% in the wholesale price index between June 1966 and June 1967, and a 33% rise in the price of food articles during that period. Despite massive assist- ance from abroad, the government was com- pelled to devalue the rupee by more than one-third in 1966 and this has been ineffec- tive as indicated by a black market in which the rupee sells at a discount of up to 25%. The dismal truth is that foreign aid has not relieved India of its problems but has in fact compounded them. India has been en- couraged to embark upon an over-ambitious industrialization program, with resources vitally needed for food production diverted into extravagant industrial undertakings. Ac- cording to a leading industrial economist of India, foreign aid induced the government to over-plan its program by at least 20%. Due to the availability of American food grains, the government was led to neglect34184 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE agriculture with the result that production languished in relation to need. The govern- ment also extended its socialistic tendencies, with increased intervention in the market by controls, rationing, licensing and other tech- niques. To quote from the Government of India Economic Survey for 1966-67 on the food situation: \"Government intervention in the marketing of food grains rests on the premise, borne out by experience, that in conditions of acute shortage exclusive re- liance on private channels of distribution is inconsistent with the state responsibility for protecting vulnerable sections of the com- munity. Therefore, the period under review saw a major reinforcement of procurement operations, increased restrictions on private trade across state frontiers, and a substan- tial expansion of the public distribution sys- tem.\" All this makes very pleasant reading from a bureaucratic standpoint but the report goes on to state: \"Altogether the volume of retail sales via public channels rose from about 4.4 million tons in 1962 to 10.1 million tons in 1965 and nearly 14.1 million tons in 1966.\" IMPORTS AND GITrs Where did this 14.1 million tons come from? Only 4 million tons were procured by what was in effect government sequestration of crops from farmers. The report then ex- plains that a \"major catastrophe\" was averted \"largely as a result of substantial imports the bulk of which have been pro- vided as gifts or as loans on concessional terms by friendly foreign countries and in- ternational relief agencies. ...For the cal- endar year 1967 an import program of nearly 10 to 11 million tons is visualized. Of this, 4.3 million tons are covered mainly by food aid from the U.S.A., U.S.S.R., Australia, and Canada for the first quarter of the year.\" Thus, as one Indian commented, \"one of every five U.S. farms is working to feed India.\" Under the food requisitioning system, euphemistically described as an agricultural support price policy, from 40% to 60% of the farmers' marketings of cereals must be sold to the government at the government price. Since the requisition price was in 1966-67 70 to 75 rupees per quintal (equal to 220.46 pounds) against an open market price of be- tween 100 and 175 rupees, it would seem the government's policy is not one of agricultural support as in the U.S. (where support prices are higher than market prices) but rather an agricultural depressant policy. The government also sells the foreign aid grain at a subsidized price of around 60 to 65 rupees per quintal, thus further depressing the general market price and discouraging production for the market. The result of all this is that not only do farmers withhold grain from delivery, or produce only for their own need, but certain states also practice this avoidance. It should be borne in mind that India is a federation of states and that the central government does not exercise absolute authority. Consequently the states' governments are impelled to deliver only what their local interest dictates. The fact, recognized by many in India, is that as long as U.S. agricultural aid is made available, neither the government nor people have in- centive to improve domestic food sources. SPURIOUS THEORY India operates theoretically under a capi- talistic system but the system is not a free enterprise system. Curiously, the system tends to promote monopolies within the economy. This arises because under the gov- ernment-controlled economy licenses are re- quired to enter business and then quotas are imposed on how much the business can produce. The theory of this is excellent- to prevent any one producer from dominat- ing the market-but it proves spurious in practice.At the same time the government protects the licensed owner in his enterprise, regard- less of his high costs, not only by the quota but by prohibiting the import of foreign goods that might compete with his. The re- sult is to discourage any effort at efficiency, to keep prices high, and thereby to freeze the market in the interest of the protected producers. This explains why a system so deleterious and unwholesome is supported by the Indian industrial community despite grumblings about government regulation and red tape. The one who pays for all this is the pathetically destitute poor man. Foreign aid proponents, not content with having destroyed the Indian economy with their shortsighted programs, now propose to intervene further into that ancient culture. If they have thei\u007f way they will, in effect, by a population control program reduce the human population in the interest of the sub- human animal life. The population problem can be stated in two ways-either more peo- ple than the land can feed, or failure to grow enough food to support the population. Foreign aid theorists, carried away by statis- tics and baffled by their own failures to raise the living standards of the country, support a massive birth control or \"family planning\" program. Let us note that foreign aid enthusiasts have nothing to say about the equally dis- tressing overpopulation of cattle in India, where one may see the animals wandering aimlessly over the countryside, largely un- productive, eating the farmer's crops, and through city markets, nibbling on the green- grocer's produce. If the problem is elemen- tally one of bringing food production Into balance with food consumption, it would appear more logical to start at the animal level instead of reducing the human popula- tion in favor of the cattle. Because of the particular status of the cow in Indian culture, however-a culture which equates man with the animals, rather than as a creature \"made a little lower than the angels\" and \"worth more than many sparrows\"-foreign aid officials find it polit- ically more expedient to propose sterilizing human beings to sterilizing cattle. Thus, by continuing to ignore the fundamental moral and cultural problems of the country, in favor of short-cut \"crash programs,\" foreign aid proponents succeed only in complicating their task, frustrating their hopes and post- poning solutions. SECRETARY McNAMARA'S PENDING RESIGNATION Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentle- woman from Hawaii [Mrs. MINK] may extend her remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. Mrs. MINK. Mr. Speaker, along with many of my colleagues I heard the news of Robert McNamara's nomination for the presidency of the World Bank with mixed emotions. There can be no doubt in anyone's mind that this dedicated American's service as Secretary of De- fense over the past 7 years has set as high a standard of personal sacrifice for the public good as we have seen in the annals of American Government. Com- bining his keen intelligence and bound- less capacity for hard work and in- volvement in the multiplicity of detail involved in administration of our largest Federal agency, Secretary McNamara has set an example that will be difficultfor any successor to live up to, and we will sorely miss his firm hand at the controls of our vast Defense Establish- ment. For a man who could have spent these years enriching himself in private business to answer the call to duty as he has, and to endure through such difficult times, both for himself and for the coun- try, I am certain has contributed greatly to the posture and security of the United States in the world today. In paying tribute to this outstanding public servant, I want to wish him well as he moves closer to assuming the leadership of the World Bank. I know that he will acquit himself there with as much distinction and success as he achieved as Secretary of Defense, and I am sure that I echo the sentiments of the country in thanking Bob McNamara for a job superbly done. He will carry with him our respect and our gratitude, along with our hopes that his experienced counsel will continue to be heard on matters of great importance to the Nation. TOWARD PEACE IN VIETNAM Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentle- woman from Hawaii [Mrs. MINK] may extend her remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. Mrs. MINK. Mr. Speaker, as the Christmas and New Year's seasons ap- proach once again and we hear that truces in the Vietnam fighting are being contemplated as in past years, I am hope- ful that the true meaning of these holy seasons, both American and Vietnamese, will lead to ever-increasing efforts on both sides to bring this disastrous con- flict to a permanent cessation so that the people of Vietnam may look toward a new dawn of peace after their long travail and may anticipate the reorder- ing of their lives back to the normal day-to-day pursuits which we in this country take for granted. As a reminder to the leaders of the nations involved in the Vietnam war, I wish to insert in the RECORD my own ap- peals for peace during the past 12 months, along with my fervent prayer that the good will of the peoples of both countries will become the overwhelming and irresistible impetus for a permanent cease-fire in Vietnam: HOLIDAY TRUCE AsGEEMENTS IN 1966 (December 20, 1966, letter to the President signed by Representative PATSY T. MINK and 16 other Congressmen) President LYNDON B. JOHNSON, The White House, Washington, D.C. DEAR MR. PRESIDE\u007fr: We note with ap- proval your decision to maintain cease-fires in Vietnam at Christmas and New Year's, and your offer for a 48-hour truce during Tat, the Vietnamese New Year. We sincerely hope that these brief truces may be extended, and we are pleased to learn that you are considering proposals to accom- plish this end. We wish to add our voices to those of Pope Paul VI and the National Council of Churches in support of an extended cease- CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 fire. Specifically, we urge you to announce that the United States will agree to a con- tinuous cease-fire, including ground, air, and naval warfare, from December 24 through January 2. If this truce is honored we rec- ommend that you offer to extend it through the Vietnamese New Year which occurs on February 8, in order to facilitate negotia- tions for an honorable settlement. We believe that an extended cease-fire in Vietnam might well create an atmosphere in which peace talks can begin and the war can be terminated on an honorable basis. With best regards. 1967 SUPPLEMENTAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION (Speech in CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, vol. 113, pt. 4, p. 5134) Mr. Speaker, I voted today for the supple- mental appropriation. I wish to state that this vote should not be interpreted to mean that I support the escalation of the war in Vietnam. I voted for the supplemental ap- propriation only because our men in Viet- nam who are there at the will of this govern- ment need these funds for their personal security and safety. Until we can urge our government to proceed with the necessary moves toward a negotiated settlement, I believe that I have a moral obligation to provide these men with whatever is deemed necessary for their personal safety. Many who view this War in Vietnam with concern and dismay have urged me to vote against this supplemental appropriation as an affirmation of belief that Peace can be negotiated and that a further escalation Is not necessary. If the measure before us was merely this simple question, I would have no hesitation to make such a reaffirmation. But this appropriation bill is not such a simple measure, for underlying it all is the consideration for the lives of 414,000 men in Vietnam who are there under orders by the government of the United States. I cannot find the justification in my conscience to use this fund request as an occasion to regis- ter my protest against the policies of escala- tion in Vietnam. The President in his State of the Union message on January 12, 1966, stated clearly that- \"We fight for the principles of self-de- termination ...The people of all Vietnam should make a free decision on the great question of reunification\" ..\"We have also made it clear from Hanoi to New York that there are no arbitrary limits to our search for peace\" ..\"We stand by the Geneva Agreements of 1954 and 1962\" .. \"We will meet at any conference table. We will discuss any proposals-4 points or 14 or 50-and we will consider the views of any group. We will work for a cease fire now, or once discussion have begun ... We have said all this and we have asked and hoped and we have waited for a response\". ... So far we have received no response to prove either success or failure. We have carried our quest for peace to many nations and peoples because we share this planet with others whose future, in large measure, is tied to our own action and whose counsel is necessary to our own hopes. We have found under- standing and support, and we know they wait with us tonight for some response that could lead to peace.\" I believe that we have now had such a response from Hanoi In the numerous re- ports recently carried in the capitals of many nations. Where once there was a flaunting unequivocal demand that the United States withdraw all troops from Vietnam before any consideration for a settlement, today we hear of pleas for the cessation of the bombing of North Vietnam, emanating from Hanoi it- self. I know that thousands of Americans are as bewildered as I am over our refusal to consider this retraction on the part of Hanoias that \"response\" which we were searching for only a year ago. Instead of only a re- sponse from Hanoi, is it now our position that we demand a promise of cessation of hostilities in advance of negotiations? Has our increased military effort in Vietnam now prompted a more ambitious course of action? Are we now demanding surrender as a pre- requisite to \"peace\" talks? I know that our military capability reasons for such concili- ation on the part of Hanoi. It is this very departure from the President's own words spoken scarcely a year ago that causes me to remind this country again of this promise of faith and earnest intentions to do all that is necessary for peace in Vietnam. On April 7, 1965, months before we landed our military forces on the shores of Vietnam, the President in a speech at Johns Hopkins University said: \"We will never be second in the search for such a peaceful settlement in Vietnam. There may be many ways to this kind of peace: in discussion or negotiation with the governments concerned; in large groups or small ones;\" ... And we remain ready-with this purpose-for unconditional discus- sions\" ...We have no desire to devastate that which the people of North Vietnam have built with toil and sacrifice. We will use our power with restraint and with all the wisdom we can command.\" I believe that that time for restraint and wisdom is now. Pope Paul VI in September 1966 said, \"Let all those responsible strive to bring about those necessary conditions which will lead men to lay down their arms at last, before it becomes too late to do so owing to the mounting pressure of events.\" I have no wish for this country to assume any unnecessary risks, and I would not advocate any step which I earnestly believed would amount to such a risk. There is no question in my mind that Hanoi is hurting badly from our bombing of the North. In the words of our President in January of 1966, we began that bombing, \"to give courage to the people of the South and make our firm- ness clear to the North. Thus, we began limited air action against military targets in North Vietnam.\" On the essentiality of the bombing of the North to the security of our defense operations on the South, Secretary McNamara has said, \"I don't believe that bombing up to the present has significantly reduced, nor any bombing that I could con- template in the future would significantly re- duce the actual flow of men and material to the South.\" I therefore feel compelled to conclude that we could have made a reply to that response for which we have waited so long from Hanoi and agreed to cease the bombing of the North, and then made a public plea for the convening of a conference \"without preconditions\" and \"at any place\" calling upon the nations of the world to intercede in laying the groundwork for the parties to meet and to discuss the means to achieve our hopes for peace in Vietnam, together with the guarantees of the rights of all Vietnamese to determine for them- selves their own destinies. I do not doubt that this Nation possesses the power and will to bring the enemy to his knees. As this war continues, the vast ma- jority of the people of this country will seek this solution as the only means to end this brutal conflict in order to bring our sons and husbands home from these foreign lands. I can see the beginnings of unreasoned ar- gument taking hold, and fear that unless we move with greater conviction that what we have done thus far is right, this Nation will be moved to a wider and wider war of all-out military victory in which no small voice for peace will ever again have a chance to be heard amid the cries that patriotism to our country demands only that the enemy surrender. Should it ever again happen, I hope soon, that a friendly nation speak to us, if evenever so softly that another \"peace feeler\"has been sounded from Hanoi, I would hopethat in a great testimony to our dedicationto Peace, our President will find it possibleto interpret it as a call for peace, and withall the honor that I have found in his pro-nouncements of the past, magnify it intothose first most difficult steps to the con-ference table. AGAINST THE BOMBING OF HAIPHONG HARBOR (May 5, 1967, letter to the President signedby Representative PATSY T. MINK and 28other Congressmen) DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: We are disturbed bythe growing number of reports that the Ad-ministration is under great pressure, some of it from Members of Congress, to attack Hal- phong harbor or seek to impose a blockade. In the past, Administration spokesmenhave pointed out that such action would be a direct challenge to the Soviet Union and would inevitably compel the Soviets to take some counter-vailing steps. The Soviet Union would in all likelihood escalate the nature of its military aid and support for North Viet- nam. Its policy of relative restraint wouldthus be jeopardized, as would the many ef- forts toward detente with the Soviet Union which the Administration has so carefully initiated. The closing of Haiphong harbor would, moreover, drive North Vietnam into even greater dependence on Peking. We have found the Administration's argu- ments against such action and its possible consequences highly persuasive in the past. We believe in their validity today. We hope, therefore, that the Administration will givethem continued consideration and emphasis in the future. SEEK A UNITED NATIONS SOLUTION (May 24, 1967, letter to the President signed by Representative PATSY T. MINK and 59 other Congressmen) The PRESIDENT, The White House, Washington, D.C. DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: We are profoundly aware of the enormous pressure on your office during these most difficult days. Your efforts to find a basis for peace in Vietnam have been strenuous and sincere. We appre- ciate those efforts and urgently hope they will continue. We believe it is crucial that all concerned continue to explore every avenue in the search for peace in Vietnam. And we be- lieve the machinery of the United Nations should be put to use in that search. In February, 1960, Ambassador Arthur Goldberg presented the matter to the Secu- rity Council and after considerable debate the Security Council agreed to place the situation in Vietnam on its agenda. Since that time, so far as we are aware, no further steps have been taken in the Security Council. We respectfully suggest that the time has arrived when a further effort should be made by the United States to seek action in the Security Council in support of our en- deavors to achieve a peaceful settlement. Sincerely. CONCERN OVER FREE ELECTIONS IN SOUTH VIETNAM (August 10, 1967, statement by Representa- tive PATSY T. MINK and 56 other Congress- men) STATEMENT ON FORTHCOMING ELECTIONS IN SOUTH VIETNAM The undersigned members of Congress are deeply disturbed by developments in South Vietnam with regard to the coming elec- tions. Reports from Saigon give us concern that such elections will be viewed as little more than a sham unless remedial measures34186 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE are undertaken immediately by the Ky gov- ernment and the military group in author- ity. For example, statements attributed to premier Ky threaten seizure by military coup in the event the election should produce results unacceptable to him. The implication of this statement is that only a Thieu-Ky victory will be acceptable to authorities now in power. Last Friday, the New York Times corre- spondent reported: \"The generals who rule South Vietnam are at work on a plan that would perpetuate collective government by the Junta despite the election of a President, Vice-President and Congress. \"Informed sources said that senior officers in the army had taken the first steps toward the formation of a 'Military Affairs Commit- tee' which would formulate national policy in much the same way as the armed forces leadership has done for more than two years. \"We think democracy is coming too soon to Vietnam,\" one general recently told an American friend. \"There is a war to fight. The army must remain powerful. We are willing to go along with the voting, but things must come out right.\" The unfortunate incident at Quang Tri on August 6 where the non-government pres- idential candidates were not furnished the facilities to meet with voters at a scheduled campaign meeting must be viewed with sus- picion. Certainly the government, which has control of transportation facilities, must as- sume the responsibility that all candidates will be given the opportunity of meeting their formally scheduled campaign commit- ments. We deplore these developments. Our coun- try has sought to foster democratic political institutions to give the government of South Vietnam a more representative character. Our Secretary of State has expressed pride in the fact that through widespread popular par- ticipation, a Constituent Assembly was elected and a constitution drafted and adopted. Despite certain serious limitations these provided a basis and framework for meaningful elections and representative gov- ernment. It would appear now that arbitrary and selfish action on the part of the military authorities places our determined and pains- taking effort in jeopardy. The message of America to the world is the message of self-determination, of enabling people to make their own decisions through a constitutional election process. In his Freedom House speech on March 16, 1966, President Johnson said: \"Men ask who has a right to rule in Viet- nam. Our answer there is what it has been here for 200 years. The people must have this right-the South Vietnamese people and no one else. Washington will not impose upon the people of South Vietnam a government not of their choice. Hanoi shall not impose upon the people of South Vietnam a govern- ment not of their choice * * * We stand for self-determination-for free elections-and we will honor the result.\" The people of South Vietnam are entitled to exercise their voting privilege free from governmental threats and pressures. They should be given a free choice of candidates, and a full and free discussion of all issues. A South Vietnamese government elected in a fair election will command a loyalty and devotion to the nation which is not now in widespread evidence. A South Vietnamese government elected under the conditions laid down by the Ky government and the military group can command little respect and little allegiance. To the President's eloquent Freedom House statement, there should be added the ad- monition that the military group should not limit the freedom of choice given the people of South Vietnam. If the governmen- tal authorities of South Vietnam continueto refuse to assure free and fair elections, they should be informed that the United States may very well undertake a serious re- appraisal of its policies in Vietnam. We urge the President to make the strong- est representations that steps be taken promptly to prevent a further eroding of confidence in the elections. For the United States to press for truly free elections in Vietnam is to reaffirm our principles and our objectives. For the elections to be consid- ered no more than a mockery in South Viet- nam and throughout the rest of the world would be a tragedy. HALT THE BOMBING OF NORTH VIETNAM (October 12, 1967, letter to the President signed by Representative PATSY T. MINK and 29 other Congressmen) DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: Since April, 1965, you have often stated your desire to seek peace in Vietnam through negotiations. With this we strongly concur. Yet, we have become increasingly alarmed at the continued escalation of bombings by American planes over North Vietnam. The bombing of targets close to the Chi- nese border, and of the port cities of Cam Pha and Haiphong conflicts with the care- fully reasoned and factual analysis presented prior to those steps by Secretary of Defense McNamara on August 25, 1967. We refer par- ticularly to the Secretary's contention that \"our resort to a less selective campaign of air attack against the North would involve risks which at present I regard as too high to accept for this dubious prospect of suc- cessful results.\" Obviously the risks to which Secretary McNamara referred are catastrophic involve- ment with Communist China and the Soviet Union, including the possibility of nuclear war. The policy of bombing in the North has been tried and has failed to accomplish its objectives of significantly reducing the in- filtration of men and supplies into the South and of bringing the Hanoi government to the negotiating table. We hold, therefore, that the time has come for the United States to halt the bombing of North Vietnam. The United States position in the world is strong enough to do so. Such a course, in our view and that of prominent statesmen throughout the world, best prom- ises to open the way for a reasonable and peaceful settlement of this tragic conflict. Respectfully yours, HONOLULU STAR-BULLETIN INTERVIEW, OCTO- BER 13, 1967 1. ON THE BOMBING OF NORTH VIETNAM Since early in 1967, I have sought and urged the cessation of the bombing of North Vietnam. I believe that if negotiations are to commence, there must be an end to the bombing of North Vietnam. This has been urged by leaders of as many as 25 countries at various times since the bombing began. Most of these countries are part of our \"Free Western\" bloc of nations, and I be- lieve that our concurrence with their view will help to engage a settlement on a multi- nation basis. Our own unilateral military policy to bring Peace in Vietnam has failed, and I believe that Peace can only be achieved now through the initiative of other nations whose involvement is predicated upon our cessation of the bombing of North Viet- nam. I believe Secretary McNamara's ap- praisal of the bombing that it has not mate- rially reduced the infiltration of men and material from the North, and thus I am not at all persuaded that the bombing must con- tinue as a matter of security for the lives of our men in South Vietnam. Since the bombing has not brought us closer to Peace, it is imperative that we develop a new strategy which will enable our inter-national friends to call for an immediate conference. 2. ENLARGING THE BOMBING TO INCLUDE HAI- PHONG HABROR AND HANOI Since December 11, 1965, I have been op- posed to any plans to bomb Haiphong Har- bor or Hanoi, and I am still against this dangerous widening of the war. 3. ABOUT POSSIBLE INVASIONS OF NORTH VIETNAM I am opposed to any plans to invade North Vietnam with troops as contrary to the President's stated policy of seeking an end to this war through negotiations. Such an invasion would further escalate the war and be susceptible to no other conclusion than that we are incapable of developing a course of action which could lead to a settlement, and instead are altering our course to one of an all-out military strategy. 4. A BOMBING PAUSE I do not believe after a policy of continued escalation of our war effort during the past 18 months that a mere pause in the bombing on our part for a stated period will have any positive results for a peaceful settlement. Such a pause of significant length during the early months of this year or in 1966 might have been successful, but it is my opinion that this kind of strategy is now without promise for success. I must, however, support President Thieu's recent announcement that he will himself call for such a pause and in conjunction therewith seek a meeting with Ho Chi Minh, for this is a new approach and so long as there is a scintilla of hope that it could bring the desired results we must give it every possible encouragement. 5. WITHDRAWAL FROM VIETNAM I still believe that the President's state- ment of April 7, 1965, made at Johns Hopkins University at Baltimore, Maryland, is the rea- son for our presence In Vietnam, and until he publicly disavows these important words, I shall support our presence in Vietnam. The President said in effect that we are there at the request of the government of South Viet- nam to protect the peace and security of these people, that we are not at war against any government, nor do we seek any con- quest or any exercise of dominion over an Asian territory, that we are only committed to preserve the security of the people of South Vietnam against external aggression. So long as that external aggression exists as a threat against the people of South Vietnam, I agree we cannot withdraw. However, our presence and commitment there does not authorize our engagement beyond the bor- ders of South Vietnam and I am thoroughly in opposition against any such plans and policies to extend our efforts beyond those boundaries. 6. WHAT MINIMUM TERMS SHOULD THE UNITED STATES HAVE FOR PEACE IN VIETNAM I believe that we have only two interests in Vietnam. One, the protection of the people of South Vietnam against external aggression from without; and two, the assurance that the people will have an opportunity to determine the kind of government they want without any intervention by any outside power. The President said In October of 1966 that given these assurances that he was prepared to withdraw the U.S. forces in an orderly manner within six months. This I believe is still the policy of the government of the United States which I support. TRAGEDY AVERTED-NEED FOR FEDERAL SAFETY STANDARDS FOR TRANSMISSION AND STOR- AGE OF NATURAL GAS Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentle- man from Michigan [Mr. O'HARA] may CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. Mr. O'HARA of Michigan. Mr. Speak- er, what could have been a major tragedy was narrowly averted in my congressional district recently when a leak from a natural gas well was sealed up without an explosion and without loss of life to workmen or residents of the area. But before the well was sealed off, it was nec- essary to evacuate 150 families and to discontinue telephone and utility serv- ices in that area for fear that a spark might ignite an explosion. Gas was able to escape from the well as the result of a freakish natural rock formation. This gravely dangerous situ- ation was able to occur even though the company drilling the well had appar- ently taken the precautions normally re- quired for such operations. The recent events in my district, as well as the gas explosion in St. Louis of a couple weeks ago, spotlight once again the great danger to the public which.can result from the drilling, transporting, and storing of natural gas. Natural gas plays a vital role in power- ing the industrial economy of the United States. And, as we all know, Mr. Speaker, it is one of the major sources of power for the myriad of laborsaving devices used in the moder American home. I sup- pose we must be willing to accept some measure of increased danger as the price to be paid for all the convenience added to our lives by this power source. But it is intolerable to expect people to expose their families and homes to the threat of destruction by unsafe and substandard procedures for the transmission and storage of this gas. Our colleagues in the Senate recently acted favorably upon the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1967. Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing a very similar bill for consideration by the House of Representatives. My bill is identical in coverage to the Senate bill. The only dif- ference is that I have added a few clari- fying amendments to the definitional sections of the proposal. My amendments merely serve to make clear that storage areas are included within the scope of the act. Gas is stored in both aboveground and underground facilities. There are over 300 depleted oil and gas fields and under- ground cavities which once held water now being used for the storage of natural gas. In the State of Michigan alone, there are 27 such gas storage fields, and two of them are in my home county, Macomb County. Rapid urbanization of areas like Macomb County bring once-isolated gas storage areas into dangerous proximity of homes and schools. The same is true of the hundreds of thousands of miles of pipelines which carry natural gas from fields in Texas, Oklahoma, and other oil- and gas-producing States into the urban regions of the North such as the Detroit metropolitan area. Mr. Speaker, the Senate hearings pro- vided ample evidence of the need forFederal safety standards for the trans- mission and storage of natural gas. I be- lieve that the Senate bill, with my clarify- ing amendments, is a good bill and I urge prompt action on it by the House. FIRST DIAL TELEPHONE IN WORLD SET UP 75 YEARS AGO IN LA PORTE, IND. Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentle- man from Indiana [Mr. BRADEMAS] may extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. Mr. BRADEMAS. Mr. Speaker, just 75 years ago this November the first dial telephone exchange in the world was set up in La Porte, Ind., in the congres- sional district I have the honor to repre- sent. This event marked the introduc- tion of the automatic dialing system that eventually spread throughout the world as the forerunner of today's direct distance dialing. At this moment, 98 percent of the more than 200 million telephones in the world are dial oper- ated. On the occasion of this telephone milestone I would like to pay tribute to a Government agency, the Rural Elec- trification Administration, for helping to bring the benefits of the modern tele- phone to the rural people of the Nation, and to my State in particular. More than one-quarter million rural residents in Indiana now enjoy this modem mir- acle of communication, thanks in large part to the REA telephone loan program. When the telephone loan program was authorized by Congress in 1949, roughly 60 percent of the farms in Indi- ana had telephones, and much of this service was obsolete. Today, nine of every 10 of the State's 116,000 farms, as well as many rural homes and busi- nesses, have telephones, and a much greater proportion enjoy modern dial service. Moreover, the announced and con- tinuing objective of REA is to achieve for rural subscribers dial telephone service under rates and conditions com- parable to those available in towns and cities, with single-party service being a long-range goal. From its inception 18 years ago until July 1, this year, REA had approved al- most $30 million in loans to 28 tele- phone borrowers in Indiana, including 18 commercial companies and 10 co- operative associations. Of these, 24 borrowers had reported to REA by the first of this year that they had placed in operation 76 automatic dial exchanges serving rural subscribers. I know I do not have to dwell on the importance of the telephone in modem living-rural and urban. Every time we call a friend or phone a druggist for a prescription or simply call home we're grateful for the service a telephone gives us. And particularly in times of emer- gency when we need a doctor, a police- man or to report a fire, the telephone is the first instrument we reach for.By making this kind of telephone serv-ice available in the rural areas of thisNation through its telephone loan pro-gram, REA has earned the gratitude ofmillions of rural residents throughoutthe United States. For a small agency it is doing a big joband in Indiana we know it. ADDRESS OF SENATOR WAYNEMORSE, OF OREGON, AT THE GEN-ERAL SESSION OF THE JOINT CON- VENTION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE UNIVERSITIES ANDLAND-GRANT COLLEGES, ANDTHE ASSOCIATION OF STATE COL- LEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, NO- VEMBER 14,1967, COLUMBUS, OHIO Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, Iask unanimous consent that the gentle-man from Indiana [Mr. BRADEMAS] mayextend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter.The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is thereobjection to the request of the gentlemanfrom Mississippi? There was no objection. Mr. BRADEMAS. Mr. Speaker, fewMembers of the House of Representativesor Senate of the United States have con-tributed more to the cause of supporting education at every level than the dis-tinguished senior Senator from Oregon,the Honorable WAYNE MORSE. As chairman of the Education Sub-committee of the Senate Committee onLabor and Public Welfare, Senator MORSE has played a particularly signifi-cant role in helping shape much of theextraordinary record of education legis-lation of recent years. I insert at this point in the RECORD thetext of an excellent address delivered bySenator MORSE on November 14, 1967, atthe general session of the joint conven-tion held by the National Association ofState Universities and Land-Grant Col- leges and the Association of State Col-leges and Universities, in Columbus,Ohio. Senator MORSE'S remarks on thisoccasion are eloquent testimony to hisvigorous leadership and dedicated effortin support of strengthening Americaneducation. The text of the address follows: QUESTIONS AS BIG AS THE WORLD AND As EN- DURING AS ETERNITY (Address of Senator WAYNE MORSE, Democrat, of Oregon, chairman, Education Subcom- mittee, Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare to the general session of thejoint convention, National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges,Association of State Colleges and Univer- sities, November 14, 1967, Columbus, Ohio) President Jensen, Distinguished Guests, Members of the Associations, and friends: We live it seems in the decade of the cen- tennial observance. So many advances made in the past 100 years are being reviewed, asin area after area courses are charted for the next moves forward. This is as it should be. We can gain a per- spective, if we pause to look back from where we started, so that we can gain for the time that it takes to breathe, a respite from the pressure to move onward to our dimly seen goals. This great audience of distinguished men and women who are dedicated to under- standing and transmitting the knowledge of34188 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE the past, and through that understanding transmuting it and minting it anew for each generation of students, is visible proof that an idea can become reality through faith and works. For it took both to bring into being the great institutions of learning which comprise your Associations. You are a great national treasure and a unique national resource whose value increases each year to all of our citizens. You are a national treasure, because from your laboratories, your libraries and classrooms come the men and women who serve all of their fellow citizens, in industry, government, labor, business and agriculture. surely these products of your teaching are the only lasting treasure that a nation can have. You are a unique resource, because of your origins. You carry on proudly the American tradition of democracy. You are not ashamed to stem from the colleges of the mechanic arts of your founding, for you realize that the dream of the architect must be based upon engineering principles, that the voice of the advocate or the hand of the surgeon is to be used in the service of the client, unstintingly, and regardless of ability to pay. This is the goldsmith hallmark of the pro- fessional. That he performs his service to meet and answer human needs. It is a sign of the discipline you have accepted that you do not measure the quality of your offering by the monetary reward you receive. So I salute you for the past services each of you, and each of your associations has rendered to the common good. I thank you as the representative of the people of the United States for the contributions you have made in every area and discipline. I am con- fident that in more than full measure you will fulfill the tasks and obligations that the century ahead will bring. It is fitting that a prophetic voice of forty years ago should again be heard on an oc- casion such as this: Does the metal of it still ring true? \"Secondary education is asleep. It is dreaming of I.Q.'s, of discipline as against supervision, of conformity to the require- ments for college, of methodologies, of peda- gogies, of the isness of many inconsequen- tial whys-but for questions as big as the world and as enduring as eternity, she has neither eye nor ear. Human relationships, the struggle against war, the economic chaos of the world, hate between races and re- ligions, the moral delapidation of mankind, the disintegration of the fireside, the appar- ent triumph of the material over the spirit- ual-all these receive but a passing glance.\" John Dewey spoke of secondary education, but in a sense, it applies, or should apply, to all educational endeavor. These larger questions are your grist for milling. Your primary function is to equip each generation of your students with the intellectual tools they need to fashion their answers based upon principle, to these eternal questions. So although I recognize the necessity of setting forth on a value free basis, that which is, I regard this only as a prerequisite for the more vital measurement, the assessment of the existing against the model of what ought to be. THE 1960'S REFLECT CONCERN OF AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR MORE EDUCATION We can take comfort, some comfort at least, that the 1960's have, as never before, reflected the concern of the American people for the need to expand at every level educa- tional opportunities for all of our young peo- ple. More young Americans now are attending better schools and are being exposed to more information at every level from pre-kinder- garten through post-graduate study than any predecessor generation. But this is not enough. Despite more than a billion dollars of Fed-eral aid which was added to the elementary and secondary school budgets of a few of our schools, urban and rural, who needed it most, as a Senator, I feel my efforts have been in- adequate when I am told in our hearings: \"In one community, for example, a prin- cipal received ESEA funds to provide free school lunches for 100 children for each day of the school year. But there were 300 eligible children in the school. In order to distribute the school lunches equally, the principal decided to feed all 300 children once every three days rather than feeding 100 children every day. There was considerable concern in the community because the Negro parents could not understand why their children did not get fed every day. This is fairly typical of the lack of communication between the school and the community and it is indeed unfortunate.\" It is hard to see how a remedial reading program can get started and work well un- less first the physiological need of the child for food is met. Obviously in that school sys- tem, the greatest improvement they could hope for would follow from the installation of what most of us thought was a standard program since the 1930s. I have been voting for school lunch programs every Congress since I entered the Senate, and I am appalled that we have not yet managed to provide sufficient resources from the agricultural abundance your schools have brought in.o being through the work you have done with the American farmer, to clear from the learn- ing path of some of our children this un- necessary and morally indefensible obstruc- tion. What relevance has this for you? Ask your- self what you did when the appropriations bill for agriculture was up. You supported, I am sure, the school lunch program, but were you not more concerned with items more immediately related to your operations? RESPONSIBILITY OF STATE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES In the second century of your service to the American people do you not have an enlarged responsibility to make better known to the Congress and to your State legisla- tures the findings of your research in urban and rural sociology, the results of your inter- disciplinary studies, so that effective pro- grams can be developed to meet these human needs? If you enlarge your horizons to reach into and criticize constructively the way things are being done, if you develop and advocate sound solutions to these problems, using as tools the authorities such as those contained In Title I of the Higher Education Act of S1965 relating to community service and uni- versity extension programs, then you will help to create for your many other concerns the climate of opinion which can assist you in solving your institutional financial prob- lems. I have spoken of your institutions as being a national resource, well aware that a na- tional resource whether it be timber, water- power, ore or oil, can be harvested and con- served or it can be willfully and shockingly wasted through exploitation. To discharge the responsibilities I am sug- gesting will require an additional commit- ment of money and talent, if other areas of equal validity are not be cut back or ignored. I propose to help you in every way that I can to develop new sources of financing through additions to existing legislative au- thorities, not because of your institutions per se, but because I am convinced that it is in the interest of all of our citizens that we develop better ways of providing a full range of educational opportunity to our young people. But I put to you the necessity of your effort with your Senators and Congressmen to obtain the full appropriation of the pres- ently authorized programs as well. Let us first take a look at the specifics.TITLE IV NDEA FELLOWSHIPS Currently 7500 NDEA fellowships are au- thorized, that is to say that budget estimates sufficient to support that number can be submitted. The President asked only for 5,460 new fellowships for fiscal 1968, the current fiscal year at a cost, for these and for funding the second and third year costs of the 12,000 fellowships previously awarded, of $96.6 mil- lion. The signed appropriations bill carried only $86.6 million. What are the results? You know them only too well. The answer I received when I asked the question of the Office of Education was: \"Should the requested appropriation of $96,000,000 be reduced by $10,000,000 to $86,- 000,000 for Fiscal Year 1968, the number of students who could enter the first year of the three-year period of college teacher training in September, 1968 would be re- duced from 5,460 to 3,325 (since the second and third year commitments to 12,000 stu- dents already in tenure represent a continu- ing prior obligation of the NDEA Title IV program). \"The practical effect would be to reduce by 45 per cent of the level of first year sup- port available to the universities and grad- uate colleges of the United States in the training of future college and university teachers. Every one of the 193 leading grad- uate schools of the 50 States would find their level of support for first year fellows reduced by approximately 45 percent in 1968- 69 as compared with 1967-68 should the re- quested appropriation for FY 1968 be reduced from $96,000,000 to $86,000,000. \"The impact of this sharp reduction in the first year support for the training of college and university teachers comes at a time of sharply increasing need for teachers trained at the doctoral level in our rapidly expanding national network of junior colleges, four year colleges, senior colleges, and public and private universities. The proposed 45 percent reduction in first year NDEA Title IV fellow- ships comes at the same time as projected reductions in most other Federal programs for pre-doctoral training of scientists and scholars to meet our rising national need for specialists trained at the doctoral level.\" ACADEMIC FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION The Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963 has helped to build many libraries and class- rooms. It is authorized at $728 million for this year. The appropriation for fiscal year 1968 was $459.7 million. Testimony on con- struction needs for academic facilities from college and university witnesses suggests a total capital investment need of about $4.375 billion each year, if we are to admit the stu- dents who apply under current standards of acceptability. The contrast between the provision made and the model of what ought to be provided is pretty clear. Yet you and your colleagues are the only ones who can make clear to the Congress that curtailment in this area is surely penny- wise pound-foolish economy. Your boards of trustees ought to be point- ing this out too, to the newspaper editors of this country and to the banking commu- nity. For education is a good Investment of the public funds. It returns a higher div- idend than almost anything else to our economy. OTHER AREAS OF UNDERFUNDING The International Education Act is the prime example of a program of promise and potentiality which has been birth-strangled through non-funding. Your Congress would not even give the Act seed money to start its operations. The Teacher Corps received $13.5 million rather than the $33 million asked for by the President.34189 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 Only half of the $2.4 billion appropriations for the Elementary and Secondary Educa- tion Act authorization was funded. These are examples of areas where you could, and in my view should have a great concern. Your students are those who come from the nation's public schools. Unless the quality of their preparation is high, you are saddled with the costs of remedial work. WATCH THE BUDGET NEXT JANUARY So I would counsel you to watch the budget that is submitted in January for next year. Analyze the implications contained in it early and make known vigorously your views upon the adequacy of the funding pro- posed. In your meetings adopt measures which will let your professional staff who are very able and dedicated keep you informed so that you can act at each key point in the process with maximum effect. But beyond this, and for the future, for the long haul as we leave this century and enter the next, I believe that the national interest calls for a new departure for meet- ing more adequately the operational as well as the capital costs of higher education. We shall soon be in hearings on the Higher Education Amendments of 1967. If your de- liberations at this meeting produce recom- mendations for a beginning in this area of future financial assistance, I shall be de- lighted to hear your witnesses in the course of those hearings. Let me share with you some of the policy considerations which such proposals should contain if, in my judgment, they are to com- mand effective support in the Senate. First, the aid proposed should encompass both public and private institutions of higher education. Second, it should recognize the advisability of support being extended to all institutions of higher education whether they be 2 year, 4 year, or university level including those aggregates of 4 year undergraduate institu- tions which have ties with a common gradu-ate center. Third, provision should be made for equi- table distribution of the aid given in terms of the students each serves to all geographi- cal areas of this country, with particular stress in building graduate capacity in those areas which now have limited capabilities in this area. Fourth, recognition should be given to the costly nature of research activities and addi- tional levels of compensation should be awarded for this function. Sixth, because of the historic development of higher education in this country certain of our institutions along the eastern seaboard and on the Pacific Coast have attained a pre- eminence which has resulted in their be- coming in recent years the prime receivers of Federal funds from our defense and space agencies and from the National Science Foundation. This is understandable and by no means, in my judgment, improper. But one of the attributes of a politician is the ability to count legislative and appropriations noses. I would strongly urge that for adop- tion of a program and the initial and con- tinued funding of a program, it would be well to incorporate into the formula a maxi- mum ceiling for funding in any one year, to any one institution. I have been reviewing draft legislation of this character. It would be my hope that the uses to which such funds as are generated under the formula approach I have briefly sketched could be put would be a broadly per- missive nature, one patterned after the op- eration and maintenance language which governs the present use of P. L. 874 funds to local school districts in our Federally im- pacted areas programs, but I would also hope that it would contain a recognition that the land-grant college concept, so successful in agriculture, could be itself transmuted into an equivalent ideal of service to themetropolitan areas which house an ever in- creasing proportion of our population. If with your help, we can evolve a new program of broadly based support for our col- leges, your successors who meet here or else- where in the year 2067 will have cause to sing your praises. And as a consequence of the benefits such a program would bring to the nation and to the world it would be my hope that they could answer Dewey with the ringing af- firmation that in our time we had not failed to put the eternal questions strongly and matched them with our appropriate and compassionate answers. ADDRESS BY SENATOR EDWARD M. KENNEDY AT THE HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentle- man from Indiana [Mr. BRADEMAS] may extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. Mr. BRADEMAS. Mr. Speaker, I be- lieve that a recent address by the distin- guished senior Senator from Massachu- setts, the Honorable EDWARD M. KENNEDY, at the Harvard Medical School, concern- ing Vietnam with particular attention to the field of civilian medical care, is worthy of the careful attention of all our colleagues. I insert Senator KENNEDY'S perceptive address, delivered on October 25, 1967, at this point in the RECORD: We meet tonight in a school of medicine to talk about the conduct of a war. But we do not meet in the usual sense, for while we are concerned for the well-being and safety of those who fight the war, we meet because of an equal concern for the civilian living in the fire of war-those who are not armed, not belligerents, not fighting against us, and significantly not fighting for us. This concern, common as it may be to the humanitarian motives of men of medicine, is novel to the rest of us in a time of all-out war. Our current involvement in Southeast Asia, however, is such that civilian concerns, I believe, are directly linked to the success of our national effort. Our setting and our concerns are unique because Vietnam is unique. And I believe we would not be here at all if we were satisfied that our country's response was appropriate to the challenge we confront. In this modern world-when all things within our environment, as well as the af- fairs of men, are considered to be controllable or open to the appeals of reason, wisdom and the accumulated knowledge of the ages- we have a Vietnam. And it seems that it will continue. It seems that nothing we do will cause it to submit to the usual solutions. It seems to be relentless in the taking of precious American lives. Vietnam is the most complex, by some measures the most costly, and certainly the most frustrating confrontation ever to plague our nation. It is a war that seriously threatens the peace of the world. It has caused divisions within the community of free nations. It holds out the possibility of tearing apart the people of two countries- ours and theirs. Vietnam is a battle between peoples that we all wish were ended, but if anything it is the one battle that will not be ended by the simple wishes of men of good will. It seems to taunt all hope. It has a way of smashing well-intentioned sug- gestions and initiatives toward peace ourcountry has made, as fiercely as it is smash.ing young Western lives and an old Asianpeople and culture. When the decision was made, so long agoto involve this country in the defense of Vietnam, it was made with the full knowl.edge that what we faced there we had neverfaced before. The original Vietnamese warwas an internal struggle, born in the vacuumcreated by the rout of colonial France, nur-tured by a mixture of nationalism and com.munism, and particularly cruel in the meth-ods used by both sides to bring the peopleinto the ranks of contending forces. Yet thedecision to intervene was made in our bestinterests, and, we felt, in the best interests of the people of the South. But the way r1 \u007f hich we chose to be in- volved then, as differentiated from our in- volvement now, reflected a cool appraisal of how our power could best be brought to bear. We chose to have the American presence felt in moderation; with respect for those we were assisting; and with the knowledge that in civil strife those of a backward and underdeveloped land would respond more readily to hope and protection than to the fear and despair that accom- panies vast destruction. Most importantly, we made our decision with the realization that the real battle was for the allegiance of the people, and that bombs and bullets could not will them to the cause of democracy if the side we were assisting offered them no real alternative in their daily lives to the side we were re- sisting. The conflict proved to be difficult, and we suffered from a lack of real experience in these matters. There was no precedent to guide us nor historical example to retreat to when patience wore thin. And as the efforts of the central government of South Viet- nam appeared near collapse we took on the brunt of the fighting ourselves. We abandoned our position of assistance and, I believe, our reliance on the long-run benefits of political action. We fell into all- out war. So it is today that the war we fight is little different from all other wars in his- tory, despite the fact we knew, and still know, that the real crisis of Vietnam calls for solutions approaches and techniques of warfare different from those produced by all wars of the past. URGENT MEDICAL NEEDS OF VIETNAMESE CIVILIANS Nowhere has our failure been more clear than in the civilian medical arena. The tes- timony of experts has been all too clear: Hundreds of South Vietnamese wounded today lie in sheds, corridors, floors, sometimes even in the open courtyards, awaiting surgery that may be delayed a year or longer. One doctor described an experience last April at Da Nang Civilian Hospital. He found fifty civilians, children and adults, lying on the floor; little children crowded into one room, all with kerosene, fire and other burns of war; people with second and third degree burns, many of them dying at the moment. There was insufficient person- nel, insufficient equipment, and insufficient medicines to care for the casualties. Not one of the provincial or major hospi- tals servicing the people of Vietnam meets even the barest minimum of sanitation or other support conditions with which to carry out simple medical practices. Tu Du Mater- nity Hospital, the main teaching facility for the University of Saigon for obstetrics and gynecology, has conditions of unbelievable filth and neglect-there is no place for 400 women to even wash their hands; showers are used as toilets; three to four women crowded with their babies in filthy beds pushed together at night; rats stalk the cor- ridors; newspapers are used for diapers; drugs for pain almost unavailable. In the entire country there is only one34190 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE maternity hospital, as of a month ago, where gloves are available for the delivering of babies, and that hospital had gloves only because a private doctor became so upset that he personally supplied them. The great tragedy of all this is that most of all of these shocking and deplorable conditions need not exist; babies and children are dying daily because of pure neglect and lack of concern. We were told that there are currently 35,000 amputees awaiting prosthetic devices and currently only a few hundred being pro- duced each month. It is hoped to have the production of prosthetic devices increased to close to a thousand a month in the future, but still thousands and thousands of am- putees face years of waiting for artificial limbs-that is, if they can ever be fitted and taught to use them after so long a lapse of time. No real means has been worked out for getting the war injured patients to hospitals. Most often they come in carts, sampans; those, that is, who can walk. Such informa- tion that we do have indicates that the lapse in time from injury to admission to hospitals, for those who do reach hospitals, more often than not runs from 24 to 36 hours. There are 43 provincial hospitals in Viet- nam. Not one was considered up to mini- mum standards for a developing country in Southeast Asia by the medical survey team recently sent to Vietnam. Almost all of these hospitals lack sanitation facilities, drinking water, dependable electrical sys- tems: Equipment is ill-maintained or non- existent. Drugs are in short supply and so too are nurses and all types of paramedi- cal personnel. I do not feel that these present condi- tions can be justified. But beyond that I feel that as long as these conditions pre- vail, we are failing absolutely in the ful- fillment of our most basic commitment to the people for whom we are fighting and dying. These people know as well as we do how efficiently and swiftly United States and South Vietnamese wounded soldiers are re- moved from the field to receive the best in medical care immediately. That we do so little for the peasants and their children can only create distrust and cynicism, a cynicism so dangerous and deep that it may well condemn us to additional years of fight- ing-and thousands more Americans dying. To state these facts is not to belittle the work of the many brave and generous indi- viduals who have gone there to help. Our AID personnel, the committed staff of the various voluntary and religious agencies, and the doctors who have participated either singly or in the A.M.A. program deserve the respect and admiration of us all. It is un- fortunate but true that they labor under the most difficult of conditions-not because they are working in war-but because they are trying to do a job with little support from those we have entrusted with the ef- fective direction of the war effort and the winning of the South Vietnamese people. Nor are these facts put forward without recognizing that in a time of war, it is difficult to bring health and care to civil- ians. Yet we are, as a nation, expending $3 million an hour in Vietnam, or $25 billion each year. In 1967, we allocated only $37 million for all civilian medical programs- an allocation for an entire year equal to one- half day's effort in our fight to save a nation. This is the pittance we have given to at- tend to the wounds of approximately 150,- 000 civilians each year who are struck down- whether by our enormous firepower or by the stiletto of Viet Cong terror. In a country where more than half of the population is under the age of 16, we might well ask ourselves whether by our lack of concern we are not only losing the haUrta and minds ofthe body politic but are also planting with- in new generations the seeds of hate to- ward us. I state these facts to make the point that I believe it is time to redefine our position in Vietnam, to question whether these peo- ple can be won and a land secured by guns alone. I believe we must rethink our total approach and ask ourselves whether the losses we have suffered and the resources we have expended have resulted in any real gains in affecting the political inclinations of the South Vietnamese. If not, must we continue to pour young Americans into that abyss, and must we con- tinue to pursue a course that threatens to alienate the minds of those we went there to assist? THE NEED TO WAGE A DIFFERENT KIND OF WAR It may be the time to recall and return to our original outlook: That whatever else we do in Vietnam, nothing of lasting value can be accomplished unless the Vietnamese peo- ple themselves wish it to be so. It was said that the war was their war-now it is our war. It may be too late to return to earlier positions, but I do not feel it is too late to now use our men and resources to wage a different kind of war-to shift from the reli- ance on military action to actions that will be more meaningful, merciful, and of lasting benefit to the people themselves. So it is my view, and I hold it strongly, that the bullet will never defeat the Viet Cong or the soldiers of the North. Our remaining hope lies with the people of the South. We must bring them to the point where they will cease to welcome the soldiers from the North or supply the Viet Cong with re- cruits. When we show them by deed, not by strength, that we represent the forces of free- dom and all that means for individual wel- fare and dignity, then they may respond. And this can be accomplished now I feel, only through the reordering of our priorities-and nowhere is this needed more than with these civilian victims of war. This is an area upon which a true civilian program could be built. For unlike the nu- merous pacification programs started to date, most of which appear to have been designed to meet American ends more than the needs of the Vietnamese, good medical care in a time of war satisfies the most basic demands of the people first. Yet it must be said frankly that a sound medical program can reap enor- mous political benefits in a struggle that is basically political. As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Sub- committee on Refugees, I have attempted to be influential in the Vietnam debate on mat- ters that I can affect. Some of our efforts have been successful, and that is most rewarding. But on the larger scale of truly affecting our government's priorities to enlarge our medi- cal efforts we can to date, claim little suc- cess. That, I must admit, is both frustrating and painful. For one can push and prod, and see piecemeal improvements in our posture, but that is no substitute for the kind of pro- gram we could mount if the initiatives came not from a Senate Subcommittee but from the highest levels within the Administration. Unless and until the decision is made to alter in a total sense, however, the Subcom- mittee will continue to offer suggested pro- grams for improving the care of the South Vietnamese civilian. As a result of my recent public hearings on Vietnam, I have submitted to the Administration the following proposals for immediate action to meet current-just current--needs. RECOMMENDATIONS TO MEET CURRENT NEEDS First, there is an urgent need for additional civilian hospital facilities in Da Nang, Chu Lai, and Can Tho. Existing hospitals are totally inadequate to meet the patient load and the serious civilian casualty problems. The Department of Defense has on three oc- casions announced the building of these hos-pitals; first in last April, again in June, and still again in August. Yet, to date, not a brick has been laid, not a penny formally obligated. It is a stark measure of the priority given civilian medical problems that $17 million cannot be found to proceed with construction of these urgently needed hospitals. Second, four existing provincial hospitals in the Northern region of Vietnam near the Demilitarized Zone have no water supply, no electricity and no sanitary facilities in- side the buildings. The bathrooms of these hospitals are on back streets, courtyards, and corridors. Third, five helicopters and two fixedwing aircraft should be assigned for the exclusive use of the Vietnam AID medical mission. Re- quests for these planes are two years old without response. These helicopters and planes would serve as transportation for civilian war injured and supplies and medical personnel to and from medical centers and specialization facilities. To attempt to flush out an enemy embedded within the people with no provision for the evacuation of the innocent civilian hurt in the action is not only thoughtless-it belies our very efforts. Fourth, in the public health area, there is a need for massive inoculation and im- munization programs among refugees and in the urban coastal areas swelled to overflowing by people displaced from the countryside. These programs should concentrate on im- munization against polio, typhoid, cholera, tetanus and tuberculosis, all of which verge on epidemic scale in South Vietnam. Fifth, greater United States control of med- ical supplies and equipment is needed in Vietnam and a regular system of maintenance and repair must be set up immediately. The supply problem is deplorable. United States field representatives as late as this past July were rating our current system 22 per cent effective. There are numerous reports of med- ical equipment and machinery wasting away because of lack of spare parts and mainte- nance. My sixth recommendation deals with the urgent need for surgical teams in South Vietnam. Here I would rely on many present tonight to become involved. I believe that there is a major role for the private medical sector in this country in providing experi- enced and capable surgical teams for at least six civilian provincial hospitals in South Vietnam. For some time now we have urged the Agency for International Development to set up a number of medical contracts with pri- vate medical Institutions and societies to provide five more surgical teams for treat- ment of civilian war casualties. Basically, each team would be composed of two general surgeons, one orthopedic surgeon, one gen- eral practitioner or internist, one anesthe- siologist, two operating room nurses, one nurse anesthetist and one corpsman. The contracts would be for one or two years and provide for six-month rotation of teams. AID has agreed in principle to this approach. And I can report tonight that we have been discussing this matter with Dr. John Knowles of the Massachusetts General Hospital in the hopes that M. G. H. might undertake one of these contracts. We are in active discussion with a number of other groups in an effort to fill the other contracts. In addition to the nine-man teams, we and AID have been in consultation with a na- tional medical organization in an effort to fill a much larger contract involving a twenty-man surgical team for the Da Nang Civilian Hospital. A tentative agreement for a two-year contract has been obtained which, we are told, should be formally executed in the next three weeks. I believe that this proposal for nine-men surgical teams in Vietnam from the private sector can go a long way toward relieving the civilian casualty needs at Da Nang, Can Tho, Quang Ngai. Saigon and Bam Neth Out. I34191 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 am hopeful that the medical community will rise to the challenge and opportunity. I have also recommended a new effort to enlist free world medical support in Viet- nam. There are currently eighteen free world teams in Vietnam. Some of the Subcommit- tee's executive session hearings, however, in- dicate we have been seriously remiss in secur- ing available free world support. I am certain a number of other nations could and would supply medical support if our own efforts to enlist this support are given the sense of urgency, which, up to now, has been lacking. MORE U.N. PARTICIPATION IS NEEDED Related to this is the question of United Nations participation in the medical needs of South Vietnam. For some time now W. H. 0., UNESCO, UNICEF, F. A. 0. and the Develop- ment Fund have been carrying out small pro- grams in South Vietnam. All of these agen- cies have indicated a willingness to increase their humanitarian efforts in that belabored nation. Funds are available through a funds- in-trust system; yet we have done little to encourage an expanded United Nations role. I have found, after repeated visits with UN representatives, that the meagerness of our efforts to encourage and enlist greater UN special agency help is both disturbing and short sighted. Tet these efforts will only allow us to hold our shaky ground. More cannot be reasonably expected until preserving the people of Viet- nam is considered to be of equal importance to the destruction of the enemy. I cannot say that the significant elevation of medical programs alone would be a turn- ing point in the war. Vietnam is far too diffi- cult for that. But a greater priority in this area would be in keeping with the finest traditions of our nation and the highest ethics of the medical profession. In the last analysis, we, as a compassionate and generous people, will be judged in the future not so much by what we did in Viet- nam, but by the way in which we did it. No great nation can long claim to have won freedom and democracy for another people if, in the process, the destruction of their land and a disregard for their pain was the hallmark of the effort. And it may even be that no nation, however great, powerful, or well-intentioned, can ever win freedom and democracy for others in the modern world with the techniques of war borrowed from the past. So it is, I feel, that a change in our effort is called for-a return to the struggle to win a people by responding to their human needs and values first, and a lessening of reliance on sheer power. For this is the best reflection of the Amer- ica we know. It has been the source of our strength throughout history. And in Viet- nam, we may find it to be the only possible path to success. MR. JOSEPH H. HAGAN, SPECIAL AS- SISTANT FOR CONGRESSIONAL RELATIONS, OFFICE OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY, ADDRESSES THE BARNARD CLUB OF RHODE ISLAND Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentle- man from Rhode Island [Mr. TIERNAN] may extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. Mr. TIERNAN. Mr. Speaker, a few days ago, Mr. Joseph H. Hagan, special assistant for congressional relations of the Office of Economic Opportunity, hadthe privilege to address the Barnard Club of Rhode Island. The Barnard Club is comprised of top-level educators and school administrators from all sections of Rhode Island. Mr. Hagan made some very poignant remarks on the impact of the antipoverty program on education in America. It is my feeling that his comments will be of great interest to us all. Mr. Speaker, I include Mr. Hagan's ad- dress in the RECORD: THE IMPACT OF THE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM ON EDUCATION IN AMERICA (Address by Joseph H. Hagan, special assist- ant for congressional relations, Office of Economic Opportunity, executive office of the President, Washington, D.C., to the Barnard Club at Providence College, Provi- dence, R.I., November 18, 1967) Nearly three years ago, during spring train- ing in 1965, the New York Mets hired what we bureaucrats would call an intermittent consultant. He was Jess Owens, the e great Olympic track star of the thirties, and his mission presumably was to teach the Mets how to run on the balls of their feet. Red Smith, the Sports Columnist, was tickled pink when he heard about this. He even wrote a column about it. During the forthcoming season, said Red Smith, lots of Mets would steal second. And once every couple of weeks, one of the faster ones would get as far as third. And once, or maybe even twice, a particularly fleet-footed, intrepid Met would manage to steal home. \"But who\", asked Red Smith, \"is going to teach them how to steal first?\" My analogy is certainly obvious, and maybe a trifle far-fetched, but I believe it is valid on the whole. What we in the Office of Economic Opportunity are trying to do, what President Johnson and the Congress of the United States committed the nation to do when they declared war on poverty in the summer of 1964, was to give the poor what they need to get to first base. We are trying to help them compete on something approaching equal terms in this intensively competitive Ameri- can society of ours. But, unfortunately, there are many people who question this analogy, or rae ther the con- clusions that logically flow from it. If some- one cannot get to first base on his own, they say, it is his own fault. They claim that everybody starts off with an equal chance, and it is his responsibility to take advantage of it. These people refuse to come to grips with some ugly facts of American life. They refuse, for instance, to look at the evidence of Head Start-and nowhere, per- haps, is the Mets analogy more valid than with Head Start. I know you are familiar with this compre- hensive pre-school program for deprived four and five year olds. If I may borrow a phrase from Madison Avenue, it is our most popu- lar product. And it is popular because there is a need for it, and because it works. But it is also popular for a negative reason. No one, not even the most rabid rlghtwinger, can maintain his self-respect and point down at a four-year-old youngster and say, \"You Ingrate. You are not living up to the American dream. Why don't you go out and get yourself a job?\" Even the most scathing critics of the war on poverty do not usually criticize small children. But they do ignore some facts about small children, at least about the small chil- dren in Head Start. Here are some of those facts: About 1.4 million children have gone through Head Start to date, either in sum- mer or full-year programs. Of these, more than 1 million had not been vaccinated against measles until Head Start did it for them.More than 900,000 of them needed sub-stantial dental care-an average of five cavi-ties a child. Some 740,000 were vaccinated against polio for the first time by HeadStart. One hundred thousand of these children had eye defects, and 90,000 had bone andjoint disorders which had gone uncared for before Head Start. Seven thousand were mentally retarded and had received no special attention. And 2,200 had previously undiagnosed and un- treated active cases of tuberculosis. Statistics can grow grimmer as people grow older. Another program the OEO administers is the Job Corps. The Job Corps enlists vol- unteers, young men and women 16 through 21 who are out of school and out of work and assigns them to residential centers. There they learn the three R's, skills which will enable them to compete in the world of work-and they acquire the intangibler, the dignity and the self-respect, which will help them become contributing citizens. Nearly 90,000 young men and women have enlisted in the Job Corps since it got under- way three years ago. About 85 percent of these had not seen a dentist professionally in the last ten years. And in the same period of time fully 80 percentt had not seen a doctor. There's no comfort for any of us in these statistics. There's no solace for any Amer- ican in being confronted with the facts that four times as many adults below the pov- erty line are afflicted with disabling heart disease as those above; that ten times as many have eye defects; that six times as many are mentally ill; that the chances of a baby born into a poor family dying before the age of one are twie wias high as for the rest of the population, and that the chances of a poverty-stricken adult dying by 35 are four times as high. Of what interest to you as educators are these medical statistics? I hope my' point is at least as obvious as the Mets analogy-of which it is, really, a part. For it seems to me that the child with bad teeth, or the child who needs glasses and does not have them, let alone the child with active tuberculosis, is handicapped, and in fact handicapped quite severely, when he is thrown into com- petition with contemporaries in good physi- cal shape. This in short is not only a matter of con- cern for dentists and doctors and psychia- trists. It is a matter of real concern for edu- cators as well. Let me digress for a moment to make a sort of indictment. I hasten at the outset to include myself in this indictment, for I am a professional as are you. In some serious way all we professionals-the doctors and dentists, the educators, the churches, cer- tainly government at all levels, the entire spectrum-have failed. In some way, with all the education and skills that we have at our disposal, we should have been meeting these terrible and very human needs. I think, for instance, that it must be considered an in- dictment of American education that 35 per- cent of the Job Corpsmen are unable to read a simple declarative sentence on a test that they take when they enter. And remember, they are at least 16 years old. Also, 30 percent make a mistake when they subtract 6 from 10. It is easy to indict and it is often agoniz- ingly hard to remove the cause for indict- ment. You know far better than I the mas- sive problems facing American education today. And I am sure that you have a far more profound sense of the implications of President Johnson's words in his message to Congress, \"Toward Full Educational Oppor- tunity\", of January 1965 when our education programs for the poor were Just getting un- derway. The President said, \"Once again we must start where men who would improve their34192 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE society have always known they must begin- with an educational system restudied, rein- forced, and revitalized.\" What gives me and all of us at OEO great encouragement and hope is that the Presi- dent's words of 1965 are becoming increas- ingly translated into action as we go into 1968. The American education system is undergoing a hard reappraisal. Its founda- tions are being strengthened. And there are more and more signs of a new vitality. Now I must confess the sin of immodesty- not about myself, but about the agency I take great pride in representing. The new strengths and the new vitality of American education are in significant part a result of the impact of Economic Opportunity Pro- grams. Head Start, again, offers a superb example. Head Start has gone far to prove that edu- cation is not, and cannot be, a compart- mentalized, pigeonholed profession, that there is more and must be more to education than what the textbook and the blackboard can give. It has laid to rest, I hope for good and all, the myth that education is unrelated to other pressing needs of poor children, and has made it difficult for any school to indulge itself in a narrow definition of its responsi- bility. Perhaps even more important, Head Start has exploded another myth-that poor par- ents are indifferent to the education their children receive. There is a very important distinction to make here: Poor parents are all too often tragically ignorant of how they can best help educate their children. But they are not indifferent. Through parent ad- visory councils, parent training, and a whole host of methods to achieve parental involve- ment, Head Start is proving they are not in- different. And it is showing them how not to be ignorant. Head Start has scored another major achievement. It is the recruitment of non- professional aides to help in the classroom. This, of course, serves a double purpose: The professional teacher's burden is relieved, par- ticularly of routine chores, and the non- professional aides get trained and directed toward a career. These non-professional aides in Head Start are poor people themselves. Many of them, in fact, are parents of the children in the program. Critics of Head Start have been forced, in the main, to feed on the program's success. Those who said in 1964 that it would never work began to say in 1966 that it worked too well, that the children got up too much edu- cational steam, and that they sank back into apathy when they started to go to regular school. So this government responded to the criti- cism of success, and this year as a pilot pro- gram in 30 communities, we have Head Start Follow Through-a post-graduate Head Start, as it were, continuing Head Start's comprehensive benefits as the children go to kindergarten or first grade. All of this, I submit, represents impact. And I think that it is good impact, effective impact. It is not, of course, a complete turn- about-many of you were thinking the same way and starting to go in the same direction before the Economic Opportunity Act was even a glint in the eye of the President. And the impact Is certainly not as forceful as some of us, and I hope some of you, would like. But it is forcing a restudy and a re- vitalization. It is beginning to cause the schools to deal with the whole child and his environment, not just with an educational statistic like an IQ, a language aptitude, or a mathematics comprehension. There is a new math-and there is beginning to be a new education. At least equally as important as the school's relationship with the child, and in fact part and parcel with that relationship, is the school's relationship with the commu- nity. It is programs like Head Start thatbring the school into the community-and the community into the school. I am very proud, we are all proud, of the Community School Program in Providence, which through a highly imaginative use of the whole gamut of educational resources, both material and human, has succeeded in mak- ing the schools the nerve center of their neighborhoods. The educational impact of the Economic Opportunity Programs is by no means con- fined to Head Start and very young children. Indeed, in the wider and the most profound sense, all of the Economic Opportunity pro- grams are founded, one way or another, on education and on the fundamental premise that to help himself, to compete, to con- tribute as a good citizen, the poor person as well as anyone else needs education fully as much as his body needs food. The new education recognizes that the poor need dif- ferent approaches, a somewhat modified edu- cational diet, you might say, than the middle class. And the new education is beginning to provide it. Many very exciting things are happening to the Job Corps. New curricula are being developed. It is a lot easier and a lot more effective to teach a Job Corps boy how to read by teaching him from a bulldozing in- struction manual when he wants to learn how to run a bulldozer than feeding him Shakespeare or the old Dick-Jane-and Spot primers we all remember. Teachers need training in the problems of the slums and the youngsters they produce, and they are getting it. The school systems of Washington, Detroit, Seattle and Sun Val- ley, for instance, are sending some of their teachers to Job Corps Centers under Project Interchange with the cooperation of the Na- tional Education Association and our Job Corps and Community Action Divisions. After a year at the Job Corps Centers, these teachers are returning with new materials, such as programmed learning Sullivan Read- ers, and new techniques so they can train other teachers and work with students who are on the verge of dropping out. The Bank Street College of Education in New York has developed training models for teacher aides. Two projects in New York and Chicago have demonstrated significant improvement in teaching results through the use of \"talk- ing typewriters\" for poor children. These are scattered examples. There are many more. But I would like to dwell briefly on another of our Community Action Pro- grams which we call Upward Bound. Al- though it is not as widely known as Head Start, it is as exciting as it is interesting. Upward Bound is a pre-college program, operated mostly by colleges and universities for high school students from poor families who are badly prepared and largely unmoti- vated youngsters, in other words, who may be natively bright but don't stand a chance of going to college. Upward Bound tries to give them that chance. So far, it has worked. Eight percent of the normal college popu- lation come from low-income families. More than 40,000 youngsters have been enrolled in Upward Bound programs since the first pilot projects got underway in the summer of 1965. Not eight but 75 percent of Upward Bound \"graduates\" have gone on to college. And, by and large, they have stayed. Only 12 percent of the alumni of the first Upward Bound Projects who went to college dropped out during their freshman year. The overall rate is more than twice that. Perhaps I am naive, but I think that this record is probably an educational miracle. If so, it is a miracle for which the President and OEO can claim very real credit. But the hundreds of colleges and universities that have sponsored Upward Bound projects de- serve a larger share of the credit. They have widened their horizons as well as those of the Upward Bound students. They have be-come more responsive to the needs of their surrounding communities-and are drawing with increasing profit on those communities' resources. They have become more flexible- and at the same time more realistic-in setting admission and scholarship standards. They are becoming more imaginative in their curriculum development-and in their ap- proach to students. They are, in short, meeting a need and developing a resource. The testimony of the students themselves is most eloquent. A boy in St. Louis's Web- ster College Program said, \"Before I went there, I was a 'corner boy'. I was with the wrong bunch all the time. We stayed up late doing all sorts of no-good things. I think I'm too much to hang on the corner with the other boys. I know my life is worth more than how they taught me to lead it. Upward Bound taught me how to love my friends\". Is there any question that an impact has been made on that boy? In opening a Presidential message to Con- gress, another President who was both vitally interested in education and in the problems of the poor, John F. Kennedy, said, \"Educa- tion is the keystone in the arch of freedom and progress\". Education is most certainly the keystone in the arch of freedom and progress for the poor-which means freedom and progress for you and me, for the entire country as well. Without it, the edifice crum- bles into dust. H. G. Wells once said that all of history was a race between progress and catastrophe. In the race, which is going on at breackneck speed today, it seems to me vital that those of us concerned with education be counted among the swift. LOCAL EFFORT NEEDED Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentle- man from Rhode Island [Mr. TiERNAN] may extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. Mr. TIERNAN. Mr. Speaker, I was par- ticularly impressed by a recent editorial in the Providence Journal entitled \"Local Effort Needed.\" While expressing pleas- ure over the selection of Providence to be a model city, the editorial cautioned that the city cannot afford to depend wholly on the program to meet its needs. The editorial called on the city to see \"what can be done with city means and private support to renew where renewal now is possible, as with single structures, to improve municipal services, to repair streets, to clean up empty lots, to put sites of razed homes into a land bank for fu- ture development.\" Mr. Speaker, I appreciated the honest and forthright analysis made by the Providence Journal. Local initiative and effort are the keys to success in the model cities program. I am glad to see that re- sponsible voices in local communities are not willing to accept this program as a Government handout. Instead, it is viewed as an opportunity to mesh local resources with those of the Federal Gov- ernment in providing a meaningful an.- swer to the problems of urban slum areas. So that my colleagues might read this provocative editorial from the Providence Journal of November 18, 1967, I include it as part of my remarks:34193 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 LOCAL EFFORT NEEDED Providence has been chosen one of 63 cities which will get federal financial help to realize the goal of President Johnson's Model Cities program-the effort to unite all agen- cies of municipal government in concerted attack on city ghettos. The selection made good news, but let's keep things in perspec- tive. The President first proposed the program Jan. 26, 1966, but it wasn't until Nov. 3 of that year that Congress gave Mr. Johnson the first appropriation for it. This year, the pro- gram has had rough going in Congress; the administration, for instance, sought 522 million dollars but got only 312 million, in- cluding a 12-million planning grant. Providence will get a part of the planning funds for use in the upper and lower South Providence areas. But it will take nine months of study before a detailed plan can be assembled. It is expected that as long as 18 months will elapse after that point before rehabilitation efforts can get under way on the ground in South Providence. The combination of fund cutback and built-in administrative red tape suggests plainly that while the Model Cities program offers great promise for rehabilitation of the most decayed sections of the nation's cities, the pace of progress is not going to be fast, no matter how dedicated the local effort may be in pushing renewal plans. Mayor Doorley and the appropriate city agencies undoubtedly will get busy, as soon as funds are available, to begin the long job of preparing working plans. The mayor is betting heavily on the program as a device to clean out the rot-wherever it exists-in a crowded residential neighborhood where many of the city's Negroes live. But the city ought not to put all its bets on the federal program. Edric R. Bates, a South Providence businessman who is at- tempting to set up a housing rehabilitation program in the area, has warned that de- terioration continues at a fast clip there; if the federal program cannot begin to be felt before another 27 months, deterioration will be even worse. It will be worse, however, only if the city and its leaders fail to do what can be done with city means and private support to renew where renewal now is possible, as with single structures, to improve municipal services, to repair streets, to clean up empty lots, to put sites of razed homes into a land bank for future development. The development of the federal program has been delayed and hamstrung by congres- sional diehards, and available funds run far behind the amounts of cash needed to realize the full hope of the Model Cities Program. Providence is lucky to have a share of the program, but it cannot afford to depend wholly on the nrogram to meet its needs. Providence-and other American cities- cannot go it alone in renewing rundown residential communities. But it is equally true that if Providence doesn't help itself as, when, and where it can with its own re- sources and aid from the private sector, the Model Cities program may turn out to be a mockery of renewal dreams. IRAN ON ITS OWN Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentle- man from North Carolina [Mr. FPoN- TAINm may extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extra- neous matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. Mr. FOUNTAIN. Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that I have had many misgivingsabout our foreign aid program in recent years because there seemed to be less and less evidence that anything worthwhile was being achieved. I still have reservations. But I also be- lieve in giving credit where credit is due, and I think that such a time has come in the case of Iran. Iran is a country where wise, firm lead- ership and native ability combined with our AID program has produced the en- couraging situation in which Iran's de- velopment can now stand on its own feet. At the end of this month-tomorrow- our AID mission in Iran is being with- drawn. To me this is indeed heartening, and I wish to extend congratulations to all the citizens of Iran. I would like to insert these editorial comments of the Baltimore Sun of No- vember 17 regarding this remarkable success story: FOREIGN Am SUCCESS The news dispatches dealing with our foreign aid programs, over the years, have been dominated by controversy-occasional charges of waste or inefficiency and annual struggles in Congress to cut the appropria- tions. Yet many of the economic programs have registered solid successes around the world, demonstrating how beneficial such assistance can be to the interest of the United States, the recipients and the gen- eral flow of trade and commerce. Moreover, as the programs succeed the aid is ended, as the Agency for International Development now reminds us In the case of Iran. As of November 30, a report from AID notes, the United States will officially com- plete its economic assistance programs in Iran, as it did in Taiwan (Formosa) in 1965 and as it expects to be able to do in South Korea within the next few years. These three countries provide examples of how outside help can be used to strengthen and develop economies and boost them toward a rate of growth which permits them to support their own development. United States economic assistance to Iran, which began in 1952, is put at $605 million in aid, $225 million of which was in loans. Military aid, which has amounted to $895 million since 1950, and \"Food for Peace,\" which totals $122 million, are being con- tinued. In its own economic development Iran has invested almost $3 billion during the period in which American aid amounted to $605 million. The Shah's action in staging his own delayed coronation this year indi- cated his belief that Iran now is firmly on its way, a point affirmed by the AID report. Mr. Speaker, my colleague, Congress- man WILLIAM S. BROOMFIELD, is doing an outstanding job at the United Nations during this 22d General Assembly in urg- ing the adoption of improved manage- ment and budgetary techniques. I have always been a strong advocate of fiscal responsibility in our Federal and State governments. In my position as chairman of the Government Operations Subcommittee on Intergovernmental Relations I have supported the adoption of improved management procedures and modern budgetary systems designed to promote and increase efficiency through- out government. I believe that modern government re- quires modern techniques and that every effort should be made by government to keep abreast of developments in man- agement that will produce a more effi- cient operation at reduced costs. This applies equally to the United Nationswhere I have been serving as a delegatefor more than 2 months. Mr. Speaker, it has been my privilegeand honor to serve with my distinguishedcolleague, the Honorable WILLIAM S. BROOMFIELD, of Michigan, as U.S. Rep-resentatives to the United Nations 22dGeneral Assembly. Congressman BR00M- FIELD is representing the United Stateson matters of finance before the Admin-istrative and Budgetary Committee ofthe United Nations. He is doing an ex-tremely effective job of putting forth theU.S. views on such matters as the United Nations budget estimates, personnel questions, and various other mattersrelating to the financial operations ofthe United Nations and its specialized agencies. On November 21, 1967, my colleague made a necessarily lengthy and very im-portant statement of U.S. policy con-cerning needed improvements in thebudgetary and management procedures in the United Nations. Congressman BROOMFIELD introduced a resolution pro- posing a new procedure which would give the Secretary General of the United Nations more leadtime in planning budgets. He proposed that a planning figure be adopted by the General As- sembly a year before the Assembly normally votes a budget. This planning figure would serve as a financial frame- work within which various bodies of the United Nations could plan a work pro- gram and establish priorities. Mr. Speaker, since the United States is the single largest contributor to United Nations programs, we are especially in- terested in assuring that we receive full value for our contribution. This proposal by my colleague should be a significant development in bringing about improve- ments in the budgets of the United Na- tions and its specialized agencies. This policy which was so ably enunci- ated by Congressman BROOMFIELD reflects our Government's serious concern and- I am happy to report-his and my own personal views and concern with the need for effective, and more economical man- agement and operation of those interna- tional organizations supported by our Government. I am inserting the principal parts of his speech in the RECORD SO that every Member may have an opportunity to read them: i Mr. Chairman, there is widespread recog- nition that if the United Nations is to carry out effectively the great task entrusted to this organization, it must pay more heed to sound management and orderly development, and that it must apply modern budgeting and programming procedures suited to its increased activities. It is essential that greater efficiency and full value be achieved for every unit of resources expended on the vital work of human, social and economic de- velopment. Mr. Chairman, the approach to budget pro- cedures which we are advocating is designed to strengthen the efforts toward improved management being undertaken by all groups in the United Nations. There is no under- lying conflict of interest in this area. We are all agreed on the need for longer-range plan- ning and for the establishment of a system of priorities to insure that the most essen- tial things are done first. We are agreed on the need to eliminate waste in whatever34194 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE form. And we are, in fact, all in agreement that improvements are needed and can be made in the budgetary and financial meth- ods of the United Nations. The recommenda- tions in point were unanimously agreed upon by the Committtee of 14 and approved by the General Assembly. Moreover, this Committee has already recommended that the General Assembly reaffirm its concern that \"rapid progress be made\" in carrying out all of the recommendations contained in the Ad Hoc Committee's report. The United Nations, as my Government sees it, is the prime instrument for carrying out in the most efficient way the works of in- ternational cooperation-for maintaining and securing peace, for undertaking the complex tasks of a technologically shrunken world, and for advancing economic and social de- velopment. We are well embarked on a period of history in which members will place in- creasing reliance on the United Nations and Its resources. The United Nations' programs to help developing countries are bound to grow. My Government's approach to this chal- lenge can be simply stated. It flows from more than two decades of consistent, bi- partisan and unstinting support for the United Nations and its programs. We favor- and always have-utilizing the full potential of the United Nations in organizing a durable peace and fulfilling the promises of the Charter for international cooperation. We want the United Nations to be able to operate at full capacity in order to promote the peaceful resolution of conflict and change and to help step up the flow of resources and technology from the industrialized to the newly developing countries. American leaders of both parties have consistently subscribed to this policy. President Elsenhower declared that through international cooperation \"all coun- tries of good will should chart anew their long-term courses of action to promote the growth of less developed areas.\" President Kennedy declared \"that the United Nations ...must play a larger role in helping bring to all men the fruits of modern science and industry.\" President Johnson at the very outset of his administration pledged United States efforts to help in the \"steady improvement of collective machinery [which] is helping the less developed nations build modern societies. We favor an international aid program that is international in practice as well as pur- pose. Every nation must do its share. All United Nations members can do better-We can act more often together-we can build together a much better world.\" Let me summarize three key features of our approach to the United Nations and its activities. The first is that the United States has consistently supported United Nations ac- tivities. No nation has been more openhanded in support of the United Nations, the spe- cialized agencies and other international organizations. We have been the largest financial contributor to the assessed and voluntary contributions for the UN family of agencies-$3 billion or over 45 percent of the present total of $6.6 billion. The Ameri- can people are proud of this record and of their support for United Nations activites. Second, the great bulk of these activities and these contributions have gone to eco- nomic and social programs. Our philosophy assumes that political and technological change required an expanded effort of mu- tual aid which will help us to close the North- South gap. In the developing world we see no higher priority than building economic and social strength. Third, the United States places an increas- ing emphasis on multilateralism. The world is too complex to be the concern of a few big powers alone. No country or group ofcountries is rich enough or smart enough to take on the job alone. The world com- munity must share the planning, the respon- sibilities and the costs. Regional and inter- national agencies for peace and develop- ment must grow in experience and be strengthened in their capacities for practical, cooperative action. My Government's serious concern with the effective management of international orga- nizations is indicated by President Johnson's memorandum of March 15, 1966, in which he directed the Secretary of State to take cer- tain actions essential to effective participa- tion by the United States in international organizations. The President noted that we can expect programs and budgets of interna- tional agencies to expand further in future years to meet the growing needs of the world community. The United States, he pledged, shall continue to meet its fair share of the financial requirements of these organizations. But, if we are to be a constructive influence in helping to strengthen international agen- cies so they can meet essential needs, we must apply to them the same rigorous stand- ards of program performance and budget re- view that we apply to domestic programs. To this end three guidelines were set down: That future expansion of the activities of international organizations be governed by the tests of feasibility and reasonableness. That programs of international organiza- tions be vigorously scrutinized so that funds are allocated only to high priority projects. That each international agency operate with a maximum of effectiveness and econ- omy. This continues to be the United States ap- proach. in As needs increase and as a larger share of the resources available are channeled through multilateral institutions, manage- ment and budgetary practices in interna- tional organizations need to be improved and modernized. If the necessary support from parliaments and taxpayers-beset by so many pressing and legitimate claims at home and abroad-is to be continued and to ex- pand, it is essential that we recognize the several aspects of better planning and get the maximum use from resources. Attitudes and administrative machinery have to keep pace with the activities they are designed to support. We must modernize our budget procedures in order to cope with the expanded role of the United Nations. Iv Mr. Chairman, the draft resolution pro- poses to take several steps toward this end. We are convinced that these steps should now go forward without awaiting the per- fection of all the other procedures which may be related-directly or indirectly--to this task. The present proposal was designed to accommodate complementary procedures, especially with respect to longer-term plan- ning and the selection of priorities. These other needed steps can and should be taken simultaneously by the appropriate bodies of the United Nations. The first and second preambular para- graphs of the draft resolution recall the spe- cific recommendation by the Committee of 14. Later in this intervention you will note that the Committee's recommendation has been closely followed: our proposal provides a way for preliminary and approximate esti- mates to be submitted \"about one year be- fore the date on which the legislative bodies of the organization are required to give the final approval to the budget.\" The third and fourth preambular para- graphs call attention to other aspects of the same problem: first, to the request of the Secretary-General for guidance on the total resources which the Member States are pre- pared to make available for implementation of the work program; and second, to the critical importance of such advance indica-tion from the General Assembly to the sound management and orderly development of the United Nations. v Before describing operative paragraphs 1 and 2, which set forth the essential concept of the planning figure and the procedure which would be followed, let me note that the proposal would only have the present General Assembly approve the procedure. It does not propose to set a planning figure this year. The Secretary-General, the pro- gram formulating bodies of the United Na- tions, and the Member Nations would have a full year in which to make adequate prep- arations before the procedure becomes op- erative. That length of time is, we believe, sufficient for any necessary steps to be taken. Now let me trace briefly what would hap- pen under the proposed procedure roughly one year from now: 1. The results of the program planning which takes place in United Nations bodies during the spring and summer of 1968 would, as usual, be available to the Secretary- General and to all concerned by November 1968. 2. By November 1968 the first reading of the budget would be about completed and therrefore the approximate level of the budge to be adopted for 1969 would be known. 3. With the program recommendations of these bodies for 1969 in hand, with the gen. eral magnitude of the 1969 budget estab- lished, and taking account of views expressed regarding future development of programs, the Secretary-General would consult his principal staff and prepare his recommenda- tions for a \"planning figure\" for use in pre- paring the 1970 budget. 4. The Secretary General's paper would quite naturally present approximate and pre- liminary estimates, but they would include: requirements broken down by sections of the budget; a comparison with cost estimates for 1968 and 1969; and a brief explanation of the major factors expected to change for each section in 1970. 5. This estimate would go to the Advisory Committee for its comments and then to the Fifth Committee for review and recommen- dation of a planning figure to the General Assembly. In the normal course of events the planning figure would be adopted not earlier than December 15, 1968. 6. Early in January 1969-less than one month later-the Secretary General would begin to put together the budget estimates for 1970, using as a framework the planning figure just decided upon by the Member Na- tions in the General Assembly. All organs of the United Nations and their subsidiary bodies financed out of the United Nations regular budget would be expected to coop- erate with the Secretary General and act consistently with the planning figure. 7. The budget would be put together in detail during the months of January through May, 1969. 8. The budget estimates would be reviewed by the Advisory Committee in June and July and that Committee's comments would be transmitted to Member Nations, together with the Secretary-General's budget, in early Au- gust 1969. 9. The General Assembly would review the budget at the regular General Assembly Ses- sion and would decide upon a final budget for 1970. 10. The budget decided upon would govern expenditures for programs in 1970. Mr. Chairman, we have traced in some de- tail the steps that would be taken under the proposed procedure. The Committee will note that the timing of the individual steps is similar to what would be done under the present system for the 1970 budget. The new procedures would mean: a. The recommendation contained in para- graph 26 of the report of the Ad Hoc Com- mittee-which calls for transmitting prelim-34195 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 inary and approximate estimates to members for comments and suggestions about a year in advance-would have been implemented; b. The Secretary-General would be asked to think a little further ahead and to consult with the General Assembly about the amount of resources to be devoted to the budget; c. The General Assembly would give the Secretary-General the guidance he has re- quested as to the general magnitude of the budget which Member Nations are prepared to support for the next year; d. The planning figure would reinforce the Secretary-General's hand in building a budget which successfully balances the dif- ferent programs and priorities decided upon by the program planning bodies of the United Nations; and as a result, the proposed procedure would inject another necessary element of sound management, orderly de- velopment, and modern budgeting into the United Nations. VI The United States Delegation does not want to oversell the planning figure device. The proposed procedure contains no alchemy to produce more resources than nations are willing to supply. It will not solve all of our problems or provide all of the improvements needed in longer-range planning, in setting priorities, and in program development. But my delegation does believe that it will Improve the United Nations system of budg- eting, regardless of whether or not other im- provements are made. Moreover, it is the sincere belief of my delegation that institut- ing this planning figure now will help to accelerate the development of longer-range planning and the setting of priorities. The planning figure can operate with whatever state of planning exists, just as, at present, budgets must be presented even when the programs for which funds are requested have not been fully developed. The planning figure is not an end in itself: it complements and presents a financial framework for whatever state of program review and analysis exists. But it can be an important step nevertheless. There is no rea- son to await the perfection of all other re- lated systems. We believe that successful management depends on making improve- ments wherever and whenever possible. vn Mr. Chairman, I have heard it suggested that the planning figure and other measures recommended for management efficiency are primarily in the interests of the bigger con- tributors. Let us reflect a moment on this. In the first place we are all contributors- big and small-and all of us have to go to our taxpayers and convince them that the programs they support are worthwhile and the administration efficient. In the second place, if resources are not employed to the best advantage, who suffers? Of course, all countries contribute proportionately to the United Nations and as a result, all countries lose, whether large or small, rich or poor. Infact, the biggest losers might well be the developing nations, whose peoples would thereby be deprived of the benefits and serv- ices that wasted or ill-spent resources could have provided. vmr Mr. Chairman, I have the honor of being on the United States Delegation and also of representing an American constituency inthe United States Congress. The American people have great faith in the United Nations and great expectations for it. There is strong support for the United Nations and its work. Polls show that the great majority of Amer- icans, like other peoples around the world, remain firm in their support for the United Nations and want to see it strengthened as an instrument of peace. Our people wish to see the United Nations used fully to help Members in the process of nation buildingand economic and social improvement. The American people and government want the United Nations potential to be used to the fullest to these ends. At the same time, the American people be- lieve that the burden must be widely and equitably shared. We are all subject to many demands at home. Even the most affluent nations face formidable challenges in cop- ing with the underdeveloped areas of their own domestic societies. Each of us must be able to assure our own people that the re- sources we make available to international programs are employed to best advantage. Mr. Chairman, this Organization has a great future. It needs to be adaptive and in- ventive If it is to be equipped to handle the next generation of problems. It needs to modernize its budgetary and administrative processes if it is to continue to be productive in the two basic areas of our work-main- taining peace and security and helping the developing nations move ahead as quickly as possible with their social and economic de- velopment. Mr. Chairman, the United States has today introduced the draft resolution contained in document A/C.5/L.917 on behalf of the present co-sponsors, namely, France, the United Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union. We hoped by these remarks of introduction to reflect somewhat fully and systematically the views of my Delegation on this important matter. We have been told by the co-sponsors that they subscribe to these views and that they also expect to make appropriate comments. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. INDIANA, LAND OF GRIDIRON GREATS Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentle- man from Indiana [Mr. HAMILTON] may extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. Mr. HAMILTON. Mr. Speaker, per- mit me to point out, with all humility, that Indiana is the greatest football State in the Nation. I am pleased, of course, that the final press association football ratings for 1967 bear me out in this simple state- ment of fact. The Hoosier State ends the regular season with three teams- Indiana, Purdue, and Notre Dame-in the top 10. Added to this distinction are the facts that Indiana University will be the Big Ten's Rose Bowl contender this year, and Indiana and Purdue share the Big Ten championship with Min- nesota. St. Louis fans may sing for the Cardi- nals, and Boston may ballyhoo its Red Sox, but you can understand why Hoosiers are deliriously hoarse. We have had three great football teams to cheer this season. GOVERNMENT PROGRAM EVALUA- TION COMMISSION Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentle- man from Indiana [Mr. HAMILTON] may extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is thereobjection to the request of the gentlemanfrom Mississippi? There was no objection. Mr. HAMILTON. Mr. Speaker, no problem in Government is more difficultor more important than the establish-ment of priorities among the competing claims for Government services and assistance. If we are ever to get ourfiscal house in order, the Congress willhave to do a better job of assigning priorities. To help in this formidable task I have introduced a bill to establish the Govern- ment Program Evaluation Commission. This bill, originally proposed by Rep- resentative WILBUR MILLS, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, would create an independent, bipartisan Commission to study all Federal pro- grams. The purpose of the Commission would be to determine: First, the effectiveness of each program in relation to its costs; second, whether such programs should be continued and if so at what level; and third, priority of allocation of funds assigned to each program. The Commission would report its find- ings to the Congress and to the Presi- dent with recommendations for changes in Federal programs and activities which, in its judgment, are necessary to meet the fundamental needs and vital objectives of the Nation. The Commission would be composed of 12 members from private life: four ap- pointed by the President, four by the Speaker of the House, and four by the President pro tempore of the Senate. No more than two appointments from each group could be from one of the major political parties. Every constituent and every Congress- man has his favorite problem that de- mands priority attention from the Fed- eral Government, and without question this Nation has many problems crying out for solution. I have received many letters from constituents saying that a certain problem should be number one on the national agenda. The difficulty is not so much what problem should be number one, but which problems should go to the bottom of the list. The candi- dates for the bottom of the list are far fewer in number. The Congress gives insufficient atten- tion to the critical task of assigning pri- orities. It is a shock for a newer Member of Congress to learn that no systematic attempt is made in the Congress to de- fine the Nation's needs, assess the costs of meeting those needs, and to weigh these costs against prospective revenues. It is fundamental that priorities can- not be established unless the entire range of expenditures is reviewed and compari- sons are made among different programs and projects. The Congress gives insufficient atten- tion to the hard task of eliminating pro- grams no longer needed or with less ur- gent claims on the public funds. The history of Federal programs is to pile new programs on top of old ones. We have today over 170-odd grant-in-aid programs with the Federal Government transferring to the States a total of about $17.8 billion this year. The most striking feature of these programs is not so much34196 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE their size as their diversity. The task of comparing and analyzing 170 programs, managed through 21 departments and agencies and involving 92,000 units of local governments in 50 States is for- midable. But it simply has to be done. procedures must be developed for contin- uing comparisons and analysis of the shifting importance of Federal programs. This Commission will help those of us in Government to ask the hard ques- tions that require answers. What pro- grams are most needed? Can existing programs be reduced or eliminated? What programs are really essential? Some programs were established in the 1930's. Are they still needed in the 1960's? Are the original goals still valid? Are there better, more efficient ways to accomplish our objectives? What are the areas of duplication and overlapping? The Federal Government simply can- not afford all that is desirable. This Commission will help the Congress make the difficult distinction between the de- sirable and the essential. The bill I have introduced will not re- duce expenditures immediately and it is not a solution to the immediate fiscal problems. But long-range planning is necessary to control in the future ex- penditures and to permit the Congress to get a handle on the tasks of assigning program priorities. The Executive establishes the national priorities in its annual budget. The Con- gress needs to do a better job in evalu- ating and judging the Executive's pri- orities and in presenting alternatives to it. It is important to note that this bill does not take away from the Congress the power to determine priorities. The Commission would simply provide to the Congress the results of its study and evaluation, together with its recommen- dations of changes in Federal programs which in its judgment are necessary to meet the fundamental needs and vital objectives of the Nation. The question will certainly arise: Why is such a Commission needed? Why can- not the Congress do the job itself? The blunt fact is that the Congress needs help. With the present workload of in- dividual Members and of congressional committees, there simply is not enough time available to give programs the care- ful and detached scrutiny they need. Mr. Speaker, I suggest that the Con- gress can take one giant stride toward fiscal responsibility by the establishment of this Commission. OBSCENITY Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentle- man from New York [Mr. MURPHY] may extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. Mr. MURPHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, Operation Yorkville is an ecumenical movement in New York City which is dedicated to fighting pornog- raphy and obscenity. Recently Opera-tion Yorkville in its newsletter published an open letter to the Supreme Court urging a new look at our present defini- tions of obscenity. Mr. Speaker, in order that all Members of this House may be advised of the con- tents of this letter, I place it at this point in the RECORD. The letter follows: AN OPEN LETTER TO THE U.S. SUPREME COURT For at least a decade, Mr. Justices, you have struggled with the word obscenity, while the problem of obscenity has grown to monstrous proportions. You have engaged in theoretical discussion while pornographers grow richer on real dollars. You have written tracts which grow more and more confusing, while pornographers' pages grow more and more blatant. Yet you yourselves have planted a seed which could evolve into a solution. The seed seems to remain invisible to you, for you most certainly have not cultivated it. Per- haps the freedom-of-the-press shouters have confused you. The seed is the word community. In your years of deliberation, you have evolved four tests-all of which center around the word community. But some of you insist that the first three coalesce when they are applied. This insistence on coalescence actually ren- ders there inapplicable, and the community comes out the loser. First you ask: Does this particular item appeal to the prurient in- terest when applying contemporary com- munity standards? You ask next if this item is patently offensive to community standards. Has it any redeeming social value (for the community)? Finally, a newly-worded \"test\"; Is it promoted or advertised as pruri- ent to the community (the pandering test). Can't you see the weaknesses, Mr. Jus- tices, in demanding coalescence? How can anything come through all these clouds as obscene? How can the community, in such threefold involvement, escape unharmed: Separate guilt on any one of the counts (weak as each is in its own way) leaves the community hurt, harmed, helpless. Its youtn, especially, has been victimized, sometimes beyond cure as phychiatry will attest. Law is promulgated by competent author- ity to protect the common good-i.e., the good of the community. Court insistence, on the part of some, upon coalescence has all but obliterated obscenity law. Are you no longer concerned with safeguarding the com- munity? SWe submit, Mr. Justices, that it is time to re-think; to evolve, develop a completely new and fresh test based on your present, but presently weak \"offensive to community\" test. The key word is community, Mr. Jus- tices. The chief concern, logically, must be with the wound inflicted on the community by a particular item and Its purveyor, and the depth of that wound. When one considers the increasingly in- citing and debasing nature of the content of obscene material, and the diabolical meth- ods of distribution (the most current being the utilization of radio and television), it is almost shocking to think of nine men theo- rizing and deliberating on whether or not a series of so-called tests coalesce when ap- plied. The content of obscene material today glorifies and incites to promiscuity, perver- sion, violence and drug usage. Look around you, Mr. Justices, at the visi- ble wounds being inflicted upon the com- munity. Reflect for a moment on the harm that media has done, on the wound and the depth of the wound it has inflicted upon so- ciety. A television show describing a bomb threat to a jetliner incited scores of persons to make telephone calls threatening planes. Arson in a school Is often not reported as such, because reporting has incited to arson.May we suggest that you jettison your tests, which must inevitably grow into six or seven or seventeen and still coalesce? May we suggest a community wound test. Can you not ask yourself in your deliberations, for example: Does this action depicted in de- tail in media (a girlie magazine with a love- and-leave ideology) incite to unfaithfulness, consequent break-up of family, and thus wound the community? Does this action de- picted in detail in media (orgies in teenage sex magazines) incite to experimentation, unwed parents, venereal disease and thus wound the community? Does this action depicted in detail in media (drug usage as a fun-thing, as reported in the underground press, for example) incite to drug usage, crime, hate and thus wound the community? Does this action depicted in detail in media (the description of sex-violence in paper- backs, the life-like visual presentation of murder, torture in films and television) in- cite to further violence and wound the com- munity? Again, reflect if you will, Mr. Justices, on mass distribution and see the depth of the wound to community in this material. Con- sider the millions of paperbacks and maga- zines distributed by mail and by carrier on our highways. Consider the mass viewing rate of films and television. Consider that radios are listened to by millions of children. You are aware, are you not, that a radio net- work owner recently discovered that certain rock and roll records incite to drug usage? That community outside your Court, Mr. Justices, is people-many people or few peo- ple; strangers to each other, perhaps, but united in some way; working toward a com- mon goal, with love emanating from each small unit. For any community to thrive, there must be love. Hate destroys community. Obscene material incites to hate. There is no better way to destroy community than by feeding it obscene material which rips it to pieces. That community must be safeguarded. It cannot survive too many more grave wounds. It cannot be protected by piling test upon test upon test. It is past time for the cultivation of that seed, Mr. Justices, the seed of community, which you have planted. It is urgent that you reconsider the entire obscenity picture in the light of the harm, the wound inflicted upon community by obscene material. It is time that you formulate a single community wound test. We submit that such a test, a test which will evaluate the real harm to the common good or the community, will provide clear, reliable guidelines for prosecutors and lower courts. It is past time for the fog to lift. The community needs protection. OPERATION YORKVILLE. Rabbi Dr. JULIUS G. NEUMANN. Rev. R. N. USHER-WnISON. Rev. MORTON A. HILL, S.J. Rev. CONSTANTINE VOLAITIS. LABOR MANAGEMENT RELATIONS ACT AMENDMENTS Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentle- man from New Jersey [Mr. THOMPSON] may extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. Mr. THOMPSON of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, it is my intention soon to in- troduce legislation to amend section 302(c) of the Labor Management Rela- tions Act to permit employer contribu-34197 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 tions to jointly administered trust funds established for the purpose of granting educational scholarships to employees and their dependents, or for the purpose of establishing child-care centers for pre- school and school-age dependents of em- ployees. As the Members know, section 302 of the LMRA restricts payments by em- ployers to employee representatives. Sec- tion 302(c) contains six exceptions to the general restriction on such payments. The proposed legislation would establish a seventh exception. Without this pro- posed exception the legality of employer contributions to jointly administered trust funds for either of the above ob- jectives would be open to question. In my judgment, permitting the estab- lishment of such trust funds will open new areas for mutually beneficial co- operation between management and labor. In addition, such trust funds could serve important national interests. Costs of education are constantly increasing, and virtually every American parent faces some hardship in sending his chil- dren to college. Trust funds established pursuant to this legislation could ease this burden for many American working- men and women, and enable young people to get the best education possible. Also, our economy will benefit from the availability of skilled women who can continue to work while their young chil- dren are cared for in child-care centers. It is my understanding that the dis- tinguished chairman of the other body's Subcommittee on Labor and others are introducing this bill. It is my hope that many of the Members will join me in sponsoring this legislation. A SPECIAL HOUSE COMMITTEE ON CAPTIVE NATIONS-AN APPRO- PRIATE ANSWER TO THE RUSSIAN BOLSHEVIK 50TH ANNIVERSARY Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentle- man from Pennsylvania [Mr. FLooD] may extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. Mr. FLOOD. Mr. Speaker, since theninth annual observance of Captive Na- tions Week this past July, the proposal for the creation of a Special Committee on the Captive Nations as an appropriate answer to the Russian Bolshevik 50th anniversary has gained wide acceptance. Although there are many other substan- tial reasons why such a committee should be established now, I believe this anni- versary of a fraudulent revolution serves as an excellent occasion for us to demon- strate how we feel about this tragic event in world history. The captive nations, both within and outside the Soviet Union, are eloquent testimony of the im- periocolonialist nature of the Russian Bolshevik revolution and its subsequent empire building. A CONGRESSIONAL OPPORTUNITY Today, with imperialist Moscow sup- porting in the main the totalitarian re- gime in Hanoi against our own boys,reinforcing the Arabs for another stab at Israel, and waging political warfare against us on all fronts in the free world, this Congress has a golden opportunity to show the Soviet Russian \"50th\" for what it really is by establishing now a Special House Committee on the Captive Nations. It is our opportunity to demon- strate initiative, foresight, and vision with regard to the prime imperiocolo- nialist power in the world today. Mr. Speaker, the 1967 Captive Nations Week observance has underwritten once again the dedication of our people to the principles of national self-determination, independence, and freedom for all na- tions. That there still are large segments of our society and active individuals who hold these principles as sacred and true, I request that the following examples be appended to my remarks: First, the proclamation by Gov. Ken- neth M. Curtis, of Maine; second, the resolution prepared by Dr. Lev E. Do- briansky, of Georgetown University, and accepted by the first conference of the World Anti-Communist League in Taipei, Free China, on the 10th observance of Captive Nations Week, July 14 to 20, 1968; third, the timely editorial and reply in the Record American, in Boston, of September 1 and 11; fourth, the item in the August 19 issue of the Manchester, N.H., Union Leader on \"The Importance of Remembering Captive People\"; fifth, the report \"Captive Nations Week Ob- servance Is Proclaimed,\" in the Morning Sentinel, July 20, of Waterville, Maine; sixth, the report in the September 7 Hairenik Weekly on \"New Hampshire Holds Captive Nations Rites\"; and sev- enth, the article in the July 6 Boston Herald on \"Captive Nations Get Lip- service,\" and the Izvestia attack against Dr. Dobriansky and Captive Nations Week, as published in the October issue of the Ukrainian Bulletin. The material referred to follows: PROCLAMATION OF THE STATE OF MAINE Whereas, Public Laws 86-90 (86th Congress, S.J. Res. 11) designates the third week of each July as Captive Nations Week, authorizes and requests the President of the United States to issue an annual Proclamation on the subject, and nvites the people of our na- tion \"to observe such week with appropriate ceremonies and activities;\" and Whereas, \"Captive Nations Week,\" July 17-23, 1967, thus gives all thinking Ameri- cans an appropriate and official means of manifesting that America shares with those nations today held in colonial bondage by the imperialism of Soviet Russia their aspira- tions for the recovery of their freedom and of their independence; and Whereas, there reside in our State large numbers of Americans who proudly own to ancestry deriving from those once free na- tions now held under Communist domina- tion: Armenia, Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Rumania, Bul- garia, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Servia- Croatia-Slovenia (in Yugoslavia), Byelorussia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Idel-Ural, North Cau- casus, Par Eastern Republic, Turkestan, Mon- golia, Albania, North Korea, North Vietnam, Mainland China, Tibet and finally Cuba; and Whereas, these submerged nations look to the United States, as the citadel of human freedom, for leadership in bringing about their independence; and Whereas, it is vital to the interests and to the national security of the United Statesthat the desire to be free on the part of thepeoples of these conquered nations should be steadfastly kept alive, especially since thisdesire for liberty and independence consti-tutes a powerful deterrant to war and one of the best hopes for a just and a lasting peace; Now, therefore, I, Kenneth M. Curtis, Gov- ernor of the State of Maine, do hereby pro- claim the week of July 17-23, 1967, as Captive Nations Week in the State of Maine, and urge all citizens to observe such week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. KENNETH M. CURTIS, Governor. Attest: JOSEPH T. EDGAR, Secretary of State. [Resolution 10 of the first conference of the World Anti-Communist League] RESOLUTION ON THE 10TH OBSERVANCE OF CAP- TIVE NATIONS WEEK, JULY 14-20, 1968 Whereas since 1959, when the United States Congress passed the Captive Nations Week Resolution and President Dwight D. Eisen- hower signed it into Public Law 86-90, all communist capitals have bitterly denounced this document as being inimical to their fundamental interests; and Whereas to the increasing consternation of Moscow, Peiping, Pyouyang, Havana and others, the Captive Nations Week movement has steadily grown in the United States, and every President in this decade has issued a proclamation in behalf of the independence and freedom of every captive nation in Cen- tral Europe, the Soviet Union, Asia, and Cuba; and Whereas the movement to support the freedom aspirations and liberation of all the captive nations has taken hold in many coun- tries of the Free World, as witness the Cap- tive Nations Week observances in the Repub- lics of China and Korea, in Argentina and Australia, in Germany and Great Britain, and a number of other countries; and Whereas for the security of the Free World and for Cold War victory over the deadly forces of Communism and Sino-Soviet Rus- sian imperlo-colonialism, it is indispensable for all free men regularly to make known their determination never to acquiesce to the permanent captivity of twenty-seven nations in the Red Empire; therefore, Be It Resolved by the World Anti-Commu- nist League and its members and associated groups to exert every effort to make the Tenth Observance of Captive Nations in July 15-21, 1968, the most successful yet by (1) urging each Head of State to issue a Cap- tive Nations Week Proclamation patterned after that of the President of the United States, (2) conducting observances of the Week in member countries and utilizing all media so that our combined message will be conveyed to the captive nations, and (3) dis- patching the published results of this event to the National Captive Nations Committee in Washington, D.C. for their appropriate transmission to the United States Congress and the President. [From the Boston (Mass.) Record American, Sept. 1, 1967] CAMPAIGN BY TERROR We trust that those members of Congress who have been casting doubt on the fair- ness and importance of the impending Viet- nam elections have been reading what's go- ing on out there these days. The biggest news of the campaign now is the climactic campaign of terror being waged by Commu- nist guerrillas in a desperate attempt to keep voters away from the polls. Secretary of State Dean Rusk took earnest note of this situation in his address to the American Legion here Tuesday when he charged that critics of the up-coming elec- tions ignore the Viet Cong terrorism which34198 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE he labeled \"the greatest obstacle\" to free and fair voting. As next Sunday's balloting grows closer, the Viet Cong terror raids daily grow more vicious and widespread. More than 600 South Vietnamese civilians were killed or wounded over last weekend alone. Men, women and children were mowed down by machine guns in villages, others were butchered in their hospital beds. Even chil- dren are being used by the Communists to mount their grisly attacks. The weak word \"unfair\" cannot even be applied to an atrocity drive which seems to block democratic processes by the cruelest of tyrannical methods. Yet we have heard no words of criticism or condemnation com- ing from those lawmakers who have been going out of their way to sniff at the fair- ness of the elections themselves. We ask these people: What do you think of the Communist campaign tactics? And we ask them another question: If these elections are as unimportant and meaningless as you have tried to suggest, how come the Com- munists are waging the greatest terror wave of the war in an attempt to spoil them? You can bet the loudest and most per- sistent Washington critics of America's Viet- nam policies will continue to remain signifi- cantly silent on both questions. [From the Boston (Mass.) Record American, Sept. 11, 1967] TIMELY EDITORIAL WEST ROXBURY.-Your recent editorial, \"Campaign by Terror,\" Record American, September 1, 1967, again underscored the fact that Communists are ready to employ the most brutal methods when it comes to im- posing Communist tyranny on other people. It is regrettable, indeed, that Viet Cong terror and murder of the civilian South Viet- namese population has not received more attention and has not been severely con- demned in the free world. Terror, executions, forced labor and mass deportations of innocent people have been the Communist trademarks. They are part of the Communist ideology for 50 years. Com- munist Russia has employed these methods against Ukrainians. Armenians, Lithuanians, Latvians and other captive nations in sub- duing their national aspirations for freedom and independence. Considerable literature is available to us which discloses the facts and statistics of Communist methods of terror inflicted on people In captive countries. Therefore, I believe, such editorials as yours are timely and there is need for more of them, to help people in understanding the methods used by Communists in obtaining their objectives. O. SZCZUDLUK. [From the Manchester (N.H.) Union Leader, Aug. 19, 1967] THE IMPORTANCE OF REMEMBERING CAPTIVE PEOPLE Addressed to William Loeb: \"We would appreciate your publishing the enclosed material on captive nations in the Manchester Union Leader, either as an arti- cle or in the 'Letter to the Editor' column. \"We thank you, Mr. Loeb, and the editors of the Manchester Union Leader for your en- deavors on behalf of freedom for captive na- tions under Russian Communist rule. \"OREST SZCZUDLUK, Executive Secretary, New England Committee for Captive Nations, Bos- ton, Mass.\" Former President Eisenhower stated re- cently that the basic Soviet goals remain the same, despite the Glassboro summit confer- ence: \"They (Communist) will push and prod wherever they think they can gain an advantage.\" This statement was especially appropriate in connection with this year's observanceof Captive Nations Week. President Johnson and N.H. Governor King issued \"Captive Na- tions Week\" proclamations. Set into law by Congress in 1959, the Cap- tive Nations Week Resolution charged the Soviet Russia with the \"imperialistic and ag- gressive policies\" against Poland, Hungary, Lithuania, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, Latvia, Estonia, Byelorussia, Rumania, East Ger- many, Bulgaria, mainland China, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, North Korea, Albania, Idel-Ural, Tibet, Cossackia, Turkestan, North Vietnam and others. The 1967 CNW provided immense oppor- tunities to advance the cause of the captive nations by: 1. Exposing the fraudulent 50th anniver- sary of the Bolshevik Revolution. The na- tional revolutions of the enslaved non-Rus- sian nations were, instead, the genuine rev- olutions because they expressed the prin- ciple of freedom, national self-determina- tion and sovereign equality of all nations. The Bolshevik revolution brought aggression and slavery. 2. Congressional review of United States policy with respect to the Soviet Union and its Communist empire. The need for new policies to meet Communist aggressions was evident during the recent debate at the United Nations on Middle East, when the United States delegation failed to challenge the Soviet Union on its aggression in East- ern and Central Europe. Cong. Edward J. Derwinski, Illinois, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Com- mittee, introduced on June 22, 1967, House Resolution 666, calling for a Congressional review of U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union. We urge Congress to approve this resolution and set it in motion during this session of Congress. As President Kennedy said: \"This country must never recognize the situation behind the Iron Curtain as a per- manent one, but must, by all peaceful means, keep alive the hopes of freedom of the cap- tive nations.\" [From the Waterville (Maine) Morning Sen- tinel, July 20, 1967] CAPTIVE NATIONS WEEK OBSERVANCE Is PROCLAIMED Observance of \"Captive Nations Week\" is underway in Maine this week following a proclamation signed by Gov. Kenneth M. Curtis. Rep. Herman D. Sahagian of Belgrade is state chairman of the observance for the sec- ond consecutive year. \"Captive Nations Week\" has been desig- nated as a tribute to countries throughout the world who are \"held in colonial bond- age by the imperialism of Soviet Russia.\" The proclamation points out that \"there reside in our state large numbers of Ameri- cans who proudly own to ancestry deriving from those once-free nations now held under Communist domination: Armenia, Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania, Czechoslovakia, Servia- Croatia-Slovenia (in Yugoslavia), Byelorus- sia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Idel-Ural, North Caucasus, Far Eastern Republic, Turkestan, Mongolia, Albania, North Korea, North Viet- nam, Mainland China, Tibet and finally Cuba.\" \"These submerged nations look to the United States, as the citadel of human free- dom, for leadership In bringing about their independence,\" the proclamation states. [From the Hairenik Weekly, Sept. 7, 1967] NEW HAMPSHIRE HOLDS CAPTIVE NATIONS RITES ASHLAND, N.H., July 23.-New Hampshire today observed its \"Captive Nations Week\" ceremonies, with speakers, proper rites and the reading of a special Proclamation issued by His Excellency, Governor John W. King, of New Hampshire. The Proclamation was read by the Gov-ernor's representative, the Hon. Sarkis Maloomian, a veteran Member of the N.H. House of Representatives, from Somersworth, N.H., who spearheaded the Captive Nations effort in this state in conjunction with the New England Committee for Captive Nations. Messages were read from Congressman James C. Cleveland, Senator Norris Cotton, and Mayors Rolfe Camp, Herbert Quinn, and Marian Phillips. Principal speakers were Mr. Herbert Phil- brick, former FBI personnel, whose book \"I Lived Three Lives\" was a best seller a few years ago, and General Harrison Thyng, a past candidate for the Senate from New Hampshire. Wreathes were laid by Polish, Cuban and Byelorussian groups, and Ashland's head Selectman, Norman Weden spoke. The Torch of Freedom was lit, and a Color Guard of the Cross American Legion Post was in attendance. Invocation and Benediction was said by the Rev. Dr. Ryki-Ryski, a Byelorussian cleric. The text of Gov. King's Proclamation reads: \"A PROCLAMATION OF THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE ON CAPTIVE NATIONS WEEK, BY His EXCELLENCY, Gov. JOHN W. KING \"Whereas, the imperialistic policies of Rus- sian Communists have led, through direct and indirect aggression, to the subjugation and enslavement of the peoples of Poland, Hungary, Lithuania, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, Latvia, Estonia, White Ruthenia, Rumania, East Germany, Bulgaria, Mainland China, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, North Korea, Albania, Idel-Ural, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Tibet, Cossackia, Turkestan, North Vietnam, Cuba, and others; and \"Whereas, the desire for liberty and inde- pendence by the overwhelming majority of peoples in these conquered nations consti- tutes a powerful deterrent to any ambitions of communist leaders to Initiate a major war; and \"Whereas, the freedom-loving peoples of the Cap Native Nations look to the United States as the citadel of human freedom and to the people of the United States as leaders in bringing about their freedom and inde- pendence; and \"Whereas, the Congress of the United States by unanimous vote passed Public Law 86-90 establishing the the ird week in July each year as Captive Nations Week and in- viting the people of the United States to ob- serve such week with appropriate prayers, ceremonies and activities; expressing their sympathy with and support fort the ust aspirations of captive peoples for freedom and independence; \"Now, therefore, I, John W.

Herald, July 6, 1967] ALL STILL IN RED POCKET DESPITE 1959 REso- LUTION: CAPTIVE NATIONS GET LIPSERVICE (By Ted Lewis) WASHINGTON.-When Congress chose the third week of July as Captive Nations Week it was because it seemed fitting to have the34199 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 observance come right after our own July 4 celebration of the Declaration of Independ- ence from foreign rule. It is now eight years since Senate and House unanimously approved the resolu- tion setting aside a specific July week for the U.S. to recommit itself to support the cause of freedom fighters in countries under the Communist yoke. The language of the resolution was clear. It constituted a Congressional stand against any \"peaceful coexistence\" deals with Moscow until the peoples of Red satel- lites recovered \"their freedom and Inde- pendence.\" The intent was just as positive along that line as the Viet war commitment made by Congress in the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin resolution. But unlike the administration's use of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution as a reference point from which policy stems, the captive nations resolution is considered an unwar- ranted Congressional intrusion into the executive branch's policy-making preserves. Annually there is almost always an em- barrassingly weak-worded presidential proclamation of Captive Nations Week. Consider some of the language in the Congressional resolution. It says that \"en- slavement of a substantial part of the world's population by Communist imperial- ism makes a mockery of the idea of peaceful coexistence between nations.\" And it refers to how \"these submerged nations\" look to the U.S. \"for leadership in bringing about their liberation and independence.\" President Eisenhower's follow-up procla- mation in 1959 simply called on all citizens \"to study the plight of the Soviet-domi- nated nations\" and to recommit themselves to the support of \"the just aspirations of all people for national independence in free- dom.\" John F. Kennedy followed an even softer verbiage line in his proclamations, such as that in 1963 \"inviting the people of the United States to observe such a week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\" Last year President Johnson similarly used the soft pedal, with four whereases citing how the U.S. since its founding \"has firmly subscribed to the principles of national in- dependence and human liberty.\" As sure as shooting, the President's 1967 proclamation-due in a few days-will con- tain the same lip service to the cause of free- dom in other lands. It doesn't take a mind reader in the Kremlin to notice how these proclamations, beginning with Ike's, keep open the door to peaceful coexistence as Congress never intended in the resolution of 1959. It would be pleasant to be able to report that eight years after Congress established its anti-captive nation policy, some progress had been made. But every one of the specific captive coun- tries named in the 1959 resolution is still firmly under the Communist yoke. A total of 21 were named, ranging from Poland to Albania in Europe to Turkestan and North Vietnam in Asia. The only shifts in any of these 21 have been in allegiance to Peking rather than Moscow, as In the case of Albania. And of course Red China in 1959 was considered a Moscow puppet and not an ideological rival. Castro's Cuba was only a Red dream in 1959, so the Communist menace, considered eight years ago to embrace only 21 captive nations, has now reached this hemisphere, as well as showing signs of developing captive nations in Africa and the Middle East. The case of North Vietnam itself shows the twists and turns in White House and State Department policy compared with the liberation-aid pledge, fundamental to the 1959 resolution. Instead of even moral support for any freedom forces that may exist in that captive nation, our war aims are totally againstHanoi's aggression in the South, with a presi- dential pledge to respect the sovereignty of the North if our terms are accepted. Prof. Lev E. Dobriansky of Georgetown University, who is chairman of the National Captive Nations Committee, says one of the highlights in this month's observance of \"the week\" will be \"the plight of the 17 mil- lion captive North Vietnamese.\" \"It is strange indeed,\" said Dobriansky, \"that few of our leaders even discuss this troublesome subject. Yet it is crucial to our winning the war in South Vietnam.\" [From the Ukrainian Bulletin, Oct. 15, 1967] IZVESTIA ATTACKS DR. DOBRIANSKY AND CAPTIVE NATIONS WEEK Each year before or after \"Captive Nations Week\" in the United States, the Soviet press attacks the concept of the captive nations as well as its originator, Dr. Lev E. Dobrian- sky of Georgetown University, who is Presi- dent of the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America, and chairman of the National Captive Nations Committee. Soviet attacks and vituperation only strengthen a long-established fact that the captive nations constitute a veritable \"Achilles' Heel\" of the Soviet Russian em- pire. Consequently, the Soviet press is trying to belittle and ridicule the idea of the cap- tive nations. It is somewhat astonishing that the Soviet press has found an eager ally in this country-The Washington Post-which has been degrading and satirizing \"Captive Nations Week, as for instance, in its editorial, \"Captive Congressmen\" of July 10, 1967. The spurious and scathing attack of Izves- tia is reproduced below, along with a photo- static copy of the Russian original, appearing on July 7, 1967: \"A CYNIC-CHAMPION \"(By A. Ter-Grigorian) \"In Georgetown University in the United States of America, a world record has been established. It was not established by a run- ner or a swimmer or even a spaghetti-eater, but by Professor Lev Dobriansky, a fairly important cog in the American propaganda machine, who is Chairman of the so-called 'National Captive Nations Committee.' \"The thing is that every year in July the rulers in Washington put on an eye-sore of a propaganda spectacle, titled 'Captive Na- tions Week.' The emigrant rabble who were chucked out of various socialist countries and Soviet national republics by the revolu- tionary tornado line up in rows and syn- chronously shed tears in remembrance of the 'good old days' when one could thrive on the blood and sweat of the people, who have now rejected capitalism. Sometimes, even the leading statesmen of the USA let a little tear fall. Rank and file 'has beens' are in- jected with a bit of courage and radiate throughout their stores, cloak rooms, and lobbies, while 'has been' leaders hand over to various American departments resources that have been gathered for subversive work against their own peoples. \"This time the advent of the notorious 'Week' is being violently commented upon by the reactionary American press. In recent years, the 'Week' has been undergoing a crisis; it is slipping by uneffectively, the anti- Communists complain. It is necessary to shift from fancy words about freedom to ac- tion. They are even scolding Washington for an insufficiently firm desire to aid the 'peo- ples of captive nations.' Something new is needed, they say. \"So, it is here that Mr. Dobriansky has set his record. If not a record of cynicism, it is a record of stupidity. The focal point of the 'Week,' announced Dobriansky in re- sponse to the wish of the leadership in Wash- ington, will this year be the 'disastrous sit- uation of the 17 million captive North Viet- namese.' \"Obviously, the armed war-heads of the'Shrike' and the napalm, with which Amerl-can aircraft have for two years now plasteredthe cities and towns of the DRV (the Demo.cratic Republic of Vietnam), are intended, according to the thinking of the organizers of the infamous spectacle, to save the North Vietnamese from the 'disastrous situation.' However, some champions of cynicism are notrescuing the American propaganda perform. ance from its usual insolvency.\" A HISTORY LESSON Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentle-man from California [Mr. VAN DEERLB3] may extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. Mr. VAN DEERLIN. Mr. Speaker, a resolution that the United States aban- don its commitment in South Vietnam has just been resoundingly defeated in Cambridge, Mass. Cambridge, of course, is the seat of Harvard University, and I suspect the voters there are about as sophisticated as anywhere in the United States. I was, therefore, somewhat bemused by Prof. Kenneth Galbraith's statement that the 39-percent support for his pull- out proposal constituted a \"remarkable showing.\" Dr. Galbraith contends that Ameri- cans have been \"unanimous\" in their support of past wars. He is an eminent economist, but ap- parently does not know his history very well. Anyone familiar with our past knows that hardly any war has been unani- mously supported. President Johnson has taken pains to research this matter in recent weeks. Some of the speeches that were made in this House opposing the Mexican War were actually suppressed because of their violence. Surely the professor remembers the Korea war. Unanimous? It became less so as it continued, month after month. World War I? There were draft riots, and widespread opposition afterward to \"foreign entanglements.\" President Lincoln prosecuted the Civil War despite a rampant \"Copperhead\" element right here in the Capital. Yes, I think Dr. Galbraith better stick to things he knows, like economics, and leave history to the historians-and resolutions to those who better under- stand the temper of the American people. THE PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentle- man from Maryland [Mr. FRIEDEL] may extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. Mr. FRIEDEL. Mr. Speaker, President Johnson's press conference of November 17 was a demonstration of Presidential leadership at its best.34200 November 29, 1967 The Baltimore News American said: The press conference may go down in his- tory as his own finest hour .... He not only successfully faced and answered the repre- sentatives of some of his bitterest critics- he did so with wit, vigor and devastating logic. What the President did, as the News American points out in its editorial of November 21, was to place in proper perspective the criticism being directed at him on Vietnam. President Johnson ably and logically defended his policies. He clearly stated the conditions under which the conflicts could terminate. And he was steadfast in America's commitment not to desert the 15 million free people of South Viet- nam. The News American said there was \"grandeur and majesty\" in the Presi- dent's words. There was also determina- tion and resolve. Let us do our part in helping our President persevere in the face of a very strong challenge to free- dom. Under unanimous permission I insert in the RECORD an editorial from the Balti- more News American entitled \"Leader- ship in Action\": LEADERSHIP IN ACTION Lyndon Johnson's press conference on Fri- day may go down in history as his own finest hour. No fair-minded American who wit- nessed his enormous self-possession on tele- vision, or who has read the compelling words he spoke with such restrained authority, can doubt for a moment this was a display of leadership in our very best tradition. Probably no President of the United States with the exception of Lincoln has had to undergo the enormous pressures to which Mr. Johnson is being subjected. Yet here, in the East Room of the White House, he not only successfully faced and answered the representatives of some of his bitterest critics-he did so with wit, vigor and dev- astating logic. What the President did, primarily, was to place in proper perspective the barrage of criticism being directed at him over the Viet- nam war. He noted with no false modesty every other war-time president had to en- dure similar violent dissent by those who would prefer compromise to the pain of battle for the right. And he made it unmistakably clear, again with no false modesty, he thinks in the end he will emerge with the honors now accorded those once-maligned predeces- sors. The words spoken extemporaneously by President Johnson were the words of an American patriot. They also were the words of a suffering but iron-willed leader who will never be swayed from doing the right as he sees it. It is not too much to say there was a grandeur and certain majesty to them, and in the appearance of the man who spoke them. Friday's press conference was an his- toric event. PEACE CORPS Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentle- man from Texas [Mr. PICKLE] may ex- tend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. Mr. PICKLE. Mr. Speaker, for over 6 years now, the young volunteers of the Peace Corps have been going all over theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOT world giving other friendly countries the technical assistance and know-how that has helped make our own country great. I have read the words of many of the critics of this program who argue that this program is not in keeping with the best interests of our welfare; that it is an intrusion into affairs that are not our own; that it is foreign. To those who feel this way about the Peace Corps, I would ask that you reflect a moment on what single characteristic most symbolized the pioneer spirit of the early days of our country. I believe the answer would be that we pulled each other up by our own bootstraps. We helped our neighbors. The same prin- ciple holds true in the Peace Corps. But instead of helping our neighbor build a cabin or clear some land, we are helping him build up his entire country. In any of the 50 countries where our more than 12,000 volunteers are, they are there at the request and invitation of the host country. And the work they are doing there is beneficial and self-satis- fying to the host country, but also to the individual and to the United States as well. By giving underdeveloped countries aid at the grassroots level, we are showing in the strongest possible way that we as Americans do care about their well-being. This goes a long way both in improving the economy of the country and in elimi- nating any conditions where communism may find a toehold. It also gives the peo- ple of these countries a firsthand look at a democracy. Mr. Speaker, I simply would like to say that to my way of thinking, the Peace Corps is one of our strong national assets and I salute those who have dedicated their lives to this cause. McNAMARA APPOINTMENT TO WORLD BANK Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentle- man from California [Mr. LEGGETT] may extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. Mr. LEGGETT. Mr. Speaker, Secre- tary McNamara perhaps imminently will be transferred to the position of Presi- dent of the World Bank. At a time when the U.S. foreign aid commitment is at a 20-year-record low, this appointment is worldwide significant. Ironically, the Secretary is most fitted for his new posi- tion. Perhaps the best foreign affairs speech of the decade was delivered in Montreal last year on May 18 by Bob McNamara. He started in part: Now I mention this-as obvious as it all is-simply as a kind of reductio ad absurdum of the concept that military hardware is the exclusive or even the primary ingredient of permanent peace in the mid 20th Cen- tury ..from the point of view of combat readiness, the United States has never been militarily stronger ...a nation can reach the point though where it does not buy more security for itself simply by buying more military hardware-we are at that point. Our security is related directly to the secu-JSE 34201 rity of the newly developed world ...secu- rity is not military hardware ..although it may include it ... Without economic, social and political development, security is impossible .. Annual per capita income in roughly half of the 80 underdeveloped nations that are members of the World Bank is rising by a paltry 1 per cent per year or less. By the end of the century, these nations will reach a per capita income of barely $170 a year while the United States will grow to $4,500. In California we grow at the rate of $170 per year in per capita income and our current $90 billion GNP economy will be the third largest economic unit in the world in the mid 1970's. We need balanced forces-military, economic and political to provide peace in our time. If a very sophisticated highly developed military will have patience, we in the Congress will try to catch up with the nonmilitary components. Bob McNamara in the World Bank can certainly help. If the Secretary can orient the world's best lending institution for developing nations to Pentagon proportions and cost effectiveness, perhaps our State De- partment will be reinspired again to un- dertake a leadership effective role with the emerging nations. The Secretary's complete foreign policy statement fol- lows: MCNAMa~A's NEW DESIGN FOR WORLD PEACE AND SECURITY* Any American would be fortunate to visitthis lovely island city, In this hospitable land.But there is a special satisfaction for a Secretary of Defense to cross the longestborder in the world-and realize that it is also the least armed border in the world. Itprompts one to reflect how negative and narrow a notion of defense still clouds our century. There is still among us an almost ineradi- cable tendency to think of our security prob- lem as being exclusively a military prob-lem-and to think of the military problem as being exclusively a weapons system or hard- ware problem. The plain, blunt truth is that contempo- rary man still conceives of war and peace inmuch the same stereotyped terms that his ancestors did. The fact that these ancestors-both recent and remote-were conspicuously unsuccess- ful at avoiding war, and enlarging peace, doesn't seem to dampen our capacity for cliches. We still tend to conceive of national secu- rity almost solely as a state of armed readi- ness: a vast, awesome arsenal of weaponry. We still tend to assume that it is primarilythis purely military ingredient that creates security. We are still haunted by this concept ofmilitary hardware. But how limited a concept this actually is becomes apparent when one ponders the kindof peace that exists between the United States and Canada. It is a very cogent example. Here we are, twomodern nations, highly developed technologi- cally, each with immense territory, both en-riched with great reserves of natural re- sources, each militarily sophisticated-and yet, we sit across from one another, divided by an unguarded frontier of thousands of miles--and there id not a remotest set of circumstances, in any imaginable time frame *Pull text of address by Secretary of De- fense Robert S. McNamara to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, Montreal, May 18, 1966. Reprinted from U.S. News & World Report, v. 60, May 30, 1966, pp. 90-95. Copy- right 1966, U.S. News & World Report, Inc. CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 of the future, in which our two nations would wage war on one another. It is so unthinkable an idea as to be totally absurd. But why is that so? Is it because we are both ready in an in- stant to hurl our military hardware at one another? Is it because we are both zeroed in on one another's vital targets? Is it because we are both armed to our technological teeth that we do not go to war? The whole notion-as applied to our two countries-is ludicrous. Canada and the United States are at peace for reasons that have nothing whatever to do with our mutual military readiness. We are at peace-truly at peace-because of the vast fund of compatible beliefs, com- mon principles and shared ideals. We have our differences and cur diversity- and let us hope for the sake of a mutually rewarding relationship we never become sterile carbon copies of one another. But the whole point is that our basis of mutual peace has nothing whatever to do with our military hardware. Now this is not to say, obviously enough, that the concept of military deterrence is no longer relevant in the contemporary world. Unhappily, it still is critically relevant with respect to our pottntial adversaries. But it has no relevance whatever between the United States and Canada. We are not adversaries. We are not going to become adversaries. And it is not mutual military deterrence that keeps us from be- coming adversaries. It is mutual respect for common principles. Now I mention this-as obvious as it all Is-simply as a kind of reductio ad absurdum of the concept that military hardware is the exclusive, or even the primary, ingredient of permanent peace in the mid-20th century. In the United States-over the past 5 years-we have achieved a considerably im- proved balance in our total military posture. That was the mandate I received from Presi- dents Kennedy and Johnson; and with their support, and that of the Congress, we have been able to create a strengthened force structure of land, sea, and air components- with a vast increase in mobility and ma- teriel-and with a massive superiority in nu- clear retaliatory power over any combination of potential adversaries. Our capabilities for nuclear, conventional, and countersubversive war have all been broadened and improved, and we have ac- complished this through military budgets that were, in fact, lesser percentages of our gross national product than in the past. From the point of view of combat readi- ness, the United States has never been mili- tarily stronger. We intend to maintain that readiness. But if we think profoundly about the mat- ter, it is clear that this purely military pos- ture is not the central element in our se- curity. A nation can reach the point at which it does not buy more security for itself simply by buying more military hardware. We are at that point. The decisive factor for a powerful nation-- already adequately armed-is the character of its relationships with the world. In this respect, there are three broad groups of nations: first, those that are strug- gling to develop; secondly, those free na- tions that have reached a level of strength and prosperity that enables them to con- tribute to the peace of the world; and, finally, those nations who might be tempted to make themselves our adversaries. For each of these groups, the United States-to preserve its own intrinsic security -has to have distinctive sets of relation- ships. First, we have to help protect those devel- oping countries which genuinely need andrequest our help, and which-as an essential precondition-are willing and able to help themselves. Second, we have to encourage and achieve a more effective partnership with those na- tions who can and should share international peacekeeping responsibilities. Third, we must do all we realistically can to reduce the risk of conflict with those who might be tempted to take up arms against us. Let us examine these three sets of rela- tionships in detail. First, the developing nations. Roughly 100 countries today are caught up in the difficult transition from traditional to modern societies. There is no uniform rate of progress among them, and they range from primitive mosaic societies-fractured by tribalism and held feebly together by the slenderest of political sinews-to relatively sophisticated countries, well on the road to agricultural sufficiency and industrial competence. This sweeping surge of development, par- ticularly across the whole southern half of the globe, has no parallel in history. It has turned traditionally listless areas of the world into seething cauldrons of change. On the whole, it has not been a very peace- ful process. In the last 8 years alone, there have been no less than 164 internationally significant outbreaks of violence-each of them specifi- cally designed as a serious challenge to the authority, or the very existence, of the gov- ernment in question. Eighty-two different governments have been directly involved. What is striking is that only 15 of these 164 significant resorts to violence have been military conflicts between two states. And not a single one of the 164 conflicts has been a formally declared war. Indeed, there has not been a formal decla- ration of war-anywhere in the world-since World War II. The planet is becoming a more dangerous place to live on-not merely because of a potential nuclear holocaust-but also be- cause of the large number of de facto con- flicts and because the trend of such conflicts is growing rather than diminishing. At the beginning of 1958, there were 23 pro- longed insurgencies going on about the world. As of February 1, 1966, there were 40. Further, the total number of outbreaks of violence has increased each year: In 1958, there were 34; in 1965, there were 58. But what is most significant of all is that there is a direct and constant relationship between the incidence of violence and the economic status of the countries afflicted. The World Bank divides nations, on the basis of per capita income into four cate- gories: rich, middle-income, poor, and very poor. The rich nations are those with a per ca- pita income of $750 per year or more. The current U.S. level is more than $2,700. There are 27 of these rich nations. They possess 75 percent of the world's wealth, though roughly only 25 percent of the world's popu- lation. Since 1958, only one of these 27 nations has suffered a major internal upheaval on its own territory. But observe what happens at the other end of the economic scale. Among the 38 very poor nations-those with a per capita in- come of under $100 a year-no less than 32 have suffered significant conflicts. Indeed, they have suffered an average of two major outbreaks of violence per country in the 8- year period. That is a great deal of conflict. What is worse, it has been, predominantly, conflict of a prolonged nature. The trend holds predictably constant in the case of the two other categories: the poor, and the middle-income nations. Since 1958, 87 percent of the very poor nations, 69 percent of the poor nations, and 48 per-cent of the middle-income nations have suf- fered serious violence. There can, then, be no question but that there is an irrefutable relationship between violence and economic backwardness. And the trend of such violence is up, not down. Now, it would perhaps be somewhat re- assuring if the gap between the rich nations and the poor nations were closing, and eco- nomic backwardness were significantly reced- ing. But it is not. The economic gap is widen- ing. By the year 1970, over one-half of the world's total population will live in the in- dependent nations sweeping across the south- ern half of the planet. But this hungering half of the human race will by then com- mand only one-sixth of the world's total of goods and services. By the year 1975, the dependent children of these nations alone-children under 15 years of age-will equal the total population of the developed nations to the north. Even in our own abundant societies, we have reason enough to worry over the ten- sions that coil and tighten among under- privileged young people, and finally flail out in delinquency and crime. What are we to expect from a whole hemisphere of youth where mounting frustrations are likely to fester into eruptions of violence and ex- tremism? Annual per capita income in roughly half of the 80 underdeveloped nations that are members of the World Bank is rising by a paltry 1 percent a year or less. By the end of the century, these nations-at their present rates of growth-will reach a per capita in- come of barely $170 a year. The United States, by the same criteria, will attain a per capita income of $4,500. The conclusion to all of this is blunt and inescapable: Given the certain connection between economic stagnation and the inci- dence of violence, the years that lie ahead for the nations in the southern half of the globe are pregnant with violence. This would be true even if no threat of Communist subversion existed-as it clearly does. IDEAL ENVIRONMENT FOR COMMUNISM Both Moscow and Peiping-however harsh their internal differences-regard the whole modernization process as an ideal environ- ment for the growth of communism. Their experience with subversive internal war is extensive, and they have developed a consid- erable array of both aocrine and practical measures in the art of political violence. What is often misunderstood is that Com- munists are capable of subverting, manip- ulating, and finally directing for their own ends the wholly legitimate grievances of a developing society. But it would be a gross oversimplification to regard communism as the central factor in every conflict throughout the underde- veloped world. Of the 149 serious internal insurgencies in the past 8 years, Communists have been involved in only 58 of them-38 percent of the total-and this includes 7 in- stances in which a Communist regime itself was the target of the uprising. Whether Communists are involved or not, violence anywhere in a taut world transmits sharp signals through the complex ganglia of international relations; and the security of the United States is related to the security and stability of nations half a globe away. But neither conscience nor sanity itself suggests that the United States is, should or could be the global gendarme. Quite the contrary, experience confirms what human nature suggests: that, in most instances of internal violence, the local peo- ple themselves are best able to deal directly with the situation within the framework of their own traditions. The United States has no mandate from34202 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE on high to police the world and no inclina- tion to do so. There have been classic cases in which our deliberate nonaction was the wisest action of all. Where our help is not sought, it is seldom prudent to volunteer. Certainly we have no charter to rescue floundering regimes who have brought vio- lence on themselves by deliberately refusing to meet the legitimate expectations of their citizenry. Further, throughout the next decade, ad- vancing technology will reduce the require- ment for bases and staging rights at partic- ular locations abroad, and the whole pattern of forward deployment will gradually change. But-though all these caveats are clear enough-the irreducible fact remains that our security is related directly to the security of the newly developing world. sECURITY FOR UNDERDEVELOPED PEOPLE And our role must be precisely this: To help provide security to those developing na- tions which genuinely need and request our help, and which demonstrably are willing and able to help themselves. The rub comes in this: We do not always grasp the meaning of the word \"security\" in this context. In a modernizing society, security means development. Security is not military hardware-though it may include it. Security is not military force-though it may involve it. Security is not traditional military activity-though it may encompass it. Security is development. Without development, there can be no se- curity. A developing nation that does not, in fact, develop simply cannot remain \"secure.\" It cannot remain secure for the intractable reason that its own citizenry cannot shed its human nature. If security implies anything, it implies a minimal measure of order and stability. Without internal development of at least a minimal degree, order and stability are simply not possible. They are not possible because human nature cannot be frustrated beyond intrinsic limits. It reacts-because it must. Now, that is what we do not always under- stand, and that is also what governments of modernizing nations do not always under- stand. But by emphasizing that security arises from development, I do not say that an un- derdeveloped nation cannot be subverted from within, or be aggressed upon from without, or be the victim of a combinatipn of the two. It can. And to prevent any or all of these conditions, a nation does require appropriate military capabilities to deal with the specific problem. But the specific military problem is only a narrow facet of the broader se- curity problem. Military force can help provide law and order-but only to the degree that a basis for law and order already exists in the de- veloping society: A basic willingness on the part of the people to cooperate. The law and order is a shield, behind which the central fact of security-development- can be achieved. Now we are not playing a semantic game with these words. The trouble is that we have been lost in a semantic jungle for too long. We have come to identify \"security\" with exclusively military phenomena, and most particularly with military hardware. But it just isn't so. And we need to ac- commodate to the facts of the matter, if we want to see security survive and grow in the southern half of the globe. Development means economic, social, and political progress. It means a reasonable standard of living-and the word \"reason- CXIII- 2154-Part 25able\" in this context requires continual re- definition. What is \"reasonable\" in an earlier stage of development will become \"unrea- sonable\" in a later stage. As development progresses, security pro- gresses, and when the people of a nation have organized their own human and natural re- sources to provide themselves with what they need and expect out of life-and have learned to compromise peacefully among competing demands in the larger national interest- then, their resistance to disorder and vio- lence will be enormously increased. Conversely, the tragic need of desperate men to resort to force to achieve the inner imperatives of human decency will diminish. WAYS UNITED STATES CAN HELP OTHER NATIONS Now, I have said that the role of the United States is to help provide security to these modernizing nations-providing they need and request our help, and are clearly willing and able to help themselves. But what should our help be? Clearly, it should be help toward develop- ment. In the military sphere, that involves two broad categories of assistance. We should help the developing nation with such training and equipment as is necessary to maintain the protective shield behind which development can go forward. The dimensions of that shield vary from country to country, but what is essential is that it should be a shield, and not a capacity for external aggression. The second-and perhaps less under- stood-category of military assistance In a modernizing nation is training in civic action. \"Civic action\" is another one of those semantic puzzles. Too few Americans-and too few officials in developing nations-really comprehend what military civic action means. Essentially, it means using indigenous mil- itary forces for nontraditional military proj- ects-projects that are useful to the local population in fields such as education, public works, health, sanitation, agriculture-in- deed, anything connected with economic or social progress. It has had some impressive results. In the past 4 years, the U.S.-assisted civic-ac- tion program, worldwide, has constructed or repaired more than 10,000 miles of roads; built over 1,000 schools, hundreds of hos- pitals and clinics; and has provided medical and dental care to approximately 4 million people. What is important is that all this was done by indigenous men in unirorm. Quite apart from the developmental projects themselves, the program powerfully alters the negative image of the military man, as the oppressive preserver of the stagnant status quo. But assistance in the purely military sphere is not enough. Economic assistance is also essential. The President is determined that our aid should be hardheaded an rigor- ously realistic-that it should deal directly with the roots of underdevelopment, and not merely attempt to alleviate the symptoms. His bedrock principle is that U.S. economic aid-no matter what its magnitude-is futile unless the country in question is resolute in making the primary effort itself. That will be the criterion, and that will be the crucial condition for all our future assistance. Only the developing nations themselves can take the fundamental measures that make outside assistance meaningful. These measures are often unpalatable-and fre- quently call for political courage and deci- siveness. But to fail to undertake painful, but essential, reform inevitably leads to far more painful revolutionary violence. Our economic assistance is designed to offer a reasonable alternative to that violence. It is designed to help substitute peaceful prog- ress for tragic internal conflict. The United States intends to be compas-sionate and generous in this effort, but it is not an effort it can carry exclusively by itself. And thus it looks to those nations who have reached the point of self-sustaining pros- perity to increase their contribution to the development-and, thus, to the security-of the modernizing world. And that brings me to the second set of relationships that I underscored at the out- set: It is the policy of the United States to encourage and achieve a more effective part- nership with those nations who can, and should, share international peacekeeping re- sponsibilities. America has devoted a higher proportion of its gross national product to its Military Es- tablishment than any other major free world nation. This was true even before our in- creased expenditures in southeast Asia. We have had, over the last few years, as many men in uniform as all the nations of Western Europe combined-even though they have a population half again greater than our own. Now, the American people are not going to shirk their obligations in any part of the world, but they clearly cannot be expected to bear a disproportionate share of the com- mon burden indefinitely. If, for example, other nations genuinely believe-as they say they do-that it is in the common interest to deter the expansion of Red China's economic and political con- trol beyond its national boundaries, then they must take a more active role in guard- ing the defense perimeter. Let me be perfectly clear: This is not to question the policy of neutralism or non- alinement of any particular nation. But it is to emphasize that the independence of such nations can-in the end-be fully safe- guarded only by collective agreements among themselves and their neighbors. PEACE: A JOINT RESPONSIBILITY The plain truth is the day is coming when no single nation, however powerful, can undertake by itself to keep the peace out- side its own borders. Regional and interna- tional organizations for peacekeeping pur- poses are as yet rudimentary, but they must grow in experience and be strengthened by deliberate and practical cooperative action. In this matter, the example of Canada is a model for nations everywhere. As Prime Minister Pearson pointed out eloquently in New York just last week: Canada \"is as deeply involved in the world's affairs as any coun- try of its size. We accept this because we have learned, over 50 years, that isolation from the policies that determine war does not give us immunity from the bloody, sacrificial consequences of their failure. We learned that in 1914, and again in 1939. * * * That is why we have been proud to send our men to take part in every peacekeeping operation of the United Nations-in Korea, and Kash- mir, and the Suez, and the Congo, and Cy- prus.\" The Organization of American States in the Dominican Republic, the more than 30 nations contributing troops or supplies to assist the Government of South Vietnam, indeed even the parallel efforts of the United States and the Soviet Union in the Pakistan- India conflict-these efforts, together with those of the U.N., are the first attempts to substitute multinational for unilateral polic- ing of violence. They point to the peacekeep- ing patterns of the future. We must not merely applaud the idea. We must dedicate talent, resources, and hard, practical thinking to its implementation. In Western Europe-an area whose bur- geoning economic vitality stands as a monu- ment to the wisdom of the Marshall plan- the problems of security are neither static nor wholly new. Fundamental changes are underway, though certain inescapable reali- ties remain. The conventional forces of NATO, for ex-34203 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 ample, still require a nuclear backdrop far beyond the capability of any Western Euro- pean nation to supply, and the United States is fully committed to provide that major nu- clear deterrent. NUCLEAR PLANNING AND NATO However, the European members of the al- liance have a natural desire to participate more actively in nuclear planning. A central task of the alliance today is, therefore, to work out the relationships and institutions through which shared nuclear planning can be effective. We have made a practical and promising start in the Special Committee of NATO Defense Ministers. Common planning and consultation are es- sential aspects of any sensible substitute to the unworkable and dangerous alternative of independent national nuclear forces within the alliance. And even beyond the alliance, we must find the means to prevent the proliferation of nu- clear weapons. That is a clear imperative. There are, of course, risks in nonprolifera- tion arrangements, but they cannot be com- pared with the infinitely greater risks that would arise out of the increase in national nuclear stockpiles. In the calculus of risk, to proliferate in- dependent, national nuclear forces is not a mere arithmetical addition of danger. We would not be merely adding up risks. We would be insanely multiplying them. If we seriously intend to pass on a world to our children that is not threatened by nuclear holocaust, we must come to grips with the problem of proliferation. A reasonable nonproliferation agreement is feasible. For there is no adversary with whom we do not share a common interest in avoiding mutual destruction triggered by an irresponsible nth power. That brings me to the third, and last, set of relationships the United States must deal with: those with nations who might be tempted to take up arms against us. These relationships call for realism. But realism is not a hardened, inflexible, un- imaginative attitude. The realistic mind is a restlessly creative mind-free of naive de- lusions, but full of practical alternatives. There are practical alternatives to our cur- rent relationships with both the Soviet Union and Communist China. A vast ideological chasm separates us from them-and, to a degree, separates them from one another. There is nothing to be gained from our seeking an ideological rapproachement. But breaching the isolation of great nations like Red China, even when that Isolation is largely of its own making, reduces the dan- ger of potentially catastrophic misunder- standings, and increases the incentive on both sides to resolve disputes by reason rather than by force. There are many ways in which we can build bridges toward nations who would cut themselves off from meaningful contact with us. We can do so with properly balanced trade relations, diplomatic contacts, and, in some cases, even by exchanges of military observers. We have to know where it is we want to place this bridge, what sort of traffic we want to travel over it, and on what mutual founda- tions the whole structure can be designed. There are no one-cliff bridges. If you are going to span a chasm, you have to rest the structure on both cliffs. Now, cliffs, generally speaking, are rather hazardous places. Some people are afraid even to look over the edge. But, in a thermo- nuclear world, we cannot afford any political acrophobia. President Johnson has put the matter squarely. By building bridges to those who make themselves our adversaries, \"we can help gradually to create a community of in- terest, a community of trust and a com- munity of effort.\"With respect to a \"community of effort,\" let me suggest a concrete proposal for our own present young generation in the United States. It is a committed and dedicated genera- tion: It has proven that in its enormously impressive performance in the Peace Corps overseas, and in its willingness to volunteer for a final assault on such poverty and lack of opportunity that still remain in our own country. As matters stand, our present Selective Service System draws on only a minority of eligible young men. That is an inequity. It seems to me that we could move toward remedying that inequity by asking every young person in the United States to give 1 or 2 years of service to his country-whether in one of the military services, in the Peace Corps or in some other volunteer develop- mental work at home or abroad. We could encourage other countries to do the same, and we could work out exchange programs-much as the Peace Corps is al- ready planning to do. While this is not an altogether new sug- gestion, it has been criticized as inappro- priate while we are engaged in a shooting war. But I believe precisely the opposite is the case. It is more appropriate now than ever. For it would underscore what our whole pur- pose is in Vietnam-and indeed anywhere in the world where coercion, or injustice, or lack of decent opportunity still holds sway. A WORLD OF DECENCY-AND HOPE It would make meaningful the central con- cept of security: a world of decency and de- velopment-where every man can feel that his personal horizon is rimmed with hope. Mutual interest, mutual trust, mutual effort-those are the goals. Can we achieve those goals with the Soviet Union, and with Communist China? Can they achieve them with one another? The answer to these questions lies in the answer to an even more fundamental ques- tion. Who is man? Is he a rational animal? If he is, then the goals can ultimately be achieved. If he is not, then there is little point in making the effort. All the evidence of history suggests that man is indeed a rational animal-but with a near-infinite capacity for folly. His history seems largely a halting, but persistent, effort to raise his reason above his animality. He draws blueprints for utopia. But never quite gets it built. In the end, he plugs away obstinately with the only building material really ever at hand: his own part-comic, part-tragic, part-cussed, but part-glorious nature. I, for one, would not count a global free society out. Coercion, after all, merely captures man. Freedom captivates him.

REMARKS OF CONGRESSMAN BOLAND I take it that the job of a toastmaster is to get on with the business of the evening. I know you will grant me a toastmaster's prerogative if I interject a personal observa- tion. As a product of the Springfield Boys' Club and a long time member, I share this mag- nificent moment with countless thousands who were sheltered by Boys' Club buildings that are no more. I likewise thrill with these same thousands in what this splendid struc- ture means to youth of this community. There are many here tonight who can roll back the years and recapture the memories. Who can forget the immortal Fred Steph- enson whose piercing whistle would petrify one and stop one in his tracks; the late beloved devoted Paul Samson; the incredible jewel of a man, Harry Feldman; the durable, lovable, Mark Moran; and the present execu- tive director, the incomparable Mike Pagos. The polyglot of Irish, Jewish, Polish, Italian and Yankee-English that dominated the scene through the roaring twenties-the teams that stormed across the gyms-the Maccabeans, the Foggy Dews, the Russian- Americans, the Samosets, the Y.M.H.A., the Sacred Hearts, and a whole host of others, black and white, that made this Boys' Club and Clubs around the nation, the true melt- ing pots of our land-the crucible into which all nationalities, religions and races were thrown and mixed to mold a product that makes the American dream possible. In this dedication we honor the long line of men from all segments of our society- business, labor, the professions, civic clubs, Kiwanis-who have given so much of their time, talent and money to make this club work and who have brought it to this mag- nificent milestone. We honor the staffs of devoted and dedi- cated people who have given warmth and understanding, who have stretched out their hands to grasp the youth who wanders aim- lessly, unwanted and unloved. This great din- ner is a moving tribute to all of them. CONGRESSMAN BOLAND INTRODUCES SECRETARY WEAVER We rightly and proudly proclaim that the United States is a great nation, that this is a land of unmatched opportunity. It is all of that! But we are also a nation of great and continuing problems, problems born of our very greatness and our rapid growth. Think of It! Two hundred million popula- tion as of today. To meet these problems and the very great challenges they present, the Department of Housing and Urban Development was cre- ated in 1966. And the task of pulling to- gether the myriad agencies of the housing and home finance administration into a co- hesive whole-the herculean job of instilling a new spirit and imagination and action into the urban chaos that threatened our cities- This gigantic effort landed on the shoulders of our honored guest of the evening. In appointing Robert C. Weaver as the first secretary of this department, President Johnson selected one of the nation's fore- most and outstanding men in the field. Your program details for you the tremen- dous record of this man: his magnificent education, his work in so many areas that cuts across the spectrum of our economic life, his uncanny ability to pull together the forces that must unite to solve the problems that press down on this land. He is the first of his race to be so signally honored by a seat in the President's Cabinet. I have had many contacts with him and his department. I am conscious of his ability, knowledge, his persuasiveness. His appear- ances and his testimony before congressional committees have won him the applause andthe esteem of the Congress-and this is no easy task in the job that is his! Mr. Secretary, all of us want you to know how much we appreciate your presence on the most important event in the history of the Springfield Boys' Club. All of us are aware of the countless demands on your time and the personal inconvenience that we have caused you. You honor us greatly by joining us tonight and we are deeply grateful. Ladies and gentlemen, with humility and pride, I am privileged to present a member of the Cabinet of the President of the United States, the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Mr. Robert C. Weaver. REMARKS BY SECRETARY ROBERT WEAVER AT THE DEDICATION OF THE SPRINGFIELD, MASS., BOYS CLUB I know how concerned you all are about urban matters in Springfield. But before I talk about them, I would like to thank Con- gressman Boland for acting as intermediary in getting me here tonight. I have lived and worked all my life in the great urban axis which reaches from Washington, D.C. to Boston, so I am in familiar territory. It is also a pleasant change to help dedi- cate something other than a product of one of my own Departmental programs. As I understand it, the only contribution we made to the Springfield Boys Club was in furnishing money for an urban renewal proj- ect which in turn forced you to relocate from your old building. I'm sorry if this was inconvenient. But let me say this, if this beautiful new building is typical of your relocation pro- gram, you are doing a magnificent job. I think the City of Springfield, President Miller and your other officials, and the many members and contributors to the Spring- field Boys Club are to be congratulated. The Springfield Boys Club looks back a long time-76 years. I don't know how many Springfield youngsters have run in and out of the doors of the three buildings that preceded this one, but it must number well up in the thousands. Now I understand that in the new building you are expecting to have about 4,000 boys, perhaps half as many girls and a thousand adults involved in programs. There can be no doubt that many of these young people will find in this Club their only chance to be out in the big world, away from homes that are small and crowded. This is their separate world of play, and of learning, and of mixing with their con- temporaries. It Is a world of interested coun- selors, a world where they can stretch their muscles, and their minds. We must be proud of the Boys' Clubs of America tonight, and particularly proud of the Springfield Boys Club. You are also to be congratulated on your choice of Congressmen. Edward Boland sup- ports the urban programs we must have if cities such as Springfield are to be restored and revitalized. He works hard for the citi- zens of this district, and he works hard for his Nation. It is a privilege for me to be here in his home district with him tonight. When I was invited here, I was asked to give you some idea of what I think about our urban situation in this Nation today. This happens to come at a very good time. Last week in Washington we announced the first 63 cities which will receive planning grants under the Model Cities Program. Springfield was one of 193 communities to submit applications. And as you are well aware, this city was among those selected in this first round. I would like to congratulate all those who were Involved in the long and difficult process of drawing up the Springfield Model City application. They have performed well for their city and for their fellow townspeople. Before I go into some of the results you34205 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 may expect under this program, I would like to say a word about those cities which were not selected. First, it is not necessarily true that the cities which were not selected were any less deserving than Springfield and those other cities which were on the list. And it does not by any means close the door on those cities in the future. Let me briefly review the selection proce- dure so you may have some idea of the prob- lems involved. The applications were exhaustively re- viewed by our own staff. That was the first step. Then they moved on to a far more wide- ranging procedure, a review by an interagency committee composed of representatives of the Departments of Health, Education, and Welfare; Labor; Agriculture; Commerce; and Justice. There was also a representative of the Office of Economic Opportunity. The purpose was clear: To select those neighborhoods across the country where the concentration of Federally-assisted programs could have maximum impact in solving urban problems. We established criteria by which the ap- plications could be judged. These were: The scope of the problems involved, and the city's analysis of those problems; The city's innovative approaches; The city's capacity to carry out the pro- gram; The commitment of city government and private groups; Geography and population. As you can understand, that last point alone-location and size of the city-coupled with the limitations imposed by the $11 mil- lion we had in planning funds, made it im- possible to include every deserving city. However, the Congress has now appropri- ated another $12 million in planning funds for a second round of applications. We will soon be inviting applications for this second round. And here is the point I want to make very strongly and would like to have re- peated in every city across the Nation which did not receive a grant: It is our hope that those cities which applied and were not selected will join other localities in applying for the second round. I also want to make the point, and make it strongly, that we in the Department will help the unsuccessful cities as well as the new cities, in developing their applications. Now, I can't stand here tonight and tell you that the fact you have been selected means there will be immediate and impor- tant improvements in Old Hill and the ad- joining sections you have designated as your Model Neighborhood. It would be unfair to the residents of that area to make such a claim. Recent urban history has proved that ris- ing aspirations must be met by results. The Model Cities planning grant is a work box for the city, not a gift package under the Christmas tree. Any city which rouses hope and does not fulfill it may find it turning into a Pandora's box of troubles. First, you will have to plan your program. Then there will be another review and again we must select those cities which will be granted funds to put their programs into effect. And again we have a budgetary limita- tion-$300 million which the Congress ap- propriated for supplemental grants and ex- tra urban renewal funds. Unfortunately, the Congress this year saw fit to cut $350 million more than the President had requested from the Model Cities budget. But even when supplemental grants and extra urban renewal funds are forthcoming, there will be important matters of local con- cern to consider. There will never be enough money to do everything you know must bedone, and so you will have to establish pri- orities. You will need a tremendous concentration of intelligent, imaginative and dedicated people here in Springfield to get the job done. This will not be a job for city hall alone, far from it. You in this audience tonight cut across the whole structure of the city. You are bankers and businessmen, social workers and city em- ployees. You represent foundations and phil- anthropic organizations. You come from the three institutions of higher education in this city. And I would say that the degree to which almost everyone here can get involved in one or another phase of your Model City Program will be the degree to which it is successful. With that warning behind me, however, let me now move over to the bright side. The immediate dividend you can count on is that you will instill hope in those who have not had hope before. These are the unemployed, and over six percent of the men in your selected neighbor- hood are out of work; These are the ill-housed, and almost half of the housing units in the area are sub- standard; These are the poor, and nearly one-fourth of the families earn less than $3,000 annu- ally; These are the school dropouts, and the rural immigrants who lack urban skills, and the Puerto Ricans and the Negroes who have problems of color and ethnic background, or who simply can't speak the language; These are approximately 18,750 people who have not shared in the wealth and the oppor- tunity of our rich Nation. Those of you who meet here tonight know exactly what I mean, because you have been working in the hope business for more than three-quarters of a century. This fine new building can be symbolic of the new building and of the physical reha- bilitation of Old Hill. The underprivileged boys and girls who pass through these portals can be symbolic of the underprivileged of Old Hill. Here you give them the chance to build their bodies and to develop their minds. Here you bring them into an environment of hope. But it does little good to stop the process as these boys and girls walk back out of the door of the Springfield Boys Club. They must be able to go back to homes which are decent, and where they can bring their friends with pride. They must be able to learn to the utmost of their capabilities, and to find jobs worthy of that education. They must be able to walk through streets that are safe, over sidewalks that are clean. They must, above all, be able to walk in pride and dignity, with no door closed to them because of race or color or ethnic back- ground. This is the meaning of the Springfield Boys Club, and it is the meaning of the Model Cities Program. As you can tell, I am proud of this new program, and I share with all of you a gen- uine feeling that we have made an important breakthrough in solving our most urgent urban problems. I would now like to give credit where credit is due. The Model Cities Program was born and kept alive only because we have a great President who threw all of his energy and all of his influence into pushing it through. President Johnson started the process which culminated in this legislation several years ago. It is part of the great vision which the President has had for the future of the American city and for those who live there. It is part and parcel of his own personal conviction that this country has the energyand the resources and the will to build de- cent communities where Americans can live in comfort and in dignity. Several years ago, the President estab- lished a task force charged with makingthis vision come true. I think it should be a matter of pride to the people of this State that two of the men on that task force who helped bring this program to life are now serving with me in my Department-Under Secretary Robert Wood, formerly of M.I.T., and As- sistant Secretary Charles Haar, formerly of Harvard. Once the program was formulated, the President threw the whole power of his of- fice behind it. Great urban Congressmen such as Edward Boland worked hard to get it through the legislative process, and then saw to it that funds were appropriated to get it on its way. This was not easy, for there are always those in Congress who fight every good new program that is proposed. There are always those who, failing to kill a program, try to starve it to death by cut- ting appropriations. They tried to kill this program before it could come to life. They tried to starve it after it had passed. They will attempt to starve it in every Congress in the future. But they must fail. And they will fail. There is a final point to be made about this program. The Model Cities Program does not stand alone as a piece of separate legislation. Without the urban renewal program, and the low-income public housing program, and the rent supplement program, among others, we would not have the physical wherewithal to start the physical rebuilding and rehabilita- tion of these model neighborhoods. Without the great social programs of the Department of Health, Education, and Wel- fare, and of the Office of Economic Oppor- tunity, and of the Department of Labor, among others, we would not have the people- oriented legislation we need. And, I cannot repeat too often that there must be a full involvement of the skills, commitment, and resources of the state, county and city governments, as well as those of the Federal Government. There must be full involvement of private enterprise, of organized labor, of community agencies and organizations of all types. There must be, most of all, the involvement of the people of the neighborhood itself. The physical structure of the neighborhood must be changed, of course. But the ultimate goal is to change the lives of those who live there, to meet the aspirations of those who have not shared in our prosperity. The success of the program will be reflected in the facades of the buildings and in the faces of the people of Old Hill and those parts of Upper Hill and Bay McKnight which are in the model neighborhood. And, inevitably, the whole city will share in the benefits of this program. I would like to commend all of you here tonight for your long service to the boys and girls of this community. And I would like to extend to you an invitation to share in making your Model City Program a model for the State and the Nation. COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentle- man from Maine [Mr. HATHAW&Y] may extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. Mr. HATHAWAY. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 13094 to amend the Commodity Exchange34206 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE Act is a long overdue bill. There have been no substantial amendments to the Commodity Exchange Act since 1936. It is ludicrous to maintain that in our ex- panding and dynamic economy changes have not occurred which should be handled by regulatory legislation. The initial hostile reaction of some members of the commodity exchanges was similar to the reaction of part of the banking and business community when the 1933 Securities Exchange Act was passed. At that time, the president of the New York Exchange solemnly predicted the col- lapse of the market. Today the market is stronger than ever partly because of the public confidence brought about by the 1933 act. Similar public confidence achieved by the passage of H.R. 13094 would strengthen the commodity ex- changes, not weaken them. For the most part H.R. 13094 merely seeks to establish rules and procedures which are a normal part of other ex- changes. In fact, the regulation of other exchanges may have an unplanned dele- terious effect on the commodity ex- changes. The lack of standards for be- coming a member of the commodity ex- change contrasted with the standards required to be a member of the stock ex- change, may result in persons who are barred from the stock exchanges being able to use their skills in the commodity exchange. For example, a Mr. John E. Hean, who testified at the hearings as to his own personal experience with un- scrupulous manipulation in commodities, mentioned that the person who he was dealing with had been previously barred from dealing in stocks. H.R. 13094 provisions requiring that persons doing business for the public meet specified minimum financial stand- ards is an obvious response to necessity. As was written in a national publication, the commodity exchanges could be de- scribed \"as a giant, Government-sanc- tioned lottery, where the losses can be staggering and the rewards immense.\" In such a sanguine environment the lack of financial standards is an invitation to fraud. The increasing of penalties for certain law violation will eliminate the profit from breaking the law. This is an area of potential white-collar crime where stiff financial penalties will be most effective. The addition of livestock and livestock products to the commodities under the act is a logical response to the increas- ingly active trading in these products. Cease-and-desist orders will provide needed flexibility in the administration of the act. We have learned the value and necessity of limited welfare; the same principles apply to regulations. All of these provisions are necessary and de- serve the support of the Congress. KENNETH ZIMMERMAN, AS A MEM- BER OF THE GREG SMITH SINGERS, PERFORMS AT THE WHITE HOUSE Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentle- man from Pennsylvania [Mr. ROONEY] may extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter.The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. Mr. ROONEY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, one of my constituents had the distinction to entertain President John- son and his guests at the White House yesterday as a member of the Greg Smith Singers. The luncheon honored Secretary of the Treasury Henry Fowler and served to formally launch the Freedom Fund campaign. My constituent is Kenneth Zimmer- man, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Sterling Zimmerman, of Werleys Corner, in my congressional district. This young man is an accomplished baritone who adds the White House performance to his already long list of other musical achievements. On December 8, 1967, he will participate in a world premier performance of \"Reynard the Fox,\" by Igor Stravinsky, famous Russian composer. Mr. Zimmer- man will sing the lead role, marking the first time this work is sung in Russian. It will highlight the 75th anniversary of the founding of Ithaca College. During October, Mr. Zimmerman sang a leading role in still another world premier-the first rendition of \"The Requiem,\" presented at Princeton, N.J. Mr. Zimmerman has another claim to fame which is of particular interest to my own district. He is well known through- out Pennsylvania and beyond for his renditions in the Pennsylvania Dutch dialect. He regularly participates in Pennsylvania Dutch song festivals during the great Allentown fair. I am pleased to have this opportunity to bring this young man's vocal talent and achievement to the attention of my colleagues. ROBERT S. McNAMARA-A MAN Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentle- man from New York [Mr. PncE] may extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. Mr. PIKE. Mr. Speaker, it seems a rather sad commentary on our times that on the day when the newspapers were full of the story of Secretary of Defense Rob- ert S. McNamara's proposed move to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, as far as the House of Represent- atives was concerned, had not a word on the subject. Perhaps this was because many of the Members were taken by surprise by the story, as I was. Perhaps it was because the Secretary has become such a con- troversial figure that no one wanted to get involved. In any event, I have been involved in the past, both as supporter and needler, and I feel compelled to say a few words about the mixed emotions with which I greeted this news, and my own feelings about our Secretary of Defense. My emotions were mixed because I feel that the Office of Secretary of Defense is losing a great man, and yet the reasons which would make him willing to dropthe heavy burdens which he has shoul- dered for so long, and take up a new chal- lenge, seem very obvious indeed. As to the man himself, he always calls his shots the way he sees them within the framework of his loyalty to the President, as part of the President's ad- ministration. He has shouldered burdens which would have killed a lesser man. He has taken the blame when things go wrong without either breast-beating or appeals for sympathy. He has shared the credit when things go well without con- descension of effusive flattery. As part of the administration he has shouldered the responsibility for decisions which were actually made by the President, and with which he did not always agree, be- cause he recognized both the human value of loyalty and the administrative necessity of a chain of command. There were those who referred to him sneering- ly as a human computer, as an inhuman and humorless man. Almost always these were people whose minds were not able to grasp his mind, whose sense of humor was far less sophisticated than his own, and who never comprehended the fact that beneath his toughness in making and carrying out individual decisions there exists an abiding concern not only for the human beings of America but for the human beings of this planet. There were among his detractors those who harped constantly on the fact that he did not get along well with Con- gress, and it is true that he really did not. First of all, he has a very low thres- hold of tolerance for stupidity, and I re- fer as much to the inefficient procedures of Congress as to any individuals within it. Second, he is perhaps a poor politician in the sense that he never could engage in the kind of habitual flattery which is a way of life for most of those in politics. I believe he considers it not only de- meaning to himself but also to the per- son on whom the butter is spread, and that he found it hard to believe that any normally alert person would not recog- nize it for what it was, simply nauseous flattery. Perhaps I flatter myself in thinking that I understand Robert S. McNamara. Truthfully, no human being can ever fully understand another hu- man being, and it is possible that no human being really even understands himself, what makes him tick, what motivates him, what his goals and ideals are, what his frustrations and feelings are, what his strengths and his weak- nesses are. But some things are obvious. Mr. McNamara is a man of modera- tion in a time when it is terribly unpopu- lar to be a moderate. In times of crisis, and this is a time of crisis, people tend to see things in absolutes, in blacks and whites. It is easier to think that way. It is easier to characterize people, for ex- ample, as hawks or doves, than to really analyze all of the gradations which there are in between. It is easy to say, \"Stop the war,\" and it is easy to say, \"Block Haiphong Harbor,\" but it is substan- tially more difficult to try to analyze all of the tremendous implications, reper- cussions, pressures, reactions, and values contained in any such major judgment. Over the past 7 years Mr. McNamara has had to make literally thousands of34207 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 judgments, and most of them were ter- ribly complex. The easy ones were made by corporals; the tougher ones were made by generals; but the really tough ones, those involving thousands of lives, or billions of dollars, were made by the Secretary of Defense, and because he was a man of moderation, of too much wisdom to see any complicated issue as a black or white issue, he had to crank into each of these judgments all sorts of factors-military factors, economic fac- tors, human factors, political factors, national factors, and international fac- tors. He was uniquely qualified to do this. One of the great delights of being in Congress over the past 7 years has been to hear his annual report as Sec- retary of Defense on the posture of the United States in the world. These re- ports have always shown both a broader grasp and perspective of America in the latter half of the 20th century and a more incisive attention to detail than I have ever seen in any other document. Because the decisions which he has made have been tough and complicated and difficult, every single one of them has displeased somebody. Some of them have displeased me, but all of them have dis- pleased someone. So Mr. McNamara has made people unhappy, and some of the people he has made unhappy have be- come enemies. I believe he has recognized this as a fact of life; yet he has continued to approach his job with zest and com- petence. I also believe, however, that the burden of all of these decisions and the brutally hard work which responsibility entails have quite naturally and nor- mally, and because he is human, taken something out of him, just as to a far lesser extent my 7 years of dealing with far lesser problems have taken something out of me. I do not believe the United States of America can find as good a Secretary of Defense. I do not believe the United States of America has had as good a Secretary of Defense. Perhaps because I live in a seafaring area there is a nautical poem which for some reason has for years come into my mind when I think about Robert S. McNamara. The poem is \"Old Ironsides,\" by Oliver Wendell Holmes, and at least when I was in high school it was familiar to every high school boy. It began with the words: \"Ay,tear her tattered ensign down! Long has it waved on high,\" and I am not going tocorn up this statement by making what ought to be an obvious comparison be-tween a sturdy man and a sturdy ship.There is nothing I like better than asturdy ship. There is one other line which comes inevitably to mind when you think of the way in which this one human being has held so steadfast to the middle course under the attacks of the extrem- ists of both the right and the left. Thatline, of course, is, \"The harpies of the shore shall pluck the eagle of the sea.\" As one of the resident House harpies whohas contributed to his difficulties, I would like to present a personal evaluation ofwhat I consider his greatest asset, andthis is simply his manliness. He is thekind of man I would like to be, but I have just enough wisdom to know that I do not have the wisdom for it. He is the kind of man I would like my sons to be,and I only hope they have the courage to be. In an age of facades and images and easy answers and spoiled and greedy men, and shallow and irresponsible values, this is a real man.flesh and blood of real renaissance thatwill restore the great cities of this Nationto positions of eminence, where promise ismatched by opportunity and potentiality opens doors to fulfillment. A MODEL PLAN FOR BETTER CITIES IN PRAISE OF OUR MEMBER WOLFF Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentle- man from Pennsylvania [Mr. BARRETT] may extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. Mr. BARRETT. Mr. Speaker, the Phil- adelphia Inquirer published an excellent editorial on November 19 entitled \"A Model Plan for Better Cities.\" This editorial stressed that- Model Cities projects are not intended to be Federally financed and Federally inspired in totality. Their purpose is to bring to- gether private and public money from many sources. More important than money is the need for common purpose and the coopera- tive pooling of talents and skills. The editorial continued: Philadelphia, if it Is to be a Model City in the finest sense of the phrase, should supple- ment Federal financial incentives with local endeavor rooted in community pride, neigh- borhood spirit and personal resolve. Mr. Speaker, I would hope that wehear this call for local initiative echoed in every community selected to receive a model cities grant. Local initiative and effort are keys to success in the model cities program. So that my colleagues might read this interesting editorial from the Philadel- phia Inquirer, I include it in the CON- GRESSIONAL RECORD: A MODEL PLAN FOR BETTER CITIES Announcement of the first list of munici- palities-including Philadelphia-to receive Federal grants under the Model Cities pro- gram does not mean that urban blight is soon to be eradicated on a massive scale. It does mean, though, that a fresh start Is being made on problems of the cities. This could produce, in a few years, tangible and visible evidence of a great urban re- birth in America. Much depends on how the Model Cities projects are planned and administered. Care- fully drawn programs are important. A city has to know what it is trying to accomplish before the tearing down and the building up begin. The first disbursements are for planning only. Philadelphia's rather disappointingly small grant of less than $200,000 will not go far, but substantially larger amounts should be forthcoming when the actual re- building starts. One point that needs to be stressed at the outset is this: Model Cities projects are not intended to be Federally financed and Federally inspired in totality. Their purpose is to bring together private and public mon- ey from many sources. More important than money is the need for common purpose and the cooperative pooling of talents and skills. Philadelphia, if it is to be a Model City in the finest sense of the phrase, should sup- plement Federal financial Incentives with lo- cal endeavor rooted in community pride, neighborhood spirit and personal resolve. Steel and concrete are but a skeleton of enduring urban progress, the bare bones of a city's rebirth. Human resources are theMr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, Iask unanimous consent that the gentle- man from Montana [Mr. OLSEN] may ex-tend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. Mr. OLSEN. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to enter in the RECORD a tribute to the gentleman from New York [Mr. WOLFF]. Philip F. O'Brien, national commander of the Veterans of World War I of the U.S.A., Inc., commends Representative LESTER WOLFF, Of New York, on the stand he has taken in reply to De Gaulle. It is unbelievable after saving France in two World Wars, with the cost of millions of lives and billions of our dollars used to build up a war-torn nation, that the French people would allow a bitter old man to use the power of his office to de- stroy the economy of the United States as well as the other nations. Our Govern- ment should take positive action to stop the flow of tourist money into that coun- try. Also, demand that the $8 billion still owned to this country from World War I be paid. Thousands of the cream of our youth are buried in Flanders Field from the War of 1917-18. Is it too much to ask that the American people at least post- pone their pleasure trips to France? Even the thought of the devaluation of the dollar could trigger a panic through- out the world which would make the thirties depression mild in comparison. It is time for our Government to take positive action and halt the flow of gold out of our country. It is high time we dis- card the Santa Claus role, and protect our people from the whims of other nations. IRRIGATION DEVELOPMENT: A MUST FOR AMERICA'S FUTURE Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentle- man from Montana [Mr. OLSEN] may extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. Mr. OLSEN. Mr. Speaker, as you and the Members of this body know, I have always supported and worked for proj- ects in the area of water conservation. Tomorrow-with its increased popula- tion and growing demand for an ade- quate water supply-will come, and we must prepare for it if we are to assure our children the water they will need for health, for raising crops, and for recrea- tion. Mr. Norman H. Moore, Assistant Re- gional Director of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, region 1, recently dis-34208 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE cussed this problem in an address before a meeting of the Pacific Northwest Plant Food Association. An edited version of Mr. Moore's remarks appeared in the most recent edition of the Montana Farmer-Stockman, and I insert the ar- ticle at this point in the RECORD. It in- cludes statistics which I am sure all of my colleagues will find interesting. \"IN THE CARDS\" FOR THE WEST: MORE IRRIGA- TION DEVELOPMENT (By Norman H. Moore) The fantastic population explosion throughout the world casts grim shadows of imminent starvation across large portions of the face of the earth unless action is taken to equate food production and population growth. From about 3.1 billion people today, demographers estimate the world popula- tion will be in the realm of 6 to 7 billion by the year 2000, which is only 33 years from now. The population of the United States will rise from the current 200 million to about 330 million in this same period. The West is our fastest growing area, and in the Pacific Northwest, that is, the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, western Mon- tana and western Wyoming, the population is expected to about double by year 2000, going from 6 million to close to 12 million persons. Considering these population figures and the fact that the total acreage actually used for food and fibre production in the United States has and will continue to remain at about the total existing in 1920, we will have to run just to stand still, to achieve ade- quate production so that our farms will continue to be one of the bulwarks against world hunger. Instead of surpluses, it is logical to reason that we will be faced with food shortages, and any so-called remaining crop surpluses now on hand must be considered essentially reserves. To assure adequate food in the future, more and more idle arable land will have to be brought into production, and considering the greater production possible through irri- gation, more and more of this land will be irrigated. Much of the land now dry-farmed will also be irrigated. At the same time it must be remembered that well in excess of 1 million acres of cultivated agricultural land nationally, each year are lost to such things as highway construction, urban ex- pansion, etc. Since the total available agri- cultural acreage in the United States will re- main about the same over the future, farm- ing efficiency or production per acre will have to increase continually. Use of fertilizers in particular, will play an important part in providing for this increase. About one-eighth of the arable lands of the world, some 400 million acres, are de- voted to irrigated agriculture. In the United States we irrigate roughly 40 million acres, with the bulk of this-well over 90 per cent-in the 17 western states. Irrigated crops account for about 25 per cent of the total value of our crops annually, but require only about 10 per cent of our crop acreage. Despite many novel and sophisticated processes which are being developed for syn- thesizing, producing and processing vital vitamins, proteins, nutrients, etc., there is little doubt that much of our success in meeting the food challenges of the future will continue to depend on how well we can blend our land, water and sunshine. A little over 8 million of the approximately 38 million acres currently actually irrigated in the western states are served a full or sup- plemental water supply from facilities con- structed by the Bureau of Reclamation. The estimated annual gross value of the 150 or so varieties of crops raised on these lands is over 1 2 billion dollars.In the Pacific Northwest there are about 7 million acres now irrigated, for which the Bureau of Reclamation has constructed fa- cilities to serve a full or supplemental water supply to about 3 million acres. In crop year 1965 these 3 million acres produced crops with a gross value in excess of $388 million, or about $147 per acre. In discussing irrigation we must consider land and available water supply in order to get the proper perspective. The arid and semiarid areas of the West have far more arable land than available water supply. In other words, in most locations throughout the West we can develop more irrigated lands only If water is economically available. Yes, water is the key. The Pacific Northwest has large areas of arid and semiarid land not currently irri- gated. Such areas are normally in short-water supply. On an annual basis, areas west of the Cascades, and the mountain regions gener- ally, have abundant water supplies, but even here the agricultural areas suffer from a shortage of natural precipitation during the summer growing season. The current annual average flow of the Columbia River at its mouth is, in round numbers, about 170 million acre-feet. The coastal streams of Oregon and Washington add about another 120 million acre-feet of flow to the total amount of water flowing into the Pacific Ocean on an average annual basis. With flows of this magnitude, one can see why water-short areas are casting cov- etous eyes on the waters of the Pacific North- west. For the Columbia River alone, the average annual discharge figure is impressive, since 170 million acre-feet is a tremendous volume of water. By comparison, for example, the annual flow of the Colorado River is about one-tenth as much. An interesting point here is that the long litigation between Cali- fornia and Nevada over apportionment of Colorado River flows involved only 4 million acre-feet of water annually. Areas of water-need and areas of water- availability do not necessarily coincide within any region. This poses a problem so far as future irrigation is concerned. How- ever, the Pacific Northwest is generally blessed with a good water supply and there is no doubt that Irrigation and other water resource development functions will be ex- panded in the future. Within the past year, in connection with preparation of preliminary data for the Columbia-North Pacific River Basin Studies, the states of the Northwest have made rough estimates of irrigation development for the years 1980, 2000 and 2020. Considering the present poor outlook for the future world food supply, the estimates appear for the most part to be realistic. The estimates indicate that by 1990 Irri- gated lands in the Pacific Northwest will in- crease by almost 4.5 million acres over the base existing in 1965. When this is added to the 6.5 million acres which received water in 1965, a total of about 11 million acres are expected to be irrigated in the Pacific North- west in a little over 20 years. The 4.5 million new acres of irrigation are broken down by states as follows: Washing- ton minor acreages in Wyoming and Ne- vada. It is contemplated that federal devel- opment will provide less than 40 per cent, or about 1.6 million of these future irrigated acres. The remainder, or about 2.9 million acres, will be provided a water supply through facilities constructed primarily by private interests. Full development of the Pacific Northwest through both government and private means is now and will continue to be spurred by the world need for food and also by the threat of diversion of water outside the re- gion if it is not put to beneficial use within.TRUTH IN SECOND MORTGAGES Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentle- man from New Jersey [Mr. PATTEN] may extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. Mr. PATTEN. Mr. Speaker, I was happy to read in today's Washington Post that U.S. District Court Judge Matthew P. McGuire granted a tem- porary restraining order halting the foreclosure of the home of a retired janitor. I was attorney for a national bank over 25 years, and I am well aware of our law \"for the holder in due course.\" The truth is, poor people in New Jersey are robbed continuously by these crooks who lie, cheat, deceive, and com- mit fraud and sell the mortgage to a legitimate bank. The Evening News, Perth Amboy, N.J., has rendered a great public service exposing these cases. A group of us in Congress have appealed to the House Banking and Currency Committee, the Post Office, and the Federal Trade Commission. We are de- termined to correct this situation. Talk about truth in lending-let us work harder until we close these loop- holes. This poor janitor apparently is paying 58 percent interest. The article follows: COURT BLOCKS FORECLOSURE ON MORTGAGE (By David A. Jewell) A U.S. District Court judge prevented a foreclosure on a delinquent mortgage here yesterday, saying \"the worst situation in 50 states regarding these mortgages exists in this jurisdiction.\" Judge Matthew F. McGuire granted a tem- porary restraining order against Montgomery Federal Savings and Loan Association on be- half of a District homeowner, Abraham Wil- liams, a 65-year-old retired janitor who lives at 1812 M st. ne. Williams challenged a foreclosure move by Montgomery Federal, saying that the interest on his mortgage was usurious and that the note had been obtained by fraud. The note was a result of a refinancing of Williams' existing mortgages, tied in with home improvement work. Williams charged in his suit that Mont- gomery Federal was involved in a conspiracy to defraud him. Judge McGuire set a hearing for Dec. 8 on a motion submitted by Williams' attorney, Mark Sandground, asking the Court to issue a preliminary injunction. This injunction would have the effect of preventing collection by Montgomery Federal of the mortgage payments, pending a trial on the merits of Williams' suit, which seeks to void the mortgage. Montgomery Federal's defense before Judge McGuire was that it was a \"holder in due course,\" which innocently purchased Wil- liams' note with no knowledge of any fraud that may have surrounded it. After saying that the city had the \"worst situation\" in the country on mortgages, Judge McGuire said: \"I will refer this whole business to the U.S. attorney for his consideration because this doesn't smell good. \"This is about the sixth such case I have had in the last month. There is something radically wrong here ... I don't say that about Montgomery Federal, but it just doesn't look good on its face.\"34209 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE November 29, 1967 Recent articles in The Washington Post have disclosed widespread charges of abuses by home improvement contractors and others who secure notes with new mortgages. Williams' suit says that Montgomery Fed- eral conspired with the following companies to defraud him: Maryland Financial Corp., 5101 Baltimore ave., Hvattaville. and Richard Construction Corp., of 8510 16th st., Silver Spring, and the chief officer of both firms, Harold Rothman; Empire Mortgage Corp., listed at 320 South- ern Building, 1425 H st. nw.; Congressional Credit Corp., of 918 16th st. nw., and Barks Title Insurance Co., of 1413 K st. nw. Williams' suit claims that he did not real- ize that when he signed papers at Rothman's office, that he was signing notes that totaled $12,340, plus 7 per cent interest, when all he thought he was signing was a note for $9200 plus interest. The suit describes what happened to Wil- liams this way: In April he received an unsolicited offer from Rothman to perform $1500 worth of improvements to his home. Rothman said this could be paid by nego- tiating a mortgage that would also consoli- date two existing mortgages on Williams' house. At that time, Williams' mortgages and some minor debts totaled $7700, the suit said. The suit also said that Williams was current in his payments on the debts. The suit said that Rothman promised him his new payments would be lower than his old ones. But, the suit says, they are now $161 a month. They had been lower, accord- ing to Williams' lawyer. The suit alleges that Williams went to Rothman's offices in Hyattsville and signed certain papers. It says he later learned that there were two new mortgages against his home, one for $9500 held by Montgomery Federal and the second for $2840 originally held by Empire Mortgage and later transferred to Congres- sional Credit. Thus, the suit claims, Williams now owes $12,340, which is $4500 more than his original indebtedness, a 58 per cent increase. The suit denies that repairs worth $1550 were made on Williams' home, as set forth in a settlement sheet made out by Berks Title Insurance Co. LEAVE OF ABSENCE By unanimous consent, leave of ab- sence was granted to: Mr. FOUNTAIN (at the request of Mr. HERLONG), for an indefinite period, on account of his attendance at the 22d General Assembly of the United Nations as an official member of the U.S. delega- tion to the U.N.

Make our hands Thy hands reaching out with help for the hungry, the homeless, the sick, and the despairing in the human family.34211 We thank Thee for the privilege of liv- ing in these days, and pray for those who carry the heavy responsibility of deci- sions and leadership in our Nation and in the nations of the world. Forgive us, O God, for every step we have taken on a wrong road, and em- power us by Thy spirit to walk in the paths of righteousness for Thy name's sake. May Thy will be done on earth, and. let Thy peace which spans beyond all human understanding guard our hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. Amen.

The Senate resumes the consideration of the bill (H.R. 7977) to adjust certain postage rates, to adjust the rates of basic compensation for certain officers and em- ployees in the Federal Government, and to regulate the mailing of pandering ad- vertisements, and for other purposes. Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon the com- pletion of the disposition of the pending amendment, there be a 40-minute limita- tion on each amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Delaware- numbered 468, 469, and 472-the time to be equally divided between the Senator from Delaware [Mr. WILLIAMS] and the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. MON- RONEY]. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. LAUSCHE in the chair). Without objection, it is so ordered. The issue before the Senate is the amendment of the Senator from Dela- ware. The vote is to be taken at 10:30 a.m. Each side has 11 minutes remaining. Who yields time? Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. President, in the absence of the Senator from Oklahoma, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous con- sent that the time be charged equally to both sides. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be re- scinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. President, the pending amendment re- lates to the provisions in existing law which provide that four staff members from a Senator's office are entitled to be paid for their transportation expenses when sent home. This means four trips each year for staff members from each Senator's office, with the exception that employees of Senators from States with a population of 10 million or more are allowed six trips. Under existing law we provide for re- payment to Members of the Senate who make official trips back to their States, up to six trips during each calendar year. These repayments are made on a strict- ly reimbursable basis for travel expendi- tures actually incurred. When the Sena-tor returns he submits to the disbursing office a voucher for his transportationcost-his airplane ticket or his railroadticket-and he is reimbursed according- ly, but reimbursement is strictly on the basis of expenditures made. In the case of staff members of the Senate, they can travel by air or by train, but they are reimbursed not on the basis of expenditures actually made for trans- portation but rather on the basis of 10 cents per mile. This method has themathematical effect in the case of far- distant States, on the west coast, for instance, that they can collect some- times 30 to 40 percent more in reimburse- ment than was paid out in transportation expenditures. The purpose of the amendment is to bring the provisions for staff members into compliance with provisions which are now in effect for Members of the Senate; namely, that the staff member would be reimbursed for travel expenses on the basis of 100 percent as they are made, but no more. In other words, reimbursement would only be made for the actual expenses. Mr. CARLSON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield. Mr. CARLSON. Is it the contention of the Senator that Members of Congress are required to submit vouchers for all expenses on travel and that that is not required by members of the staff? Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. The Sen- ator is correct. I believe that was an oversight at the time this measure was passed. I am sure it was. I voted for it, and it was my understanding that both groups would be reimbursed according to expenditures, but the law does not so read. Based on my survey most staff members today are merely collecting on the basis of actual expenses, and there are very few, I suspect, who even know about the conditions to which I refer. I would not change the number of trips, but I think they should only be reim- bursed on actual expenditures. Mr. CARLSON. I favor the present system in which staff members are per- mitted to travel and receive pay for their travel. However, I rather agree with the position of the Senator from Delaware. There should be no question as to vouchers submitted for travel. The requirements should be the same as those required of Members of the Senate. I think that our staff people are en- titled to travel, and we request that they travel. Therefore, they should be reim- bursed on the number of trips we per- mit. However, if the Senate's amendment is so drawn that it does only that to which he refers, I would support it. Otherwise, I would not want to endanger the travel pay of our staff people. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I assure the Senator that that is all the amend- ment does. If it were found that the amendment does more I would oppose it. I am 100 percent in favor of the al- lowance for staff members. I think it is essential, just as travel is essential for Senators. I do not think that under any cir- cumstances anyone should ever collect anything in addition to the amount actually paid out for travel expenses. Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve whatever time I have remaining. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, first, I wish to make a brief statement for the RECORD which is out of order.The PRESIDING OFFICER. TheSenator is recognized. TRIBUTE TO DR. HENRY GART- LAND BENNETT, PRESIDENT TRUMAN'S FIRST POINT 4 ADMIN- ISTRATOR Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, it has been nearly 16 years since thetragic and untimely death, in line of duty, of Dr. Henry Gartland Bennett, a great Oklahoman, a great American, and President Truman's first point 4administrator. Dr. Bennett had been the head of Oklahoma State University and he wasthe man who brought it into greatness from a small school. Dr. Bennett and his wife were killed 16 years ago this Christmas Eve, while he was on duty, during a landing at one of the Middle Eastern airports in a storm. If he were here today, I know that Dr. Bennett would be very proud of the record of one of the projects initiated by him-the Oklahoma State University agricultural education program in Ethio- pia. Within months of Dr. Bennett's death, three Oklahomans arrived in Ethiopia to start work on the educa- tional program Dr. Bennett and His Im- perial Majesty Haile Selassie had agreed upon. Dr. Bennett understood that the secret of American success was to be found in the application of universal truths andthat, as such, the secret was adaptable to the environments and cultures of any people. At the same time, Dr. Bennett made it clear that his purpose was not to impose an American way of life upon the world. The corollary for the Amer- ican technical cooperation program, Dr. Bennett explained to the Foreign Affairs Committee in June 1951, was: We work ourselves out of business .. As soon as possible the nationals of the country take leadership. I take great pride in the fact that the Oklahoma State University program in Ethiopia has worked itself \"out of busi- ness.\" Great credit is due to the many Ethiopians, starting with Emperor Haile Selassie, whose vision and hard work over the years has brought about the training of enough top level administra- tive leadership to take over the full responsibility for this very important portion of their nation's economic de- velopment. I am also happy to agree with a great Oklahoma newspaper's editorial position that OSU and all Oklahomans can be proud of their record in Ethiopia. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent to have printed in the RECORD an editorial from the Oklahoma City Times of November 1, 1967, commenting on the takeover of the agricultural education program in Ethiopia. There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: [From the Oklahoma City (Okla.) Times, Nov. 1, 1967] OSU IN ETHIOPIA So successfully involved has Oklahoma State University been in its agricultural edu- cation program in Ethiopia since 1952 that it is hard to realize the end is approaching.34212 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE But that is the word as Washington offi- cials have decided the program is going well enough now that it can be turned over to the Ethiopians next year. OSU President Rob- ert Kamm in a recent interview said the process of replacing OSU personnel there with Africans has been going on for years and the time for change is here, even though there will be a shortage of trained Ethiopian per- sonnel because of the many demands for such persons throughout that country. A record of help has been established there of which OSU and all Oklahomans can be proud. ORDER OF BUSINESS Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will the Senator from Delaware yield to me for a minute? Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ROBERT S. McNAMARA Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I wish to make a brief statement with respect to Secretary of Defense Robert S. Mc- Namara. I listened to the colloquy on the floor of the Senate last night. I thought it was too serious to interpose quickly, as it affected a man's life. I have thought the matter over and I feel that I should speak. I would suppose that there will be great restraint on all of these questions raised last night about Secretary McNamara. I should doubt very much that he would want any such storm of controversy and suspicion to surround his movement from one great office to another. In my judgment, he is a great Amer- ican to whom the Nation owes a great debt of gratitude. Whether one agrees or disagrees with him on individual matters, he has been a great Secretary of Defense who streamlined the Pentagon and estab- lished civilian supremacy over the mili- tary. He is a man who in every way dis- tinguished the office he has held. The decision of Secretary McNamara with respect to the deployment of the thin anti-ballistic-missile system is one of the most courageous decisions ever made by any Government official. Al- though I agree with him, that is neither here nor there. I would hope that he would be allowed to move from the office which he now has to the presidency of the World Bank, with the dignity, respect, and aura of propriety to which he is so fully entitled as a man. Mr. President, I express this opinion as a friend and as one Senator. POSTAL REVENUE AND FEDERAL SALARY ACT OF 1967 The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill (H.R. 7977) to adjust certain postage rates, to adjust the rates of basic compensation for certain officers and employees in the Federal Government, and to regulate the mailing of pandering advertisements, and for other purposes. (At this point, Mr. HARRIS assumed the chair.) Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I am afraid that we are making a mountain out of a mole hill in the Williams amendment.First, I feel that the present arrange- ments for the Senate staff travel of four trips to the State of the average Senator is less than we pay to our committee staffs, who also travel back to their States, and also for those in the execu- tive department. The Senator is correct that we do not calculate the exact cost of the airline trips that staff members take. We take the official mileage to the Senator's resi- dence. That official mileage is calculated at 10 cents per mile. The usual air pas- sage is about 7.5 cents a mile tourist and it would be close to 10 cents a mile first class. Counting trips to and from the airport one would have very little, if any- thing, left from the 10 cents a mile allow- ance, even though one were to travel tourist, to pay for these extras that are indispensible to trips by the staff on the whole. I have always thought we were doing less for members of the staff than for committee staff. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Oklahoma has ex- pired. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 additional minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Oklahoma is recognized for 3 additional minutes. Mr. MONRONEY. The committee staff are paid 12 cents a mile if they travel by car, and are paid exactly the amount of the airline fare whether traveling first class or tourist. Now this is the im- portant part of the amendment. The committee staffs are paid $16 a day per diem. I point out that the same thing applies in the same manner to employ- ees traveling for the executive depart- ment. They are paid 12 cents a mile if traveling by car, and are paid the exact amount of the airline fare if traveling tourist or first class-most travel tour-ist-but they, too, are paid $16 a day per diem. The staffs of Senators are paid 10 cents a mile if they travel by car. Under the Senator's amendment, these trips would be paid at 10 cents a mile for employees merely traveling to the residence of the Senator in his home State and that is all they would get. They would not get any per diem. We consider-at least I do- that the overage, if there be any, between the actual air fare of 71/2 cents a mile and the 10 cents a mile we now pay, does perhaps pay for their time over the weekend when they are in a motel or have a place to stay in a rooming house or a hotel. Certainly, they will be in the hole because of the trip back home. We pay only the cost of the air trip back home as vouchered by the Senator. We pay on a vouchered certificate of the employee, signed by the Senator, of the official mileage established in the Dis- bursing Clerk's office. The exact mileage, at 10 cents a mile, is vouchered and checked. It cannot vary. But we do admit that there will be, perhaps, a residual of 2s/2 cents on the 10 cents a mile that we have vouchers for. This is in lieu of the $16 a day per diem. If we want to make it equal and fair, then we should change the amendment to say that we will pay the same as committee staff are paid- that is, at the actual air fare rate; butwe will also pay them $16 a day per diem. This will, of course, cost a lot more money to the Federal Government be- cause now our staff members are absorb- ing it. The Senator asks why do Senators get only air fare. The reason is that Senators have residences of their own in their home States, in which, of course, they stay. We would be foolish to give them $16 a day per diem. We would be foolish to overpay the amount of their actual air fare. I think we would be working an injustice on committee staff by saying, \"You cannot have any per diem for your hotel bill. You cannot have 10 cents a mile. You can have only the actual amount of the airline ticket.\" Mr. President, the amendment of the Senator from Delaware should be de- feated. Mr. PONG. Mr. President, will theSenator from Oklahoma yield? Mr. MONRONEY. I am happy to yield to my distinguished colleague from Ha- waii, a member of the committee. Mr. FONG. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Oklahoma in objecting to the amendment of the Senator from Delaware. I do not know how other Senators use their staff expenses but in my office I make sure that each man is reimbursed only for the amount he pays for actual travel expenses going to and from Ha- waii. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Oklahoma has expired. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I yield 2 additional minutes to the Sen- ator from Hawaii. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator has only 1 minute remaining. Mr. FONG. Mr. President, I ask unan- imous consent that I may proceed for 3 minutes on the bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the unanimous-consent agreement, there is no time allowed on the bill, only on the amendment. Mr. FONG. Then, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed for 3 minutes on the time allowed un- der the amendment. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, may I yield the Senator from Hawaii 3 min- utes from the time on the bill? Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres- ident, how much time do I have re- maining? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I want to use only 3 minutes. I am glad to yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Hawaii. Just so I have 3 minutes left. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Hawaii is recognized for 3 ad- ditional minutes. Mr. PONG. Mr. President, I repeat, in my office I make sure that each staff member who returns to Hawaii is re- imbursed only for his actual transporta- tion costs. I find that I need more than four staff members in my home State while the Congress is in adjournment. By using the money available under the 10 cents a mile rule presently in law. I am able to send 10 or 12 staff members to my home State.34213 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATENovember 29, 1967 It is difficult for the members of my staff to get to Hawaii, because it costs so much to go there and back. Four hun- dred dollars for a trip is the cheapest one can go. If he went first class, it would cost $600. They go the cheapest way home every time. I find that even with the present law, staff members must pay a part of the way from their own pockets. They also receive no per diem expenses that other Federal employees receive when they are traveling. Thus, I think that the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Delaware is not a good way to handle this kind of expense. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. President, if the Senate wants to send more members of the staff back home, the way to do that is to change the num- ber of trips or the number of staff mem- bers, and to do it in an open and above- board way, still reimbursing each one of them solely on the expenditures incurred. The argument is made that this is an offset to what would normally be classi- fied as a per diem allowance. The fallacy of that argument is that in the State of Pennsylvania, say, the difference in the allowance would amount, on a round trip, to perhaps $12 to $15. That is because it is close by. The difference in a round trip to Hawaii would amount to $400 to $500. If staff members are sent there, it would cost no more to stay in Hawaii than in Pennsylvania. If we are going to make extra allow- ances let us do whatever we do in an open and aboveboard way. This amendment would not change in any way the number of trips allowed to staff members, as was approved by Con- gress. It leaves it at exactly the same number. It gives them every trip which Congress intended them to have. This amendment merely states exactly what is now true with Members of the Senate, that staff members will be reim- bursed only for expenditures actually incurred. That is all anyone should ex- pect under any program or any authori- zation of the U.S. Government. Mr. President, I want a record vote on the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. President, how much time is left? The PRESIDING OFFICER. One min- ute is left to each side. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President---- Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. If the Senator from Oklahoma is willing, I am willing to yield back the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are Sen- ators willing to yield back the remainder of their time? Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, do I have 1 minute remaining? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. Mr. MONRONEY. Then I yield my- self the additional minute. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. President, I withhold my 1 minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Oklahoma is recognized for 1 minute.Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, if Senators want uniformity, if they want the same kind of treatment for the mem- bers of their staffs as are paid commit- tee staffs and the executive department, then let us have an amendment which will provide for the exact amount of the airline ticket cost and give our employ- ees the $16 a day per diem which is al- lowed to everyone else. For myself, I do not expect and I do not want any employee to be using money out of his pocket for expenses when he goes back home for a few days to help answer the phone and see constituents that I am unable to see. I have to have some staff back there. If the Senator wants to be fair, he should say, \"Sure, allow them the exact amount of their airline ticket, but let us give them the same per diem.\" It is going to cost a lot more, but I think that would be fairer. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. President, I yield myself my remaining minute to say that the Senator from Ok- lahoma says, \"If we want to be fair, let us put them on the same basis.\" We should put them on the same basis, but let us remember that an employee here is receiving $20,000 to $22,000, and what will be a $25,000 salary for staff mem- bers, compared with an employee down- town who is drawing $10,000 or $12,000. Mr. MONRONEY. The committee staff is drawing more than the Member staff. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. The com- mittee staff may be overpaid. This is getting out of hand. I repeat, under no circumstances should there be in a governmental role any Government official, either staff member or any other official of the Government, who can collect and make money on his travel allowance. He should collect only that which he pays. That is the law as it relates to all private citizens. The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment has expired.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment was rejected. Mr. MANSFIELD. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. The legislative clerk proceeded to read the amendment. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres- ident, I ask unanimous consent that fur- ther reading of the amendment be dis- pensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment (No. 468) of Mr. WIL- LIAMS of Delaware is as follows: On page 143, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following: \"SEC. 225. (a) The paragraph under the heading 'Stationery (revolving fund)' in the appropriations for the Senate in title IV of the Foreign Aid and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, 1964 (77 Stat. 864; 2 U.S.C. 46a), is amended by adding at the end thereof the following: 'The allowance for stationery shall hereafter be available only for (1) purchases made through the Senate stationery room of stationery and other office supplies for use for official busi- ness, and (2) reimbursement upon presenta- tion, within thirty days after the close of the fiscal year for which the allowance is provided, of receipted invoices for pur- chases elsewhere of stationery and other of- fice supplies (excluding items not ordinarily available in the Senate stationery room) for use for official business in an office main- tained by a Senator in his home State. Any part of the allowance for stationery which remains unobligated at the end of the fiscal year 1968 or any subsequent fiscal year shall be withdrawn from the revolving fund es- tablished by the Third Supplemental Ap- propriation Act, 1957 (71 Stat. 188; 2 U.S.C. 46a-1), and covered into the general fund of the Treasury.' \"(b) The stationery allowance, as author- ized by law, for each Member of the House of Representatives and each Resident Com- missioner shall hereafter be available only for (1) purchases made through the House stationery room of stationery and other of- fice supplies for use for official business, and (2) reimbursement upon presentation, within thirty days after the close of the session for which the allowance is provided, of receipted invoices for purchases elsewhere of stationery and other office supplies (ex- cluding items not ordinarily available in the House stationery room) for use for offi- cial business in an office maintained by a Member in his home State. Any part of the stationery allowance which remains unob- ligated at the end of the session for which it is available, beginning with the first ses- sion of the Ninetieth Congress, shall be withdrawn from the revolving fund estab- lished by the Legislative Branch Appropria- tion Act, 1948 (61 Stat. 366; 2 U.S.C. 46b-1), and covered into the general fund of the Treasury.\" Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Florida. Mr. HOLLAND. I thank the Senator for yielding. Mr. President, yesterday afternoon, some time after 6, there was a vote in the Senate. Under a misunderstanding that there would be no further votes, the Sen- ator from Florida, a few minutes after 6, had left the Senate Chamber. The vote was on an amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Delaware [Mr. WILLIAMS]. The results of that voteare shown in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, volume 113, part 25, pages 34020-34021. If I had been present and voting, I would have voted \"nay.\" I ask that that fact be shown in the RECORD. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished sen- ior Senator from Arkansas. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Arkansas is recognized for 2 minutes. OMNIBUS CRIME CONTROL AND SAFE STREETS ACT OF 1967 Mr. McCLELLAN. Mr. President, on yesterday in my remarks while discussing the pending crime measure, I referred to an incident that had occurred in the State of Oklahoma when a murder charge had to be dismissed because a 14-year-old boy had confessed to the crime without having been warned and without having been offered the assist- ance of a lawyer. The young boy blurted out his confession. The court dismissed the case or was forced to find the de- fendant not guilty because of the ruling by the Supreme Court in the Miranda case. I made some reference yesterday to the facts and circumstances attending that crime. I spoke largely from memory, although I had printed in the RECORD a new account of the crime from the Washington Post. I am now in possession of the other article about which I spoke. I ask unan- imous consent that the editorial entitled \"The Law: Criminal Justice-A Father Is Not a Counsel,\" printed in Time mag- azine of December 1, 1967, be printed at this point in the RECORD. Those Sen- ators who read the article may refer to my previous remarks in the CONGRES- SIONAL RECORD, volume 113, part 25, be- ginning on page 34006. There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: THE LAW: CRIMINAL JUSTICE-A FATHER Is NOT A COUNSEL When the gasoline fire in the living room was finally put out, it was found that Mrs. Udine Harp's body had not been destroyed, and an examination disclosed numerous bullet wounds. County police in Boise City, Okla., soon learned from 14-year-old Bruce, one of her three sons, that he had seen a rug-cleaning salesman on the front porch shortly before the fire. An itinerant was picked up on suspicion of being the sales- man, but the investigation continued. The husband, Lester Harp, was brought to the district attorney's office for further question- ing, and eventually the three Harp boys were also brought in. To clear up some points, Assistant District Attorney Loys Criswell asked if the three would mind taking a lie- detector test. Before they answered, their father took them aside for a family consulta- tion and returned with some surprising news: \"Bruce wants to tell you something.\" Bruce then blurted out that he had shot his mother accidentally with a .22-cal. rifle. Reloading the rifle one cartridge at a time, he had continued to pump bullets into his mother \"to put her out of her misery.\" He next shot her dog, then doused the couch and her body in gasoline and touched off the fire. The confession came as a complete surprise to Criswell, who said later that he had never even suspected the 14-year-old.FINGER OF SUSPICION Criswell was in for another surprise. Be- cause he had not suspected Bruce, he had not warned him of his rights to silence and counsel under the U.S. Supreme Court's Miranda decision. As a result, after one day of a non-jury trial last week, Judge Merle Lansden reluctantly barred the boy's confes- sion and found him not guilty. \"Before a confession is to be accepted when a person is in custody or his freedom of action is limited in any significant manner, he must be warned,\" said the judge. Mention of \"the words lie detector\" indicated \"that the finger of suspicion was moving toward Bruce.\" Though Bruce cannot be tried again on the murder charge, Criswell said he would appeal the ruling in order to challenge the judge's interpretation of the juvenile's rights. \"It's the worst miscarriage of justice I've ever seen,\" said the angry prosecutor. \"The boy hadn't even been arrested. And his father was there. This is ridiculous. It means we have open season on mothers up here.\" If Judge Lansden's barring of the confession is overruled, it will hardly make any difference to Bruce, who has been committed to a state mental hospital by his father. Criswell, how- ever, says that if he wins the appeal, he may retry the boy-this time on an arson charge. POSTAL REVENUE AND FEDERAL SALARY ACT OF 1967 The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill (H.R. 7977) to adjust certain postage rates, to adjust the rates of basic compensation for certain officers and employees in the Federal Government, and to regulate the mailing of pandering advertisements, and for other purposes. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Nebraska. Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, I rise to ask a couple of questions of the manager of the bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Let there be order in the Chamber. Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, my ques- tion relates to the pay increase portion of the bill. Is my understanding correct that for the classified service there are three steps to the pay increase? Mr. MONRONEY. The Senator is cor- rect. The first step is 4.5 percent. That would be effective as of October 1 of this year, contingent upon its being signed by the President. Mr. CURTIS. I am not concerned about the dates. Mr. MONRONEY. In the classified service, the next step would be effective next year. It would be one-half of the difference between the Federal salaries for that particular position and the com- parability in outside industry, with a minimum of 3 percent. The following year, it would be the amount that would close the comparability as determined by the labor statistics wage index. Mr. CURTIS. Is there a minimum per- centage? Mr. MONRONEY. Not that year, be- cause we do not know what it will be. This is the markup step. The third step will close the difference. There will be at least an automatic 3 percent or at least half of the then existing difference as determined by the Bureau of Labor Sta- tistics for the second step. Mr. CURTIS. That has a compounding effect. It is 3 percent. Mr. MONRONEY. Or more.34215 34216 November 29, 1967 Mr. CURTIS. On what the wages will be after the bill takes effect, and the first step goes into effect. Mr. MONRONEY. The Senator is cor- rect. Mr. CURTIS. What will the total cost of the pay increases in the bill be when all the steps have been taken? Mr. MONRONEY. It will be $2.6 bil- lion, including the postal wages and all wages at the conclusion of the 3-year step increases. Mr. CURTIS. Each year? Mr. MONRONEY. It will be that amount at the end of the third year with that increase. It would escalate so that the increase will be $2.6 billion for all of our Federal employees, classified and postal workers. Mr. CURTIS. A 12-month period? Mr. MONRONEY. The Senator is cor- rect. It will begin at that point, with the last pay raise, to become $2.6 billion. Mr. CURTIS. Will the distinguished chairman tell me what the present me- dian salary is in the classified service? Mr. MONRONEY. It is about $6,800 median. That takes in the highest level, GS-18, down to the general service level, GS-1 and GS-2. Mr. CURTIS. That means that half of the employees get less than that amount and half of them get more? Mr. MONRONEY. The Senator is cor- rect. Most of them would be up a step or two from the median or a step or two down from the median. Mr. CURTIS. That is the present median. Mr. MONRONEY. The Senator is correct. Mr. CURTIS. I thank the Senator from Delaware for yielding. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres- ident, I yield myself 3 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Delaware is recognized for 3 minutes. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. The pending amendment is the exact amend- ment that was approved by the Senate as a rider on the legislative appropria- tions bill. The amendment deals with the sta- tionery allowance for Members of Con- gress, both House and Senate. The pending amendment would not change the amount of such allowances at all as it pertains to what could be expended. It merely provides that to the extent any portion of a Senator's or a Congress- man's stationery allowance is left over at the end of the fiscal year, not having been used or needed for the purpose for which it was intended, it would auto- matically revert to the Federal Treasury. The amendment provides, in addition, for offsetting the purchases made in the stationery stores, both House and Senate. If purchases of stationery and office supplies are made in the home State of a Congressman or in some other State by a Member of the Congress he can submit vouchers and be reimbursed for that expenditure. I have consistently taken the positionthat the Federal Government should re- imburse and underwrite 100 percent ofthe cost of operating a senatorial office. Under no circumstances do we wantto get to the point where the Senate is just a rich man's club or where the av- erage individual cannot afford to serve in the Senate. I have constantly sup- ported whatever stationery allowance is necessary. I fully recognize that it takes more of an allowance in a large State than for a smaller State such as mine. I support an allowance that is adequate to take care of any State. However, to the ex- tent that one dime is left over and not needed or used to defray official ex- penses of that office as they are defined, that money should not go to a Member of the Senate as additional income. The money should automatically revert tothe Federal Treasury. That is all that is involved in the pend- ing amendment. The amendment is identical to the amendment that was agreed to before. Unfortunately it was lost in conference. One of the arguments that was made for not holding the amendment in the bill at conference wasthat they were confronted with the situ- ation where the amendment had been agreed to by the Senate on a voice vote and without the prestige of a record vote. They said that therefore they could not hold the amendment. Mr. President, to avoid that one argu- ment I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending amendment. The yeas and nays were ordered. ADDRESS BY SENATOR KUCHEL BEFORE THE LOS ANGELES SECTION OF THE AMERICAN WATERWORKS ASSOCIATION Mr. KUCHEL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield me 1 minute? Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the dis- tinguished senior Senator from Cali- fornia. Mr. KUCHEL. Mr. President, I had the honor on October 25, 1967, of speaking before the California section of the American Waterworks Association in Los Angeles, Calif. I ask unanimous consent that a partial text of my comments on that occasion be printed at this point in the RECORD. There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,as follows: FEDERAL PARTICIPATION IN WATER RESOURCE ENHANCEMENT (Partial text of remarks of U.S. Senator THOMAS H. KUCHEI before the fall 1967 conference of the American Water Works Association, California Section, Los Angeles, Calif., October 25, 1967) In May of 1924, the inhabitants of the little town of Lone Pine in Inyo County, California, were shocked from their beds when an enormous and destructive dynamite blast occurred nearby. Such explosions were not to be a rarity during the troubled days and months which followed. The normally placid Owens Valley was the scene of war. Heavily armed guards patrolled through fields of wild flowers, while machine gun nests were strategically placed within the usually quiet valley. Fortunately, there were no casualties as a result of this war. Property losses, however, ran high, and passions ran higher. The Owens Valley war was not over gold or silver. It was waged over that rarest of California resources-water.The effort by the people of Owens Valleyto prevent the diversion of Owens Riverwater to the City of Los Angeles was merely one of many of the struggles by westerners over the precious fluid. The \"War of the Waterhole\" was a standard occurance in therough and ready West of our ancestors. While our times, dress, and activities have changed with time, the \"War of the Water- hole\" continues even today. While it is wagedon a less destructive scale, it exists on a far wider front; the battle continues with great vigor in the historic Halls of Congress. To- day, I will not retrace the often colorful past. Rather, I shall attempt to look at the present and the future of water resources development. Water, which has been a rea- son for war, may even prove to be the means of achieving peace and cooperation in some of our most troubled areas of the world. THE AVAILABILITY OF WATER The volume of water on the earth is fixed. This volume has served the needs of this planet over and over again through a nat- ural use-purification-reuse process known as the hydrologic cycle. We are all aware that water evaporates from the ocean Into the atmosphere, condenses into rain, falls on the land, and is used by man, animals, and nature; finally returning to the ocean where it again evaporates into the atmos- phere. For a moment, then, let us examine just how much water is available to and is currently being used by man. If the total amount of water in existence was considered to be in one fifty-five gallon barrel, then the amount of water in the oceans could be represented by a bathtub containing fifty gallons. The ice caps and glaciers would be a small block of ice con- taining about one gallon of water. The total water annually involved in the hydrologic cycle could be represented by two ounces of water in a small glass. The quantity of water falling as annual precipitation on the land could be contained in a liqueur glass, and then, only to the extent of half an ounce. The fresh water discharged annually into the sea by rivers shows up as about five millimeters in a small hypodermic syringe. The annual recoverable ground water would be a very small drop on the end of the hypodermic needle. Our five millimeters of water contained in the syringe, represent- ing the total discharge of rivers, is an ap- proximate measure of the potentially avail- able and manageable liquid water in con- tinental areas. Our country has an average annual pre- cipitation of approximately 30 inches. It can, therefore, be calculated that we have an aver- age runoff of about 4.4 trillion gallons of water per each day. Evaporation and various other natural withdrawals reduce the amount to 1.1 trillion gallons a day. Of this amount, avoidable losses such as water pollu- tion and our failure adequately to store the water available to us, as well as unavoidable losses reduce the amount of water available to support human life to less than half the potential usable amount. It is clear that our country is not the Sahara Desert. However, our long-range water requirement forecasts indicate a possible requirement of nearly 900 billion gallons a day by the year 2000. It has been estimated that even within the next decade our water needs may exceed 600 bil- lion gallons per day. While the dilemma of procuring usable water for our people exists practically nation-wide, it is amplified many times in the arid portions of our country, such as in the Pacific Southwest. It is repeatedly suggested that we not plan for population growth, and force the people to go where there is water. It is undeniable that additional urban, agricultural, and in- dustrial growth cannot take place where there is no water. While it is true that if we make portions of California, and Arizona un- inhabitable, people will go elsewhere, thoseCONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE of us charged with the responsibility for providing water for people at the locations where the people want to be must strive with all our foresight, resources, and energy to carry out this duty, and thus prevent what probably would be an economic and social cataclysm. As our population, industry, and agriculture increased, our use of water in- creases. As the demands for water increase, our task becomes more difficult, as well as more crucial. Our job can be done, and will be done. Furthermore, I am convinced that its accomplishment will prove exciting, as well as fascinating. Let us look now at a few of the areas in which the Federal Government is operating to assist in answering the challenge. WATER POLLUTION CONTROL In 1658 Richard Franck averred that \"ne- cessity is the mother of invention.\" Franck, however, did not foresee that invention would be the mother of pollution. Our ever-grow- ing industries and communities produce more and more waste products which must be disposed of. Contrary to the thinking of many, the major use of free-running water in industrial nations is not in the productive process. Rather, it is used in waste disposal. Out of the total potentially controllable water in the United States, approximately ninety-five percent is used as a conveyor belt on which to send waste products to the sea. Such waste product disposal includes both soluble and insoluble wastes, chemical pol- lutants, and dispersal of waste heat. It is easy, as well as fashionable, at this point in comments such as these to bring on the \"parade of horribles.\" Describing the often disastrous results of our waste dis- posal practices in terms of disease, fish, wildlife, and plant destruction, increases in salinity and chemical pollutants, and the like, often dramatizes and emphasizes the crisis. Those of us here today, however, need no dramatization of this dreadful problem. We realize that many of us did not under- stand the dangers to our environment, and, indeed, to our productive capabilities, threatened by our heretofore accepted waste disposal practices. As in so many instances, the problem was not anticipated sufficiently to be forestalled. Seemingly before we knew it, eutrophication had turned many of our once-blue lakes into beds of green slime, and our clear-running rivers into clouded, life-killing eyesores. It was not until moun- tains of foam clogged and discolored many of our waterways that a concerted effort was launched to correct this shameful and de- structive degradation of our water re- sources. My friends, I am not talking merely about aesthetics. Water is used and reused many times in its travels from the moun- tains to the sea. It is not altogether fanciful to find some truth in the ditty: \"What you threw away the other day, they'll drink to- morrow in San Jose.\" While some pollution is unavoidable, at least until we can train our farm animals to use plumbing facilities, we must engage in a successful effort to pre- vent that pollution which is avoidable. In 1956, with the enactment of the Fed- eral Water Pollution Control Act, the Fed- eral Government was permitted full par- ticipation in a wide variety of pollution control activities. This program was con- siderably strengthened by amendments to the Act signed into law in July 1961. An- other major step was the Water Quality Act of 1965, which, among other things, created the Federal Water Pollution Control Admin- istration. Since, up to this time, water pol- lution was considered primarily a health hazard, the 1965 Act placed the Water Pol- lution Control Administration under the Department of Health, Education, and Wel- fare. Soon it was realized that water pollu- tion was far more than a health hazard. Indeed, the health aspects of the problem were well on their way to being under con- trol by the time the FWPCA was created.Therefore, the Federal Government's pri- mary water pollution control arm was transferred to the Department of the Inte- rior in May of 1966. In November 1966, the Clean Water Restoration Act became law. This Act, in conjunction with the Water Quality Act of 1965, signaled a new era for water pollution control in the United States. By use of a variety of programs, the Federal Government is encouraging and in- spiring states and local governments to wage war on pollution. The rapid and suc- cessful conclusion of this conflict is a neces- sity if we are to make full use of our water resources. Some of the programs being administered by the Federal Water Pollution Control Ad- ministration are: grants to assist in the con- struction of waste treatment works to pre- vent the discharge of inadequately treated sewage or other wastes into the nation's streams, lakes, and coastal waters; grants to state and interstate water pollution control agencies to assist in the administration of their programs, including amounts for the training of public agency personnel; grants to states, municipalities, other governmental agencies, and individuals for research and development, including amounts for projects concerned with storm and combined sewers, advanced waste treatment and joint treat- ment systems for municipal and industrial wastes, and methods for the prevention of pollution by industry, such as the treatment of industrial wastes; and grants intended to encourage and assist appropriate agencies, institutions, and individuals in the conduct of studies and training in research and de- velopment activities. These programs are in addition to the direct operations of the Fed- eral Water Pollution Control Administration. Such direct operations include research and development, technical assistance, pollution surveillance, training, public information, and enforcement of pollution restrictions placed on interstate waterways. I am pleased to report that the Secretary of the Interior is in the process of final evaluation of state water quality standards required by the Water Quality Act of 1965. Under this Act, the states were required to submit water quality criteria for their inter- state and coastal waters and a plan for im- plementing and enforcing the criteria adopted. If state standards prove unaccept- able, the Secretary of the Interior has the authority to establish standards of his own, but only after the state and other affected interests have had a full opportunity to be heard. Once adopted, the standards are en- forceable by the states and by the Federal Government. The existence of such standards makes it possible for municipalities, indus- tries, and other water users to know in ad- vance what their responsibilities are for keeping clean waters clean, and for restoring polluted waters to a reasonable degree of purity. As in so many other aspects of govern- mental activity, the most effective vehicle for bringing about the desired results is also the item in greatest scarcity. Of course, I am referring to money. While authorizing legisla- tion confirms the need for governmental activity and assistance, the great demand for the federal dollar often leaves the desired programs only partially operational. I fear that the water pollution control activities of the Federal Government are no exception. For example, the current drain on the Fed- eral Treasury caused by other legitimate activities of the Federal Government has allowed only partial funding of the Water Pollution Control program. However, this is not to say that the program is in danger of failing. Hundreds of millions of dollars are being provided with which to fight the battle against pollution. The signs of success are encouraging and often dramatic. One area related to water pollution con- trol, which is of special interest in thewater short areas of the country, is that of water reuse. The principle of reuse of nat- ural resources has been applied in many situations: Waste oil is often salvaged, re- fined, and used again; and wood and paper products are often reprocessed and reused. Such direct reuse is now being applied to our most precious and essential natural resources-air and water. Since we wash the family car when it gets dirty in preference to throwing it away, in areas of water need consideration should be given to \"washing\" water when it becomes dirty. It is no longer prophetic to talk of a man-made hydrologic cycle wherein water would be used, purified, and then reused in the same manner as \"new\" water. While the purification cost is a factor, in areas where it is expensive to acquire new water supplies of sufficient quality, reuse of waste water may be espe- cially meritorious. Because the wastes of man and industry are becoming more com- plex, more sophisticated purification meth- ods are needed, and are being developed. The degree of purification required is de- termined by the specific purpose for which the treated water will be used. At some lo- cations, the irrigation water used for non- edible crops, for golf courses, and for parks, can be municipal waste effluent that has been conventionally treated and then chlo- rinated. In my State of California, at San- tee, near San Diego, purified waste water is used in a series of man-made lakes for recreational purposes. Of course, often the major problem in such endeavors is public acceptance. The success of projects, such as that at Santee, should serve to quickly allay public fears. With improved scientific methods of purification and corresponding reduction in costs, there is little reason to deny that before too long we will in fact be drinking tomorrow the water we drank yesterday. WEATHER MODIFICATION In November, 1966, the Department of the Interior put forward its plan to develop technology for increasing the water yield from atmospheric sources. This plan con- tained a broad, generalized program with a view to the development of operational sys- tems to enhance precipitation In some areas by 1972, and to achieve a general national capability to enhance or redistribute precip- itation by 1985. Up until recently, most plans dealing with transporting water to areas of use considered only bringing water already on the land across the surface of the countryside to the areas of need. There is growing interest in having nature assist in this transportation job. If it rains or snows in proximity to the areas of need, the transportation problems are diminished or may even be eliminated. That is why today's scientists, replacing the rainmakers of old, are seeking to explore the nature of the precipitation process, and, if possible, to control it. The desirability of redistribution of precipitation can be appreciated when one recognizes that many areas of the country are threatened with water deficiencies while other areas have a water surplus. The Senate Select Committee on National Water Re- sources, of which Committee I had the honor of being Co-chairman, in its 1960 report projected areas of future water deficiency. We concluded that substantial areas of the country, notably in the upper Missouri, Great Basin, upper Rio Grande-Pecos, Colorado, and South Pacific basins, face a water supply deficiency which will exist by 1980. Water supply deficiencies would additionally exist, or be threatened, by the year 2000 in the Central Pacific, Upper Arkansas-Red, Western Gulf, Western and Eastern Great Lakes, and the Delaware-Hud- son regions. While the reasons for the exist- ence of deficiencies may differ with the dif- ferences in geography, the need to develop34217 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 adequate water resources of sufficient quality is universal. Weather phenomena, including precipita- tion, involve large exchanges of energy. Man's efforts to alter the weather have the greatest chance of success if the compara- tively meager amounts of energy which he can selectively introduce are applied to un- stable atmospheric situations where rela- tively small amounts of energy can serve as a trigger for the release of much larger amounts of energy through natural proc- esses. To know how, where, and when to apply such energy, scientists must seek to complete their understanding of the physical pr6cesses involved in precipitation. Most ac- tivity in the Interior Department's Atmos- pheric Water Resources Program will be per- formed by universities and private firms, with government agencies generally furnish- ing specialized support and coordination, as well as financial backing. It is hoped by such activity to stimulate and strengthen aca- demic research and educational capabilities in general in the area of weather modifica- tion. Ideally, this program will be expanded to in the neighborhood of 50 million dollars per year by 1972. Best estimates of precipita- tion increase range from 10 to 20 percent, although continued research and develop- ment may increase this range. As in all processes, the cost of the water produced is a factor in determining the feasibility of this approach. It will be fascinating to watch the progress of this new scientific program both from the standpoint of scientific achievement, as well as the manifest social and legal im- plications it will nurture. The problems and advantages which can result from truly ef- fective management of the weather can be imagined when one considers the power available to the person or nation capable of denying his neighbor the rain which would otherwise provide his water, or, con- versely, causing precipitation to fall upon a designated area for as long a period as desired. DESALINATION OF SEA WATER An area of current practical value, and of great future promise and necessity, is that of desalination of sea and brackish water. In my earlier discussion of water availability, I in- dicated that if there were only 55 gallons of water available on the earth, 50 gallons would be in the oceans. As we know, sea water is a homogeneous mixture of water molecules and salt particles, with smaller amounts of more than forty other minerals. Although not fully explainable, it is known that the water molecules of sea water are sensitive to both the addition and the withdrawal of heat, while the salt reacts to the application of voltage. This knowledge is used today in various desalination plants. One desalting method initiated and developed through more recent research activity is that of reverse osmosis. It was discovered that when saline water was forced through a relatively sim- ple plastic membrane, fresh water would pass through the membrane while the salt was withheld. Field tests will begin shortly on this process with a view to increasing the relatively slow flow rates experienced. Through such scientific discoveries, and con- tinued research, it is hoped by many that desalination will contribute greatly to the reduction of our water supply problem. The economic reduction of saline solutions is complicated. For example, if each salt par- ticle and water molecule in a gallon of sea water was enlarged to the size of a sand grain having the diameter of the period mark on a typewriter, the resulting mass of sand would cover the entire surface of the earth to the depth of more than 800 feet. However, notwithstanding the difficulties, several sea water conversion plants have already been constructed, and are augmenting the water supply of their respective regions, as well as contributing to scientific research and devel-opment knowledge. Most of these units pro- duce only from one to two million gallons of fresh water per day at a cost of about one dollar per thousand gallons. On May 19th of this year, the President signed into law a bill which I sponsored in the Senate to al- low the Department of the Interior to con- tribute 57.2 million dollars toward the con- struction and operation of a massive nuclear powered dual-purpose desalting and electri- cal power generating facilities to be built off the coast of Orange County, California. This facility will be built at a total cost of ap- proximately 450 million dollars by the Metro- politan Water District of Southern California in conjunction with the Southern California Edison Company, the Department of Water and Power of the City of Los Angeles, and the San Diego Gas and Electric Company. The plant will produce 150 million gallons of fresh water per day and will generate ap- proximately 1800 megawatts of electric power. The cost of the water produced will be in the neighborhood of 27 cents per thousand gallons delivered to the Metropolitan Water District's Diemer Reservoir. While the cost of this water is by far too expensive for agricul- tural use, its cost is not prohibitive to indus- trial and municipal users. Another advantage is the very high purity of the distilled water which will be produced. While the progress in desalination is en- couraging, it does not, at least for the pres- ent, promise to solve our water problems completely. The high initial capital outlay, as well as the cost of producing the water, in conjunction with the relatively small amounts of water currently producible, in- dicate that desalination merely will be a supplement to our existing water supplies. It is, however, a very important and promis- ing supplement. With scientists almost daily making discoveries and achieving break- throughs in numerous areas of their en- deavors, we can be hopeful that before too long our oceans will be sufficiently tapable so as to moot most of our water supply problems. Earlier I indicated that water often has been the cause of war. Conversely, it is prob- able that an adequate supply of water may become a tool for peace. Particularly, I refer to the hostilities recently exhibited in the Middle East. In that extremely parched area water is life. It has been speculated that if an adequate supply of water could be pro- vided to the arid Middle East, the resulting agriculture and industrialization would re- move most of the basic reasons for discon- tent. Earlier this summer, former President Elsenhower in collaboration with Admiral Lewis L. Strauss, Eisenhower's Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, put for- ward a plan for the construction of three very large nuclear desalting plants, two off the Mediterranean coast of Israel and one at the northern end of the Gulf of Aqaba. The first plant would be designed to produce 450 million gallons of fresh water dally- more than a combined flow of the three main tributaries which make up the Jordan River. Vast amounts of power, far in excess of the present needs, would also be produced. This power would be used to pump fresh water into the water short areas of Israel, Jordan, and other Arab countries, as well as provid- ing a source of inexpensive power, which, when coupled with the large labor force available, hopefully, would attract industry to the area. Operation of the plants would be made the responsibility of the International Atomic Energy Agency of which Agency each of the major belligerents in the area is a member. The Eisenhower plan proposes that the project be financed by a corporation re- sembling Comsat, with the government sub- scribing to half of the stock, and the bal- ance to be offered in the securities markets of the world. Additional funds would be raised by the international marketing of con- vertible debentures which would bear no in-terest for the first few years while the initialplant was being built. While there is somedispute as to the total cost involved, theplan is sufficiently intriguing to merit further exploration. On August 14th of this year a resolution of which I am a co-sponsor was introduced in the Senate by Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee. The resolution indicates that it is the sense of the Senate that a plan along the lines indicated by General Eisenhower would produce many social, economic, and political benefits and would serve as a demon- stration of the United States' efforts to find peaceful solutions to areas of conflict. The resolution requests the President to pursue the objectives of the plan both within and outside of the United Nations and with all nations similarly minded. If this plan bearsfruit, the results could be one of the most dramatic and inspiring events of modern history. In this time when the slightest in- ternational conflict can produce catastrophic worldwide results, factors such as the normal economic feasibility considerations should be modified so as to allow greater considera- tion to the overall good which can result. I am happy and excited to be a part of this very important venture. THE USE OF SPACE IN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT I will conclude my remarks by describing what I think is one of the most fascinating scientific adventures ever conducted in the area of natural resources research. There is on the drawing board a cooperative program between the Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Interior, the Department of the Navy, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The program is designed to orbit a space satellite which will contain special sensors and instrumentation designed to provide earth resource data. The broad areas within which such a program may be potentially suitable include: Agri- culture and forestry resources, such as by increasing the yield and quality from lands under cultivation, decreasing losses in pro- duction, such as from infestation and forest fires, and increasing the potential quantity of land in cultivation; geology and mineral re- sources, such as by developing means of mapping geology and geophysics on a re- gional basis, developing methods of monitor- ing natural disturbances, delineating regions of mineral potential for subsequent detailed study, and providing new methods of in- vestigating major structural units; geog- raphy, cartography, and cultural resources; oceanography, such as by increasing the re- liability of predicting sea-state conditions, and increasing production of fish; and hy- drology and water resources applications. Observation from satellites has unique properties that make it highly desirable in natural resources work. The foremost among these are high altitude and great speed. High altitude enables the scientist to obtain in- formation about large areas at a single in- stant of time. This so-called \"synoptic view\" Insures that data procured will be uninflu- enced by changes occurring within the viewed area over a period of time. Similarly, orbital speeds not only allow the making of repeated observations of the same area at different times, but also allow the observance of con- tiguous areas with a minimum time loss. This means that orbital photographs will Include large areas in a single exposure with uniform shadows and illumination, as well as allow- ing a stereoscopic image to be produced. This can be extremely useful in the detection of mineral deposits where such deposits are re- lated to anomolous geologic structures, es- pecially where such structures are large and subtly expressed. After World War II, aerial photography proved quite valuable in geologic interpre- tation. However, hundreds of photographs were necessary to cover meaningful areas. The time which elapsed in transporting the cam- era from one place to another often allowed34218 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE the light angle, surface temperature, and cloud cover to change between photographs, thereby complicating the task Immeasur- ably. Photographs from a space platform allow the observation of large segments of the earth at one instant of time under uni- form conditions of illumination. Color pho- tography allows the detection of minerals which accompany a discoloration of the rock or other structural elements in the area. The possibility of repeated sensing from a space- craft allows the detection of changing con- ditions, such as surface temperature, over a broad area. This is useful in detecting poten- tial geothermal resource areas as well as of- fering the possibility of providing advance warning of some volcanic eruptions. The benefits of the broad view provided from a spacecraft can be appreciated when one rea- lizes that using conventional aircraft exclu- sively one and a half million aerial photo- graphs are required to provide a single cover- age of the coterminous states of the United States. The cost of acquisition of such photo- graphs is about 12 million dollars. It can be seen that repeated coverage on a frequent basis by such conventional methods is be- yond feasibility. From orbit only about 400 photographs would be necessary to cover the coterminous United States. The feasibility of such repeated coverage, in addition to the benefits previously described, would be of additional use in keeping our land use maps current in this rapidly changing land. The Earth Resources Observations Satel- lite project, known by the acronym EROS, can be especially useful in assisting in the management of our water resources. The measurement of chemical and biological characteristics of water is usually carried out by either spot sampling or continuous sam- pling of water from lakes, streams, estuaries, and underground reservoirs, and the sub- sequent analysis of the samples in the labora- tory. In addition, there is some work being done on automatic monitoring of chemical and biological parameters. However, it is dif- ficult to develop regional synthesis of such data for large water bodies. For example, measurement of the concentration of cer- tain pesticides at a location on the shore of an estuary may not be representative of the concentration or even of the presence of such pollution within the entire estuary. Spacecraft may prove helpful in detecting the presence of pollution, identifying the specific pollution substance, measuring the concen- tration of that substance, and determining its movement and its position. The use of color, infrared, and infrared color photog- raphy in conjunction with surface analysis should prove very helpful. Measuring the physical properties of wa- ter, such as heat, can be done on a large scale from spacecraft. The monitoring of stream temperatures is particularly impor- tant below large power plants which dis- charge great amounts of heated water, since heated water may be detrimental to the oxy- gen content of the stream, and, therefore, to the fish population, beneficial bacteria in the water, as well as its usefulness for munic- ipal or industrial supplies. Such monitoring activity should be valuable in determining the water management practices needed to reduce the amount of thermal loading or to suggest management methods for proper res- toration and use of the water. Ground water is contained within the rocks of the earth's crust and, therefore, the major tool for mapping and descrip- tion of ground water features is geology. Geological mapping is a prime tool and the first tool in any area where ground water exploration is to be done. Because of the necessity for large-scale development within a short time, it is necessary to make pros- pecting for ground water more efficient. This can be done by increasing the mobility of the man who surveys the area, and by reducing the scale of his problem. A synoptic viewof large regions being considered for ground water prospecting can be exceedingly help- ful in reducing the scale of the hydrologist's problem by allowing him to delineate the areas of greater geologic favorability for the occurrence of large quantities of ground water. Photographic and electromagnetic sensors will assist in eliminating surface sur- veys of areas with little potential. By so doing, the surface geologist can devote his time to areas with the most promise. This is particularly important in undeveloped areas where little basic work has been done and yet large supplies of ground water are needed now or in the future. The importance to water management of knowing the location and characteristics of the winter snowpack goes without saying. Too few data points are normally available to allow reliable estimates of the snow cover of watersheds. Methods to monitor vast areas on a periodic basis are required. Work is be- ing done to develop sensors which would allow mapping of the water content and thickness of snow over broad areas. The use of such sensors, when developed, from space- craft will be immensely valuable. Spacecraft also have potential value in the measuring of the liquid-vapor transfer to the hydrologic cycle. It is important for us to know what the water balance of the world is in terms of how much water falls on the ground as precipitation, how much is entering the atmosphere as evaporation or transpiration, and how much is flowing from the land areas into the oceans. The measurement of this phase change of water in the hydrologic cycle is important in the understanding of the world-wide water bal- ance. However, measurement of the evap- orative and transpirative phases of this cycle with methods now available is ex- tremely difficult. The use of infrared radiom- etry and imagery may provide a means to determine the average water surface tem- perature, and, thereby, provide a term in the heat budget equation and, also, in the water budget equation for determining the evap- orative loss of water from lakes and res- ervoirs. Other uses of spacecraft in remote sensing include the study of glaciers, the regional analysis of lakes and associated resources, study of coastal marine hydrology, includ- ing the determination of the distribution of the effluents discharged by the major riv- ers that flow into the sea, and the collec- tion of data which may yield cause and effect relations within hydrologic systems. The collection and analysis of data ob- tained from space promises to be of great economic benefit. When one considers that the total existing capital investment in water resources facilities of all types in the United States is approximately 235 billion dollars, and water resources research expenditures often near 100 million dollars in a year, the desirability of a program by which improved water resources and hydrologic data can be obtained almost goes without saying. The data obtained from such a program will be of immense value not only to the United States, but to every nation over which the spacecraft travels. The Department of the Interior already has numerous expressions of cooperation and participation from various countries around the world which see the great advantage to be derived from having this type of information about their natural resource potential. With the development of increasingly sophisticated sensors, the bene- fits obtained from earth resources research from space will increase with the expanded data collection and evaluation processes. CONCLUSION I have tried to indicate that the Federal government has embarked on a large-scale, broad-ranged program for the development and improvement of our water resources. As a member of the United States Senate, andas the ranking minority member of that body's Committee which oversees our natural resource development, the Committee on In- terior and Insular Affairs, I am particularly gratified with the enthusiasm and dedication of the scientists and administrators who are participating in these programs. The public acceptance of such efforts by their govern- ment is also stimulating and encouraging. While there have been delays and short- comings, I am convinced that we are moving in the right direction. All of us who partici- pate in the task of providing and adminis- tering our water resources should work to- gether to conquer waste, and strive to supply our most precious resource where it is needed by our dynamic countrymen. GAULLISM MAY NOT SURVIVE DE GAULLE BUT THE ATLANTIC AL- LIANCE WILL Mr. KUCHEL. Mr. President, among free men there is an ineluctable unity. Whether we speak of the Allies of World Wars I and II, the Atlantic alliance, or of other agreements among freedom-loving peoples, we are talking about a larger and fundamental process of increasing harmony and cooperation among free men. This unity is a great asset of Western civilization, and its value continues to increase. It is the foundation of our hopes for the peace and prosperity of mankind. It is still true that in union there is strength. He who would tear this fabric asunder, Mr. President, would take away from us far more than our gold supply, precious though it may be, he would put an end to the expansion of world trade, reduce to a paper phantom the bulwark of world collective security, and stifle the tender shoots of broader international coopera- tion which have been so carefully nur- tured by peoples of Europe and America. Yesterday, the distinguished Copley newspapers pointed out in a major edi- torial how the cause of unity has been set back by the recent remarks of French President de Gaulle. The editorial said: In the week which has followed the British devaluation of the pound, President Charles de Gaulle of France was able to assess with some accuracy the best card he could play in the game of international squeeze. At the semi-annual ceremonial monologue which passes for a de Gaulle press conference, the French leader yesterday confirmed grow- ing suspicions that his consuming hatred of anything American or British has almost got the better of his reason. Where he could have provided his interest in helping a former ally, he rubbed salt into British wounds. Again he has dictatorially vetoed Britain's entry into the Common Market, and again he has lashed out blindly at the United States of America for defending freedom in Asia and even impugning our technological superiority. He continued to fan the flames of nationalism in Quebec. In his November 27 press conference, the President of France, once a great hero in the fight for freedom, disavowed his heritage. In a series of incredibly bitter statements aimed at all of his once- prized, English-speaking allies, Gen. Charles de Gaulle regrettably reiterated his tired policy of international irrespon- sibility aimed at dissolving the close harmony among Atlantic nations that has stood for nearly 200 years. Even ugly34219 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 undertones of racism crept into his re- marks. As the Copley editorial notes: This is the man whose country twice within a generation was saved from complete anni- hilation by the military and economic aid provided by her friends. It is certain that if the French President had not blocked, with vindictive determina- tion, Britain's entry into the Common Mar- ket, the economic plight which brought the pound devaluation last week could have been avoided. For months, until the French economy began to run into trouble in mid-year, de Gaulle tried to undermine the United States' economy. By turning his dollars into gold he depleted our gold reserves at an alarming rate. Now he has in effect served notice that he will continue this policy by demanding a return to the discarded international gold standard. Meanwhile his political overtures toward the Russians and his prompt support of the Arabs in the aftermath of the June war in the Middle East not only made his politics suspect, but also his very cerebral processes. He did not alter his stand yesterday. France and De Gaulle can no longer be reckoned among our allies, or our friends, if they are bent on destroying Western unity. I am confident that few in Europe would follow his lead. Indeed, many in France will, I feel sure, part company with their leader. What is at stake here is not merely the economic well-being of the Atlantic community, it is the hope for peace and prosperity in years ahead for ourselves and our posterity. The unity of two centuries will not be broken overnight, nor in a year. But let those who would misjudge its value take heed. America seeks no do- minion in Europe, we seek a continued and close cooperation. The majority of Europeans share this hope and will not be misled. The Copley papers are to be congratu- lated for their ringing American stand. They have sounded the call to action: The General must be warned that he is by our standards now an enemy of the West. He is actively engaged in endeavoring to smash all the Western unity and safety built over the years. SUBCOMMITTEE MEETING DURING SENATE SESSION TODAY Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I yield such time as may be required to the distinguished assistant majority leader. Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. Presi- dent, I ask unanimous consent that the Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Government Operations be authorized to meet during the ses- sion of the Senate today. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. POSTAL REVENUE AND FEDERAL SALARY ACT OF 1967 The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill (H.R. 7977) to adjust certain postage rates, to adjust the rates of basic compensation for certain officers and employees in the Federal Government, and to regulate the mailing of pander- ing advertisements, and for other pur- poses.Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I will not take much time. The Williams amendment is the customary amend- ment. I have voted for it a number of times when the legislative appropriation bill was before the Senate, and he offered it to that bill. I have been a member of conference committees that have tried to work out with the House a satisfactory solution for the limitation of the station- ery account with respect to stationery actually purchased or office supplies ac- tually purchased. I have seen this pro- posal beaten down each time, because the House did not intend to let the Sen- ate fix the amount of stationery they can buy or to determine whether any of the unused stationery allowance could be used for other purposes in the Repre- sentatives' offices or for their office ex- penses, or even for the personal use, in travel or otherwise, of the various Members. I would support the amendment again today if it were on a legislative appropri- ation bill. If we insist upon our disagreement with the House, if we put this amend- ment in the bill, it will be a further cause for delay, long past the New Year, in reaching any agreement. I have sat with conferees of the House. I know their position. I know their de- mand that we do not dictate to them the way they handle their affairs. It is cus- tomary to receive such residual amounts of the stationery account as paid directly to the Representative's office for use as he may see fit. So I cannot accept this amendment to the bill. I know the dangers we will en- counter in going over until after the new year. This bill contains perhaps 500 to 800 separate items, many of which are in controversy. We have resolved many of them. I am sorry that the Senator did not appear before the committee to take up his amendment again. It is another amendment that comes to the floor with- out testimony, although I believe that I know the argument. I have heard him make it. I have heard him testify before the proper appropriations committee. But this is not an appropriations bill. It is a bill designed to raise nearly $1 billion worth of revenue and to increase the pay of our nearly 3 million Federal employees somewhat closer to compara- bility with private industry. The pending amendment deals with the personal af- fairs of the House Members and the personal affairs of Members of the Sen- ate. It is a residual item, and I believe it could well wait until consideration of the legislative appropriation bill when we return, in January, February, or March, or it could be put on a supple- mental appropriation bill, where it belongs. Personally, I take none of this amount. I return it to the Federal Government, as I believe the distinguished Senator does. I believe that we would only be jeopar- dizing the final conference agreement if we were to include this amendment in the bill. We have been indulging in an exercise of futility, because I know the House position on the matter. I would not like to see the amendment encumber a bill that is so important to 3 millionfaithful employees who want this in-crease by Christmas. Practically everymatter in the bill has been resolved, andthis amendment would be impossible ofresolution in the conference. I yield such time as he may require tothe distinguished Senator from Texas.Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, Ihave no personal financial interest inthe outcome of the pending amendment,because, with more than 101/2 million people in my State, the stationery al-lowance is inadequate. I pay hundreds of dollars out of my own pocket each year for stationery after the allowance is used up, and we cut down on ourcommunication with our constituentsthe last few months before the June 30 end of each fiscal year. I should like to see the stationery al- lowance increased for the States with larger populations, at least those with a population of more than 10 million. I have been a member of the Commit- tee on Post Office and Civil Service for 10% years and have engaged in numer- ous conferences with the House, and I knbw that nothing inflames and aggra- vates the House Members more than our including an amendment to regulate the House allowance, -to regulate the way they live. Beginning at line 12, the amendment states what the House Members can do with their stationery allowance. When we go to conference and the House Members see that we have put in the bill an amendment to tell them what they can do with their stationery allow- ance, it is a gross aggravation to the House Members. With such an amend- ment by the Senate aimed at House Members, we have immediately aggra- vated the House Members and made the matter of a conference with the House more difficult. I see no reason for need- lessly slapping the House of Representa- tives in the face, and making the job of the Senate conferees with the House more difficult, by telling the House how they can spend their stationery money. I do not believe we should do it. I be- lieve that any amendment relating to the House stationery allowance should come from the House. We know that there will not be any agreement with the House if that Senate amendment at- tempting to regulate House expenditures is in the bill, because they regard it as a personal insult. They say that the Sen- ate has needlessly insulted them by tell- ing them that they cannot handle their stationery allowance properly. I believe that the amendment should be defeated, because, as the able distin- guished senior Senator from Oklahoma has pointed out, this is an important bill to 3 million Federal employees, to the 200 million Americans interested in the efficiency of the American Government, and to the 200 million Americans paying postage. No other bill considered in this session will affect more directly the pocketbook of every American. There is a tax bill, but some people are not in the income tax- paying bracket. There is a social security bill, but some people are not in the social security bracket. This postal bill affects every American, and the efficiency of Government service affects every Ameri-34220 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE can. There is a double effect on every American in this bill, and we should not clutter up the bill with something that raises friction between the two Houses when we go to conference. This amend- ment would be an impediment to com- pleting action on the bill this year. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, the longer we are delayed, the more we will have to slip the increase forward into next year. The estimate of the committee staff is that we would lose $17 million a week by postponing it. Mr. YARBOROUGH. How many mil- lions a week? Mr. MONRONEY. Seventeen million dollars a week. So if we stay in session and if we insist on our disagreement with the House, as the distinguished Senator from Delaware wants us to do, I can state now that the House will be adamant, as they always have been, and we will begin to lose, by this delay, $17 million a week, because of our failure to act. Also, it would delay over the holiday season the pay increases that the Federal employees so justly de- serve. This amendment would jeopardize the passage of the bill this year, and I do not believe it is worth the effort. I have supported the Senator's amend- ment when it was brought up in con- nection with the proper bill to accomplish his purposes. But I do not want a dead cat thrown into this bill at the last min- ute which will prevent us from com- pleting action on the bill before the new year. I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Tennessee. ORDER OF BUSINESS Mr. GORE. Mr. President, I ask unani- mous consent to address the Senate for 2 minutes as in the morning hour. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MON- TOYA in the chair). Without objection, it is so ordered. REFUSAL OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELA- TIONS Mr. GORE. Mr. President, I wish to read to the Senate a motion which I sub- mitted to the Senate Committee on For- eign Relations this morning. I requested that the motion be inscribed on the agenda of the committee for action in a subsequent session of the committee, and the committee acceded to my request. This is the motion: I move that the Chairman of the Commit- tee be instructed to communicate to the President of the United States the concern of the Committee about the breakdown in public communication between the Executive and the Senate which arises from the refusal of the Secretary of State to testify before the Committee in public session on United States policy in Southeast Asia. POSTAL REVENUE AND FEDERAL SALARY ACT OF 1967 The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill (H.R. 7977) to adjust certain postage rates, to adjust the rates of basic compensation for certain officersand employees in the Federal Govern- ment, and to regulate the mailing of pandering advertisements, and for other purposes. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may require to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey. Mr. WILLIAMS of New Jersey. Mr. President, it would be very easy for me to support the Senator from Delaware with respect to the pending amendment. It has been my practice to return my unused stationery allowance. It has not amounted to much, but I have done it. However, I shall vote against the amend- ment, because I do not wish this bill to be jeopardized in any way. I believe the Senator from Oklahoma has been elo- quent in his plea that if these matters are tied to the bill, we will experience difficulty in achieving agreement in con- ference. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres- ident, the argument has been made that this bill is not an appropriate vehicle on which to attach this proposal. Every- body says they are for it but that this is not the appropriate place. The same argument was made when I offered the amendment as a rider to the legislative appropriation bill. A point of order was made against it, and a two-thirds vote was required to override the point of order. I was told then that I should wait until the Senate had before it a legisla- tive bill. Such a bill is now before the Senate. Now, as to the argument that this proposal will delay the enactment of this bill beyond Christmas, I think that argu- ment is utterly ridiculous. That argument proceeds on the assumption that Mem- bers of the House of Representatives or Members of the Senate, rather than give up their right to kickbacks on the sta- tionery allowance, would kill a bill af- fecting a pay raise for 3 million employ- ees. I think that is an insult to the House of Representatives. The House of Repre- sentatives is not going to say, \"Either we keep our right to stationery kick- backs, or we will kill the bill.\" Mr. President, this amendment is in two sections. One section deals with the Senate and would require Senators to comply with the rules of automatically turning back whatever is remaining on expenses allowances. The second section deals with the House of Representatives and would impose the same requirement on them. If my friends on the other side of the aisle who spoke for the amendment, but who would vote against it, are so con- cerned about the House of Representa- tives, all they have to do is vote for the amendment, and, if our conferees in con- ference cannot persuade the conferees from the House of Representatives to accept all of the amendment, then they can keep that portion that deals with the Senate alone. The House of Representa- tives has repeatedly said they have no concern over what we do in the Senate. Therefore, let the Senate come back with the provision applicable to the Senate, and at least let us put our house in order. If we do not want to put our house in order let us not hide behind the cloak of placing responsibility upon the House ofRepresentatives. This is not the responsi- bility of the House of Representatives on this vote. We are doing the voting. If we are for the amendment let us vote for it. If we are against the amendment let us vote against it. If the conferees cannot retain all of the amendment then let us settle for that portion of the amendment which affects the Senate. If the amendment is returned from conference with only that portion which is applicable to the Senate I would ac- cept that portion without objection. As far as I am concerned, that eliminatesthat part of the argument. Mr. President, I am ready to vote. Ifthe Senator from Oklahoma is prepared to yield back the remainder of his time, I am ready to yield back the remainder of my time. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I shall yield back the remainder of my timein a moment. I still respect the Constitution of the United States and it provides that each House shall be in charge of its own rules. This is not an appropriation bill appro- priating x dollars for Senate use andx dollars for House use. This proposal is attached to a bill that affects not only the Senate and the House of Representa- tives jointly, but it also affects the execu- tive department, the legislative depart- ment, and a substantial number of civil- ian workers in our great military depart-ment. If Senators believe in orderly parlia- mentary procedure they would not jeop- ardize a bill that would be so effective by throwing in this \"dead cat.\" I have voted for this measure every time it has been before us in proper form. I have insisted on it in conference time and again. I do not know how long we are expected to penalize other people by holding out for this measure. The Sena- tor knows and I know that the House of Representatives is not going to accept it. Therefore, I ask that the amendment be defeated. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres- ident, this measure has been referred to as a \"dead cat.\" This bill before us was originally a postal increase bill, and later it became a salary increase bill, with the salary increase taking three times the revenue. It also embraces additional life insurance for Government workers. There are many provisions in the bill relating to various employees. To proceed on the premise that either Congress is going to insist on its right to take these annual kickbacks on the sta- tionery allowance or the bll will be de- feated, in my opinion, is placing a low estimation on the caliber of Congress. I have a far higher opinion of Congress than that. Certainly in connection with private industry Congress passes laws requiring every businessman in America to itemize on his tax returns his expense account in order to claim deductions. That ac- counting provision is now applicable to every American citizen except Members of Congress. Members of Congress should have an allowance for stationery, but that portion of the allowance that is not needed does not belong to us.34221 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATENovember 29, 1967 I say that we should extend to our- selves the same requirements imposed upon the 2 million employees who are not permitted the privilege of sticking their expense account money in their pockets. Mr. President, let Congress tell the American taxpayers that we are willing to live by the same rules. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back any time I have remaining. Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. MONRONEY. I yield. Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, I wish to call attention to section 46(a) of the Senate Manual which states: Commencing with the fiscal year 1964 and thereafter the allowance for stationery for each Senator and for the President of the Senate Shall be at the rate of $2,400 per annum. As Senators know, out of that allow- ance there is paid the cost for all sta- tionery, carbon paper, typing paper, mimeograph paper, pencils, ink, note- books, tablets and similar office supplies. There is provided, under that provision, $200 per month for a Senator to attempt to communicate with, in the case of my State, 10,700,000 people, and it is impos- sible to do it on a $200 a month allow- ance. Each year I use all of the allow- ance and in addition I pay hundreds of dollars out of my pocket. We scrounge through the office and find whatever pa- per and copy paper second sheets we can find to serve the purpose. We slow up communication to our constituents in the closing month of each fiscal year. Constituents write to us and say, \"You do not send out information on sub- jects.\" We have groups who are inter- ested in veterans benefits; they write and they say, \"Won't you please write to us and inform us of the provisions of veterans bill.\" The stationery allowance is wholly inadequate for a Senator to try to advise his constituents in a State such as mine, of pending legislation. Mr. President, I have no personal fi- nancial interest in the amendment. We have such a low allowance we cannot communicate with all of the people in my state. But I think the amendment harms the bill and is the wrong proposal at the wrong time. I think it clutters up the bill when we are all hoping to finish the bill this year. It is a very minor amendment which adversely affects a major piece of legislation, which we are anxious to get to the White House for signature. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I agree with the Senator from Texas that in large States the stationery allowance of $2,400 is not too large. If the amount is not sufficient to cover legitimate ex- penses, I would support an increase. I think the Government should underwrite the stationery allowance for all States. All I am saying is that to the extent any portion of the allowance is not needed or used for the purpose for which it is allowed, that amount does not be- long to Members of the Senate; it does belong to the Treasury and the Ameri- can taxpayer. I yield back the remainder of my time. Mr. MONRONEY. I yield back the re- mainder of my time.The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Delaware [Mr. WILLIAMS].

POSTAL REVENUE AND FEDERAL SALARY ACT OF 1967 The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill (H.R. 7977) to adjust certain postage rates, to adjust the rates of basic compensation for certain officers and employees in the Federal Government, and to regulate the mailing of pandering advertisements, and for other purposes. MOTION TO RECOMMIT WITH INSTRUCTIONS Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk and ask for its imme- diate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the motion. The assistant legislative clerk pro- ceeded to read the motion. Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, this mo- tion is offered in behalf of myself and the distinguished Senator from Delaware [Mr. WILLIAMS]. I ask unanimous consent that the read- ing of it be waived and that it be printed in the RECORD. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The motion is as follows: MOTION To RECOMMIT BY MR. CURTIS FOP. HIMSELF AND MR. WILLIAMS OF DELAWARE Mr. President, I move that the bill (H.R. 7977) to adjust certain postage rates, to ad- just the rates of basic compensation for cer- tain officers and employees in the Federal government, and to regulate the mailing of pandering advertisements, and for other pur- poses, be recommitted to the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, with instruc- tions to report the said bill back to the Senate as soon as practicable, with such amendments as may be necessary to provide for revision of increases in salary rates which are in excess of $8,000 per annum so that (1) no rate in excess of $10,000 will be in- creased, (2) no increase will cause any rate to exceed $10,000, and (3) increases in rates in excess of $8,000 but not in excess of $10,- 000 will, to the extent possible, reflect ap- propriate relationships between rates, until such time as- (1) the receipts of the government for the preceding fiscal year have exceeded the ex- penditures of the government for such year, as determined by the Bureau of the Budget; or (2) the budget submitted to the Congress by the President under the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921, reveals that estimated receipts of the government for the fiscal year for which the budget is submitted are in excess of the estimated expenditures of the government for such fiscal year. Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, each Member of the Senate will find a copy of this motion on his desk. I believe I can34222 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE explain it very briefly. It is not my pur- pose to have a prolonged debate on this subject. I can tell Senators very briefly what it does. It is in the nature of a motion to recommit, but it would not materially delay the consideration of the bill. I put the motion in this form because it might call for a rewriting of some of the tables and certain sections in the bill. But here is what the motion would do. If this motion to recommit is carried, the committee will report the bill back as soon as practicable, which I imagine would be in a few hours, providing that every Government employee who is paid $8,000 or less will get his pay raise as provided in the bill. It will also mean that those Government employees who receive $10,000 or more will have their pay raise deferred until the budget is balanced. Employees receiving between $8,000 and $10,000 will get part of their increase. In other words, there is a phasing in there. Adoption of the motion will mean that every worker, every letter carrier, all of the employees in the lower brackets, will be unaffected. They will get their pay raise. The distinguished chairman yesterday made an eloquent plea in behalf of the postal workers who are carrying the mail and will be doing such an unusual job this December. This motion will not in- terfere with their complete pay raise. The distinguished chairman has in- formed the Senate chat the median- paid Government employee receives $6,800. My motion provides that all those employees drawing $8,000 or less will get the full benefit of this bill according to its terms. Those who get $10,000 or more will have to wait until the budget is balanced. Those receiving between $8,000 and $10,000 will get part of their increase and will have to wait until the budget is balanced for the full increase. Mr. President, I do not need to remind this Chamber that we are at war. I do not need to remind this Chamber that we are facing the largest deficit of all time. I do not need to remind this Cham-= ber that the pressure is on to increase taxes. But there is something else involved. This would be the first time to my memory that we had ever offered an in- centive pay increase-I repeat, an in- centive pay increase. It would mean that all of the employees in the upper brackets in Government, if they did their little bit to balance the budget, would get a substantial pay increase at the end of the road, one in which the percentage was compounded, at least in the first two steps. It would mean that everybody in the bureaus who was dreaming up new schemes to expand his bureau would have an incentive to operate with re- straint. It would mean that every individ- ual who is in charge of purchasing sup- plies, who, when the end of the fiscal year comes along, spends all the money he can so he will not be cut next year, would have an incentive to operate with restraint, because if he did his part, there would be a substantial pay increase at the end of the road.Now, I do not wish to be misunder- stood. There are many dedicated public servants in our offices and in the bureaus elsewhere who, day in and day out, do all that they can to hold down the expenses of government. There are some who do not. There are people on Capitol Hill who, in order to expand their domains, are urging upon committees and subcommit- tees further action, further legislation to help them build a bigger empire. Let us give those people an incentive to do their part in balancing the budget. Mr. President, this motion to recommit is not a repudiation of the committee. I am not unaware of the long hours of painstaking work that have gone into this bill. It merely says that a part of its benefits shall be delayed until we balance the budget. How do we determine when the budget is balanced? We provide that these in- creases will be delayed until first, the re- ceipts of the Government for the pre- ceding fiscal year have exceeded the ex- penditures of the Government for such year, as determined by the Bureau of the Budget; or, second, the budget submitted to the Congress by the President under the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921, re- veals that estimated receipts of the Gov- ernment for the fiscal year for which the budget is submitted are in excess of the estimated expenditures of the Govern- ment for such fiscal year. Mr. President, a vote for this motion is a vote saying that we are not going to increase the salaries of those members of our own staffs who are in the upper brackets until we put our financial house in order. How much more do we want to happen in this country before we really get in earnest about saving money? We know what has happened to the English pound. We know what is hap- pening in the way of eroding the value of the dollar. The people of the country know about the rising cost of living, even if we do not. I beg of you, let us post- pone the pay increases for everyone who receives more than $10,000 a year until the budget is balanced, give the full pay increase for those who receive $8,000 or less, and a proportionate partial increase to those in the bracket in between. That is necessary in order that the plan work in an orderly fashion. Mr. President, we have passed many pay increase bills. We often provide a pay increase in stages, and then, before all the steps are taken, we have another pay increase added to it. Every time a pay increase bill comes before the Senate, there is an impas- sioned plea made in behalf of the \"person down below\"-though he draws more than most of the people back home draw in salary or income-the individual who makes less than $8,000, the individual who does the hard, manual work to carry on the burden of the Government. This motion, Mr. President, will take care of all of those people. Half of the employees of this Government draw less than $6,800; so more than half of them would be unaffected by this motion. It really comes down to this: Shall we, without restraint, increase the salary of every Government worker and official, in wartime, at the time of the highestdeficit in history, at a time when inflation is rampant? Many of us have reluctantly voted for some pay raises in the past because there were so many individuals who desperate- ly needed and deserved a raise. Here is our chance to apply the raise as provided in the bill for more than the lower one- half, from the standpoint of pay scales. It is also a chance for the Senate to rec- ognize that we are at war, that inflation is rampant, that the President of the United States-yes, and many of the people-are pressing upon Congress for a tax increase; and I believe that the vast majority of the people strongly favor a reduction in expenditures. The amount of money that this mo- tion would save is a small part of it. The great bureaucracy that we have abroad administering foreign aid is filled with officials who, wanting to see their empires maintained, keep recommending more programs, and programs are established and go forward in manners that are not carefully watched and controlled. Under this proposal, those officials and em- ployees would have an incentive to do better, because when they get the budget balanced, they will receive a pay increase. I expect an eloquent answer to what I have said here, in behalf of Government employees who feel they ought to have a pay raise, that we ought to be compa- rable with industry, and all this and that. I do not dispute that. All I say to my fellow Senators is, \"If you believe in such an argument, let us raise the money now, and not charge it to our children and our grandchildren.\" I have little respect for the individual who says, \"Oh, this is in the public in- terest; it must be done now,\" and then will not pay for it. If Senators believe that something is vital and important to good government, let us do it and pay for it, and not resort to looting the Treas- ury over and over again. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres- ident, will the Senator yield? Mr. CURTIS. I yield. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Is it not a fact that the Senator's motion would still extend to all Government employees receiving $8,000 and under all the bene- fits of the three-stage increase provided in the pending bill? Mr. CURTIS. That is true; and the other benefits are not dealt with in this motion at all. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. One fur- ther question. The only effect of the Sen- ator's motion is that those in the top bracket, those receiving $10,000 and over, those who are responsible for the administrative decisions and the man- agement of this Government, those who are responsible for the deficits and the vast spending programs, those making the policymaking decisions, would have the responsibility of putting our financial house in order; and then when that is done they, too, would receive the benefit of the increases pro- vided in this bill? Mr. CURTIS. That is correct. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. And until such time as those of us who are respon- sible for the policy decisions do cooperate CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 in putting our financial house in order, our salaries will not be raised and charged up to our grandchildren and the future generations? Mr. CURTIS. That is correct. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. President, I believe that adopting the principles embodied in the Senator's motion would have a wholesome effect far beyond the amount of dollars in- volved, because it would place a direct incentive before every policymaking offi- cial in the Government to try to reduce the cost of Government by eliminating waste in his department and other de- partments and to try to bring our Gov-ernment into an orderly fiscal position sothat not only would we have a balanced budget and some degree of financial san- ity in this country, which would help combat inflation, but at the same time,from purely selfish motives, they would be working hopefully toward the day when they could receive a salary increase. Until such time as that is done I do notthink any of us deserve a salary increase. Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, I thankthe distinguished Senator. So far as my memory serves me, thisis the first time the Senate will have hadan opportunity to vote for the principlethat everybody in Government drawinga salary of $10,000 or more will get a re- ward as soon as we balance the budget.I call attention, Mr. President, to thecost involved in paying the interest onthe national debt. This year the cost is $14.2 billion. When we stop to realize what we coulddo with $14.2 billion, we realize that wecould pay all the veterans' benefits andservices, all highway costs includinginterstate highways, all costs of civilfunctions of the Army Engineers, allcosts of the Bureau of Reclamation, andall costs of running Congress and thecourts, and still have money remainingfrom what the people have to pay ininterest on the national debt. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr.President, I notice from an item on thewire service outside the Senate Chamberthat the Secretary of the Treasury isnow testifying before the House Waysand Means Committee. He has advisedthat Committee that unless some actionis taken to bring the fiscal position ofthis Government under better control weare not just facing inflation in thefuture, but we have it now, and it willsoon be out of control. We are also advised that the interestcharges next year will be substantiallyhigher than they are even today. So Ithink it is mandatory upon this Congressto take some affirmative steps to startputting our house in order. This certainlyis the very minimum step that we cantake in that direction. Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, I thankthe Senator. I would like to have the attention ofthe committee members for one moment. The motion recognizes the great amount of detailed work that has gone into thepending bill and the dedication to thetask. It does not repudiate the judgment of the members of the committee. It merely injects the further principle thatwe will withhold putting this part of the measure into effect until our budget is balanced. I hope that no member of the com- mittee will rise to defend what the com- mittee has done and oppose the motion with any thought that it means to upset the work of the committee. It does not. The committee can report this matter back in a matter of hours. Mr. LAUSCHE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. CURTIS. I yield. Mr. LAUSCHE Mr. President, the Washington Daily News of a day or two ago published an editorial entitled \"De Gaulle and U.S. Dollar.\" It so precisely describes the plight of our country that I should like to read a part of it. It reads in part: One of the things about Gen. de Gaulle that grates on the nerves is that many of the things he says are true. When he says, as he did yesterday, that the American dollar is vulnerable and that it may go the way of the British pound sterling if the U.S. continues its economic and fiscal policies, he was drawing on histori- cal experience and applying common sense. Few of the modern-day world currencies have been devalued as often and as drasti- cally as the French franc, and always for the same reason-that France did not govern it- self with proper self-restraint. The British have been less irresponsible, so British devaluations have been less frequent and less drastic. America, in proportion to its vast resources, has been even less irresponsible than France or Britain. But if we continue to spend money we do not have, for things we are unwilling to tax ourselves to pay for, then the American dollar too will lose in value. Over the last 35 years, we have had the New Deal, the Square Deal, the New Frontier and the Great Society, all financed substan- tially on borrowed money. In the same period we have engaged in World War II, the Korean War and now the Vietnam War, likewise fi- nanced. In those 35 years, our national debt has risen from $19 billion to more than $340 billion. It all has to be paid for, either in taxes or in erosion of the purchasing power of the dollar. It used to be America's proud boast that \"the dollar rings true on every counter in the world.\" How true for how long depends on how we protect it-something that for the last generation we have not been doing. Mr. President, the article from which I have read in part concisely and ac- curately points out the path which we have been traveling, a path which, in my opinion, will inevitably lead to the de- valuation of the dollar or to such infla- tion that bank deposits of thrifty people, Government bonds, and retirement pay- ments vill be eroded to the point that the poor retired minister, schoolteacher, and worker will be robbed of everything that has been promised to him. It is easy to spend money. It is difficult to tax. What we are doing is urging a mad rush for spending. However, we are un- willing to impose taxes to provide the money with which to pay for the spend- ing. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that the editorial to which I have referred to be printed at this point in the RECORD.There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: [From the Washington Daily News, Nov. 28, 1967] DE GAULLE AND THE U.S. DOLLAR One of the things about Gen. de Gaullethat grates on the nerves is that many of the things he says are true. When he says, as he did yesterday, that the American dollar is vulnerable and that it may go the way of the British pound sterling if the U.S. continues its economic and fiscal policies, he was drawing on historical experi- ence and applying common sense. Few of the modern-day world currencies have been devalued as often and as drastically as the French franc, and always for the same reason-that France did not govern itself with proper self-restraint. The British have been less irresponsible, so British devaluations have been less fre- quent and less drastic. America, in proportion to its vast resources, has been even less irresponsible than France or Britain. But if we continue to spend money we do not have, for things we are un- willing to tax ourselves to pay for, then the American dollar too will lose in value. Over the last 35 years, we have had the New Deal, the Square Deal, the New Frontier and the Great Society, all financed sub- stantially on borrowed money. In the same period we have engaged in World War II, the Korean War and now the Vietnam War, likewise financed. In those 35 years, our national debt has risen from $19 billion to more than $340 billion. It all has to be paid for, either in taxes or in erosion of the pur- chasing power of the dollar. It used to be America's proud boast that \"the dollar rings true on every counter in the world.\" How true for how long depends on how we protect it-something that for the last generation we have not been doing. As for de Gaulle on other subjects- HE WAS LESS ACCURATE Elsewhere in his semi-annual press con- ference Gen. de Gaulle was much less mind- ful of history and common sense. He again encouraged independence for Canada's French-speaking Quebec province, a blatant interference in the internal affairs of a friendly country. He ordered Britain to overhaul its entire economy before attempt- ing entry into the European Common Mar- ket, an affiliation which would be profitable to both Britain and the Common Market. He claimed the Arab-Israeli War in June would not have occurred if the United States had not \"intervened\" in Vietnam, a wholly ficti- tious presumption. And altho the evidence runs to the con- trary, Gen. de Gaulle denied France had any- thing to do with the run on the British pound, which helped bring about the deval- uation, or that he was trying to undermine the dollar, which would be dangerous to France as well as the U.S. In trying to make gold (which France has been hoarding) the sole basis for Free World trade, Gen. de Gaulle also would disrupt the present basis of trade which by long-standing agreement stands jointly on gold, the dollar and the pound. One thing he grandly ignored, however, was an old item on the international books: France's debt to the United States dating back to World War I when the U.S. came to his country's rescue. That debt, with interest, now is more than $6.8 billion-and altho the U.S. has not insisted on repayment, the debt hasn't been waived, either. Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Ohio for his remarks.34224 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE As to the gloom expressed by that edi- torial, I should like to quote the words of the immortal Lincoln: As a nation of free men, we will live through all time or die by suicide. The most progressive suicidal tendency in this country so far as the Government is concerned is uncontrolled spending and debt. Mr. President, I am not condemning the dedicated, faithful, hard-working in- dividual in Government who makes more than $8,000 or $10,000 and who tries to save money. I daresay that all of those people want the budget balanced. This proposal will give a chance to all of them to work for a balanced budget. They would then get a handsome pay increase. At the same time, the motion provides for the pay increase worked out by the committee for everyone drawing under $8,000, and between $8,000 and $10,000 they will get part of the increase. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my motion. The yeas and nays were ordered. Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, I tem- porarily yield the floor. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, a parliamentary inquiry. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, is there a time limitation on the motion? The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limitation on the motion. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may require to the distinguished minority member of the committee, the Senator from Hawaii. Mr. FONG. Mr. President, the commit- tee has worked long and arduously on this bill, and it has produced a very fine bill. The amendment which has been presented by the Senator from Nebraska should be defeated. Why should we take it out on the poor Government employees to balance the budget? What have the Government em- ployees to do with the deficit we are now incurring? Federal employees are not re- sponsible for our governmental deficit. Why should we take it out on them? In 1962, we promised the Government employees that we would make their salaries comparable to those paid in private industry. This bill would give them comparability with private industry in 1969-7 years after we promised them comparability. We made this promise in the Federal Salary Reform Act of 1962, and because of the continuous annual Federal deficit, we have not been able to give them comparability. Now, we are attempting to give them comparability in three stages, so that by 1969 they will have comparability, based on the most up to date statistics available at that time. It is long past time for Congress to keep faith with our Federal employees and to keep faith with our promise to them. Looking at this amendment, I cannot see any reason for saying that an em- ployee who receives below $10,000 a year is entitled to his increase, that another employee who receives $10,001 should be deprived of the increase because we have not been able to balance thebudget; furthermore, that the employee who receives $10,001 will receive his in- crease after we have balanced the budget. We have not balanced the budget since 1960. We balanced the budget in 1956, 1957, and 1960, but for the past 7 years the budget has not been balanced. Since 1959, when I began my service in the Senate, I know of at least four pay raises we have given to Government em- ployees; and never yet have we said to one group of Government employees, \"Since you receive more than $10,000, we are going to hold up your increase; but if you receive less than $10,000, we are going to give you the increase.\" Why should we make fish of one and fowl of the other? We should treat all these dedicated Government employees equally and say that they all deserve a raise, in line with the comparability principles we voted in 1962. We should say, \"The Senate committee has gone into this matter thoroughly, we have re- ceived evidence from all sources, and we find that, salarywise, Government em- ployees are far below comparability with their counterparts in private industry.\" In fact, Federal employees who are receiving more than $10,000 a year in salary are now further from compa- rability than those who are receiving less than $10,000. In the lower grades we are very close to comparability, but in the higher grades we are 15 to 21 percent be- low comparability. I believe that the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Ne- braska is discriminatory and arbitrary, and I urge that my colleagues reject it. I helped write the comparability prin- ciple into the 1962 pay bill as a member of the Senate Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. I was convinced at that time that in all fairness Federal employees should be paid the same sal- aries paid for substantially equal work in private industry. This bill would reach that stage in 1969. The effect of this amendment would be to wipe out that possibility. Mr. President, as a member of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Serv- ice I wish to commend the chairman of the committee, the senior Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. MONRONEY , for his diligence in guiding the bill through the many long hours of public hearings and the days of executive committee sessions where we attempted to iron out the dif- ferences we had on the provisions con- tained in H.R. 7977. I wish also to com- mend the senior Senator from Kansas, [Mr. CARLSON], who is the ranking mi- nority member of the committee, and all other committee members for their counsel and guidance in working on this bill. Although this is an excellent bill, one which will raise much needed revenue for our Post Office Department and will also bring the salaries of almost 2 million Federal classified and postal employees closer to comparability with their counterparts in private industry, I do have a few reservations about certain specific provisions in both the postal rates and salary sections of this legislation. Under title II, Federal classified em- ployees will receive a 4.5-percent salaryincrease across the board effective Oc- tober 1, 1967. They will also receive addi- tional increases in July 1, 1968, and in July 1, 1969; the end result being the achievement of comparability with their fellow workers in private industry. Postal employees will receive a 6-per- cent increase effective October 1, 1967, an additional 5 percent on July 1, 1968 and whatever amount is necessary to bring them up to full comparability on July 1, 1969. The comparability principle voted by Congress in the Salary Reform Act of 1962 should be realized in 1969. During committee debate on the pay provisions of this bill I made a motion to increase the salaries of all Federal classified employees to 6 percent, effec- tive October 1, 1967, rather than the 4.5 percent voted by the House. This 6 per- cent is the same amount voted for the Federal postal employees. My motion was not adopted and I shall not make that motion here, because I think we have the best bill we can get at the present time. But I do serve notice that I shall monitor the actions of the agencies charged with executing the catchup pro- visions of this bill to insure that full comparability is reached for all Federal classified and postal employees by July 1, 1969. This is a matter in which our Fed- eral Government and the Congress must keep its pledge to these dedicated public servants. The fight to achieve salary compara- bility for Federal employees with their fellow workers in private industry has been a long, hard fight. It is not yet over, but by passing this bill with its three- stage increase, Congress will come as near as is presently possible to keeping its faith with the Federal employees. Realization of comparability can be seen on the horizon, and I urge the Sen- ate to pass this bill with its three-stage increase. Turning to the subject of postal rates, I believe the increase in air mail letter rates of 10 cents is too large. The present rate is 8 cents per ounce. Under the present rate the Post Office Department recovers 105 percent of the costs for handling air mail letters. The Post Office Department will be recovering 119 per- cent of the costs under the 10-cent rate. I proposed in committee that the new rate be nine cents-this was the rate recommended by the administration. However, my amendment did not carry in committee. I am pleased, however, with the language in the committee report on this bill, calling for the movement of first- class mail by the most expeditious means available. This action allows all first- class mail traveling long distances, such as between Hawaii and continental United States, to travel by air on a space available basis. I understand that all first-class mail traveling between Hawaii and the west coast now, is transported by air on a space available basis. I ask the distin- guished committee chairman whether mail traveling between the west coast gateway cities and major interior and east coast cities also is being airlifted on a space available basis. Mr. MONRONEY. I am happy to say to my distinguished friend, the Senator34225 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 from Hawaii, that, thanks to his en- thusiastic insistence upon the airlift, with the passage of this bill 99 percent of it will be airlifted between New York and the west coast, and beyond to Hawaii or to Alaska. I expect this to be almost 95 percent complete on movement of first- class mail between any points in the United States-and by that I mean the 50 United States, and not just the 48 contiguous States. As a result of the great effort by the Senator from Hawaii and his insistence that it is foolish to send first-class mail for Hawaii by railroad for a 5-day trip and then fly it for 3 hours to Hawaii, we have this provision in the bill. The Sena- tor's insistence upon the mail being air- lifted from New York to Los Angeles or Seattle or San Francisco, and dispatched onward, will be realized and achieved. Mr. FONG. This would mean that a letter with first class postage would be treated almost the same as an air mail letter? Mr. MONRONEY. That is correct. I read from the report: PRIORITY MAIL The Postmaster General is to be commend- ed for the actions he has taken this year to airlift first-class mail in order to improve postal service to American citizens in antici- pation of the increased rates of postage pro- vided in this bill. Earlier this year the Department began a vigorous program to provide airlift of first-class mail on a space- available basis when air was the most expe- ditious means of transportation available. This has resulted in substantial improve- ments in service, especially for first-class mail going relatively long distances. The amount of first-class mail being carried this year as of the end of September, compared with the same period last year, has increased 254 percent on the domestic trunklines and all cargo carriers and by an astounding 591 per- cent on the local service carriers. The Senator can be assured, with this giant movement from trains that no longer exist, that first-class mail will have priority handling and will fly from Washington, New York, or any other place in the contiguous United States to the gateways of Hawaii and Alaska and be airlifted on both ends of the trip. Mr. FONG. I thank the Senator. Mr. MONRONEY. The insistence of the Senator has been of great help in achieving this superior service. Mr. FONG. I thank the Senator for his kind remarks. He has been very in- strumental in obtaining first-class by airlift as far as possible. Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield so that I may make a unanimous-consent request? Mr. FONG. I yield. UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclu- sion of the Senator's remarks, there be a time limitation of 20 minutes on the pending motion, the time to be equally divided between the Senator from Okla- homa [Mr. MONRONEYI, the manager of the bill, and the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. CURTIS], the initiator of the mo- tion. Mr. CURTIS. How much time?Mr. MANSFIELD. Ten minutes on each side. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MANSFIELD. I thank the Senator for yielding. Mr. FONG. Mr. President, this type of mail service is essential to the people of Hawaii. Correspondence with our fam- ilies, friends, and business associates on continental United States must be trans- ported as quickly as possible. We have a long tradition of using air mail service because of our insularity. However, I also believe that the people in Hawaii and those in other comparatively isolated places served predominantly by air, should also have an alternative mail service in view of the increased airmail rates being enacted. The Senate Post Office and Civil Serv- ice Committee report on H.R. 7977 pre- sents an excellent alternative, one which the Post Office Department has already instituted on certain mail routes. I urge that the Committee on Post Of- fice and Civil Service stay in close touch with the Post Office Department to monitor the movement of first-class mail by air on a space-available basis. This is a service that is sorely needed by our postal patrons and I commend the com- mittee for its position in this matter. During the hearings on the third-class rate provisions of this bill I was impressed by the argument of the third-class mail users that the per-piece rate for third- class regular bulk mail under the House bill would impose a severe burden too soon on them. Under the House bill the per-piece rate for such mail would be increased by 32 percent on January 7, 1968. Such an increase in one fell swoop on these mail business houses would be drastic. I believe that if such an increase is to be imposed it should be phased in over 3 years-this is the same treatment given second-class mailers of newspapers and certain other publications. The Sen- ate committee voted to increase this rate by an additional two-tenths of a cent, but phased in over a 2-year period. I am still convinced that this increase should be held at the House level of 3.8 cents and phased in over 3 years. I be- lieve this group of mail users provides a real service to the American public and as an employer of hundreds of thousands of Americans its position should not be jeopardized by such a drastic increase in such a short period of time. A reasonable adjustment period in line with other sec- tions of the bill would be to phase the increase in over 3 years. Again, I commend the chairman for his hard work on this legislation, and the distinguished ranking minority mem- ber, the senior Senator from Kansas [Mr. CARLSON] for his counsel during our deliberations. I urge that the Senate and House act quickly on the bill so that it can be sent to the President as soon as possible. Mr. President, now that we are on a time limitation, I ask that my comments on \"Magazines as the Melding Force in Democracy\" be printed in the RECORD at this point.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The views presented by Mr. FONG are as follows: MAGAZINES AS THE MELDING FORCE IN DEMOCRACY The power of Congress to legislate postal rates is one we should exercise with ever-in- creasing care and deliberation. Because of the concepts of the postal serv- ice since Colonial times, and because of the manner in which Congress has used its postal rate making power, we have made the United States the greatest nation of com- municators in history. Insofar as we can, we should keep it that way. In testimony on the bill pending to raise mail rates, the Postmaster General reportsthat with six per cent of the world's popula- tion, this country originates and distributes more than one-half of the world's mall. In the 10 years through 1966, the mail volume rose from 56 billion to 76 billion pieces of mall. It will be more than 82 billion in the next fiscal year and will top 100 billion pieces In 1976. Our wise postal policies through the dec- ades have encouraged this growth in the use of the mails. We have many tangible as- sets of great value as a result. Despite some congestion and delay, our first class mallservice Is the finest in the world, consider- ing its load and geographic reach. We have a healthy newspaper publishing industry serving local and regional areaswith information, opinion and entertain- ment. We have a truly national press in themagazine publishing Industry which servesthe broad range of all our interests as anation. We have a prosperous multi-billiondollar direct mail and parcel post Industrythat contributes substantially to our eco-nomic development. I would like to speak particularly to thedevelopment of American magazines as a truenational press, filling a need and function-ing In a manner not duplicated in any othernation at any time. Each of us must have a number of cur-rent magazines on our desks right now, forinformation, Interpretation, or reference. We may get two or three general interest magazines at home, perhaps one or two business publications, a farm journal, fra- ternal magazine, a religious periodical. We know our wives read homemaker, fashion, and garden magazines, maybe one or two others of special interest to them. And our children get one or two magazines edited for their particular interests. The chances are that almost all of these magazines reach us at home or office through the mail. Many people, when discussing magazines, tend to think of the dozen or so whose names are household words, whose circula- tions run into millions, whose advertising revenues are very large. These are the gen- eral circulation magazines, but the major- ity of our magazines are comparatively small, specialized magazines which have great meaning to selective and significant audiences, which in total account for mil- lions of readers, most of them people of purpose and with Influence on the cultural, economic and political course of the country. These are magazines of contemporary thought, religion, science, farm, industry, fashion, news, travel, business, music and arts, home service, homemaking, children and youth, sports and outdoors, special in- terest to women and many more. Their audiences are men and women of decision, leaders who make the news, ob- servers of public affairs, students of eco- nomics, citizens in search of political en- lightenment; audiences of farmers, follow-34226 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE ers of a religion, parents in search of better ways to rear their children, newlyweds creat- ing homes and families. And remember this highly significant point. These audiences are distributed throughout the breadth and length of this land, in every state-truly national audiences served by a truly national press, the maga- zines. While the magazine industry is a mirror of American life, it is also a highly com- petitive business. A periodical must find and retain an audience or it cannot survive. It must meet the payroll to continue. There have been a number of famous failures that can be recalled to mind, among them Col- lier's and Coronet. The tastes of the public change. Advertisers are most reluctant to part with their promotion dollars, and a pub- lisher is in competition with a myriad of counter attractions when he seeks to per- suade a reader to invest his money in a subscription. A magazine must find a place in the life of its readers or die a premature death. Even the most popular magazines, with a vast national audience, must keep coming up with stimulating editorial mate- rial or the race is lost. Periodical circulation has continued to rise as the population increased, as techno- logical developments and industrial diversifi- cation created new audiences for specialized business and professional publications, and as a more affluent and leisured society pro- vided new markets for magazines serving a wide range of cultural and recreational interests. Continued improvement in editorial qual- ity, better design and vigorous promotion have enabled periodicals to increase circula- tion despite competition for the reader's time from television, inexpensive marketed paperbound books, and various other types of leisure activity. The periodicals' share of the advertising dollar has been gradually shrinking although receipts from advertising have steadily in- creased. About 47 per cent of total national advertising expenditures in 1966 went into television and its share may grow as the use of color increases. This total was up 4.4 per cent while magazines share went down 3.6 per cent in the 1962-1966 period. The power of Congress to legislate postal rates is one we should exercise with ever- increasing care and deliberation. We have exercised this power from the birth of our nation to encourage communications. We have seen a healthy vigorous magazine pub- lishing industry develop under these policies of encouragement-an industry which de- pends upon the Post Office for distributibn of three billion copies of product annually. So postal rates are an important item of cost. In sum, we are talking here about a de- cision of considerable economic import, and, considering the political and philosophic value of an independent press, one of un- measured-and probably immeasurable- consequences. A low rate of postage for periodical pub- lications disseminating ideas to the reading public has contributed tremendously to our American mass education. Magazines are a major factor in unifica- tion of the nation, a great melding force to work the will of the electorate, the will of a majority of the people. They are part of our national press. Our great responsibility is to see that we do not stifle it, but act wisely that its continued growth may be fostered for our own strength and progress, and for the generations to come. Mr. CARLSON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. FONG. I yield. Mr. CARLSON. Mr. President, I do not believe we are on a time limitation until the conclusion of the Senator's statement.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator is correct. Mr. CARLSON. Mr. President, as a member of the minority and as a Sena- tor who has served on the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service ever since my entrance into the Senate, which is some 18 years ago, I commend the distin- guished Senator from Hawaii for his out- standing work in the field of service to the Federal workers of this Nation, the postal employees, the classified workers, and the other people who are interested in our governmental operations. I know of no one who has made a more dedicated effort in this field in behalf of our pub- lic servants, the Federal workers of this Nation, than has the Senator from Hawaii. He has devoted much energy in trying to secure improved salaries for Federal workers based on comparability, and time and time again he has worked for their best interests. I express my appreciation to the Sena- tor from Hawaii. It has been a pleasure to work with him. Mr. FONG. I thank the distinguished senior Senator from Kansas for his kind remarks. The Senator from Kansas has been in the forefront to obtain compara- bility for Federal employees, and many of the fine features of this bill and the provisions dealing with postal rates and Government employees are the result of the excellent thinking and the fine work of the Senator from Kansas. Federal postal, classified, and other employees have no finer friend in Congress than my colleague, who is the ranking minority member of the Senate Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, Senator CARLSON. It has been my pleasure to work with him, and the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend and col- league. Mr. President, a parliamentary inquiry. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. INOUYE in the chair). The Senator will state it. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, will the Chair be good enough to tell me whether the time limitation is 20 min- utes, with 10 minutes on each side? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator is correct. Each side has 10 minutes. Mr. MONRONEY. I thank the Chair. That applies on this matter. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator is correct. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, if someone started out to find a way to wreck the efficiency of the U.S. Govern- ment here and abroad he could not have dreamed up a better way to do it than to produce a motion of the kind produced by the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. CURTIS] and the Senator from Delaware [Mr. WILLIAMS]. This bill does take care of a large num- ber of well deserving employees. These are the faithful postal employees, 90 per- cent of whom are below the $8,000 pro- vided ir. this bill. Those employees who receive $8,000 would receive the benefits of the 6 percent increase we are provid- ing in this bill. Above that level there are the super- visors, the men who must plan and de- sign the mail schemes, those who makecontracts with railroads and airlines, those who run all of the executive de- partments of the Post Office, all of whom would be denied any increase whatsoever. Mr. President, under the amendment, it would be possible and probable that men who have menial tasks-and this would benefit them almost solely-would be able to go above their supervisors in salary, and those who have already reached above $8,000 in salary would see their subordinates in menial capaci- ties paid more than they are. Ninety percent of the postal employees are below the $8,000 figure. Those who serve in a supervisory capacity, or an executive capacity, those who plan the entire $8 billion system, would have no increase whatsoever. Although the de- gree of comparability with private in- dustry is high at the extreme low level, it goes down in comparability to 75 per- cent or 80 percent in the management- type position. This measure puts the emphasis in that area where we have the greatest difficulty in recruiting and keeping com- petent Federal employees. If there is any way to save money, anyone who has studied high school economics will tell you that it is good management. I do not see how we can have good manage- ment if we are paying less than the man across the street is paying. Ninety percent of GS employees are paid below $8,000. The others are their supervisors, directors, and planners, and the specialists in all agencies of inter- state commerce. I respect and admire the lower level menial employees and I want to see them rewarded in a pay increase, but this increase cannot be denied to manage- ment. We are losing those who are in man- agement now because of the inadequate pay and lack of adequate promotional opportunity. How much is going to be saved by this proposal? We are not go- ing to save all that it is thought will be saved because of the large percentage of employees below the $8,000 grade. There will be saved, according to the committee statistics that were given us, if we cut all above $8,000, only $68 million a year out of $500 million in the pay bill. We would sacrifice the incentives necessary to preserve management and the skills that are necessary. Do Senators think they could hire a doctor or keep a doctor, and-we have to have thousands of them in our Vet- erans' Administration, Public Health Service and of various facilities-unless they receive a pay increase, when the medical orderly below them would be getting a raise? Do we think we will be able to employ and keep nurses? That is probably the greatest shortage we have. No nurse above the beginning salary today is paid under $8,000. So these great ladies who care for the wounded and come back after discharge from the military hos- pitals where they are military personnel, cannot be hired. Certainly they are not going to stay, as much as they love Government work, when the hospital down the street, or in some other city, is paying the going rate. We are already having great difficulty on that.34227 34228 CO: We will not hire any dentists, because they are above that salary. We will not be able to keep them. We are having trouble keeping air traf- fic control experts. They are all paid above $8,000. Certainly, these men are necessary. The FBI is going to be ashamed to see its agents leaving for better jobs, being unable to compete in the promotional op- portunities with supervisors at the lowest level of the FBI. We are not going to be able to keep any researchers in the billion-dollar en- terprises of research and all the things we do there. Engineers cannot be hired for $8,000, so the men we have are going to move on because there are ample oppor- tunities elsewhere in those fields. Scientists, supervisors, test training pilots who go along with certifying train- ing programs and checking out the pilots at the airlines, we will not be able to hire them. We will eliminate by necessity all the top level of congressional offices. Mr. President, judge for yourself, we can keep the boy in the folding room by giving him a raise, and we can keep the elevator operator by giving him a raise; yet the most effective and efficient administra- tive assistants, the personal secretaries, the girls on whom we so much depend for the efficiency of our office work, are all paid better than $8,000 a year in order to get the kind of talent we need. They will all be hired away from us down- town or hired by others. This is an amendment which puts the emphasis on the wrong syllable. We do not save the money that it says we have. The best way to do it, if we gentle- men wish to effect it, is to tear out the whole section on pay increases. Let us not say that because the votes are over here in the great numbers of postal em- ployees-90 percent of the votes are at the lowest level, \"Let's go for broke, boys. To hell with the efficiency of the U.S. Government.\" In this time of crisis, I do not believe even though we do have a difficult time with the budget, that we want to destroy and kill off our management and man- agement opportunities. I have never seen anything that would work as inequitably, which would put the management of the various depart- ments of Government in the position of having their subordinates paid more than they are. I do not see how anyone can think we can keep a man in the Federal employment at that rate. I do not know how anyone could have thought this through properly. I do not know how anyone could expect we could get a bill if we are going to have to crank all this junk into it. The bill was considered for 4 long months in the House and for 2 months in the Senate. I do not know anyone who knows more about this subject than the minority member on the committee, the Senator from Kansas [Mr. CARLSON], who has made such a great contribution to this bill. Mr. CARLSON. Mr. President, I con- cur in the statement just made by the distinguished chairman, the Senator from Oklahoma.NGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE This is absolutely the wrong way to deal with the Federal employment picture. It is also unfair. It is based on the 1966 Bureau of Labor Statistics salary survey on what the actual salaries were in 1960 prior to the enactment of the compara- bility principle, which shows that the sal- aries of classified Federal employees lagged behind by 2.3 percent in GS-3; 4.3 percent in GS-15. In 1962, we adopted the comparability principle. The pending bill is trying to carry out that principle. As the distinguished chairman stated, it is most fair to close up the gap be- cause they are further behind in com- parability. As I mentioned, in GS-3 it was 2.3 percent behind; in GS-15, 4.3 percent in GS-7, 6.6 percent; in GS-9, 9.3 percent; GS-11, is 10.3 percent behind. Therefore, I sincerely hope that all Senators will consider this proposal seriously, and reject the motion. Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Kansas yield? Mr. CARLSON. I am happy to yield to the Senator from California. Mr. MURPHY. Do those figures in- clude the so-called fringe benefits, such as insurance, and all other benefits that are important in comparing salaries in government with those in private indus- try? Mr. CARLSON. These are considered on a salary basis only. They do not in- clude fringe benefits. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Oklahoma is recognized for 1 minute. Mr. MONRONEY. Let me say to my distinguished colleague from California, who represents a most progressive State in a most progressive way, that the fringe benefits are much less today in Govern- ment than they were. They used to be much superior. But on insurance and re- tirement, they do not match the equiva- lents of outside employment today. The salary level there, as to the total cost of the bill or the total cost of the salary level we have quoted, adds $38 million for insurance benefits to the total. That is provided in the last title. Mr. MURPHY. In other words, a com- parison of the fringe benefits would be on approximately the same percentage basis as a comparison of the actual total figure; is that not correct? Mr. MONRONEY. That is correct. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Oklahoma has ex- pired. Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Nebraska is recognized for 1 minute. Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, I listened with much interest to what the distin- guished chairman had to say. I should like to say that during World War II there were pay raises greatly favoring the lower paid workers. Today, we are at war. The dollar is im- periled. We have the highest deficit in our history.November 29, 1967 Now it is being said that this would save only a few million dollars. Mr. President, that is not true. If we go on record of having no payincreases over these upper brackets until we balance the budget, then I believethat we will get a balanced budget. The eloquent Senator from Hawaii [Mr. FONG] pointed out that we havenot had a balanced budget since 1960,but we have added four pay raises. One of the virtues of this thing is that it is an incentive. It will not hurt re- search. It will see that the money vested in research is conserved, that we willthen be able to get a balanced budget, and then we shall be able to put on a pay increase. Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, will the Senator from Nebraska yield? Mr. CURTIS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from South Carolina is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to thank the distinguished and able Senator from Nebraska. I am in favor of the motion being made by the able Senator from Nebraska. We are going to have a deficit this year of somewhere between $18 billion to $30 billion. In view of the fact that we are at war now, it seems to me that the only sensible course to pursue would be to fol- low the course of economy and retrench- ment. I realize that this is not a popular course to take. I realize that the Senate many not see fit to adopt this motion. However, it is the right course. It is the honest course. It is the course which is best for the people of this country. It is the course of sound fiscal policy. It is the course that this country needs to take in order to bring some semblance of soundness to the fiscal policies of this Nation. Mr. President, our national debt today is almost $344 billion. By the end of this fiscal year it has been estimated that it will go to between $345 billion and $350 billion. The ceiling now is $358 billion. The annual interest on the national debt is approximately $14 billion per year. The Federal Government has balanced its books only six times in the past 37 years. How much longer are we going to wait? When are we going to start balancing our books? When do we begin to think about the people back home who pay the bills? Of course I am sympathetic to Gov- ernment workers. I have the utmost re- spect for them. They are dedicated and hard-working people. At the same time, I emphasize that we are now at war, that we are facing a def- icit of between $18 billion and $30 bil- lion this year alone. I believe that our Government workers at the top salary levels would be willing to delay a pay raise. This will enable those with salaries of $8,000 or less to get their increase. Those receiving above $10,000 will get it when the budget is balanced. I think that fact alone will have a tremendous moral sua- sion, because human nature is human nature. I believe when those in some November 29, 1967CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE high positions in Government know they are not going to get a raise until the budget is in balance, they will help bal- ance the budget. It should be balanced. I do not know of anything that is more important for the preservation of the country, other than maintaining a strong military establishment, than maintain- ing a strong economy. We cannot main- tain a strong economy if we are spending more than we are taking in. That is what our country has been doing for many years. Our Government cannot continue to operate on this basis indefinitely. No business can operate in this fashion and neither can the government of any country. I hope the Senate will adopt the mo- tion offered by the distinguished Sena- tor from Nebraska, as I feel it is sound. It offers us a course that will be in the best interests of the people in the long run. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. THURMOND. I yield. Mr. MONRONEY. Since the military pay bill follows the civilian pay bill in pattern, does the Senator feel we should increase the pay of captains so they will be earning more than majors? Mr. THURMOND. I do not think that is applicable. In fact, I do not think now is the time to raise the salaries of Con- gressmen or any Government employees. Mr. MONRONEY. Not even the mili- tary? Mr. THURMOND. If the Congress raises the salaries for civilian employees, I would feel free to vote to raise military salaries, because the military raises have always lagged behind the civilian raises.I have been here 13 years, and I believe there have been between eight and 10 raises for civilian employees. I do not be- grudge any of those raises, but these raises should be delayed while a war is going on. How much longer does the Senator from Oklahoma feel we can continue to raise salaries while we are running un- balanced budgets? Mr. MONRONEY. This would affect only $68 million out of $500 million, but it would disturb the balance in the exeC- utive pay scale. My question still is, Since the military pay bill follows the same pattern as the civilian pay bill, should we fix the sal-aries of captains above that of majors? Mr. THURMOND. I do not object to raising the lower grade officers' salaries in a larger proportion if that is the ques-tion. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator's time has expired. Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, how much time do I have left? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes. Mr. CURTIS. The committee's argu- ment on this point is just plain foolish- ness. It is not proposed to pay a captain more than a major. The reason we have a phasing out bracket between $8,000 and $10,000 is to prevent that very thing from happening. The employees receiving under $8,000 will get the raise. Those receiving over $10,000 will have to wait until the budg-et is balanced. Those receiving salariesin between those two will get part of the raise. Mr. President, I would not downgrade this committee and say that they could not work that out equitably. Of course they could. We do not have the time, but I would challenge Senators to put the question up to their people back home: Should Government employees drawing more than $10,000 receive a pay increase while the budget is unbalanced? Senators know they will say they should not. Those of us who served during World War II saw pay increases. I remember one that was $300 a year for everybody, whether someone was in the $25,000 bracket-of course, it was not that high then, but the highest bracket-or was the lowest paid worker. It is not unusual to do this in wartime. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. CURTIS. I yield. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I call to the attention of the Senate that there is a precedent for such action, and it can be done. After World War II, the former Senator from Virginia, Harry Byrd, made a similar motion to a similar pay bill in the Senate. It was adopted; the committee took the bill back, and the provision was embraced in the bill. If the Senator will yield further, I might add that after that action the budget was soon balanced. Mr. CURTIS. If a pay increase were withheld from every Federal employee getting over $10,000 until the budget was balanced, we would get a balanced budget; but as long as we defend the principle that has been prevailing all through these years of never balancing the budget, and always increasing pay, it will go on that way. Now, I will accept- The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator's time has expired. The question is on the motion of the Senator from Ne- braska to recommit with instructions. The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. BYRD of West Virginia.

Mr. President, I send to the desk a unanimous-consent request and ask that it be stated. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the unanimous-consent re- quest. The legislative clerk read the unani- mous-consent request, as follows: Ordered, That, effective during the further consideration of the bill, H.R. 7977, the so- called Civilian Pay Raise Act, but exclusive of the previous agreements of the Senator from Delaware [Mr. WrmIAas] numbered 469 and 472, debate on any amendment, mo- tion, or appeal, except a motion to lay on the table, shall be limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided and controlled by the mover of any such amendment or motion and the senior Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. MON- RONEY]: Provided, That in the event the senior Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. MON- RONEY] is in favor of any such amendment or motion, the time in opposition thereto shall be controlled by the minority leader or some Senator designated by him: Pro- vided further, That no amendment that is not germane to the provisions of the said bill shall be received. Ordered further, That on the question of the final passage of the said bill debate shall be limited to 2 hours and 15 minutes to be equally divided and controlled, respectively, by the majority and minority leaders: Pro- vided, That the said leaders, or either of of them, may, from the time under their control on the passage of the said bill, allot additional time to any Senator during the consideration of any amendment, motion, or appeal. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered. CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, if I can make one addendum to that request, the distinguished Senator from Maine [Mrs. SMITH] has indicated that she will offer an amendment. I ask unanimous consent that there be a time limitation of one-half hour on her amendment, the time to be equally divided between the distinguished Sen- ator from Maine [Mrs. SMITH] and the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. MONRONEY], and that prior to the time starting, there be a live quorum call. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The unanimous-consent agreement, without objection, will be printed in the RECORD. The unanimous-consent agreement, ordered to be printed in the RECORD, reads as follows: UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT Ordered, That, effective during the fur- ther consideration of the bill, H.R. 7977, the so-called Civilian Pay Raise Act, debate on any amendment, motion, or appeal (except two amendments to be offered by the Sena- tor from Delaware [Mr. WILLIAMS], Nos. 469 and 472, on which there is to be 40 minutes of debate, and one by Mrs. SMITH, on which there is to be 30 minutes of debate), except a motion to lay on the table, shall be limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided and con- trolled by the mover of any such amend- ment or motion and the senior Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. MONRONEY] : Provided, That in the event the senior Senator from Okla- homa [Mr. MONRONEY] is in favor of any such amendment or motion, the time in op- position thereto shall be controlled by the minority leader or some Senator designated by him: Provided further, That no amend- ment that is not germane to the provisions of the said bill shall be received.

Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I address myself to the merits of the bill, and I hope that Senators present will listen. Title III of the pending bill relates to the prohibition of pandering advertise- ments. Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, may we have order? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator will suspend. The Senate will be in order. The Senator may proceed. Mr. JAVITS. The committee has not extensively discussed this title in relation to the bill, and I think it is a matter of considerable importance as it represents basic constitutional rights. Mr. President, first with respect to the pay raise itself as it is contained in the pending bill, the action of the House and now by the Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committees in approving a postal pay increase for the Nation's faithful postal employees is at last be- ginning to redeem the promise of com- parability with private employment is most gratifying. Approval of this bill is truly an opportunity to implement thepay comparability principle which has been adoted as settled policy by the Con- gress. I have long been a devoted advocate of adequate salaries for postal workers. This is basic justice by the Federal Govern- ment to those who are among its most de- voted workers. All too frequently there is substantial inequity in the wage level of Federal employees, and particularly pos- tal workers, as comparability to that for equivalent job skills of those working in private employment. I feel that the Fed- eral Government has a clear responsi- bility to give enlightened and modem leadership to compensation and condi- tions of work throughout the Nation in justice to its own personnel. The com- mittee already recognizes that Post Office employees cannot go into business for themselves, their only opportunity is jus- tice from Congress and the United States. I feel that we can at long last begin to deal with the matter of a postal raise in the pending bill. As I come from an area where that is a matter of very critical consideration with many of the largest mailers in the Nation being located there, I feel it is the responsibility of Congress to see that the Post Office Department is operated at maximum efficiency and the lowest practicable cost to the Government and to the users of the mails. Some subsidy undoubtedly continues to be needed and justified for types of mail worthy of pub- lic subvention, but the overall deficit is unacceptable without a detailed review of mail rates and, if necessary, adjust- ment to keep the deficit within manage- able proportions. Legislation which imposes higher taxes or increases Government service charges must always be weighed carefully. The Post Office Department has stated that the postal deficit is responsible for almost half of the total increase in the national debt. Fiscal responsibility is essential to a healthy economy, and I must in good conscience support legislation judged necessary to maintain it. Mr. President, I am very much pleased, also on the matter of the postal raise provision of the pending bill, to note that the alleged discriminatory postal sur- charge on periodicals with a circulation of 500,000 or more has been eliminated by the Senate bill and that the proposed rate increase of an alleged disproportion- ate 60 percent on fourth-class bulk mail, on sound recordings especially, has also been eliminated by the Senate commit- tee. I hope very much that, as the Senate passes the bill in its present form, this will be maintained in conference. Mr. President, it is claimed with re- spect to rates that there is very strong discrimination in rates as against the rates for controlled circulation publica- tions. There are not many of those pub- lications, perhaps not more than four or five, the main publication being from the Reuben Donnelly Co. Mr. President, it was claimed on the part of those mailers that the bill im- poses a 280-percent rate increase on them over a 3-year period. The Senate com- mittee claims that it recommends only a 20-percent increase.Mr. President, we ought to see whetherthis works out onerously, and we ought tobe prepared to give these publications some relief if, in fact, their great fearson the subject are realized, as they say,either by conforming to the aspects ofmore suitable mailing rates or by amend-ment to the pending bill, should that be deemed to be required, depending uponhow the matter eventuates. Mr. President, on the main point which I wish to discuss, title III of the bill puts, in effect, a rather unique question of how to deal with a problem which has been widely complained about by mil- lions of parents. That concerns the mail- ing to them or to their children or to their homes of material which is, to use the words of the committee and the words of the bill, \"erotically arousing or sexually provocative.\" This is a rather new catechism and it differs from the language of the court decisions and existing statutes on the subject which bar only obscene material from the mail. The scheme of the bill is that the citi- zen notifies the Post Office to order the sender to discontinue the sending of such material to him. The Post Office Depart- ment then notifies the sender to take that person off the mailing list. If the sender does not do so, then the Post Office Department may move in court for a cease and desist order against that sender to compel him to do so. The difficulty is that the bill requires no finding on the part of either the Post- master General or the court that the material is actually \"erotically arousing or sexually provocative.\" All that is needed is for the sender to say so, and that is the end of that. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, may I ex- plain my point? I am very anxious to have a colloquy with the Senator. I be- lieve that it will be very important. This is the point at which we bring into conflict two constitutional rights- the constitutional right of the addressee to privacy under the fourth amendment, and the constitutional right of the sender to free speech under the first amendment. The thing that I am troubled about in the constitutional realm is that the courts may very well find that, even if an addressee does not want the material sent to him, the prevailing policy of the country requires that the sender has the presumptive right to use the mails. He can throw it in the wastepaper basket when it is received if he wants to. The analogy is, interestingly enough, a political one. Senator MONRONEY is a Democrat and I am a Republican. In 1946, when I ran for public office in a strongly Democratic district in Manhat- tan, in New York City, I knew that many people there did not want to receive any mail from a Republican and would not stop to hear him on a street corner. But some of them, who happened, by acci- dent, to be caught where they had to hear me or were caught where they had to read, were persuaded, much to their sur- prise; and that was a very valuable con- stitutional right which I had as a candidate.34230 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE The real constitutional difficulty in this title is that no finding is required, not even a finding that the test of the bill is actually being met-to wit, that the material is \"erotically arousing or sex- ually provocative.\" I believe that is a very important element. Mr. President, I have given consider- able thought to whether or not an amendment should be offered to title 3 which would require such a finding. But my consideration led me to believe that if that were done, it would erect such a complicated structure of hearings and determinations and trial examiners, and so forth-it would invite bureaucracy and litigation-that the practical aspects of the matter would be better handled by leaving the matter to the courts; be- cause I do not believe the cases will be many, and I believe that they will be re- solved better by the legal processes of the judiciary. However, in view of that determina- tion, I believe it is important that the legislative history of the bill before the Senate clearly deal with the subject, show that we considered it, show that at least one Senator raised the issue of consti- tutionality, and the rights of the sender as well as the addressee. As a Senator representing all the people, I am very sympathetic to the addressee. I am a father myself. Our youngest child is 12, and I feel strongly about this matter on constitutional and on personal grounds. However, I am also aware, as a Sena- tor, of the necessity for protecting the constitutional rights of all the people, including the senders. One of the ge- niuses of our society is that we are often compelled-by the fact that there but for the grace of God am I-to protect those who might be doing things that we might like the least. I believe that a fair balance will be held if it is made clear that in my judg- ment, as a lawyer and as a Senator, the courts will require that the material be substantively of the type that meets the test of this bill, which, I repeat, in this connection, is the test of being \"eroti- cally arousing or sexually provocative.\" Mr. President, to the extent that thit bill creates that test, I believe it is valid, notwithstanding the fact that there may be some doubt, from the leading cases, the so-called Roth case, which is found in 354 U.S. Reports, and the Ginsberg case, a later case, as to whether this de- scription-to wit, erotically arousing or sexually provocative-is actually what the courts have held to be barrable from the mails as obscene. I believe that the courts will require that the material actually be erotically arousing or sexually provocative and will not let the matter go solely upon the fact that the addressee says it is. I believe that will be the way in which the courts will resolve the dilemma-rather than try to erect an elaborate structure of bureaucracy to hear and consider these matters and to make findings and to in- vite litigation on that score. Practically, it will work out just as well if we leave the matter to the courts, this statement having been made by at least one Sen- ator on the floor of the Senate. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I am glad to have this discussion, particularlywith an attorney who is so thoroughly versed in constitutional law and so aware of civil rights protected by the Bill of Rights. The testimony with reference to this matter was taken from several sources. We spent much time on it. We had the advice of the Justice Department. Mr. Wozencraft testified for the Justice De- partment, and I believe his comments are persuasive. He said: In 1951 the Supreme Court upheld an ordinance barring all kinds of door-to-door solicitation throughout a community. The Court there stated: \"Freedom of expression or press does not mean that one can talk or distribute where, when, and how one chooses. Rights other than those of the advocates are involved.\" Thus, the right of a city to bar door- to-door solicitation in a community was sustained by the Court at that time. Mr. Wozencraft continued, on the same page: The CHAIRMAN. This comes under first- class mail and there is no way you can tell the content of the first-class mail until you have opened it. Therefore, you have allowed the invasion of the homeowner to that extent. Mr. WOZENCRAFT. That is true, if there is no label on the envelope. It is also true that it is difficult to tell what is going to come up next on the television set. You have to see it for a second before you decide to turn it off. That is about what you can do on throwing away the mail, but there is that problem, certainly. The crucial question, I think, posed by this bill or any bill in this field is whether the first amendment permits one person to cut off the right of another to send him through the postal system matter which vio- lates no objective standard but is offensive to him. After listening to all the testimony, a majority of the committee decided that the right of privacy provided a home- owner by the Fourth Amendment was controlling; that we have a right to mail this matter to him, but cannot repeated- ly do so if the man finds it objectionable and, in the language of the bill, deter- mines it is erotically arousing or sexually provocative. This is the language we put in the bill. By no means do I think that anyone-I repeat, anyone-except the boxholder, in his home, has any control over what the latter considers objection- able. He could go to the postmaster and say, \"This is objectionable to me because of it being erotically stimulating,\" and so forth. It does not have to be. He can say, \"Cabbage incites me, and I do not want any more cabbage direct mail delivered to my home.\" I believe that the court would find, under the language of the bill, that he is the sole judge; and the processes set forth by this amendment, which is identical to that of the House, would be that no one could question his right of privacy because he objects to this type of mail coming from the sender. He protests, so the sender is notified, and then the provisions of the bill go into op- eration, as ably described by the Senator. I believe the matter will have to go through a Supreme Court test. I am sure it will have to be tested. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Mr. MONRONEY. I yield 5 additional minutes to the Senator from New York.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 5 additional minutes. Mr. MONRONEY. As the committee understood the matter, and as the testi- mony was revealed in a full morning's hearing, the fourth amendment would prevail. With respect to the test con- tained in the bill, if the addressee de- clared it to be erotically arousing or sexually provocative, the Postmaster General would have to notify the sender to send no more mail to that address, and the cease and desist processes, if he suc- ceeded, would prevail. I grant the Senator that only the Su- preme Court is going to finally decidethe matter. I think this is a very helpful discussion by way of legislative history to the bill. Mr. JAVITS. I am grateful to my friend, the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. CASE. Mr. President, will theSenator yield? Mr. JAVITS. I am afraid that I am going to be caught in a time dilemma. I wish to ask the manager of the bill about the time. I wish to yield to the distin- guished Senator from New Jersey. I could send an amendment to the desk if that would simplify the matter. Mr. MONRONEY. That is not neces- sary. Mr. JAVITS. I yield to the Senator from New Jersey. Mr. CASE. Mr. President, I appreciate the consideration of the leadership. I think this is a matter of very great im- portance, and I believe that a little dis- cussion on the floor of the Senate beyondthat which has already taken place might be helpful, in addition to the help we have already gotten from the initiative of the Senator from New York and the very thoughtful response of the Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. President, there is a very large question here. The balance of the right of privacy, the right of self-expression, and freedom of speech is something we are dealing with and should deal with in a very careful way. Would the Senator from New York agree in substance that what we come down to here is the committee's viewthat the right to close the door to aparticular sender is absolute on the part of the home owner or addressee? Mr. JAVITS. The committee finds that is a superior right to the right of the sender to send something. I wish to call attention to the testi- mony of Mr. Wozencraft. He dealt with the right of the homeowner, which in- volves a right far more sacred than the mails, and that is trespass. Mr. Wozencraft had this to say on the same page: The courts have neither answered this question nor clearly foreshadowed what their answer will be. I am trying to suggest a technique by which the Postmaster General and the courts can enforce this law and not run afoul of the civil liberties of the citi- zens involved. That technique would bethat somewhere and somehow in the courts there would have to be a substan- tive finding that the material was actual- ly, in accordance with the law, erotically34231 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 arousing or sexually provocative; and that the court would accept findings of fact that that is the kind of material which should be legitimately barred from the mail under the Constitution. I agree that should be implemented by the courts as if it were the courts' definition. Mr. CASE. The Senator would, I take it, require that the decision by the court ought to be required to be made after due process before the bar on the mail- ing. Mr. JAVITS. That is an interesting point because there is no penalty on the sender if he resists the notice of the cease and desist order. I think he would even have the right to enjoin the Post- master General if he were given such a notice. When I found there was no penalty on the sender, that a refusal to obey the order is no crime, I felt it better to leave this matter to the courts than to re- work the bill, especially since I am sym- pathetic to the bill. Mr. MONRONEY. I think it would be in order to place further excerpts in the RECORD from the testimony of Mr. Wozencraft. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Mr. CARLSON. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator. Mr. MONRONEY. I thank the Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. HART in the chair). The Senator is recognized. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. Wozencraft further testified: The courts have neither answered this question nor clearly forshadowed what their answer will be. There remains a practical question. The CHAIRMAN. This is the guts of the issue, isn't it- Mr. WOZENCRAFr. Yes, sir; it is. The CHAIRMAN (continuing). The way the bill Is drafted and the rights conferred upon the individual to say, \"I don't want this type of mail delivery\"? Mr. WOZENCRAFT. Yes, sir. The CHAIRMAN. You don't make a test of whether It Is pandering or not. You don't make a test of whether it is sexually provoca- tive or erotic but you just say, \"I don't want it for these reasons,\" but no official Is allowed to go behind those reasons or to even question whether they are legitimate or germane or not. Therefore, you are giving in fact the right of an individual for the first time, I believe, to say he does not wish the stuff delivered at his door and certain steps by the Federal Government will be taken to back him up in his determination that it will be not delivered to him. Is that a correct summation? Mr. WOZENCRATr. Exactly correct, sir. Mr. President, that is the view of the Justice Department on the question which the Senator is so ably discussing. Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I con- clude by saying that I think we have very materially demonstrated that we are cognizant of the issue, which is very important to the courts. When we pass the bill, we will be cognizant of the issues and there are at least some suggestions as to how the issues could be met. Personally, I believe that this is the best way to get at the problem. If I did not, and if I thought it would be better and wiser to establish a form of bureau- cratic control, I would do so.Mr. President, it is my conviction that we are better off this way making the record very clear and posing the issue to the courts and leaving it to them to work out practically. I am willing to let the matter proceed on this record. Mr. HRUSKA. Mr. President, I call particular attention to title III of the pending bill because it represents re- markable progress in the battle against smut and filth in the mails. I am happy to say that title III was in- troduced as an amendment to H.R. 7977 by my capable colleague, Representative GLENN CUNNINGHAM. This was no spur-of-the-moment ac- tion on the part of the Representative from the Second District of Nebraska. For many years he has been a leader in the fight to protect society from obscene and pornographic material which has been circulating through the mails in ever-increasing amounts. I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate and commend him for his persistent efforts in this field. Over the years, many measures have been introduced both in the House and in the Senate to protect the law-abiding citizen from unwanted obscenities; how- ever, our efforts have not met with suc- cess. Each of us receives ever-increasing numbers of complaints from outraged constituents concerning this problem. With the rights of the law-abiding citizen in mind, Representative CUNNING- HAM introduced bills in the 88th and 89th Congresses which would enable the ad- dressee to put a stop to unsolicited mail- ings of pornographic material. Both bills passed the House; however, time did not allow Senate action. This year, Representative CUNNINGHAM introduced H.R. 426, which is substan- tially similar to his earlier bills. This Senator had the pleasure of introducing S. 926, as a companion measure to the House bill. The House Post Office and Civil Service Committee incorporated Mr. CUNNING- HAM'S bill into and made it a separate title of H.R. 7977, and the committee action was thereafter endorsed by the House when it passed H.R. 7977. Title III provides for an individual ap- proach to the problem of obscene mail- ings. We are all aware of the personal judgments of what is or what is not ob- scene, and of the problem of applying one standard for all persons. The cry of censorship is raised when- ever an attempt is made to protect the citizen from the encroachment of obscen- ity upon his right to privacy. Title III will avoid the censorship ar- gument since it meets the problem in a direct and responsible way without at- tempting to establish broad standards applicable to all persons. Title III would allow the recipient of obscene mail to return it to the Post- master General with a request that the Postmaster General notify the sender to stop mailings to the addressee or mem- bers of his household. If after 30 days from the date of the notice to the sender, the Postmaster General believes that the sender is still sending such mail to the complainant in violation of the notice, a complaint is mailed to the sender and heis given the opportunity for a hearing. Ifthe Postmaster General then finds thatthe sender is violating the order, he mayrequest the Attorney General to apply foran order of the appropriate Federal dis-trict court to enforce compliance. Viola- tion of the court order would be punish- able by contempt of court proceedings. This bill does not establish a Federal censor, but rather leaves the question of what type of material a citizen receives up to him. If he wants to receive obscen- ity, that is fine. However, this bill would allow the citizen to make this choice. Title III achieves an effective and equitable balance between the sometimes conflicting free speech rights of the deal- ers in pornography and the right of pri- vacy of the individual. It is time that parents and other in- dividuals have the protection from the unwanted filth that is sent through the mails. On page 38 of the committee's report, the following statement is found: The Committee is convinced that no user of the mail has the right to force upon an unwilling recipient the type of mail matter covered by Title III and that the U.S. Post Office is not required to act as the instru- mentality by which a mail user, over the ob- jection of the recipient, invades the home and mailbox of a citizen. I salute the distinguished chairman and the member of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee for coming to grips with this problem. I urge that all Senators support title III, so that the dealers in filth and ob- scenity will know exactly where they stand with the U.S. Congress. ORDER OF BUSINESS Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed for an additional 2 minutes without re- gard to the rule of germaneness. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. TURKISH-GREEK CONFRONTATION OVER CYPRUS Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I have just returned from the 13th Annual Confer- ence of the North Atlantic Assembly at Brussels where I was elected chairman of its political committee. Much discussion centered on the present crisis in Cyprus. For 3 years I have headed the Special Committee for the Less-Developed NATO Countries of the NATO Parliamentarians' Conference-now North Atlantic Assem- bly-seeking to establish economic co- operation between Greece and Turkey. Our work, which has been financed by the Ford Foundation as well as by other foundations, corporations and individ- uals and by two foundations in the Ger- man Federal Republic, Thuyssen and Volkswagen, has concentrated upon the possibilities of establishing a major land reclamation and irrigation project on the Thracian border between Turkey and Greece along the Meric-Evros River- perhaps even a TVA. Our work has also included cooperation between the public and private sectors of both countries on tourism, fisheries and the marketing of34232 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE fruits and other agricultural products. The project has had the most sympa- thetic consideration by the U.S. State De- partment and by the President and has had the backing of the NATO countries. The work has gone very well and is most promising for both countries. It is a dis- tinct setback to the hopes of the peoples of both countries whenever this work is interrupted. Now, following the political unsettle- ment in Greece, there is a threat of war between Greece and Turkey over Cyprus. I have made it an article of faith in my relations with both governments to con- fine my activities to the economic par- ticipation to which I have referred; how- ever, war would be such a disaster for all concerned as well as for the hopes for this project, that I must speak out now. NATO simply cannot permit a conflict between Greece and Turkey over Cyprus. It would shred the very fabric of NATO, gravely imperil its southern flank, and undermine the security of all Western Europe. In addition, it would dash the hopes, built so greatly upon the tradition of the Venezelos-Ataturk accord con- summated 40 years ago, for the economic cooperation project which I have de- scribed From my contacts with the govern- ments concerned-with Premier Demirel, Foreign Minister Caglayangil of Turkey and with their predecessors as well as with the successive Prime Ministers of Greece under parliamentary govern- ment-no one recognizes better than I the profundity of the issues involved over Cyprus. Deep and sincere feelings have been aroused, there has been blood- shed and peril. It is my profound convic- tion that the course being pursued to attain the peace is the right one; that is, an effort to lessen the tension created by the presence of armed forces by phasing them out to bring about a period of tran- quillity. In such a period conditions may be restored for a new national determina- tion as to the future constitutional status of Cyprus and its Turkish minority, while at the same time obeying democratic principles by relying upon the ultimate mandate of the people as to the future of Cyprus as a democracy. Tranquillity, and citizens' participation under condi- tions of tranquillity are the best answer, always remembering that in any free society basic inalienable rights as in the U.S. Constitution's Bill of Rights are guaranteed to all citizens as individuals and as members of a group. As I believe the efforts of the Secretary General of NATO, Manlio Brozio, the representative of U.N. Secretary Gen- eral U Thant, Mr. Rolz-Bennett, and the representative of the United States, Cyrus Vance, are being directed toward these objectives, I rise today to express the hope as the respective governments proceed to a peaceful solution that they will have support and respect in their mission and the confidence in their good faith from the people of Turkey and Greece, which they deserve and which those whom they represent deserve. To the ancient and proud peoples of both Greece and Turkey, I speak in the name of my friendship and respect for them and my service in their interest, that reason prevail over passion andthat the courage of forbearance be greater than the courage of the battle- field. All will gain from the success of the peaceful negotiations and from a withdrawal of contending forces, leaving the main peacekeeping role to the U.N. Security Force. All will lose by recourse to violence. I ask of both peoples of Greece and Turkey, from their friend-and I am their friend, as they well know-as they have done in the past, to their eternal credit, to stand back of peace. THE RECENT ANTICS OF PRESIDENT DE GAULLE OF FRANCE Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. Pres- ident, I yield myself 5 minutes on the bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from West Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. Pres- :dent, the antics of President Charles de Gaulle of France never cease to amaze me. But I think he outdid even himself this week in the attack he made on the United States, Great Britain, and Can- ada, and in his call for devaluation of the dollar and a return to the gold stand- ard. It is incredible to me that a man who exists in such a dream world can actually be the head of a modern state. The dollar will remain unchanged by anything De Gaulle can say or anything that he can do, for his delusions of grandeur have no substance. There has been no rally of gold speculators against the dollar, as he obviously had hoped there would be. There has been no rush to follow his leadership. On the contrary, the reaction to his words has been one of anger, of pity, and of silence. In his own country, French news- papers have led an outraged attack upon his willful irresponsibility and distor- tions of reality. In the United States his words have not even been dignified by the White House or the State Depart- ment. But I do not think it amiss, Mr. Presi- dent, for a member of this body to rise to express his dismay at the mischief that has been done, or attempts to be done by this deluded man. Charles de Gaulle has created an artificial chasm between France and this country that should not exist, for our two nations have been natural allies since France helped us gain our own independence. As a result of that strong friendship, Mr. President, the Armed Forces of the United States, twice in this century, have rescued France from defeat and disaster. The people of this country felt that they owed a debt of gratitude to the nation that aided us in our infancy, a debt that should be repaid. It is obvious, Mr. Presi- dent, that President de Gaulle-this vainglorious man whose return to power was made possible by the Allied liberation of France in World War II-shares no such feeling of gratefulness for the aid given his country. We do not seek gratitude, of course. But how ridiculous De Gaulle's postur- ings, how offensive to the Americans who stormed the Normandy beaches in 1943 to free Prance from the Nazi occu- pation, how disillusioning to the men ofan earlier generation who turned the Germans back at Chateau-Thierry and St. Mihiel to save France in World War I. The glory that was France would be nothing but a hollow dream had the United States not sent its sons to pull France from oblivion in two world wars. And today America is again sending her sons into Southeast Asia to fill the vacuum created there when a bankrupt France pulled out after its defeat in Vietnam-a defeat that would be re- peated in an American defeat if De Gaulle could only have his way. De Gaulle, of course, knows these things. Perhaps they are what rankle him. Mr. President, France owes the United States $6.850 billion in unpaid debts from World War I. This is an obligation on which the interest mounts each year. But there has been no move on the part of Charles de Gaulle, the man who would restore the glory of France, to talk about repayment of this debt. It has been suggested from time to time, Mr. President, that the United States should demand payment of this debt, which has gone unpaid now for more than 40 years. Perhaps this is unrealistic. But I can see no good reason, in view of the cir- cumstances that President de Gaulle himself has created, not to make the de- mand. French assets in this country might also be frozen, as has also been suggested, to back up the call for pay- ment. Charles de Gaulle has clearly shown that he is not a friend of the United States. I do not see any reason why this Government should continue to treat him with kid gloves. If Charles de Gaulle is as serious about returning to the past as his lofty talk about such things as restoring Frenchnationalism and returning to the gold standard would indicate, let him prepare then also to shoulder France's rightful responsibilities as well as flaunt its fancied glory. Let France pay its debt to the UnitedStates of America. America has pulled the chestnuts of France out of the fire twice in this century. Let De Gaulle remember. MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT- APPROVAL OF JOINT RESOLUTION Messages in writing from the President of the United States were communicated to the Senate by Mr. Jones, one of his secretaries, and he announced that on November 28, 1967, the President had approved and signed the joint resolution (S.J. Res. 26) designating February 1968 as \"American History Month.\" EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED As in executive session, The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be- fore the Senate messages from the Presi- dent of the United States submitting sundry nominations, which were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary. (For nominations this day received, see the end of Senate proceedings.)34233 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 EXPANDING THE ROLE OF MEDICAL UNIVERSITIES Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, more and more Americans are becoming aware that, if our country is to meet its chang- ing and growing domestic problems, its universities must be given and must as- sume an expanded role of serving the larger community. In no field of concern is this more true than in the field of health. We in Okla- homa, therefore, have been very proud of the plans and activities of the Uni- versity of Oklahoma Medical School under the distinguished leadership of its dean, Dr. James L. Dennis, M.D. A recent article by him entitled \"The Role of the Medical School in Health Care in Oklahoma,\" which was published in the October 30, 1967, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Asso- ciation, speaks eloquently of the evolving relationships between the University of Oklahoma Medical Center and its State community. Dr. Dennis writes that: The mission of the medical center is to serve mankind (society). Believing that it will be of interest and value to other Senators, I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: THE ROLE OF THE MEDICAL SCHOOL IN HEALTH CARE IN OKLAHOMA-A CASE STUDY (By James J. Dennis, M.D.) The broad and diverse activities associated with a modern university school of medicine are commonly described under the term \"medical center.\" I have been asked to pre- sent a \"case study\" of the evolving relation- ships of the University of Oklahoma Medical Center to its state community. CASE PRESENTATION In the fall of 1964, I was introduced to the problems of this 50-year-old \"institutional patient.\" Using the traditional medical ap- proach, I would describe the case as follows: Chief Complaint.-Anxiety, fatigue, loneli- ness, and a sense of having been abandoned by the parent community. Present Illness.-The present illness ap- pears to have had its onset about 15 years ago, when a full-time clinical faculty began to replace the voluntary faculty. Although this transition appears to have been accomplished with a minimum of sibling rivalry, this was at least partially due to an almost passive withdrawal from any major consideration that might have precipitated an abrasive con- frontation with practicing physicians. The peace and comfort of isolation was at the price of a loss of communication with the parent community. In spite of minimum local support, the patient, thrived and grew for some time, largely because of an explosion of scientific knowledge that had permitted a talented faculty to attract impressive federal support for categorical efforts in research. During the same period of time, as elsewhere. new knowledge and technology had generated an acceleration in the numbers of physicians who chose to enter one of the specialties, with a concommitant decline in those choos- ing to enter family or general practice. The social impact of these developments has been aggravated by a significant shift of popula- tion from rural to urban centers. A shortage of physicians and health services in small communities and rural areas had caused rural citizens, who no longer had family doc-tors, to complain to their \"family legisla- tors.\" The responses of a rurally dominated legislature were less than adequate. Many citizens, many legislators, and even many physicians attributed all health serv- ice deficits to trends in medical education. The medical center was accused of overem- phasizing specialization, downgrading family medicine, and of devoting its interest and energies to research with \"teachers who do not teach.\" The fact that these allegations represented false conclusions, based on as- sumptions, did not alter the reality of a per- vading public attitude, an attitude that seemed to preclude the development of an environment essential to stability and normal growth and development. History.-The most pertinent aspect of the past is the status of the university hospitals, built 50 years ago as \"indigent and charity\" institutions. Although long since designated teaching hospitals, the indigent image re- mained, hence there had been few real rela- tionships with the average citizen and none with the more influential and affluential citizens, who regarded the hospitals as a place where their tax dollars were siphoned off to support welfare patients. In effect, the state's only university medical center had never been able to develop meaningful rela- tions with a great majority of people who compose the parent community. Diagnostic Impressions.-These include (1) parent (community) deprivation syn- drome, (2) latent sibling rivalry, (3) malnu- trition, (4) isolation, withdrawal, and fail- ure to perform at the level of capabilities. Prognosis.-Prognosis is excellent; poten- tials are great. A loyal core faculty requires only parent community support to perform at exemplary levels of excellence. This is de- pendent, however, on their ability to reestab- lish rapport with the parent community and with professional siblings. RECOMMENDATIONS When faced by such vexing problems, it is time to return to fundamentals. What is the purpose of the school of medicine and its related activities? I posed this question to a few prominent citizens, state officials, stu- dents, and faculty members. Except for fac- ulty and some students, all expressed a myopic opinion that the school existed for one reason, \"to produce practicing physi- cians.\" The faculty was more idealistic, but less precise. Many referred to such familiar cliches as \"the pursuit of excellence\" and \"education, research, and service.\" The com- fortable and simple statements were thought- fully reviewed. Research and perhaps education may con- stitute goals in themselves for certain in- dividuals, e.g., the pure scientist and directors of educational programs. For the parent in- stitution, however, education and research represent functions, not goals. It is possible to teach and to search on an uncharted course. After much deliberation, we came up with the following concepts: The mission of the medical center is to serve mankind (society) ; this is to be accomplished by fulfilling aca- demic and medical-social responsibilities. Our academic responsibility is to nurture an environment of excellence in biomedical education and research, hence, contribute to the advancement and the communication of knowledge and technology in biomedical sicences. Our medical-social responsibility is to conduct academic affairs in harmony with the needs, expectations, and goals of our society. We proposed that this be accom- plished by (1) an increased sensitivity to the primacy of obligations to our students and to the dignity of our patients; (2) the pre- vention of obsolescence in trained health personnel by planned continuity in the trans- mission of new knowledge and technology to the state community; (3) to develop pro- grams designed to meet public needs by theapplication of the principles of investigation to the growing problems of the health care system; (4) the evolution of pilot programs concerned with the synthesis, demonstration, and exploration of improved methods for the delivery of health care and the development of health manpower; and (5) coordination and cooperation with the private and public sectors of the health professions in the pur-suit of our common goals. To pursue these goals in a role of consultative leadership, asservants-not master, and with a contrived avoidance of commitments that might in- volve the faculty in the delivery of mass health services to the public. In spite of assurances that our actions were to be governed by a primary concern with the need to preserve the integrity of private prac- tice on the one hand and the sanctity of aca- demic excellence on the other, these propos- als posed threats to practitioners and to fac- ulty alike. Practitioners were certain of a diabolical scheme to encroach on private practice, and some faculty were terrified at the thought that they might become in- volved in the delivery of mass health serv- ices. Academic freedoms and freedoms of practice are both precious trusts, but they are privileges-and both can be lost if we fail to work together in a constructive an- ticipation of the needs and expectations of a demanding public. Having recognized a responsibility to ex- amine institutional academic efforts in rela- tion to the needs of our state society, we then established the position of associate dean of planning and development and engaged the consultative services of Lester Gorsllne and Associates, professional medical center plan- ners. Long-range plans based on intramural functions, needs, and goals have evolved and are being coordinated with plans that relate to extramural medical-social responsibilities. If we are to relate to needs, the identifica- tion of needs becomes elementary. Even a cursory preliminary examination indicated critical deficits and a maldistribution of health manpower in Oklahoma. The shortage of physicians is probably the least of these. Others include dentists, dental hygienists and assistants, therapists, technologists, techni- cians, nurses, psychologists, admin- istrators, dietitians, medical-social workers- in fact, all kinds of allied health personnel. Since the university medical center is the \"fountain head\" for the production of these people, our challenge seemed very clear. With these \"blueprints\" for action, we were ready to approach the formidable prob- lem of enlisting the active support of faculty, influential citizens, and our professional col- leagues. Our approach was based on the philosophy that Oklahoma's growing health needs could only be met by the combined efforts of our citizens, our practicing pro- fession, our private hospitals, our local, state, and federal health agencies, and the uni- versity's medical center. Such a mutual effort is possible only if the medical center will re- late its efforts to the state community's needs and provide the leadership essential for the mobilization of public support. In conformity with this philosophy, we proposed a new concept for the redevelop- ment of the medical center as a comprehen- sive Oklahoma health center in which the university facilities would provide the core programs but would be only one of the many separately governed private and public in- stitutions, hence meaningful to all segments of our state society. From the beginning, there was the obvious necessity to mobilize, rather than further divide, the potential strengths of our phy- sicians, faculty, health departments, com- munity hospitals, voluntary agencies, gov- ernment agencies, and our most influential citizenry. We envision the Oklahoma health center as one which will accept the medical- social responsibility of relating education,34234 November 29, 1967 CON training, research, and service programs to statewide needs. COORDINATION To coordinate the Oklahoma health center and to insure broad goals and a continuing \"public conscience\" we proposed that an \"umbrella\" nonprofit corporation, comprised of \"blue ribbon\" citizens representing every section of the state be formed to provide a coordinating body for the greater Oklahoma health center. The success of this approach became assured when 40 of the state's lead- ing citizens agreed to establish the coordi- nating \"umbrella\" body for the projected multi-institutional health center, incorpo- rating as the Oklahoma Health Science Foun- dation. The goals of the foundation are many but can succinctly be described as follows: to at- tract, encourage, and assist private and pub- lic institutions and agencies related to the public health, health science education, bio- medical research, and exemplary patient care to locate in a functional relationship to the University of Oklahoma Medical Center, ac- cording to a master plan, and in so doing to encourage a \"unity of diversity\" in efforts to meet the health-science manpower needs of all the people of Oklahoma. Such a proposal could be expected to create acute anxieties in the faculty as well as in physicians in practice. For different reasons, both have justifiable fears that in assuming broad community responsibilities the medi- cal center would become a primary source for the dispensation of mass health services. To the academician this would pose the threats of a dilution of his educational and research interests, would necessarily obstruct what the academician likes to call \"the pur- suit of excellence.\" To the physician, the program suggested just one more encroach- ment on private practice. These things can- not be permitted to happen. Surely academic excellence is not incompatible with medical- social responsibility nor with the private practice of medicine. We projected the basic concept that the medical center effort would be confined to leadership in the development of improved methods of care, extension and application of new knowledge and technol- ogy, and in assistance to community hospitals in their efforts to gird up their own pro- grams for the production of health man- power. We approached the physicians of our state with an invitation to join with us in a mutual effort \"to serve the health needs of our people,\" knowing full well that any physician worthy of his name would react to such a charge in a manner appropriate'to the best interests of the public, provided he be given the opportunity to say \"yes,\" that he not be forced to submit to unilateral planning, that he Is not humiliated and that his professional rights and code of ethics are respected. They have responded in an in- telligent, responsible, and positive manner. The physicians of Oklahoma may con- servatively be \"conservative.\" Their reactions have convinced me that those who plan and administer health programs can more readily accomplish their goals if they will provide a more thoughtful and empathic consideration for the physicians who must deliver the services. How did we approach the faculty? In the same manner, with an appeal for an exami- nation of our activities in relation to \"the needs of our people.\" With full assurances for the protection of academic goals, we moved into position to assume a meaningful role in our state community. At the present time, the Presbyterian, and Mercy Hospitals, two major private hos- pitals, the Oklahoma State Department of Public Health, the Oklahoma county and city health departments, the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, the Veterans CXIII-- 2156--Part 25GRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE Administration Hospital, and all of the many University medical center facilities are com- mitted to locate in geographic proximity to this cooperative effort. All institutions will affiliate in educational, training, and research programs. Interinstitutional affairs are re- solved horizontally in the \"operations com- mittee,\" composed of the administrative heads of each participating institution. This committee has agreed to study the feasibility of the many central services that could be utilized in common. These services include such things as a single power and utility plant, one laundry, parking and grounds maintenance, library and computer facilities, emergency room, selected laboratory fa- cilities, and about 20 other possibilities. The central services will be built by the nonprofit \"umbrella\" citizens group, who compose the Oklahoma Health Science Foundation. This arrangement provides great economy in capital expenditures to the center's institu- tions. The day-to-day interinstitutional prob- lems, as well as coordinated planning for thehealth center, are responsibilities of the operations committee. Problems are resolved horizontally. Once concensus is achieved, the individual members take recommendations to their respective governing boards and to the health science foundation for final ap- proval. If nothing else has been accomplished, these efforts have produced unprecedented unity of spirit and an understanding that bodes well for the future. It has already produced a change in the image of the pro-fession in the state. NEW PROGRAMS The university is developing several pro- grams that have great appeal to the public and to physicians alike. These include the following: 1. A new division of family medicine, apilot program to explore and evaluate thecontents of family medicine. This activity will be housed in a separate and especially designed model community clinic that ispurposely located separately from the uni- versity clinics. Trainees in family medicine will not rotate through the traditional serv- ices, but will, when indicated, go with their patient in whatever service is required-if surgery, they will \"scrub up.\" When the pa-tient requires a specialty consultation, thetrainee must make the appointment in the appropriate specialty clinic as he would in practice, then accompany the patient, hence learn from the consultation. This arrange- ment does not disrupt the traditional uni- versity specialty clinics and rotations, and has been welcomed by the faculty. If a trainee wishes extra training in a specialty area, he will have opportunities in elective times later in his training. He will make house calls and will be exposed to the busi- ness aspects of a practice. Practicing \"fam- ily doctors\" will staff the family medicine clinic under the direction of a full time director. 2. Project responsibility, a pilot program in rural health will relate to the family medi- cine program, described in detail in THE JoURNAL of the American Medical Associa- tion (197:339 [Aug 1] 1966). The objective is to meet a major medical social responsibility by (a) exploration of methods for making rural practice of scien- tific medicine attractive to young physicians; (b) the evaluation of health service and health science personnel needs in rural areas (Oklahoma); (c) the development of a pilot health program based on needs (analogous to the agricultural experiment station concept), a utilization of a group practice-commu- nity health clinic in a rural setting as a base for the study and improvement of methods in the packaging and delivery of34235 health services; (d) the utilization of such a program to assist in the development of curriculum, training, and applied research in family medicine, the provision of medical school leadership in mobilizing not only their own talents but those of private citi- zens, private agencies, public agencies, and organized medicine in a cooperative effort to produce the health science personnel needs of rural communities. 3. The health manpower intelligence facil- ity, a permanent program established for per- petual inventory of health manpower in the region, to provide the basis for a planned production of appropriate numbers and kinds of health manpower. 4. The regional medical program (which in our state embraces, and is embraced by the entire Oklahoma health center concept) will offer essential support for the planned state- wide relationships with physicians and allied health personnel in community hospitals and other health programs. 5. The establishment of a school of den- tistry. Surveys reveal that Oklahoma has only 850 dentists for 2,500,000 persons, and more than half of these are located in two cities. Over 200 young Oklahomans are in dental schools in other states at this time-enough to fill a new dental college. 6. A school of public health and a school of allied health, both geared to the produc- tion of the numbers and kinds of allied health workers that are needed and are now almost nonexistent in the state. 7. Formal organization of graduate educa- tion into a graduate college in the biomedical sciences with its own dean and budget. We were surprised to find that we have 256 grad- uate students in the basic sciences, all buried in the medical student education programs and budgets. The graduate college is en- visioned as a protected core of academic ex- cellence, where scientists and researchers can be protected from the vicissitudes of public pressures and undergraduate teaching responsibilities. CONcLUsIONS The programs projected provide answers to the necessity to react to the challenge of medical-social responsibility in a manner that will preserve the traditional American freedoms of practice and education as well as the enhancement of academic excellence. RECRUITMENT, TRAINING, AND USE OF WELFARE RECIPIENTS UNDER THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, on other occasions I have spoken in the Senate concerning amendments Nos. 400 and 401, which I authored with other Sen- ators and which were adopted by the Senate Finance Committee during its consideration of the social security bill, H.R. 12080. The amendments require each State welfare plan to provide for the recruitment, training, and use of welfare recipients as subprofessional \"community service aids\" and also for recruitment, training, and use of non- paid or partially paid \"social service volunteers,\" and direct the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to study and recommend how the State welfare systems may become more activist on behalf of the poor. By letter, the direc- tor of public welfare in Oklahoma, Mr. L. E. Rader, has endorsed these amend- ments, now pending in conference, and I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the RECORD. CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: STATE OF OKLAHOMA, OKLAHOMA PUBLIC WELFARE COMMISSION, DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WELFARE, Oklahoma City, Okla., November 21, 1967. Hon. FRED R. HARRIS, U.S. Senator, Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR HARRIS: We were much In- terested to note that both of your proposed amendments (Nos. 400 and 401) were incor- porated In H.R. 12080, the \"Social Security Amendments of 1967,\" as that bill was re- ported out by the Senate Committee on Fi- nance. If enacted into law, and properly im- plemented, these proposed amendments would, in our opinion, serve to Improve and clarify the administration of the public as- sistance programs. One of the proposed amendments, incor- porated as Section 209 of H.R. 12080, as re- ported by the Senate Committee on Finance, would provide for use of subprofessional staff and volunteers In providing services to Individuals applying for and receiving as- sistance. In view of the shortage of trained professional social workers, now and in the foreseeable future, we think that a need exists to use other levels of personnel, in- cluding the use of paid subprofessional staff as \"community service aides\" as provided in the proposed amendment. To ease the man- power shortage, use could be made also of \"nonpaid or partially paid volunteers\" as provided in the proposed amendment. Given proper orientation and training, members of both groups could make a positive contri- bution to the assistance programs. Such members would be drawn, we assume, from individuals who would be free to engage in such duties without in any way interfering with their obligations to their own families. The other proposed amendment, Section 250 of H.R. 12080, as reported, would, we note, direct the Secretary of Health, Edu- cation, and Welfare to \"make a study of and recommendations concerning the means by which and the extent to which the staff of State public welfare agencies may better serve, advise, and assist applicants for or recipients of aid or assistance in securing the full protection of local, State, and Fed- eral health, housing, and related laws and in helping them make most effective use of public assistance and other programs in the community and the extent to which the State public assistance, medical assistance or related programs may be used as a means of enforcing local, State, and Federal health, housing, and related laws.\" The Secretary would report his findings and recommenda- tions, including the necessary changes in the Social Security Act, to Congress by July 1, 1969. Such study would, in our opinion, clar- ify certain questions which should be clari- fled before staffs of State public welfare agencies are asked to assume a more active role in matters in the fields of health, hous-ing, and related laws, as such matters affectthe applicants for and recipients of assist-ance. The proposed amendments are constructive and clarifying in nature, and you should, wethink, be commended for advancing them. Very truly yours, L. E. RADER,Director of Public Welfare. POSTAL REVENUE AND FEDERAL SALARY ACT OF 1967 The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill (H.R. 7977) to adjust certain postage rates, to adjust the rates of basic compensation for certain officers and employees in the Federal Government,and to regulate the mailing of pander- ing advertisements, and for other pur- poses. AMENDMENT NO. 472 Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 472. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be stated. The assistant legislative clerk read the amendment, as follows: On page 132, line 20, after the period in- sert the following: \"Notwithstanding the amendment made by this subsection, the basic pay of the Chairman and members of the Subversive Activities Control Board shall continue at the rate in effect immediately prior to the effective date of such amend- ment until otherwise provided by law.\" Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. Pres- ident, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask unanimous consent that the time not be charged against either side. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be re- scinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes on the amendment. Mr. President, I cannot conceive of their being any objection to this amend- ment. Much has been said that the pur- pose of this bill is to establish compara- bility; that is, to provide comparable pay for public officials to that which they would be receiving in private industry. In this particular situation, as I pointed out several weeks ago, we have the Subversive Activities Control Board, which is composed of five members who are being paid $26,000 a year. The fact is not disputed that for 17 months the members of this Board have not had one single duty assigned to them. I talked with one of the members who came to my office, and he confirmed the fact not only that they had not had any duties assigned to them but there was no possibility under existing law that they could have any duties assigned to them until after Congress had taken action, legislatively, to assign them such duties. The Senate acted on this matter. I supported it, but as yet that bill has not become law. Under these circumstances these men for 17 months have been draw- ing $26,000 a year for doing nothing ex- cept cashing their checks. They are doing nothing now and will continue to have nothing to do until Congress assigns them duties. Now this bill proposes to raise the salaries of the members of that Board by $2,000 for continuing to do nothing. As I stated before, I supported the bill of the Senator from Illinois to confer upon this Board certain duties, but that bill has not as yet become law. Under this amendment, when and if that bill becomes law Congress can then, if it thinks the members of the Board de- serve it, increase their salaries; but untilthat time the very least we can do isfreeze their salaries at the existing $26,000 level. Frankly, if we carried out all the argu. ments that have been made on the floor of the Senate to establish comparability, in this particular case we would do away with their salaries entirely, because I can- not conceive of any well-managed busi- ness organization in America carrying on its payroll five men at $26,000 a year when they walk into the management's office and say, \"For 17 months we have not done anything. We have not had a single job to perform. There is nothing we can perform if the board of directors takes no action to assign us some duties.\" As yet the board of directors, or Congress, has taken no action. The only action be- ing taken now is to raise their salaries by $2,000. Mr. President, I hope the amendment is accepted. As I stated before, when and if the previous bill becomes the law we can then consider the need for raising their salaries. Mr. DIRKSEN. Mr. President, is the time rationed? Mr. MONRONEY. It is on the amend- ment. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Illinois. Mr. DIRKSEN. Mr. President, to adopt this amendment would be the most curi- ous action the U.S. Senate could take. I fought through for the Subversive Ac- tivities Control Board because it is the only Board in Government we have that deals with the Communist conspiracy and subversive activities. It is up to the Attorney General, under the basic law which was passed in 1951, to petition that Board and send those cases there. The Attorney General appeared before the committee and said there were 100 organizations which ought to be cited to that Board. If the Board has not any business for the moment, whose fault is it? First of all, the Supreme Court, in the sense that they saw fit to interpret the 1951 law with respect to compulsory self- confession. But Congress is not without culpability, because it has persistently jockeyed on this thing for months and months; and we are still jockeying around and not finishing that legisla- tion. We sought to amend the basic act in every particular to meet the decisions of the Supreme Court; for it was up to Congress to so modify the law that the Board could then act, without requiring compulsory self-confession from either an organization or an individual. Why has not Congress acted? I do not know. There is a peculiar kind of inertia that settles upon this body, as well as upon other legislative bodies, and they push it off and do not act. But that is not the fault of the Board, so why penalize the Board for the laches, the negligence, and the laxity that has occurred here on Capitol Hill, and for our failure to take steps to meet this threat that is so evi- dent in the land? The amendment should be rejected, because, in my judgment, it is absolutely punitive, it is discriminatory, it is par- tial, and it singles out one board that is ready to do its job fully, if Congress will only undertake its responsibility un- der the law and do what it ought to do.34236 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE I hope the amendment will be de- feated. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, this amendment would reach into a blanket amendment that elevated some 100 posi- tions in executive level 5 from $26,000 to $28,000 a year. The amendment of the distinguished senior Senator from Dela- ware would, as the distinguished mi- nority leader has pointed out, block out two people, and put them back outside. I do not know what level they would then be in, because the amendment does not, I believe, put such positions in the regular salary scale. I would think, since Congress has just recently voted and established its intent to maintain the Subversive Activities Control Board, that we are on the way to providing them with active duties again; and I, for one, would hate to lose good men by punishing them in this way, by making them the only two men of about 100 to be selected out. I do not care to take any more time; I am ready to yield back the remainder of my time, if the Senator from Dela- ware is ready to yield back his, and we will vote. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres- ident, I shall yield back my time in just a moment. From my point of view, my amendment does not discriminate against the mem- bers of this Board. If it does I am sure there are a great many people who would like to have such discrimination prac- ticed upon them. No one disputes the fact that for the last 17 months this Board has not per- formed one single duty. As I have stated, one of the members of the Board, in my office, confirmed that fact. He said, \"It is embarrassing; all I do is collect my check and cash it.\" That is all he has done for 17 months. It is true that the Senate has passed a bill sponsored by the Senator from Il- linois to give the Board some duties. I supported that bill. But it is also true that the bill has not been acted upon in the House of Representatives and is not now the law. Until it does become law the Board has no duties. I am just as much against communism as any Senator, but we are not fighting communism by carrying, not two but five people on the payroll at $26,000 a yearfor 2 years with no duties to perform. If that is the best way we can find tofight communism we had better give up the fight. All I propose in this amendment isthat the salaries remain at $26,000 a year until such time as Congress acts to givethem some duties. The Senator from Oklahoma has appealed most eloquently for comparability between Government service and private employment. I ask him to name one industry in America, one private employer who after having five people on its payroll for 17 months with no duties, would say to them, \"We are going to raise you $2,000 a year so you can buy some more pinochle cards.\" Or perhaps they are tired of playing pinochle and want a chess board or something. If it is the desire of Congress to give them duties let us first assign them someduties, but I feel that until we do assign them duties the least we can do is not raise their pay. Otherwise, let us forget about talking comparability, because I say again, no industry in America would be so foolish as to follow the action now proposed in the Senate insofar as it af- fects this Board. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute. If, as the distinguished Senator from Delaware thinks, they have nothing to do, the proper amendment would be, not to give them a slap on the wrist by re- fusing to elevate their salary along with all the other employees of executive grade 5, but to abolish all five positions, and really save some money. Why do we not get into the big business of saving money, and offer a substitute amendment? If the members of the board have nothing to do, let us take them off the payroll. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I might say to the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from Illinois, I believe that is an excellent suggestion. I tried to do that several weeks ago, and the Senator from Oklahoma and his colleague voted against it. That fight is over; I lost it. Now we have reached the point where we must decide whether we want to raise them $2,000 a year because their $26,000 is not quite adequate, on the basis of comparable pay for sitting in an office for 17 months doing nothing. I concede that that is probably not a very pleasant task. Perhaps they need a raise for I suspect that just sitting there looking at the four walls for 17 months or just reporting in once a day, may be growing somewhat boring, and perhaps some Senators think this do-nothing job is irksome enough to entitle them to $2,000 more. But I happen to be one taxpayer who thinks $26,000 a year for doing nothing is more than adequate pay. Mr. LAUSCHE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question? Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield. Mr. LAUSCHE. If and when the House passes the Dirksen bill, what will the effect of the Senator's amendment be re- garding the right of those members of the Board to receive the additional $2,000? Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. If that bill goes into effect later? Mr. LAUSCHE. Yes. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. If the bill giving them duties goes into effect later Congress can if it wishes raise them at that time. But if we do not pass the law giving them some duties, then, by all means, the very least we can do is not raise the sal- aries above the $26,000 level. We have crossed the bridge of whether or not we are going to keep them on the payroll. That was settled some time ago. As I have stated, I supported the bill sponsored by the Senator from Illinois to assign them duties. But no one dis- putes the fact that they do not have duties. If that were solely the fault of the At- torney General of the United States I would say let us get rid of the Attorney General, but he has already stated that he feels he cannot assign them any duties until Congress acts.So let us not pass the buck to the At- torney General. Let us accept responsi- bility right here where it belongs. We speak about the increased cost of living and inflation, but I do not see how we can justify a $2,000 per year increase for five men to pay them to continue doing nothing. I am willing to yield back the remain- der of my time and vote if the Senator is. Mr. MONRONEY. I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished senior Senator from Illinois. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Then I withhold my time. Mr. DIRKSEN. Mr. President, to pass this amendment would be to invite some- thing like an elevator operation, because there is no question but that this bill will be enacted into law. Then what? Then we will be doing again what we are doing in this bill; we will be in duty bound to come back and raise these sal- aries. How long will it take? Well, we will stumble around with it for quite some time. Then there will be the question of whether we want to date them back, and make it retroactive; watch and see what kind of argument is made on that point, on the floor of the Senate. I still insist that this is a punitive proposal, and should not be adopted against a board that is ready, able, and willing to do its duty. It is an overstatement to say that they do exactly nothing, because they have masses of evidence and testimony to be analyzed, and there is a considerable workload pending before the board, even though no new matters are presently being referred. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time if the distinguished senior Senator from Delaware is prepared to do so. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. President, I yield myself a half minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Delaware is recognized for one-half minute. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois said that if we agree to the pending amend- ment and later some duties are conferred on this board and an attempt is made to establish retroactive pay for the Board members there would be a fight on the floor. That is the underestimate of the year. Certainly the Senator will not propose retroactive pay for the five Board mem- bers who are now drawing a salary of $26,000 a year for doing nothing. Why give retroactive pay to the five Board members who already receive $26,000 a year for doing nothing. I repeat, the Board has no duties at present, It has had no duties for 17 months, and it will have no duties until Congress acts affirmatively on the bill now in the House. Mr. President, I yield back the re- mainder of my time. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.

I yield myself 5 minutes. Mr. President, I ask for a live quorum, since this is of direct interest to every Member of the Senate, and I thought that the Members of the Senate should know what is involved. Mr. President, the two top majority members of the Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committee yesterday made two very significant statements with respect to the pay bill now before us. The chairman of the committee, the distinguished senior Senator from Okla- homa, stated: I am getting a little sick and tired of two or three Members being afraid we might recognize the legislative branch as a coequal branch and deserving of coequal treatment. This is a case in point. Mr. President, I, too, am getting a little sick and tired of some Members being afraid we might recognize the legislative branch as a coequal branch and deserving of coequal treatment. But the very bill reported out by the Post Office and Civil Service Committee does the very thing about which the chair- man of that committee complains. It does it against our own top staff members because it places a pay ceiling on our own top staff members at a level of nearly $1,500 below that of the pay ceiling set for the classified workers in the executive branch. This is surely not making the legislative branch a coequal branch and deserving of coequal treat- ment as far as our top staff members are concerned. To the contrary, it degrades and be- littles our top staff members and makes second-class employees when compared to the employees of the executive branch. Mr. President, if we are in righteous indignation to demand coequal treatment for ourselves as Members or for former Members, then surely in all consistencyand good conscience we should demandthe same for our own top staff membersinstead of degrading them into \"secondclass\" status as we have done for so many years. Mr. President, I have said this re- peatedly for many, many years, yet boththe Post Office and Civil Service Com- mittee and the Appropriations Commit- tee have continued to give this second class treatment to our top staff mem-bers-both those of the Senators and ofthe committee staffs. My pleas have fall-en on deaf ears. One rather calloused answer that has been made to my pleas through the years has been: \"Well, the top members of our staffs are not forced to stay here. They can leave and get better pay downtownin the executive branch if they want to. We have not chained them as slave labor to stay here against their own will.\" This brings me to the very significant statement made by the No. 2 majority member of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee, the distinguished senior Senator from Texas. He said in debate yesterday: We can have an employee here as a con- gressional employee, working in our office or for a committee for 25 years. Then he can go the executive branch and work 6 yearsfor a salary of $27,000. And that is not ahigh salary in the executive branch. That would be a high salary for our employees here, but not downtown. That man could get a GS-18, and many of them do. TheSenators know how the executive branch bleeds our competent employees away fromus.... We will not have Congress treated as a coequal branch of the Government unless we are willing to treat ourselves as being equal with members of the executive depart-ment. Well, Mr. President, I ask, \"How abouttreating our top staff members as being equal with the top GS-18 employees ofthe executive department?\" When we complain about coequaltreatment and about the executive branch bleeding our competent em- ployees away from us are we really serious? Do we really mean what we say?Are we willing to put into practice what we claim we preach? Are we willing tostop penalizing those top staff members whose loyalty to us and to the Senate is so great that they cannot be lured away by the executive branch? Mr. President, I think it is about time for us to declare ourselves one way or theother. I think it is about time that we stood up and be counted on this matter one way or the other. I, for one, am not going to ask for more coequal treatment for myself than for our top staff members-for more co-equal treatment in the event that I should later become a member of the executive branch. That is why I voted for the Williams amendment yesterday. But, Mr. President, I have concludedthat such is not enough for registering my protest against this second-classtreatment we give to our top staff em- ployees. And so I am offering an amend- ment to make the legislative employee pay ceiling coequal with that of the executive employee pay ceiling. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment. The yeas and nays were ordered.34238 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE Mr. MONRONEY. I deeply regret the necessity of opposing the amendment of one of the grandest Members of the Sen- ate that anyone could ever have served with, a lady who is a faithful, dedicated, and knowledgeable member of the Com- mittee on Appropriations and the Com- mittee on Armed Services. I respect the great workload that the distinguished Senator carries. Mr. President, I, too, am devoted to our staff. I claim credit, along with the late Senator Bob La Follette, in elevating them to professional status. When I served on the Committee on Banking and Currency in the House we handled such matters as price control, and we set up Bretton Woods, and we had as our only staff assistant a retired rural mail carrier. We have gone from that situa- tion to what I think is a dignified, com- petent, and capable professional staff. I would like, but I do not want, to upset the balance in this body that goes along with the various levels of status. I repeat that word \"status.\" Senators occupy a status of which we are proud. Unfor- tunately, because of that status our other employees come below in what we call compressibility as other salaries are raised. As they near the salaries of Sen- ators we try to keep a little gap between them and us. This requires maintaining at least a percentage gap that exists be- tween other layers of the officers of the Senate, members of our committee staffs, and our administrative assistants. Having gone through this two or three times, it is not an easy job to try to pre- pare against a mistake in compressibil- ity, in having employees of the Senate actually netting more salary than Sena- tors because of their lack of expenses, which everyone knows a Senator must provide, but we tried to arrange the vari- ous levels as best we could. After a unanimous vote from the committee, which followed lengthy discussions, we fixed a limit at which other salaries of Senate employees would approach the salaries of Senators. I think this degree of difference isnecessary. It is not necessarily because of prestige but because it is required tomaintain some difference between our employees and Senators. With unanimous consent, the commit- tee fixed a rate of $28,000 as the top salary for all Senate employees. That amount would go to the principal em- ployees, and it applies to the three senior officers of the Senate: the Legislative Counsel, the Secretary of the Senate, and the Sergeant at Arms. These are our executive officers. These salaries should be fixed at $28,000. The next level would be the salaries paid for the Parliamentarian, financial clerk, and others above the committee level. I think there are three or four of those people who would be compensated at a rate not higher than $27,000. The general maximum now established by law is $24,480, which should not beincreased to a figure greater than $26,000. We try to do this to maintain a degree of difference percentagewise because wecould not afford to disregard the time-honored rank of the different groups of our official Senate staff.On the side of our staff members in our offices, and in connection with the Senate staff, I, too, regret that we do not have comparability with Members of the House of Representatives, but only as it relates to the committee staff in the House. Today we pay our committee staff as follows: The Chief Clerk is paid at the rate up to $24,480. Under the first step of this pay bill, that sum would go up to $25,568, which is the 4.5-percent increase that all members of the executive de- partment get in that grade, which is com- parable and, therefore, they will have a raise next year, it is contemplated, and the 1968 step will take place and they will raise to not more than $26,000. It is true that the House of Repre- sentatives has a $27,055 top for its com- mittee chief of staff, while our committee chief of staff, as I said, will reach the level of $25,568. The House of Representatives sets its figures, and we set our figures. I might point out that there is a difference in the salaries of staff members in our offices. If comparability works one way,it must work both ways. I might point out that House staff administrative assistants compared with ours are paid $21,504. Yet our top salary is $24,480. Therefore, there is a difference on the low side in the House for administrative assistants. The difference is just about comparable with the difference in the House on the high side and a little bit on the low side in committee. I admit it would be fine if we could make these salaries uniform. I believe that the House moved its figure upward for committee staffs, so we are in some disagreement. I do not feel we can conscientiously move both groups of employees up to $27,055, which would be a 9-percent raise from that which they are getting today when we are giving the rest of the Government a 4.5-percent increase, and not have it pointed out that we did twice as much for our employees as we were willing to do for the hundreds of thousands of general service employees downtown, all of whom get a limit of 4.5 percent increase. Mr. President, I will respectfully ask, with all due appreciation for the resched- uling of these difficult jobs, that we not encumber the bill at this time with a 9- percent raise which would bring up the men and women who work under us-and they are very faithful. They undoubtedly will come up another 3 or 4 percent to be above the $28,000 automatically next year if they are included beyond the limit we set. I feel this compressibility may affect people who may be doing more work than I am doing, but certainly they do not have the responsibility for returning to their home States as we do, which it is essen- tial that every Senator should do. Most of the people I know-and I do not think I have been unkind-do not think the committee has been niggardly with the Senate staff. I know that in the reorgani- zation program we tried to rescale many of these. It was our bill which the Senate passed and now rests in limbo in the House. I do not know what will happen. This is a matter on which I do not think anyone will be hurt by the $25,568 salaryfrom the $24,480 for our committee staffs. Let me again say that comparability does not exist here, if we consider our own per- sonal staff which involves 100 at least for the Senate, and involves 435 for the House where we exceed their top limit of $21,504 and our figure of $24,480, both of which, under the bill, will go up by 4.5 percent and not by the 9 percent which is pro- posed by the amendment. With all due respect, as tender a household matter as this has become, I think we must realize that we, too, should be restrained in our demands for pay increases. I think we have been as lib- eral as we can. We have observed as we must, the traditional status of the var- ious offices below those of others, to keep some kind of recognized and historic differential between those who run the Senate; namely, the top three officers, the Legislative Counsel, the Sergeant at Arms, and the Secretary, on down through to the various groups, the Finan- cial Clerk, and officers of that kind, which are carefully scaled down today by a percentage difference that is main- tained in our traditional staffs. This would upset the whole balance. I do not think it would be wise or should be in- sisted upon by the men who serve us. Mr. CARLSON. Mr. President, I sup- port the position the chairman has taken in regard to the proposed increase for the heads of staffs of Members of Congress. As he well knows, we spent hours and hours studying this problem. There has been considerable discussion in committee as to the discrepancies and the variance between House and Senate staffs. We regret that. We have had this matter up with Mr. Brenkworth on several occasions. There are some prob- lems existing as to these salaries. I sincerely hope that the pending amendment, despite its merits, will be rejected, because we set a limit of $28,000 and we set that limit after much study and deliberation. If this amendment should be agreed to, then the salary of this particular in- dividual would go to $28,272 and would break the ceiling which, I think, would be most unfortunate for all em- ployees working in the Senate. Therefore, I hope that the amendment will be de- feated. Mr. METCALF. Mr. President, will the Senator from Maine yield to me? Mrs. SMITH. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Montana such time as he may require. Mr. METCALF. Mr. President, when the Senate had before it the bill which came from the Joint Committee on the Reorganization of Congress, as the Sena- tor from Oklahoma has told us, we looked into the problem. At that time, I offered an amendment, and the Senator from Oklahoma was very generous in his support of it. It provided for some comparability for House and Senate committee staffs. That amendment is still pending in the House of Representatives. Now I am prepared to offer an amend- ment which would make the pay in- creases which the Senate adopted at that time, by a vote of 2 to 1, applicable to the pending bill.34239 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATENovember 29, 1967 It would permit two committee staff members, to serve at $27,055, and four at the second level of $25,944. I spoke with the distinguished chairman of the committee and listened to his reasons why we should not make some of the increases. Under present law, staff members in the House of Representatives receive the top salary of $25,890. There is no limita- tion on that. There can be as many staff members at that rate as they can find appropriations for. In the Senate, we have a limitation permitting only one committee staff member to receive the top salary of $24,- 480-a disparity of $1,410 annually. When the bill is enacted, that dis- parity will go up, to make a difference of $2,000 annually. All that the Senator from Maine [Mrs. SMITH] is trying to do is to say that we can have one staff member on the same basis as on the House side. Many of us have served in the House as well as in the Senate, and we have great admira- tion for the staff members there. But we still have a superb staff who work with us in the Senate, too. We know the kind of valuable work they do. They are a highly professional staff, whose activi- ties the Senator from Oklahoma has mentioned. We talk about prestige. Well, just as a matter of prestige, our staff members, who do the same work and perform the same functions, have the same right to the salaries as are paid in the other body. We do not like to see them leave us, but they do leave us. They go downtown too, and get more money. Under the bill, we are limiting our senior officers on the Senate side to $28,000-as well as limiting to $27,055 employees in the General Accounting Office and the Library of Congress. We are limiting our committee staff members to even less than that; yet GS-18's in every other agency can go up to $28,000, as the Senator from Oklahoma has mentioned. I see no reason why we should not adopt the amendment offered by the Senator from Maine, recognizing that we need ard desire, and that our staffs are entitled to, some comparability, and move one of these staff members up to at least $27,055. Mr. MONRONEY. Is not the Senator from Montana overlooking the fact that if we are to have this comparability, we will have to reduce the pay of our ad- ministrative assistants by some $3,000? I am not ready to do that. Mr. METCALF. That is a matter which the House of Representatives should take care of in its own housekeeping. If the House wants to raise the pay of their staffs, that is their problem. They will have to take care of it. But we should recognize that at least one member of our staff has just as high a professional standing, does just as good a job, has just as much experience, and has just as much responsibility as staff members in the other body. Mr. MONRONEY. I should like to in- quire of the distinguished Senator fromMaine as to the numbers to be affected by the amendment. Would we have more than one staff member at the top salary? Mrs. SMITH. No. My proposal is for only one. I am not wedded to any par- ticular formula. All I am trying to get is equality between the executive branch and the Senate. I do not like the idea of our people being belittled and degraded in com- parison with GS-18's in the executive branch, which they insist on, I say to the chairman: Let us cut down the GS-18's in the executive branch, if that is what he would like, and I would go along with him on that. Mr. MONRONEY. We are cutting down on the escalation at the higher levels to run below the $30,000 Senate salary. So many who would go above the $30,000 figure on this raise are denied that raise in the executive department. We are trying to preserve this at the level of Senators as to the ordinary com- parability of the various grades. I wish we could display a little patience so that we could study this problem more carefully. It does not properly belong in a general pay bill because here we ac- tually would be changing grades. I think we would be in a bad way there, to say that we raise our own assistants, 100 of them, of Senate Members, and some 14 or 15 in the committees, by 9 percent, when we held all raises at the general service level to 4.5 percent. I think it would be in better taste and much better to consider, with all due re- gard to the capabilities of the people who serve us, to take this up in a more leisurely way, to have an adequate study made between the careful relationships of the first, second, third, or fourth eche- lons of Senate officers, so that we will not reach this normal differential. I hope the Senator will support the committee. We had no hearings on this amendment. We know a great deal about it. Perhaps we do not need hearings. But I think it would be much more ap- propriate to take this proposal up in a legislative appropriation bill. Mrs. SMITH. Mr. President, how much time have I remaining? The PRESIDING OFFICER. 4 min- utes. Mrs. SMITH. Mr. President, I am in- trigued by the Senator's plea for re- straint. I agree with him on the need for restraint in other areas as well as this one. I am also intrigued by the Senator's plea for patience. I think he will remember that 10 years ago almost the same words were uttered on this floor. I have been patient for 10 years or more. I have been trying to get something done legislatively as well as in appropria- tions, so I am sure he will not disagree with me on the matter of my having been patient. I will go back to the statement about the 9-percent increase. It was only be- cause our people were held down that that particular group received the 9-per- cent increase. As I understand, if I am correct-and the chairman will correct me if I am not-a year from now the differential will be even greater, because the GS-18salary will be $28,000 and the salary here could not be higher than $26,000, whichwould be a $2,000 differential. I just do not understand why, underthe guise of further study, patience, re-straint, or anything else, we should bewilling to have our people here made second-class employees compared to theexecutive branch. Again, all I say to the chairman andthe committee is that it seems to methat some way ought to be found to putthem on the same level. I will go all the way with them if they want to present an amendment to get the GS-18 down to the level of our own top people. Other- wise, I would like to have a vote on my amendment. As the Chair knows, I have called for the yeas and nays. I yield back the rest of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques- tion is on the amendment of the Sen- ator from Maine. The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. SPARKMAN (after having votedin the affirmative).

Mr. President, I was happy to hear the official announcement today that former President Dwight D. Eisenhower has donated his home and farm in Gettysburg, Pa., to the Federal Government for national historical pur- poses. The property adjoins the present Gettysburg National Military Park. This is a magnificent gift. It will pre- serve the former President's attractive residence and farmland as the Eisen- hower National Historic Site. The total land involved is 230 acres. Under the terms of the donation, General Eisen- hower would reserve a life interest in the property. Under existing law, such a gift can be accepted by the Secretary of the Interior and designated as a national historic site. However, it has been customary to withhold such a designation until legis- lation is approved by the Congress. During recent correspondence with President Eisenhower regarding his public-spirited intention to make this gift, I informed him that legislation was customary. He wrote back to say that he would be happy to have me introduce such legislation. He said it would be pleasant to know that public opinion, as represented in the Congress, would ap- prove of the transaction. Accordingly, Mr. President, I introduce for appropriate reference a joint reso- lution to authorize the development by the Federal Government of the gift of the Eisenhower home and farm at Gettys- burg, Pa. However, the property will not be developed during the tenure reserved by President and Mrs. Eisenhower. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution will be received and appropri- ately referred. 'POSTAL REVENUE AND FEDERAL SALARY ACT OF 1967 The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill (H.R. 7977) to adjust certain postage rates, to adjust the rates of basic compensation for certain officers and employees in the Federal Government, and to regulate the mailing of pandering advertisements and for other purposes.

The yeas and nays were ordered. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Kansas yield? Mr. CARLSON. I yield. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, since the proposed amendment deals with mat- ter on two separate pages of the bill and with three separate categories of mail, I ask at this time, if it is parliamentarily possible, for a division of the question when voted upon. I ask unanimous consent that while we are waiting for a decision of the Chair on the question of division, that the Sena- tor from Kansas be permitted to pro- ceed, and we can thus save some time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas may proceed. Mr. CARLSON. Mr. President, I am of- fering this amendment together with the distinguished Senator from Indiana [Mr. HARTKEI and the distinguished Senator from Indiana [Mr. BATH]. Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, may we have order?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ate will be in order. The Senator from Kansas may pro- ceed. Mr. CARLSON. Mr. President, I am offering an amendment which would cor- rect certain inequities in the postal rate bill. First, it would adjust the rate on sec- ond-class mail affecting religious and nonprofit publications in such a manner as to conform to the treatment afforded in the pending bill to profitmaking news- papers and magazines. Second, the amendment would con- form the rates on third-class mailings to the rate adopted by the House, 3.8, over a 2-year period. This amendment would be helpful to veterans organizations, civic clubs, fra- ternal organizations, and churches, who use their publications to inform their membership with no thought of profit. The pending bill as reported by the committee carries a provision that will impose a 60-percent increase, at one stroke, in the second-class postage rates CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 on lightweight publications of nonprofit labor, church, educational, civic philan- thropic, fraternal, and veterans' orga- nizations. Such publications, if weighing less than an ounce a copy, are now subject to the minimum rate, which is one-eighth of a cent a copy. The Senate committee bill would raise that to one-fifth of a cent a copy, effective January 7, 1968. This amounts to a 60-percent increase. By contrast, commercial publications and others which come under the pound rate would bear only a 23-percent in- crease, spread out over a 3-year period, or approximately 7 percent a year. The amendment would provide that the minimum second-class rate for light- weight, nonprofit publications be in- creased by approximately 20 percent over a 3-year period, roughly the same per- centage as commercial publications. Here is a typical example of how it affects one such nonprofit publication: Labor Newspaper, as you may know, is the national weekly of 18 railway unions and goes to approximately 550,000 sub- scribers in the United States. It is an eight-page tabloid and weighs less than an ounce. As such, it is subject to the minimum rate. Labor Newspaper asks for no preferen- tial treatment. It requests approximately the same three-step increase as proposed in the committee bill for other second- class publications. A jump of 60 percent, as proposed in the committee bill, would cost Labor Newspaper an additional $20,000 a year. This would be a very critical blow to this paper's slender financial resources-and to hundreds of other nonprofit labor pub- lications. Labor Newspaper is established as a nonprofit cooperative. It carries no ad- vertising. Its only source of income is from voluntary subscriptions. In a few cases, railway unions subscribe for all their members, in others, local lodges subscribe, and in addition, thousands of individuals subscribe. Subscription rates cannot be easily raised, and they do not come overnight. Just as in the case of commercial publications, it often takes years to secure subscription rate in- creases. To the Post Office Department, a 60- percent increase in the minimum rate on all nonprofit publications would yield an insignificant amount of revenue-far less than $1 million. But to labor newspaper and the labor press as a whole, the effect would be harsh and even devastating. We think Senators will agree it is not fair to impose a 60-percent increase in one stroke on publications least able to pay, while only a little over 20 percent is imposed over a 3-year period on com- mercial publications. Among those this amendment will help are veteran groups, gasoline stations, de- partment stores, civic clubs, fraternal organizations, churches, corporations and partnerships, museums, schools, vol- unteer fire companies, newspapers and other publications delivered within the county, trade unions, mall-order houses, political candidates, and so forth. There are 275,000 third-class permit holders in the United States. The average congres- sional district has more than 500 permit holders.There are hundreds of thousands of semiskilled and handicapped workers employed in the direct mail field. If the volume of such mail should severely drop through too high postage rates, these semiskilled workers will be the first to suffer. More than 41/2 million persons de- pend on third-class sales for their liveli- hood. Assuming arguendo that third-class mail is paying less than its allocated costs, it is not as a subsidy, but as a rec- ognition of the deferred service it re- ceives and the lesser value it represents. Deferred mail was created by Congress to keep valuable employees profitably occupied during any slack period and to create increased mail volume. It takes on the average 18 days for a third-class piece of mail to be delivered from Wash- ington to San Francisco. If it were not for the deferred mail category, thousands of postal workers would be removed from their jobs. The Postmaster General stated before the Senate committee on October 16: ZIP Code pre-sort savings are averaging two-tenths of a cent per piece, and applied to projected 1968 volume this would mean total annual savings of about $35 million for bulk third class and $18 million for publish- ers' second-class mall. In other words, were it not for pre-sorted second and third class mail we estimate our expenses in 1968 would be $53 million higher. Eighty percent of the costs are for la- bor, and labor is used primarily for the handling, carrying, and sorting of mail. As the result of ZIP code regulations, much of this handling is done at the expense of the bulk mailers. A piece of mail is handled on the average of 15 times by postal employees. Bulk mailers do nine of these handlings at their own expense. Many magazines of small circulation, such as the many educational, civic, trade union, and veteran publications, are hit very hard by this bill. The com- mittee bill provides for a 60-percent in- crease in the piece rate for nonprofit second-class mail, and the piece rate for in-county second-class mail. This would be catastrophic to many publications which survive on marginal revenues. In addition, the proposed increase is very discriminatory since the overall second- class rates will increase 20 percent and spread over a 3-year period. Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator indulge the Chair so that he may rule on the question that has been raised? A division of the question having been demanded, the Chair rules that the amendment is divided into three parts. The first part is that on page 1, from line 1, down to line 4. The second question would be on page 1, beginning with line 4, down to line 3 on page 2 of the amendment. The third question would be on page 2, beginning with line 3 of the amend- ment down to the end of the amend- ment. The yeas and nays having been ordered, there will be a rollcall on each one of the separately divided questions, with a time limitation of 1 hour-30 minutes to the side-on the entire ques-tion, not on each division, but I hourtotal on the amendment, 30 minutes tothe side. Mr. CARLSON. Mr. President, I have made the case on the first part of the measure dealing with the veterans or- ganizations and other groups. As the Chair has ruled-and I think rightfully so-it is divisible. I have noth- ing further to say at this time except that many magazines of small circula- tion, such as educational, civic, trade union, and veterans publications, are very hard hit by the pending bill. The committee bill, as I stated, pro- vides for a 60 percent increase on a piece-rate basis for nonprofit second- class mail, and the piece rate in the county second-class mail. This would be catastrophic in my opin- ion. Many publications are nonprofit and are published to help their membership and others who are concerned. Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. CURTIS. I yield. Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, the Senator from Rhode Island is curious to know the rationale that was used by the committee in imposing a 60-percent in- crease on nonprofit publications, where- as on profit publications it is much less. Why the distinction? What is the rea- son for it? Mr. CARLSON. Mr. President, I shall be glad to let the distinguished chair- man of the committee answer the ques- tion. I opposed this provision in committee. I think it would be too great an increase. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Oklahoma is recognized for 2 minutes. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, the main rationale, I say to my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Rhode Island, is that the rate is one-eighth of a cent for accepting that mail, sorting it, and putting it out on a route, rural or domestic. We charge that much for that service. It costs as much to deliver that mail as it costs to deliver a letter that we are now charging 6 cents to deliver. We do raise the rate 60 percent. It would go up from one-eighth of a cent to one-fifth of a cent. I say that it is high time that these rates started to go up, whether for charitable or other non- profit organizations. There are some 8,000 to 10,000 maga- zines in publication and enjoying this ridiculously low rate. I think the committee had adequate hearings on the matter. It is ridiculous to say that we should charge the average woman 6 cents to mail a letter to her son or husband in Vietnam and at the same time allow the so-called 8,000 to 10,000 nonprofit organizations to continue to enjoy a rate of one-eighth of a cent. It is a 60-percent increase. It is an increase from one-eighth of a cent to one-fifth of a cent. Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, I can realize the drama of bringing the widows and the boys in Vietnam into the ques- tion. However, let me ask this question: How much are we charging the paid pub- lications, those magazines and newspa-34242 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE pers that operate for profit? How much do we charge them as against the widows and our boys in Vietnam? Let us make that comparison. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, by quick mathematics I believe we are charging them better than 10 times what we are charging the so-called nonprofits. Mr. PASTORE. How much less do we charge them than we charge the writing mothers? Mr. MONRONEY. We are charging them 1.3 cents minimum on all publica- tions on profitmaking publications, for second class. That is the minimum. It goes up by the pound rate. Of course, the minimum rate is pri- marily for the small county newspapers. We also raise their rate. Everyone gets an increase. No one gets a lesser amount of increase than the ones who are ask- ing at this point to try to remain at one- eighth of a cent instead of being raised 60 percent to one-fifth of a cent. Mr. PASTORE. The practice has been that we have been charging parents the regular rate for mailing letters to their boys in Vietnam. We are asking them to carry the load for the profitmaking pub- lications that have actually been receiv- ing a boon. It costs just as much and even more money to deliver Time or Life magazine as it does to deliver a letter. I think that in the past we have been too preferential in the case of all of the publications. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I yield myself an additional 2 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Oklahoma is recognized for an additional 2 minutes. Mr. MONRONEY. This class of mail is now paying only 7 percent of its cost to the Post Office Department. The loss is $126.2 million a year. That is not hay in this day and age when the distin- guished chairman of the Finance Com- mittee is trying to find ways and means to meet the financial requirements of the Government. Mr. LONG of Louisiana. Mr. Presi- dent, will the Senator yield? Mr. MONRONEY. I yield. Mr. LONG of Louisiana. Mr. Presi- dent, I do not find any fault with the Senator for trying to raise the mailing cost of an item that costs 5 cents to de- liver from the present cost of one-eighth of a cent to a cost of one-fifth of a cent. However, as the chairman of the com- mittee that has to raise the money to pay for this, I think you are not charg- ing enough. How does the Senator excuse having the cost that low? Mr. MONRONEY. We are trying to recognize the traditional, historic bene- fits of the veterans organizations, the Red Cross, the cancer societies, and alsothe Hibiscus Society of Alabama. Lookat this list. The book is approximately a foot thick, with the names of people who enjoy nonprofit, charitable rates.Just about everybody is in it, including many of our fine civic clubs and some of our great national organizationswhich enjoy the same rate. Mr. LONG of Louisiana. How does one CXIII- 2157-Part 25explain to people that $1 of their taxes is used to pay for mail they do not want? The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SPONG in the chair). The time of the Senator has expired. Mr. MONRONEY. I do not wish to im- pinge upon the time of the Senator from Kansas. I only meant to answer the ques- tion of the Senator from Rhode Island as to why we raise this class of mail 60 percent. Mr. PASTORE. All I am trying to point out-and this is also in answer to the Senator from Louisiana-is that in the past, and even now, the profitmaking publications have been the sacred cow; and they have been subsidized by those mothers and those widows who are writ- ing letters to the boys in Vietnam. Let us face it. Mr. MONRONEY. The Senator can submit an amendment that would in- crease rates. I am trying to prevent the loss of revenue. I am trying to cover as much of our cost of operation as possible. The bill is open to amendment to increase the second-class rates. This amendment would decrease second-class rates in many respects. Mr. LONG of Louisiana. What is hap- pening in the House is that the commit- tee with the responsibility of raising all this money is revolting against the com- mittee spending all this money. The de- bate is going on between the Senator from Louisiana and the Senator from Rhode Island at this time. The people who must raise the money are saying, \"We refuse to raise taxes; you pay for it.\"I cannot see any reason why the Sen- ator from Oklahoma would let these peo- ple get off with one-fifth of a cent. I think he is being most generous. Mr. MONRONEY. I thank my col- league. I yield to the Senator from Kansas. Mr. CARLSON. Mr. President, the is- sue is very simple. For years, the Post Office Department has regarded these groups as nonprofit organizations and has carried them as performing a public service. The chairman and I disagreed in com- mittee, and we disagree now. To me, the Post Office Department is a public serv- ice organization. I have in my hand the Scouter, which is a weekly digest of the national Scout organization. It is distributed to the Scout leaders and others interested in this great movement. Certainly, no one would say that this is a profit organiza- tion. You and I contribute to it. It is a great organization. If the committee amendment is adopted, it will cost the Boy Scout or- ganization $86,000 a year. It is not a small item. We are talking about large sums of money today. Therefore, it seems to me that we can continue, as a great nation, to be inter- ested in taking care of and assisting people who are trying to help others. That is all the pending amendment would do. Does the Senator from Indiana wish me to yield to him? Mr. HARTKE. Will the Senator yield for a question? Mr. CARLSON. I yield.Mr. HARTKE. Does the Senator know what the estimated loss of revenue is with regard to the handling of the mail of these organizations which are putting out such publications? Mr. CARLSON. This will cost $1 million. Mr. HARTKE. Is the Senator aware that there are more than one-quarter of a million separate organizations-ap- proximately 275,000-which the Senator from Oklahoma indicated would con- tinue to use such an operation, if they can continue in business, if it is not a burden on them? Am I correct? Mr. MONRONEY. I said there were 8,000 to 10,000 magazines. The book is about a foot thick, completely filled with names of societies and organizations. It makes interesting reading, but one is astonished as to how gracious the Fed- eral Government has been to this typical class of nonprofit second-class user. Wealthy churches are using it to mail from here to Hawaii for one-eighth of a cent, and now it will go to one-fifth of a cent. Mr. HARTKE. Is it not true that there are approximately 275,000 publications and the revenue is less than $1 million, which means that the cost for any one organization or any one publication can hardly be found, that it is like finding a needle in a haystack? It is not the same amount of money as the Senator from Rhode Island spoke about with respect to the large publica- tions. In the case of most of these pub- lications it amounts to the difference between their staying in business or going out of business. I do not wish to pass judgment on these organizations. I do not know what the hibiscus organiza- tion is. I have never heard of it. If people like flowers and like to send out leaflets about flowers and encourage people to appreciate the beauty of life. I do not see anything wrong with that. If it is a dif- ference of $50 to them, it may mean the difference between staying in operation and ceasing operation. A great issue has been made of this matter, as though this is a major part of the bill. This is a minor part of the bill. The original report of the Bureau of the Budget was that it would be a negligible amount. The amendments we are considering really involve a very severe increase in rates. Perhaps the Senator from Okla- homa does not believe it is very much, but it is a great deal of money to these people, compared with the amount of money they are receiving. All they wish is to be treated fairly. I believe the Senator from Rhode Is- land has made a good point: The per- centage of increase for the big publica- tions is not nearly as large, and this is a fact of life. It is true that much more money is involved. It seems to me that the issue comes back to the basic proposition as to whether you really want to hit them hard, and I know that some people would like to hit them hard and drive them out of business. Apparently, everybody is sup- posed to send their publications by first- class mall.34243 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 I believe that the mail service is one of the great operations of this country. We started with RFD--ural free de- livery. It is a great service to this coun- try. People who accuse it of being a boon- doggle or anything such as that are doing an injustice to a fine organization. I wish the Post Office Department would give as much attention to the delivery of the mail as it does to criticiz- ing people who try to use it to promote their own charitable organizations and good ideas. Mr. CARLSON. Mr. President, a parlia- mentary inquiry. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator will state it. Mr. CARLSON. Do I correctly under- stand that, under the ruling of the Chair, all three of the separate divisions in the amendment must be discussed and the discussion is to be completed before a rollcall vote can be had on any one of them? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator is correct. Mr. CARLSON. And the discussions on the three separate items must be com- pleted within 1 hour? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator is correct. Mr. LAUSCHE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question? Mr. MONRONEY. I yield. I should like to keep it brief. Mr. LAUSCHE. I shall be brief. When was the last time that an in- crease in the rates was instituted in the carrying of what is called nonprofit serv- ice leaflets and magazines? Mr. MONRONEY. With respect to non- profit magazines, it was 1962. This is 1967. They have been enjoying this rate, which covers only 7 percent of the costs, since 1962. Before that, it was distinctly less, and it went on for many years. Under this \"terrible\" 60-percent raise, it would only come up to 9 percent of our cost, and this would not be so bad if you singled out the American Red Cross or such organiza- tions. But this includes 8,000 or 10,000 magazines about which the distinguished Senator has spoken. He said it is only $1 million. This dem- onstrates the tenderness with which we tried to treat this class. He then said to leave it as it is because it is only $1 mil- lion. The Senator cannot have it both ways. Mr. HARTKE. Is it not true that in the last 15 years second and third class have been raised 122 percent and 188 percent respectively? Mr. MONRONEY. This rate in 1962 was--is the Senator talking about the first amendment? Mr. HARTKE. As I understand the ruling of the Chair I am talking about all three. Mr. MONRONEY. There are three separate groups. Are we talking about second-class nonprofit? This is not my understanding. Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, a par- liamentary inquiry. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Oklahoma yield time? Mr. MONRONEY. No. I am on limited time. The Senator is speaking on the other side of the issue and I would sug- gest that he get time from the Senator from Kansas.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Kansas yield time? Mr. CARLSON. How much time does the Senator require? Mr. HARTKE. I would like to proceed for 2 minutes. Mr. CARLSON. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator. Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, I wish to make a parliamentary inquiry. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator will state it. Mr. HARTKE. Is it not true that all parts of this amendment which have now been divided are being voted on in suc- cession without intervening debate? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator is correct. Mr. HARTKE. This is the point I am making. Mr. President, I ask that I be permitted to proceed for 2 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator is recognized. Mr. HARTKE. I wish to speak on the time of the Senator from Kansas. Is it not true that during the last 15 years second- and third-class mail, which these amendments are directed to, have had an increase of 122 percent and 188 percent, respectively? Mr. MONRONEY. I think we wouldbe-I cannot exactly say. I can only say that this second-class nonprofit up to now is only paying 7 percent of the cost, and this would raise it to 9 percent of cost coverage. Mr. HARTKE. The Senator does not know how much the rate was increased in the last 15 years? Mr. MONRONEY. I cannot keep all of that information in mind. I know it has gone up from 1 cent to 27/ cents in 40 years in third class. The Senator is figuring percentages and when one figures percentages there is figured the fraction of a cent. You can get 60 percent by raising it a quarter of a cent, which does not make sense. Mr. HARTKE. These people can be put out of business. There are certain han- dling processes which are eliminated in third-class mail which the Post Office De- partment does not have to do, specifically including ZIP code. Is that correct? Mr. MONRONEY. The amount we raised over the present rates is 0.075 cent for in-county and nonprofit sec- ond class. I do not believe this is too much when one considers all that a post- man has to do. He has to carry this ma- terial the same as first-class mail, de- liver it to the right address and put it in the right box. The nonprofits can go across the country to Hawaii. By raising 0.007 cent, you have 9 percent. Mr. HARTKE. I thank the Senator, butthat is not in answer to the question I asked. However, it is all right. It is allright with me, but in order to put the question back in sequence with the an- swer, the question which I asked-- The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, I askthat I be permitted to proceed for 2 minutes. Mr. CARLSON. I yield 2 minutes. Mr. HARTKE. Is it not true in han- dling processes at the present time there are 14 separate operations generally decided to be the job of the Post Office Department on first-class mail?Mr. MONRONEY. I think it is some- thing like that, yes. It is in the hearings and the Senator can find it there. Mr. HARTKE. In third-class mail,there are nine operations by handlers. Mr. MONRONEY. We are not talking about junk mail. Mr. HARTKE. I am talking about third-class mail. Mr. MONRONEY. That is junk mail. The Senator is going from in-county in one debate to second-class and non- profit mail thereafter, and now we are on junk mail. Perhaps we could simplify the Sen- ator's understanding if we try to stay on one matter and get a unanimous-consent agreement to have a vote on each section of the bill. It is going to be confusing. Mr. HARTKE. I am not confused. Mr. MONRONEY. Let us talk about each of the sections in the bill and then we will have an intelligent approach. Mr. HARTKE. I am not confused. It was not the Senator from Indiana who requested the division. If the Senator from Oklahoma did not understand the question, that is one thing. I asked whether or not those proc- esses, which are ordinarily required of first-class mail, consist of some 14 of them, handled by mailers. Mr. MONRONEY. That was the testi- mony. That included every single phase of bringing it to the post office and so on. They had 39 processes and about six or seven more if they took the mail from the Printing Office. They are still charg- ing a great many of the operations to the mailers in the post office. It was about as phony as a $3 bill. Mr. HARTKE. I am not the one who complains about using time. I got my time from the Senator from Kansas and the Senator from Oklahoma is keeping all the time. Is it not true that there was a state- ment by the Postmaster General on Oc- tober 16 that ZIP code savings are aver- aging 0.2 of a cent and projected into 1968 this means there are annual savings of about $35 million and, using the words of the Postmaster General, were it not for that it is estimated expenses in 1968 would be $53 million higher. Mr. MONRONEY. Yes, but they are still losing $316 million on the operation at the old rate of 61-percent cost cover- age. At the present rate that does not pay for junk mail mailers. This is commercial mail and has nothing to do with public service. Why should it be passed on to first-class mail? Mr. HARTKE. I would be very glad to listen to a speech by the Senator from Oklahoma on his time. Mr. MONRONEY. The Senator asked the question. Mr. HARTKE. I asked if the Postmas- ter General made such a statement. Mr. MONRONEY. He did. He went on to say that the cost was not as much in savings and we do not approach the cost coverage by 75 percent. Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a parliamentary in- quiry? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. MONRONEY. I yield time.34244 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, a par- liamentary inquiry. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator will state it. Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, without taking time out of the amendment, which is 1 hour, I understand, one-half hour on each side, would it be possible by unanimous consent to have a rollcall on each part before we get to the second part? Could we vote on the first part and then discuss the second part and take a vote on that, and then the third vote in order that debate be confined in the 1-hour period? Can we do that by unanimous consent? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous-consent agreement under which we are operating presently may be amended and modified by subsequent unanimous consent. Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we take a roll- call vote without taking the time out of the time of the 1 hour on each part of the divided question. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair states that there already will be a rollcall on each part. Mr. PASTORE. I know, but the fact is that we are going to take them in suc- cession after the hour has expired. I want to interrupt the hour by taking the rollcall vote on each part as we debate it. Mr. CARLSON. Mr. President, I did not suggest the division. In view of the situation where we get three rollcall votes, I hope the suggestion of the Sena- tor from Rhode Island carries. I think we should do it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would say to the Senator from Rhode Island that he may, in his unani- mous-consent request, suggest that there be a period of time between each rollcall vote and then accomplish what he de- sires. Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 20 minutes be allotted on each one of the three parts, and at the termination of 20 minutes we take a rollcall vote without counting that as a part of the time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. CARLSON. Mr. President, reserv- ing the right to object, and I shall not object, everyone understands the issue and 20 minutes, 10 minutes to a side, if agreeable to the chairman of the com- mittee, is agreeable to me. Mr. MONRONEY. That is agreeable to me, but debate should be germane and it should not go all over the lot. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Who yields time? Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten min- utes to the Senator from Kansas [Mr. CARLSON], and 19 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. MONRONEY]. Mr. MONRONEY. Was the Senator from Indiana through? Mr. HARTKE. No, I was not. Mr. MONRONEY. We have not dis- cussed yet the matter on the first amend- ment we are going to vote on in the first division. I should like to get to that. Thenwe have the question of the second and the third. So let us take it section by sec- tion. I would hate to yield my time-the 19 minutes that I have-to discuss some- thing we are not going to vote upon for a half an hour or three-quarters of an hour. Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, a parlia- mentary inquiry. Mr. MONRONEY. Well, Mr. Presi- dent- The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Oklahoma yield to the Sen- ator from Indiana for the purpose of making a parliamentary inquiry? Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, the Sen- ator from Kansas yielded to the Senator from Indiana. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I will yield to the Senator from Indiana from time on the bill for his parliamentary inquiry. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Indiana will state it. Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, how can the Senator from Oklahoma have 19 minutes, when only 20 minutes are re- served for discusion of the amendment on both sides, with 10 minutes to a side? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The un- derstanding of the Chair was that there would be 20 minutes on the second and third part. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President- Mr. HARTKE. I do not care how much time he has. I am trying to find out something. I had understood, under the unanimous consent request, that there would be 20 minutes on each part. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Mr. HARTKE. On each part of the amendment, with the time to be equally divided, 10 minutes on a side. Am I in- correct in that statement? Mr. PASTORE. The Senator is cor- rect. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Mr. HARTKE. Then how can the Senator from Oklahoma have 19 min- utes when there are only 10 minutes per- mitted to each side? Mr. MONRONEY. On three votes I have 19 minutes left according to the Presiding Officer. The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is right. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, in order to allow the Senator from In- diana to- Mr. HARTKE. I do not care now-- Mr. MONRONEY. I yield him such time on the bill as he may wish, to pro- pound a question. Mr. HARTKE. I believe the Senator from Kansas yielded me 1 minute. I should be able to finish what I had in mind in that time. Mr. MONRONEY. I have so little time, I am glad to yield to the Senator from Indiana such time as he may desire from the time on the bill. Mr. HARTKE. I am not complaining. Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, we are wasting time. The Senator from Kansas [Mr. CARLSON] yielded 1 minute to the Senator from Indiana. He wants 1 min- ute, but he has used up 2 minutes. Let us get going. Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, in regardto the question of publications, Congress has consistently recognized that the \"postal service is a public service.\" The nonprofit second-class and third-class mail, to which this amendment applies, provide the advancement of education and culture, the dissemination of infor- mation, the distribution of articles of commerce and industry, provide a basis for communication of intelligence, and contribute materially to the growth of many commercial enterprises, the na- tional economy, and the public welfare- all of which contribute to making these classes of mail part of the public service. Many magazines of small circulation, such as the many educational, civic, trade union, and veteran publications are hit very hard by this bill. The committee bill provides for a 60-percent increase in the piece rate for nonprofit second-class mail, and the piece rate for in-county second-class mail. This would be cata- strophic to many publications which sur- vive on marginal revenues. In addition, the proposed increase is very discrimina- tory since the overall second-class rates will increase 20 percent and spread over a 3-year period. Mr. LAUSCHE. Mr. President, I should like to ask a question of the Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. MONRONEY. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Ohio. Mr. LAUSCHE. I questioned the Sena- tor from Oklahoma yesterday dealing with what the House did on this subject and what the Senate committee did. The Senator from Oklahoma answered that in cost coverage it has been 6.7 percent, that it will be 6.9 percent. The House bill pro- vided for 11 percent cost coverage so that the Senate bill has reduced the cost cov- erage by 2 percent. Is that a fact, I ask the Senator from Oklahoma? Mr. MONRONEY. The reason for that is the House bill had two classes. We de- termined to have one class because it is hard to distinguish the money-raising type of solicitation from the Christmas seals. Mr. LAUSCHE. On second class, on which we shall vote soon, we reduced the House figure by $1.7 million on the sec- ond class. That is, the Senate version is more beneficial to the nonprofit user than the House version. Mr. MONRONEY. That is correct. Mr. LAUSCHE. I thank the Senator. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, briefly, up until 1962, county publishers of small country newspapers were en- titled to mail free in the county. We raised that in 1962 to a small amount, at which time we acquired only a 13-percent cost coverage. In the new bill we raised it a little bit more and acquired 14-per- cent cost coverage. This is the very mini- mum because the loss this year was $70.9 million. It will still be pretty high on edi- torial associations, especially those spe- cializing in county newspapers who have supported the rate we have here. There- fore, I think it is quite proper that we divide the amendment, and that we de- feat the amendment, because the very users of this service through their na- tional organization have testified that they were satisfied with the rate the com-34245 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 mittee proposes here. Thus, I am ready to vote. This is an amendment that every- one can understand. The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has now expired under the first amend- ment, unless the Senator from Kansas has something to say, and then the Sen- ate will vote on it. So that the unanimous consent agree- ment may be thoroughly understood, the Chair informs the Senate that 20 min- utes has been allotted to each part of the amendment, with 10 minutes to each side on the second amendment, and then 20 minutes, with 10 minutes to each side, on the third amendment. Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, a parliamentary inquiry. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Montana will state it. Mr. MANSFIELD. I thought we had only one amendment, and that there was a 1-hour time limitation on that amend- ment, with the time to be equally di- vided? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Subse- quently, the amendment was divided under a subsequent unanimous-consent agreement. Mr. CARLSON. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute on the bill, if my time has expired on the amendment. The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Kansas is recognized for 1 minute. Mr. CARLSON. Mr. President, the is- sue is simple. As stated before, we can increase the rate for second-class mail on profit organizations 23 percent. We can take the nonprofit group sending through the same mail at an increase of 60 percent. My amendment would bring it back to the same provisions of second- class mail. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques- tion is on agreeing to the first part of the amendment of the Senator from Kansas. On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk pro- ceeded to call the roll. Mr. BYRD of West Virginia.

The additional revenue to be realized is $4.5 million. That may not sound like much to the distinguished senior Sena- tor from Indiana; but $4.5 million, when we are seeking to make up a tremendous loss, is, I think, a step in the right direc- tion; and I believe the increase is proper. The present loss on this class of mail is $126.2 million. The present cost coverage is only 7 percent. When we pass this in- crease, it will rise to only 9 percent, if the committee bill is approved. The Carl- son amendment would lower the mini- mum charge per item from one-fifth of a cent to one-sixth of a cent, and would restore the preferential low advertising schedule proposed by the House of Rep- resentatives. Mr. President, that is as simple as I can make it. The loss exists. I believe everyone is treated fairly in the bill, and I hope our friends on the other side of the aisle, who advocate economy and revenue coverage so strongly, will ask themselves how much longer the Post Office Department should continue to carry publications that will yield only one-sixth of a cent, and find it objec- tionable to increase that figure to one- fifth of a cent per item. Several Senators addressed the Chair. Mr. MONRONEY. I yield first to the Senator from Michigan. Mr. GRIFFIN. Mr. President, I am not sure how I shall vote on this matter; I should like to propound a question or two so that I may better understand it. Mr. MONRONEY. Yes, sir. Mr. GRIFFIN. In defining what is a nonprofit organization that would qual- ify for this special subsidized rate, am I correct in assuming that a political par- ty, or the campaign committee of a po- litical candidate, would not be a non- profit organization which would be en- titled to the special rate we are talking about now? Mr. MONRONEY. The answer to the question on political organizations 'is \"No.\" This class of mail includes publica- tions of religious, educational, scientific, philanthropic, agricultural, labor, vet- erans, and fraternal organizations, as well as the publications of associations of rural electrification cooperatives and one publication by the official highway or development agency of any State. Mr. GRIFFIN. If I may propose a fur- ther inquiry, if a labor organization sees fit to use its publication to extol the vir- tues of one candidate in a primary con- test, and attack the qualifications of an- other candidate, does the labor organi- zation thereby lose its special exemp- tion under this law? Mr. MONRONEY. I had the same ex- perience, on the same end, that the Sen- ator has in mind, when I first ran for the U.S. Senate. Mr. GRIFFIN. No, I am merely asking the question. Mr. MONRONEY. I know what the Senator means. This is what we call aJGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE throw-away, that has no paid circula- tion, a publication that circulates all over the State at a very low second-class rate. Mr. GRIFFIN. Am I to take it, then, that the answer is that the labor orga- nization does not lose its special exemp- tion, that it gets the subsidy regardless of how partisan it is? Mr. MONRONEY. I am afraid that is correct. Mr. GRIFFIN. And the other candi- date, whether he be an opponent of the same party in the primary, or of the opposite political party in the general election, will have to pay a higher rate in order to answer the charges circu- lated against him at the subsidized rate; is that correct? Mr. MONRONEY. He would probably have to buy advertising in a regular, profitmaking, second-class publication. That runs a good deal higher, although there are some advantages, one being the demonstration copies that the paper, if it has not used up its allotment, can use in a political campaign for a mug patch, and all that kind of thing. The bill would barely raise the rate on the class of publications we are talking about, and I think it is time to start. Fifteen-hundredths of a cent is not enough for such publications to pay, and I think it is high time we voted to raise it. I yield to the Senator from Ohio. Mr. LAUSCHE. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan developed the extraordinary privilege granted to the alleged nonprofit organizations such as a labor magazine. The answer is that that magazine can use its publication politi- cally and obtain the low postal rates provided for nonprofit organizations. My question is whether any nonprofit organization-whether religious, philan- thropic, labor, or otherwise-can use its magazine or periodical politically and still enjoy this very low rate provided in the pending bill? Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, this is a matter that we would have to take up with the Postmaster General and have hearings on. We come to the very delicate area involving the first amendment and freedom of the press when we decide what can and cannot be carried in the mail. If it is advertising-and it must be identified as advertising-it would then carry a separate rate. However, I do not know how to approach the question con- cerning news material that might be said to be slanted for this or that party. Mr. LAUSCHE. I take it that the an- swer of the Senator from Oklahoma is that if it is declared to be nonadvertis- ing material, the nonprofit organization issuing the periodical or magazine can attack a Senator or a Representative without limitation and still enjoy this low rate. Mr. MONRONEY. The Senator is ex- actly right. Mr. LAUSCHE. So that the Senator from State X, if he were attacked by a labor paper and if he wanted to answer that attack, would have to pay the nor- mal rate while the labor magazine would enjoy the benefit of this low rate on its postal service.34247 Mr. MONRONEY. Or he might acquire a low rate from another labor paper on the other side of the question or from a right-to-work organization. So it all washes out. Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. MONRONEY. I yield. Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from Okla- homa if the slightly higher rate con- tained in the committee bill is retained, what percentage of the cost of carrying this type of mail will be borne by the Government or the taxpayers? Mr. MONRONEY. Ninety-three per- cent of the cost will be borne by the Gov- ernment and 7 percent by the publisher under existing rates. If the committee amendment prevails, 91 percent will be borne by the Government and 9 percent by the publication. Mr. YARBOROUGH. If the committee amendment prevails, the Government or the people will still be paying 91 percent of the cost? Mr. MONRONEY. The Senator is ex- actly correct. Mr. YARBOROUGH. What amount of money will the carrying of this kind of nonprofit mail cost the Government? Mr. MONRONEY. The present annual loss to the Government is $126.2 mil- lion. And the present cost to the pub- lishers of such publications is 7 percent. It would be raised to 9 percent, and we would still be losing more than $120million. Mr. YARBOROUGH. We would still be losing more than $100 million on thiskind of mail? Mr. MONRONEY. The Senator is cor- rect. Mr. CARLSON. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute. The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Kansas is recognized for 1 minute. Mr. CARLSON. Mr. President, there has been a great deal of discussion about the contents of these articles and papers that are published by nonprofit organi- zations-religious organizations, Boy Scouts, and many other types of organi- zations. If the publication contains advertising material in excess of 10 percent, under the pending bill they have to pay the advertising rate. It gets to be a serious question as to whether we should try to limit an orga- nization and tell a church, a veterans' organization, or whatever the organiza- tion is, what they should put in the paper. That is their privilege under the Constitution. I sincerely hope that we will keep that in mind. We increase the rate for the second-class profit group of this coun- try 23 percent. And this nonprofit group gets a 60-percent increase. I think that is an excessive increase. It should not be any higher than the rate paid by the profit group. Mr. President, I yield back the re- mainder of my time. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. The VICE PRESIDENT. All time hav- ing expired, the question is on agreeing to the second part of the amendment of CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 the Senator from Kansas.

Mr. President, I am advised by the staff of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service that a tech- nical change should be made in the amendment that has just been approved.I ask unanimous consent that the staff be permitted to make the necessary tech- nical changes. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BREWSTER in the chair). Is there objec- tion? The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered. Mr. CARLSON. Mr. President, my un- derstanding is that the third section of the pending amendment is now up for debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Mr. CARLSON. Mr. President, I do not expect to take much time on this amendment. I believe the issues are well known to every member of the commit- tee. We had considerable debate and dis- cussion on it in the executive sessions of our committee. In fact, we had several 6-to-6 votes on it. I wish to comment briefly on the merits of the type of mailing involved and what the pending amendment pro- poses to do. Under the pending bill reported by the committee, the first year figure for third-class mail is listed as 3.6 percent, and the second year and thereafter as 4 percent. The amendment I offer would make one change. The figure for the first year would be the same, 3.6. The second year and thereafter, it would be 3.8, which is the figure contained in the House bill. The Senate increased the 3.8 to 4. My amendment, if approved, with a 2-phase stepup of 3.6 and 3.8, would re- duce the revenue $28 million. We will hear much discussion about a few large mailers in this country. We probably will hear about 13 or 15 great organizations that are abusing our mails by filling them with third-class mail. There are 275,000 third-class mailing permits in the United States. Every State has a large number of them, and they are owned by diverse groups, such as the Boy Scouts, Dr. Billy Graham, every charitable organization in the land, every corporation, every State govern- ment-the entire spectrum of our social and political life. Each Senator will find, if he checks into the matter, that many of these permits are issued to organiza- tions in his State. We will hear much discussion about this mail being dis- tributed by a few large corporations and organizations. This was brought out yes- terday. Let us consider the mailing permits in Emporia, Kans., a city of 15,000 or 20,000 people. The first one on the list is the Salvation Army, the second one is the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the third is the Gowther Junior High School, and on down the list. Also, the city of Em- poria, the American Legion, the United Christian Fellowship, Girl Scout Coun- cil, First Baptist Church, First Method- ist Church, the Messiah Lutheran Church. So when we hear a great deal of dis- cussion about third-class mail being used by only a few large mailers, Sena- tors should keep in mind that in their own communities, in every city in the Nation, charitable organizations use this mail in many instances to get messages to their members and to raise revenue. Many people do not realize that the U.S. Government itself is the largest user of third-class mail in the Nation.And judging from the samplings Ihave seen, some of the largest users ofthird-class mail are those very peoplewho attack it the most. Mr. President, third-class mail is thesmall merchant's medium for advertis-ing. The small businessman in our com-munities cannot buy a page in Life mag-azine or Look magazine, but he can usethird-class mail. Many businesses andmany stores have been built upon third-class mail. Ordinarily, the small mer-chant is the person who uses third-classmail. It is a medium which he can af- ford. It permits him to pinpoint his mar- ket and direct his message only to thosemost likely to respond to it. Obviously, the small merchant can- not afford to buy space in a large metro- politan daily or to buy time on a major television station. And if he could afford it, he would be wasting his money if he did use these media. Third-class mail is an advertising toolhe needs and should have. If we were to take that tool away from him we would virtually be driving the small busi- nessman out of his store and limiting the merchandising field to the huge chain stores which can .afford big league ad- vertising. The small independent merchant is having a tough enough time as it is. Let us not drive him to the wall by making his most effective means of advertising inaccessible to him. Then there is the rather foolish chargethat third-class mail is a useless medi- um of advertising-it is a waste of the advertiser's money-it just clutters up the mails and accomplishes nothing. Look at the growth figures for this type of mail. They tell the story of its ef- fectiveness. Bulk mail-third class-was created by the Congress in 1928 in response to a request from-not the advertising peo- ple of the United States, but from the Post Office Department itself. The De- partment needed something in the way of low-priority mail material to keep the work force occupied between peak hours. By 1946, the volume in this type of mail had risen to 4 billion pieces a year. In the succeeding 21 years-despite severerate raises-and despite the constant at- tacks of its critics-it has grown 500 per- cent, up to 20 billion pieces a year- and it is still growing-still performing a service for the Post Office-for the people-for the economy and for the people who use it. Mr. President, it would serve no use- ful purpose for me to discuss the matter at great length. The issue is simple. I would not reduce the rate substantially but from 4 cents to 3.8 cents, which is the House preference. Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. CARLSON. I yield. Mr. HARTKE. Is it not true that there are hundreds of thousands of handi- capped workers employed in third-class mail businesses? Mr. CARLSON. The Senator is correct. Mr. HARTKE. There are 4.5 million persons who depend on third-class mail for their livelihood. Is it not true that this mail has de- ferred treatment?34248 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE Mr. CARLSON. The Senator is cor- rect. Mr. HARTKE. We are not changing the priority because it is going at a lower rate. Mr. CARLSON. It Is handled by the Post Office Department after first-class mail and second-class mail is taken care of. Mr. HARTKE. They take care of this mail in slack periods and it is said that it sometimes takes 18 days for third- class mail to go from Washington, D.C., to the west coast. Is that correct? Mr. CARLSON. The Senator is cor- rect. Mr. HARTKE. I join the Senator from Kansas. I hope this minor adjustment in the bill can be achieved. Mr. CARLSON. I thank the Senator. Mr. AIKEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. CARLSON. I yield. Mr. AIKEN. Does the amendment of the Senator apply to seed catalogs? Mr. CARLSON. It would apply to that type business. Yes, it could. Mr. AIKEN. What about advertising material which is mailed in such enor- mous quantities by being slipped inside of a newspaper? Mr. CARLSON. That is not covered in this amendment, but we did not remove that. Mr. AIKEN. It seems to me that is about the biggest loss of revenue that the Post Office sustains when they drop from 18 cents to 3 cents a pound. Mr. CARLSON. The committee did not change that. We left it to be handled by the Post Office administratively. Mr. AIKEN. We will continue to get the Sears, Roebuck catalog. Sears, Roebuck is one of the biggest advertisers using that class. I am not complaining about it, but I am wondering if there will be any change in rate. Mr. CARLSON. There will not be. Mr. AIKEN. And they get the same rate as local newspapers? Mr. CARLSON. Inserts are left as they are at the present time. Mr. AIKEN. That is supposed to drum up business, I guess. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, this is the junk mail amendment. Of all the classes of mail we had to consider, I think that the lobbyists for the junk mail have been the most active and the most insistent in trying to bring pres- sure from every known pressure point. Their type lobbying and the morality of their lobbying, I think, leaves one of the blackest marks on the lobby echelon of any national trade association. The amendment here would cut $30 million from the bill. It would reduce new revenue by not making these purely advertising projects carry a little more toward the cost of handling. It would reduce the revenue in the Senate bill from $264 million a year by $30 million a year. This is in the face of the fact that already we are giving them a very un- usually low rate and their cost coverage of third-class mail today is 61 percent. With the amendments in the bill it would be 75 percent. The amendment we vote on would probably cut it to around 70 percent of cost coverage.This is a matter which I think disturbs many Members of Congress. I receive in the mail complaints about unwanted mail, unwelcome and nuisance junk mail. The matter of third-class mail is not a matter that is going to penalize anybody because the men fighting for the highly subsidized rate do not pay the postage. The advertisers pay the postage and be- cause postage is going up the lobbyists feel they may lose a few of the smaller mailings. All of their costs have gone up on paper and ink, and other costs of publication, and they want to keep the rates frozen and not raise them. It seems to me that this is a distinct subsidy for those people who are able to pay a pro- portionate part of their cost. Thirteen of the permit holders for this junk mail distribute each year 7 billion pieces of mail, against 82 billion pieces of mail for the total mailing of all of the United States and its Territories. It seems to me that we cannot feel that they are doing so badly. It seems to me that it is wrong for General Motors to be able to pay 4 cents to mail a stockholder's report to stockholders while it would cost anybody else 6 cents to send a letter from here to Los Angeles first class. We should raise the rate and we have not raised the rate in a way that would be harmful. I was in favor of going to a straight 4-cent minimum. That rate would be cheap enough. My dear friend from South Carolina [Mr. HOLLINGs] wanted to raise the rate to 4.5 cents. That would have been fair enough. We discussed this section longer than we discussed any other section in committee. The distin- guished senior Senator from Wyoming [Mr. MCGEE] proposed 4.2 cents as a single-step increase. I greatly admire his courage and leadership in this matter. Finally, the Senator from West Vir- ginia [Mr. RANDOLPH] came up with the proposal to raise the present rate from 2.87 cents, which is the figure they now pay, to 3.6 cents for the first year and 4 cents for the second year. The House bill made the 3.8 cents effective immedi- ately. I wanted a straight 4 cents effec- tive immediately. With the persuasion of the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. RANDOLPH] and the desire not to be injurious to anyone, we agreed to phase this for 2 years and to take .2 cent less than the House bill the first year but going .2 cent over and above the House so that we would reach a 4-cent minimum. This is a fair rate. We had a close, hard fight in the committee and many votes on this issue. It was due to the diligence, the patience, and the efforts of the Senator from West Virginia that we were able to reach agreement. He proposed the key idea which enabled the committee to arrive at a fair compromise-one which allows an adjustment period for the mail user and raises more revenue for the Depart- ment. I am grateful to the Senator from West Virginia for his assistance and good judgment on this matter. I do not recall how many lobbyists there were for General Motors, or how many there were for Procter & Gamble, those poor boys in Ohio, who came in and shed tears all over the carpet as tohow hard this would hit Procter & Gamble. Mr. President, I think the Senate is ready to vote. I wish to be realistic about the matter. I certainly feel we should eliminate the annual loss of $342 million. By this new bill we will be able to ma- terially reduce this by bringing in $264 million in additional revenue. Mr. President, I urge the defeat of the amendment of the Senator from Kansas. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do Sen- ators yield back their time? Who yields back time? Mr. MONRONEY. I yield such time as he may need to the Senator from West Virginia. Mr. RANDOLPH. Mr. President, in the hope that I shall please Members of the Senate at this late hour by speaking very, very briefly, rather than for several min- utes, I trust that the amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas [Mr. CARL- soN], the very able ranking minority member of our committee, a man with whom I am delighted to serve, and sup- ported equally by the distinguished Sen- ator from Indiana [Mr. HARTKE] will be defeated. The Post Office and Civil Service Com- mittee members considered my proposal, and the provisions I offered there for afair determination for increasing the rev- enue from this class of mail, over the House action, should commend itself to my Senate colleagues. I know so well of their fairness and justice as legislators. I could join the knowledgeable chair- man of our committee [Mr. MONRONEY]in further discussion of this importantmatter. I shall not do so. I shall stop now, expressing the hope that the amendment will be defeated by a decisive vote. Mr. CARLSON. Mr. President, every- one understands the issue: to increase the third-class rates, which I think are excessive in the context of the other in- creases we voted in the bill. It will cost $28 million. I would be less than frank if I did not say that. But in view of the choice of companies the Senator from Oklahoma used, whereas I mentioned a large number of organizations at the be- ginning of my preliminary statement, let me say that we heard a great deal about the 13 organizations and Procter & Gamble, but we did not hear anything about the First Baptist Church, the American Legion, or the other worthy organizations who use this type of mail to send out messages of importance. Mr. AIKEN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Kansas yield? Mr. CARLSON. I yield. Mr. AIKEN. Would the Senator tell us how much his amendment would re- duce the revenue? Mr. CARLSON. Twenty-eight million dollars. Mr. AIKEN. How much? Mr. CARLSON. Twenty-eight million dollars. Mr. MONRONEY. The committee fig- ures it at $30 million. Mr. AIKEN. That would run the war in Vietnam for about 9 hours, would it not? Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. Mr. CARLSON. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.34249 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATENovember 29, 1967 The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has now been yielded back.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendments offered by the Senator from Delaware will be stated. The legislative clerk proceeded to read the amendments. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres- ident, I ask unanimous consent that fur- ther reading of the amendments be dis- pensed with, and that they be printed at this point in the RECORD. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendments are as follows: On page 143, between lines 6 and 7, Insert the following: \"SEC. 225. (a) During any period in which the aggregate number of full-time civilian officers and employees (including the full- time equivalent of part-time employment) in the executive branch of the Government ex- ceeds the aggregate number employed on July 1, 1966, no vacancy in any office or position in any department or agency in the execu- tive branch of the Government resulting from the resignation, retirement, transfer, removal, or death of the incumbent of such office or position shall be filled, except pursuant to a determination of the Director of the Bureau of the Budget (hereinafter referred to as the 'Director') under subsection (b). \"(b) The Director shall make continuing studies of the personnel needs of the various departments and agencies of the Govern- ment during any period referred to in sub- section (a), and shall determine which of the vacancies occurring in such departments and agencies may be filled. Such determinations shall be so made that the aggregate number of vacancies filled during any calendar quarter, beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 1968, in the executive branch of the Government, shall not exceed 25 per centum of the aggregate number of vacancies occur- ring during such quarter. The determinations of the Director under this subsection shall be made on the basis of the relative needs of the various departments and agencies for person- nel, having in mind the importance to the national health, security, and welfare of their respective functions and activities. Such de- terminations may be made by such appropria- tion units or organization units as the Di- rector may deem appropriate. \"(c) The Director shall maintain a con- tinuous study of all appropriations and contract authorizations in relation to per- sonnel employed and shall reserve from ex- penditure the savings in salaries and wages resulting from the operation of this section, and any savings in other categories of ex- pense which he determines will result from such operation. \"(d) The departments and agencies in the executive branch shall submit to the Direc- tor such information as may be necessary to enable him to carry out his functions under this section. \"(e) The Director shall submit to the Senate and the House of Representatives at the end of each calendar quarter, beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 1968, a report of his activities under this section. \"(f) This section shall not apply to officers and employees in the Department of De- fense, the postal field service, and the Fed- eral Bureau of Investigation, to casual em- ployees, as defined by the Director, to employees employed without compensation, to offices filled by appointment by the Presi- dent by and with the advice and consent ofthe Senate, or to offices or positions filled bytransfer from another position within thesame or another department or agency, ex- cept that such employees, offices, and posi-tions shall be taken into consideration indetermining the aggregate number of officersand employees for the purposes of subsec.tion (a). \"(g) Nothing in this section shall super.sede or modify the reemployment rights ofany person under section 9 of the MilitarySelective Service Act of 1967, or any otherprovision of law conferring reemploymentrights upon persons who have performedactive duty in the Armed Forces.\" On page 135, after line 25, insert the fol-lowing: \"(5) Section 225 shall take effect on Janu.ary 1, 1968.\" PERSONAL STATEMENT OF SENATOR YOUNG OP NORTH DAKOTA Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres.ident, I yield 1 minute to the Senatorfrom North Dakota [Mr. YOUNG]. Mr. YOUNG of North Dakota. Mr.President, like most Members of theSenate, I thought Congress would ad-journ before December 1. As a result, Iaccepted an Invitation of long standing to speak at the annual convention of theOregon Wheat Growers League tomor- row morning in Portland. This means Ishall have to leave before the final vote ishad on this postal-pay raise bill. If I could be present for that vote, I would vote \"yea.\" In checking with many Members of the Senate, it appears thebill will pass with a big majority without my vote, and that my vote will not beneeded. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, the purpose of this amendment is to write into law the Executive order ofPresident Johnson as issued September 20, 1966. On September 20, 1966, Presi-dent Johnson issued an Executive order freezing Federal civilian employment atthe July 1, 1966, level.In that order he made certain exemp- tions as they would relate to the DefenseDepartment and the Post Office Depart- ment. Subsequently he mentioned an ex- emption for the FBI. This amendment is drafted to carry out the purpose and the objective of thatExectuive order, with the same exemp- tions as were embraced in President Johnson's original freeze order. Mr. MUNDT. Mr. President, will theSenator yield? Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield.Mr. MUNDT. I would like to raise thequestion, in harmony with the rest of theexemptions, as to whether we should not include the Central Intelligence Agency as well, because, with the exception ofthe Post Office, whose burden of workmust be carried out and which must havean appropriate number of employees toget through its work, all other exemp-tions deal with the security of the coun-try, either externally or internally. Itseems to me the Central Intelligence Agency would fit neatly the package ofother exemptions. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. The rea-son the CIA was not included is that it was not included in the President's origi-nal Executive order. I assume the Presi-dent had taken that into considerationand saw no need for the exemption. However, since the Senator from SouthDakota and other Senators mentionedit to me yesterday, I am advised thatwhether that Agency is in or out wouldmake no difference whatever because, as I understand it, the Agency has not in-creased the number of its employees. So,while I see no real purpose in putting it34250 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE in there would be no harm and nothing would be lost by including the Agency. Mr. MUNDT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield further? Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield. Mr. MUNDT. Due to the uneasy situa- tion around the world, it is impossible for the CIA to make a calculation of what its burdens are going to be. I won- der if the Senator would be willing to accept an amendment, at the end of line 13, on page 3, after the comma, to add the words \"the Central Intelligence Agency,\" and then continue as it is. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. The Sen- ator from South Dakota [Mr. MUNDT] and the Senator from Washington [Mr. JACKSON] have expressed concern, and even though, as I mentioned earlier, I do not think it is necessary, I do not see any harm to have the agency included. If it is going to make the two Senators feel better I would be willing to accept such an amendment. Mr. MUNDT. I wish the Senator would. It could be a wise precaution. It may not be necessary, but it is better to be on the side of prudence. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Very well. Mr. JACKSON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. MUNDT. I yield. Mr. JACKSON. I concur in the re- marks of the able Senator from South Dakota. I would hope the Senator will modify the amendment to exclude the Central Intelligence Agency. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. President, I so modify the amendment. On page 13, after the end-- Mr. MUNDT. To include that Agency among the exclusions. Mr. JACKSON. Yes, to include it in that list. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I modify the amendment on page 3, line 13, to add the Central Intelligence Agency with the other exclusions. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator has that right, and the modification is so ordered. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that President Johnson's Executive order of September 20, 1966, be printed in the RECORD at this point. There being no objection, the Execu- tive order was ordered to be printed in RECORD, as follows: EXECUTrVE OFFICE OF THE PRESI- DENT. BUREAU OF THE BUDGET, Washington, D.C., September 20, 1966. MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND ESTABLISHMENTS Subject: Fiscal year 1967 employment ceil- ings. 1. The President has directed that the head of each agency take necessary steps to: a. Hold employment In full-time perma- nent positions for the remainder of fiscal 1967 to a level at or below that prevailing as of July 31, 1966. (Those agencies whose employment is already above the July 31, 1966, figure should reduce their employment to the July 31 level as expeditiously as pos- sible by not filling vacancies.) b. Hold employment in temporary, part-time, or intermittent positions for the re- mainder of fiscal 1967 to a level at or belowthat prevailing as of June 30, 1966, except for meeting normal seasonal changes in agency workloads. In no event should suchemployment on June 30, 1967, exceed that on June 30, 1966. 2. These actions are an essential part of President Johnson's efforts to reduce Fed- eral expenditures. 3. Each agency head should make every effort to achieve the lowest possible level of employment. We must increase our pro- ductivity level of employment. We must in- crease our productivity, redeploy our per- sonnel, simplify our procedures and strip work to essentials in order to meet the em- ployment ceilings established by this memorandum. 4. In view of the personnel requirements involved in the Viet Nam conflict, the De- partment of Defense and the Selective Serv- ice System are specifically exempt from paragraph 1 of this memorandum. For these two agencies, employment ceilings heretoforein effect will remain in effect subject to ad- justment during review of the 1968 budget. 5. In the case of the Post Office, the June 30, 1967, employment ceiling established in the January budget review will remain in effect. 6. Requests for exception to the levels es- tablished by this memorandum will be pre- sented to the Director of the Bureau of the Budget by the agency head under the fol- lowing circumstances only: a. When the need for employment in- creases can be related directly to require- ments for Southeast Asia, or b. When employment increases are needed for new programs which were not in exist- ence on July 31, 1966, and for which appro- priations or other funds have been provided and have been apportioned by the Bureau of the Budget, or c. When employment increases are needed for emergency situations involving the pro- tection of life, property, or the national se- curity, or d. When transfers of functions from one agency to another or from headquarters to the field result in a need to adjust employ- ment levels. In any of the above cases, exceptions will not be requested until the agency head has determined that it iS clearly not possible to meet the required employment needs by re- deploying personnel from other areas so as to remain under the employment level estab- lished by this memorandum. Exceptions willnot be granted unless agencies clearly dem- onstrate that such shifts have been evalu- ated and that they are not feasible. CHARLES L. SCHULTZE, Director. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. President, as I stated earlier, this amend- ment would merely write into law the executive order as promulgated by Presi- dent Johnson on that date. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment. The yeas and nays were ordered. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. I believe 5 min- utes is sufficient for Senators to under- stand both sides of the question. This proposal is a meat-ax cut, com- ing after the Appropriations Committee of the Senate, led by our great chair- man, the Senator from Arizona [Mr. HAYDEN], has managed to reduce by $5 billion, so far this year, the total appro- priations that we have made. I say that $5 billion is a good, substan- tial cut, and was not easy to arrive at. So I surrender to no one when it comes to trying to reduce Government expenses. I wish to see the total number of em-ployees reduced as much as possible; but I do not believe we can roll back the ceiling to July 1966, and say \"This will be your employment ceiling, and you are to reach it by attrition, not hiring replace- ments for those who quit or take other jobs,\" because there are certain agen- cies, certain demands, and dozens of pro- grams that have been created by our own legislation which the agencies are re- quired to staff. I might mention a few that have not been considered, which would have ex- actly zero employees if the ceiling the distinguished Senator from Delaware proposes were imposed. One such is the great Department of Transportation, which was created only last year. Its op- erations, today, include all of the FAA, which employs some tens of thousands of very skilled, able, and competent per- sonnel. With the increasing air traffic today, I personally know of the desperate con- dition we are getting into, to find ade- quate air traffic controllers, weather ex- perts, mechanical investigators, and safety inspectors of all kinds. The Sen- ator's amendment would not give them any ceiling whatever, because the De- partment of Transportation is an en- tirely new organization, and there is nothing in the amendment, as I read it, that would transfer whatever ceiling the FAA had to the Department. This is a kind of meat ax, quick-on- the-trigger proposal, which says, in ef- fect, \"Let us do it and get it over with.\" We shall continue to cut expenses, of course, but let us try to do so without having to cut into such programs as medicare, for which people must be re- cruited to staff the medical programs we have instituted since July 1966. The Veterans' Administration must face the burden of the tremendous load of the 125,000 men, who have thus far been wounded in Vietnam, who will initially be treated, of course, in Gov- ernment and military hospitals, but at some point they will have to be trans- ferred to civilian hospitals. The am- putees and the handicapped must be cared for on a long-term basis, in addi- tion to those who continue to come in. The GAO-with the rocketing of our procurement of military hardware, we know from past experience how difficult it is to keep track of the gypping, the defrauding, and the padding of costs in this vast $75 billion military affairs en- terprise for which we are appropriating the funds-would also be rolled back, if attrition occurs, to their July 1966 level. We have passed, in the last year and the year before, which would not be under this ceiling, the greatest educational pro- gram of assistance to the school districts of America and to the poverty-stricken areas of America ever instituted, which will involve the expenditure of billions of dollars. Yet this amendment, because the program did not exist before in HEW, and did not have a personnel ceiling as of July 1, 1966, would require that any- body who quits could not be replaced, because the ceiling is so low. Mr. President, I just jotted these items down in 2 minutes, after I heard the amendment read. To agree to an amend- ment such as this would get us into a34251 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 meat-ax type of operation, which has no place here. There is a place for it on ap- propriation bills. There is a place for it in a separate resolution, if the Senator will spend more time with his proposal, work the flaws out of it, and bring it to the floor. The distinguished Senator from Dela- ware has offered seven or eight amend- ments, I think, thus far. I cannot under- stand why he does not come before the committee and give us a chance to study these matters. That is why we had open hearings. The Senator would have been most welcome. But on not one of his amendments did the Senator from Delaware come before the committee to explain what he sought to do. Instead, we must face them on the floor of the Senate, and, in 15 or 20 minutes, are asked to revolutionize the entire operation of the Government by rolling back to July 1966, without know- ing what agencies will be affected. We just had the CIA added on the floor. My fellow Senators, if we wish to roll back the ceiling, let us do it with a sur- geon's scalpel, and not with a meat ax. I urge that the amendment be rejected. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres- ident- The PRESIDING OFFICER. How much time does the Senator from Dela- ware yield himself? Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield myself 4 minutes. The Senator from Oklahoma has ex- pressed concern because these amend- ments were not first considered by his committee. I, too, am concerned that they were not. I call his attention to the fact that four of the amendments I have offered here today were submitted to his committee, and I thought they would be considered by the committee. I suggest that if they did not consider them that is not my fault; it is their fault. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield. Mr. MONRONEY. Did the Senator ask for a minute of time to come by and ex- plain them to the committee? Are we supposed to salute and obey if we re- ceive a letter? We would like to have the author, if he wants an amendment corsidered, ex- plain it to the committee. During my 17 years in the Senate, that is a courtesy I have come to think proper, and to expect of the author of an amendment. But ap- parently the Senator thinks just a letter, or sending a copy of the amendment, is all that is necessary. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. President, the amendments were before the committee. I had the greatest spon- sor of them all, the President of the United States. This was President John- son's proposal, and he is a member of the same political party as the chairman of the committee. Certainly they are not telling me that no Democratic member of the committee read the President's Executive order of September 20, 1966, which was printed in detail in every newspaper in the country. Copies of his Executive order were sent to the committee. Am I now being told that this so-called Presidential freeze or- der on civilian employment in the Gov-ernment was not even read by committee members? President Johnson made a solemn promise in that statement to roll back Federal employment to the level of July 1, 1966. As a matter of fact, he has made a series of such promises. Let us review the record. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD an editorial pub- lished in a Camden, N.J., newspaper on December 30, 1963, wherein President Johnson was quoted at that time as stat- ing: There will be fewer Federal employees in 1964 than in 1963, President Johnson prom- ises. There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: JOHNSON'S FEDERAL JOB CUT ORDER There will be fewer Federal employes in 1964 than in 1963, President Johnson promises. The promise is definite and explicit though the President does not yet say and doubtless does not know how large the reduction will be. It is a part of his general economy pro- gram and budget-cutting drive. Johnson discloses that in the last three years Federal employment has increased by 131,000 jobs. He notes that it has been a de- cade since it showed a decline. In an order to all heads of departments and agencies, the President says the budget di- rector will shortly notify them of maximum employment levels they must enforce for the fiscal years of 1964 and 1965. He tells them to make personal examinations of the Job situa- tion and to \"establish new end-of-year tar- gets\" below the budget director's figures. He emphasizes that these figures are ceilings, not goals. Once he approves the department heads' new targets, they are not to be ex- ceeded without his specific approval. Coupled with the reduction in jobs, John- son tells the executives to turn their atten- tion to \"tighter management, redeployment of personnel, simplification of procedures, and stripping work to essentials.\" In other words, to getting more work out of jobholders. And he orders quarterly reports to him, beginning April 1, \"on what you have ac- complished under this effort.\" The order follows earlier actions toward governmental economy initiated by the President, including the Defense Depart- ment's decisions to curtail the number of U.S. military bases and to scrap the Dyna- Soar spacecraft project. It Is known that he has other programs in mind, including our administration of foreign aid. It is refreshing to see a President so econ- omy-minded and acting personally to give the taxpayers more value for their dollar, and particularly his effort to get more value out of their salary dollar from Federal em- ployes, whose jobs in many instances in- volve duplication of work, featherbedding and goldbricking. Many people have the impression-justi- fied or not-that as a party the Democrats are less interested in governmental economy than the Republicans. President Johnson seems to be moving energetically to erase that impression. In doing so he takes considerable wind out of the sails of the Republicans, who have been planning to make governmental economy an issue in 1964. After announcing his job reduction order to an informal press conference at his Texas ranch, the President was asked by one re- porter, \"How big is the total reduction to be in Federal employment?\" Replying that he could not yet give specific figures, Johnson asked, \"Isn't it just enough that we cut it? You don't know how hard that was.\"But anyone familiar with government andpolitics has a good idea of how hard it musthave been, and will agree that even a smallcut will reverse an alarming long-term trendand will be better than none. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. President, what a promise. But what happened? The number of employees crept higher. Then in December of 1965, speaking from Texas, President Johnson issued another Executive order. Againhe expressed his great concern over the large number of Federal employees and said that he was going to cut the num- ber by 25,000 during that fiscal year. I ask unanimous consent that the ar- ticle concerning that interview as pub- lished in the New York Times be printed at this point in the RECORD. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: [From the New York Times, Dec. 2, 1965] PRESIDENT BACKS A CUT IN U.S. JOBS- APPROVES PLAN TO RETIRE 25,000-SPENDS QUIET DAY AUSTIN, TEX., December 1.-President Johnson approved this afternoon a plan that could eliminate 25,000 Government jobs. The plan, contained in a memorandum from the Budget Bureau and released here,instructs the heads of Government depart- ments and agencies to reduce their employ- ment by 1 to 1.25 per cent by the end of the fiscal year 1966, which ends next June 30. Joseph Laltin, assistant White House press secretary said the plan did not mean that present employees would be dismissed. It is designed, he said, to take advantage ofstepped-up retirement from Government jobs. These retirements have been increasing because of a new law offering certain In- ducements, including larger pensions, to em- ployees who retire before the first of the year. \"The vacancies thus created,\" the mem- orandum said, \"present an opportunity to take new specific action to carry out the President's long-standing instructions to hold Federal employment at the minimum necessary to carry out Government oper- ations effectively.\" The President spent a quiet day at his ranch studying reports and preparing for a meeting tomorrow with Secretary of Agri- culture Orville L. Freeman and Secretary of State Dean Rusk. The main topic at the meeting is ex- pected to be the world food situation and Mr. Johnson's forthcoming talk with Presi- dent Mohammad Ayub Khan of Pakistan. Mr. Rusk is expected to join Mr. Johnson and Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara for a discussion of world problems this weekend or early next week. The White House announced yesterday that this meet- ing would be held tomorrow or Friday. How- ever, officials explained today that ad- ministrative work at the Pentagon would keep Mr. McNamara in Washington longerthan expected. The President also spoke by telephone with his special assistant for national securi- ty affairs, Mr. McGeorge Bundy. Mr. Laitin, in response to a question, said that the sub- ject of Mr. Bundy's future had not been discussed and that, to the best of his knowledge, the two men had never dis- cussed it. Mr. Bundy has been offered a post as head of the Ford Foundation. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres- ident, after that second historic state- ment in December of 1965, promising to cut back the number of Federal em- ployees by 25,000, we find that by the following July 1, instead of cutting the34252 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE payroll, the President had added 187,506 employees. These 187,000 em- ployees are costing the taxpayers over $1.5 billion annually. In September 1966, a couple of months before the election, the President again got concerned and issued an Executive order announcing that he was freezing employment at the July 1966 level. I have just had a copy of that Execu- tive order printed in the RECORD. What happened this time? Since that Executive order was issued the President has added 185,393 more employees. I appreciate the President's great ex- pression of concern for economy. I ap- preciate his speeches and his promises of economy as much as any American; however, we are about to go broke as a result of that kind of economy. Each time the President expresses concern over the number of employees he just adds an- other 100,000 to 200,000 employees. The Senator from Oklahoma said that this is a buggy amendment or a meat-ax approach. If it is so it is a Texas meat ax. I am using the same ax that was presented by the President of the United States. It is a good Texas ax, and if the President of the United States is ap- proaching the economy with a meat-ax approach perhaps he thinks we need this kind of meat-ax approach. If, as the Senator from Oklahoma claims, the amendment has bugs I re- mind him that they are not mine; they are Texas bugs. The pending amendment would merely write into the law what the ad- ministration says, and surely the Presi- dent meant it. Surely the Senators on the other side of the aisle have enough confidence in their own President to think that he was on the level when he promised this cutback in Federal em- ployment. Certainly we have established some new agencies. The President knows about those agencies, and in his Executive order he provided that the Budget Direc- tor could transfer employees to these new agencies. The Transportation Agency was men- tioned. We have created a new transpor- tation agency. They had 53,000 em- ployees, but we transferred 43,000 of those employees from the Department of Commerce. Under the pending amendment thePresident can transfer employees from agency to agency and make the cutbacks wherever he sees fit in line with his own Executive order. The pending amendment would not cause the firing of a single Government worker. There is no time limit here. The measure merely states that at the end of every 3-month period, three out of every four normal resignations or retirements must be eliminated until the July 1, 1966, level of employment has been reached. They can appoint one-fourth of all nor-mal resignations and retirements. That gives them a chance to continue in operation. If they have a specialistthat resigns they can hire another one. This same language has been adopted in the law heretofore. It has been done many times before when Congress andthe administration were really serious on curtailing expenditures.I have too much respect for the man in the White House to say that he was not serious when he issued his Execu- tive order of September 20, 1966. Surely the President of the United States was serious, and surely his political party will back him in this Executive order. Surely Democratic Members of the Sen- ate will not try to discredit him by say- ing that the President was using an ir- responsible meat-ax approach or had a buggy idea when he said he was trying to cut back on Federal employment. Let us proceed on the premise that he was serious and help him roll back the number of Federal employees in the exact manner in which he said he wanted to do it. If, on the other hand, those on the other side of the aisle think the Presi- dent was not sincere and that his state- ment of September 20, 1966, was just so much political poppycock, they should vote against the amendment and then tell the American people that the Presi- dent really did not mean it. Then let us cut out this political malarky of saying the administration is for economy when it is not. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Oklahoma is recognized for 2 minutes. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, the President does not need a bill to effec- tuate economy. He is trying to effectuate economy. Everyone knows that the war has escalated and that we have more employment in the Government as a re- sult of it. The situation affects other agencies than the Department of De- fense. However, those figures are also Department of Defense figures. I think the President can and should and will effectuate a reduction in Fed- eral employment by the use of a sur- geon's knife and not by the meat-ax Wil- liams approach. He will do so because he does not have to come to Congress with relation to the number of employees in each agency and have the figure fixed in concrete, by reason of attrition, and fill one job for every four positions that have become vacant by reason of resig- nation or retirement. The proposal is dangerous. It would put the Government in a straitjacket. We have cut appropriations by $5 billion so far this year. I am proud of the job that the Appropriations Committee has done. It will do a lot more and will reduce per- sonnel far more for the purpose of econ- omy than would the Williams amend- ment. I think the Williams amendment should be rejected. It is dangerous, harm- ful, and unworkable. It is a rigid piece of legislation to apply in a country during a wartime economy when the country needs production in the way of admin- istration and the auditing of accounts and things that are so vitally necessary to protect the country because of the great war expenditure that is required. I ask for the rejection of the amend- ment. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 1 minute.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. President, I have said enough in support of the amendment. Frankly, I was con- fident that the amendment would be unanimously agreed to, with the sup- port of those on the other side of the aisle. I am surprised that my good friend,the Senator from Oklahoma, would de- scribe an Executive order of the President of the United States, a man representing his own political party, as being an ir- responsible meat-ax approach. I am sur- prised that the Senator used all those un- complimentary adjectives. Even as a member of the minority party I havemore respect for the President than to charge that he would issue an Executive order solely for political purposes andthat he never had any intention of im-plementing it. But perhaps they have a reason. What has happened every time the Presidenthas put such an Executive order into ef- fect? When in December 1965 the Presi-dent promised that for the remainder ofthat fiscal year he would cut Federal em- ployment by 25,000 he added 187,526 em- ployees to the payroll. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr.President, I yield myself 1 additionalminute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. TheSenator from Delaware is recognized for1 additional minute. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr.President, when the President announcedhis freeze order of September 20 insteadof holding the line, he added another 185,393 employees within the next 12months. The Secretary of the Treasury, Mr.Fowler, is before the House Ways andMeans Committee today promising thatthe President is again going to cut theFederal payroll. I shudder to think whatwill happen this time when he promisesto reduce employment by Executiveorder. Our experience has been that he addsanother couple of hundred thousandevery time. That is what I want to cor-rect. If they do not mean it then theyshould stop talking about it and tell theAmerican people the truth.These false promises of economy arecontributing to this credibility gap bothhere at home as well as abroad. Mr. MUNDT. Mr. President, will theSenator yield? Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield. Mr MUNDT. Mr. President, I think theSenator from Oklahoma misinterpretsthe amendment of the Senator from Del-aware. He said this would be a rigid pieceof legislation. As I read the amendment, it is simply applicable to the aggregate population ofFederal employees. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. The Sen- ator is correct. Mr. MUNDT. And the President has a perfect right to shift the employees from an understaffed department-if he can conceivably find one-to a new depart- ment. There is nothing rigid about it ex- cept the setting of a top limit. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. The Sen- ator is correct. Likewise, the amendment34253 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 would not place any time limit as to when they must reach this July 1, 1966, objective. They reach it in the normal manner through resignations and retire- ments. If it takes 6 months, a year, or 2 years, they ultimately reach their objec- tive. However, they must continuously move in the direction of dropping back to the July 1, 1966, level of Federal employ- ment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres- ident, I yield myself 1 additional minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Delaware is recognized for 1 additional minute. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. This amendment is in line with what the Bu- reau of the Budget will need to imple- ment this Executive order. This is in line with what was promised in the Septem- ber 20 Executive order. Certainly my Democratic colleagues will not charge that that was not an irresponsible ac- tion on the part of the President. I do not so characterize it. Mr. MUNDT. It seems to me that the way the Senator has described it, the Senator could not possibly have done anything to direct a reduction of the Fed- eral payroll with a greater degree of flex- ibility. I do not see how anyone could grant any more Executive authority than the Senator has. He provides that this will be the top bracket and that the ad- ministration can do this in accordance with the job that needs to be done. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. The Sen- ator is correct. He can move these em- ployees around. They have complete jurisdiction to do it. The point that concerns me is that we are dealing with a bill that will ulti- mately cost about $2.5 billion annually. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres- ident, I yield myself 1 additional minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Delaware is recognized for 1 additional minute. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres- ident, each 1-percent increase in Federal taxes across the board brings in about $900 million. A 3-percent increase in taxes across the board would be required to pay for this bill. We must take some constructive step to hold the cost of this Government down. I believe the least the Senate can do is to support the amendment. Surely this is one of the most responsible amend- ments I have ever offered. In fact, I was inclined to offer it on behalf of both my- self and President Johnson, but I would not be so presumptuous. However, I ap- preciate the honor of upholding his hand in the Senate, where apparently he has so few friends. The adoption of this amendment will achieve a reduction in the cost of Gov- ernment totaling at least $1.5 billion annually. Whether the President was serious ornot, let us take him at his word. At leasthe cannot object. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, Iyield myself 2 minutes. As I read the amendment offered bythe distinguished senior Senator fromDelaware, I see no relationship in lan- guage or plan or program to that of Pres- ident Johnson. I do not believe it is proper to say that this is the President's bill, when it bears only the handiwork and the usual degree of misaccuracy and miscalculation we sometimes find in con- gressional drafted legislation, instead of the skills of trying to use executive power through well-trained budget groups to effectuate these ceilings. Even the distinguished Senator, who pointed out how flexible it was in an in- terchange between agencies, thought it was necessary to exempt the CIA so that they would not be left short in their un- dercover work. The author does not con- sider it to be flexible, or he would not have included the Department of De- fense or the Federal Bureau of Investi- gation. This proves to me that he does not know exactly what departments will be crippled. So he singles out these few which will not be crippled, and he leaves all the others, no matter how enlarged or how important their program might be, to the vagaries of what the overall amendment might happen to be. Again, this is a meat-ax approach, a typical operation for a quickie amend- ment to vitally affect, in a dangerous way, the economy and the operation of this vast Government of ours. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I take 1 minute to call attention to the fact that the reason the Department of Defense and the postal service were excluded is that they, along with the FBI, were a part of the President's recommenda- tions. At the time the suggestion was made about the CIA, I said it did not make any difference whether it was in or out. Under the rules they could handle it, but if the Senator from South Dakota felt differently, it did not make any dif- ference, and I accepted his suggestion. The reason these others were included is that the President had them in his recommendations, and I was trying to repeat what was in his order. Now as to this being called a meat-ax approach-if it is a meat-ax approach, it is a good old Texas meat-ax that should be put into law. I hope the Senator will join me in ac- complishing this. If, as the Senator from Oklahoma states, this amendment has the \"usual degree of misaccuracy miscalculation\" I remind him that he is talking about a proposal first made by President John- son. This was the President's own proposal. Mr. MONRONEY. Will the Senator tell the Members of Congress why he has ex- cluded the National Security Agency, one of the larger agencies, which is not in- cluded in the list of protected agencies? The Senator has missed many things he is trying to protect, and in this meat- ax approach, the National Security Agency has no more protection than the poverty program. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BAYH in the chair). The time of the Senator has expired. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield myself 1 additional minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The dis- tinguished Senator from Delaware has no time remaining.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yieldmyself 5 minutes on the bill. Mr. HOLLAND. Mr. President, will theSenator yield for a question? Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I shouldlike to complete my statement first.The reason these certain agencies wereexcluded and others were not is that Ifollowed the pattern outlined in the Pres-ident's Executive order. If the Senator desires to know whythe President did not include the otheragencies his relationship is closer withthe President than mine, and I suggestthat he ask the President. I would ap-preciate it also if the next time he meetsthe President he tell him that I am go- ing to try to persuade enough of hisfriends in Congress to uphold his hand by getting his Executive order writteninto law. Mr. HOLLAND. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question? Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield. Mr. HOLLAND. What provision is made, under the proposed amendment, for filling vacancies in the Post Office De- partment? Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. The Post Office Department can fill its vacancies without regard to the one-in-four for- mula under the President's Executive order. However, at the end of each quar- ter the Director of the Budget Bureau would certify, for example, that they have had 500 resignations and retirements and that they had reduced the Federal pay- roll by 375. The 125 could be filled in or transferred to any department, and they could be transferred among the agencies. They would have a free hand, as they have without this amendment. That is the way the President had suggested it in his Executive order. With respect to the Post Office Depart- ment, I suppose the reason he exempted that agency is that it has a certain amount of seasonal activity. Such sea- sonal activities were exempted under his order. Mr. HOLLAND. Does this mean that only one out of four vacancies in the Post Office Department can be filled? Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. No, not at all. It means that one out of four of the aggregate number of Federal em- ployees can be filled each quarter. But they can fill them as they see fit and in whichever agency they see fit. They have complete flexibility to interchange and work around the agencies. Mr. HOLLAND. In other words, in filling the Post Office vacancies to keep the service going-there are thousands of vacancies that occur every year due to retirement or other causes-the other agencies can be impoverished as to their employees in any way that the Bureau of the Budget suggests? Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. That is the President's Executive order, and that is provided for in this amendment. Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield. Mr. CURTIS. I call attention to the fact that the Senator's amendment ex- cludes the postal field service. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Yes. Mr. CURTIS. Line 13, page 3. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware.

The Sen- ator made that statement a moment ago. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back? Mr. MONRONEY. I yield back the re- mainder of my time. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I ask for the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques- tion is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Delaware. On this question the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. BYRD of West Virginia.

Mr. MANSFIELD. I thank the Senator. PROGRAM-UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT Mr. DIRKSEN. Mr. President, I wish to ask the distinguished majority leader whether he can ascertain how many amendments may still be called up, and as to the business for the balance of the day after we finish the instant bill. Mr. MANSFIELD. I am delighted to furnish what information I have at my disposal. It is my understanding that the dis- tinguished Senator from Indiana [Mr. HARTKE] may have an amendment which possibly will be acceptable to the com- mittee. I further understand that the distinguished Senator from Maryland [Mr. BREWSTER] has an amendment, and that he is willing to agree to a 10-minute time limitation, 5 minutes to each side. Mr. President, I formally make that request for the 10-minute time limita- tion in connection with the Brewster amendment which will be the next amendment to be proposed. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MANSFIELD. Does the Senator from Texas have an amendment? Mr. YARBOROUGH. I have an amend- ment, but I shall not request a rollcall vote. Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, there is one other amendment to be offered by the distinguished senior Senator from Texas [Mr. YARBOROUGH], and one amendment to be offered by the distin- guished senior Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. MONRONEY], the manager of the bill, none of which, I understand, will take very long. Therefore, I think we can reasonably anticipate that about 6 o'clock we should be able to approach final passage. Cer- tainly third reading should occur by that time, unless something develops. Mr. President, this bill is to be fol- lowed by Calendar No. 793 (H.R. 13510) the military pay bill. At least that meas- ure will be laid down tonight. Whether it is taken up will depend on the duties and responsibilities which the distinguishedSenator from Georgia [Mr. RUSSELL] has at that time. Mr. DIRKSEN. I thank the Senator. Mr. MANSFIELD. I do not believe that I gave the whole schedule insofar as it could be accomplished, so I think I had better do it now. Following the disposition of the mili- tary pay bill, Senate Resolution 180, the U.N. resolution on Vietnam will be taken up. Then, it is hoped, some time late to- morrow afternoon, it will be possible to take up various conference reports which will be coming over from the House. MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE A message from the House of Repre- sentatives by Mr. Bartlett, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House had agreed to the report of the com- mittee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the amend- ment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 8629) to amend the act of July 4, 1966 (Public Law 89-491). The message also announced that the House disagreed to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 12144) to clarify and otherwise amend the Meat Inspection Act, to provide for coopera- tion with appropriate State agencies with respect to State meat inspection pro- grams, and for other purposes; agreed to the conference asked by the Senate on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon, and that Mr. POAGE, Mr. GATHINGS, Mr. FOLEY, Mr. PURCELL, Mr. BELCHER, Mr. TEAGUE of California, and Mrs. MAY were appointed managers on the part of the House at the conference. ENROLLED BILL SIGNED The message further announced that the Speaker had affixed his signature to the enrolled bill (H.R. 8629) to amend the act of July 4, 1966 (Public Law 89- 491). POSTAL REVENUE AND FEDERAL SALARY ACT OF 1967 The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill (H.R. 7977) to adjust certain postage rates, to adjust the rates of basic compensation for certain officers and employees in the Federal Govern- ment, and to regulate the mailing of pandering advertisements, and for other purposes. AMENDMENT NO. 477 Mr. BREWSTER. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I askthat it be stated. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be stated. The assistant legislative clerk pro- ceeded to read the amendment. Mr. BREWSTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered, and, without objection, the amendment will be printed in the RECORD. 34256 CO] The amendment, ordered to be printed in the RECORD, is as follows: On page 143, line 7, insert the following: \"SEC. 225. (a) Section 5102(b) of title 5, United States Code, is amended to read as follows: \"'(b) Except as provided by subsections (c) and (d) of this section, this chapter ap- plies to all civilian positions and employees in or under an agency, including positions in local boards and appeal boards within the Selective Service System and employees oc- cupying such positions.' \"SEC. 2. So much of section 10(b) (4) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act (50 App. U.S.C. 460(b)) as precedes the words 'That any officer' is amended to read as follows: '(4) to appoint, and to fix, in accordance with the classification provi- sions of title 5, United States Code, the compensation of such officers, agents, and employees (including employees of local boards and appeal boards) as he may deem necessary to carry out the provisions of this title: Provided,'. \"SEC. 3. The rate of basic pay of each em- ployee appointed to a position in a local board or in an appeal board within the Selec- tive Service System prior to the effective date of this Act shall be adjusted, as of such date, as follows: \"(1) If the rate of basic compensation of such employee is equal to any scheduled rate for the grade to which the position of such employee is allocated, such rate of basic compensation shall be the new rate of basic compensation for such employee; \"(2) If the rate of basic compensation of such employee is less than the minimum scheduled rate for the grade to which the position of such employee is allocated, such minimum rate shall be the new rate of basic compensation for such employee; \"(3) If the rate of basic compensation of such employee falls between any two sched- uled rates for the grade of which the posi- tion of such employee is allocated, the higher of such two rates shall be the new rate of basic compenstlon for such employee; and \"(4) If the rate of basic compensation of such employee is greater than the maximum scheduled rate for the grade to which the position of such employee is allocated, such rate of basic compensation shall be the new rate of basic compensation for such em- ployee. \"SEC. 4. This Act shall take effect at the beginning of the first pay period which be- gins more than ninety days after the date of enactment of this Act.\" Mr. BREWSTER. Mr. President, my amendment pertains to clerks of the Se- lective Service System working in the local appeal draft boards. As we all know, because of the situation in Viet- nam, our draft boards are very active. These clerks perform a very valuable service to all Americans. These clerks in the draft boards serve fulltime capac- ity as Federal employees performing a valuable service for all America. Prob- ably there is no more important thing for the young men of our country than the decision whether they will be drafted into the armed services. However, the clerks are paid not as regular Federal employees but on some arbitrary system depending upon what someone else may determine to be the prevailing rate in their own community. They are not covered under the clas- sified service. They have no classified rating. Time and again they have pe- titioned Congress that they be included in the classified service. Here we are passing a bill which will substantially increase the salaries ofNGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE Federal employees, but we fail to take into account or to recognize the very fine service being rendered by the draft board clerks. My amendment would simply include them in the Federal service and classify them and give them the benefits of this pay raise. I think this is a perfectly fair request on their part, and I ask the chairman of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service if he would accept the amendment and take it to conference. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I should like to accept the amendment, but I fear that this is a questionable area. The Selective Service System and its ad- ministrators find themselves opposed to including these clerks in the Federal Civil Service system. Most of the draft boards are run by officials appointed and desig- nated by the States. The comparability of pay is more or less in line with that paid to State and local employees rather than Federal postal employees and those under the classified civil service. It seems to me that, at this time, it should be authorized by legislation and taken out as a separate bill. I would be very glad, because I know of the distinguished Senator's longtime interest in this problem to assign such a bill to a subcommittee, hopefully to call it before the subcommittee early and have some testimony taken on it, to find out what the cost would be and other aspects of the problem. Accordingly, at this time, I would rather not take the amendment-especi- ally at this late hour-not take a step this far without having had testimony and some knowledge of what we are doing, since it involves about 7,500 local clerks in draft boards who are today earning a nationwide average of $4,700. I am aware that they will probably re- ceive an increase which will result in about a 17-percent pay increase for them by administrative action. Therefore, I would have to oppose the amendment. I would be very much in favor of a hearing to explore the subject in the Subcommittee on Civil Service, in which my distinguished colleague is one of the most energetic and ranking mem- bers. Mr. BREWSTER. Mr. President, of course, I am pleased that the chairman of the committee has indicated he would like to take up the measure at a later date, if it is not adopted now. But I do request the chairman to take the meas- ure to conference because I think it would be entirely fair and equitable. I think the request of the clerks merely to be treated as any other Federal em- ployee is certainly fair. I would ask the Senate to consider my amendment favorably. Mr. President, I yield back the re- mainder of my time. Mr. LAUSCHE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield me 3 minutes? Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Ohio. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized for 3 minutes. Mr. LAUSCHE. Mr. President, while the proposal of the Senator from Mary-November 29, 1967 land is of consequence, to some it mayseem to be of inconsequence. It points upone of the great problems Congress iscreating by constantly increasing thewage schedule of Federal employees. During my 10 years of service as Gov- ernor of Ohio, one of the problems con- stantly confronting me was the inability of the State of Ohio to pay salaries com- parable to those paid by the FederalGovernment. It raised one of two questions: Was theState paying too little, or was the Fed- eral Government paying too much? The answer probably is that a midway ground should be established. I am surethat the Governors of every State in theUnion-and all Senators now in this Chamber who have been Governors-will confirm my words, that what the Fed- eral Government has been doing has contributed to great embarrassment and difficulty on the part of Governors in running their State governments. Salaries have been pumped up and in- creased, here on the floor of the Senate, beyond the wildest imagination. If my chief assistant-and I say this with all due respect to the Senator from Maine [Mrs. SMIrTH]-were to receive $27,000 a year, without having to endure any of the hazards of running for elec- tion, or experience the grief, the barbs, and the attacks heaped upon him as a public official, and without any of the responsibilities, he would be earning practically what I as a Senator would be earning. Obviously, that cannot be justified. In conclusion, while I recognize the good purpose of the Senator from Mary- land to accord the registrars in the Se- lective Service System the same rights that are accorded to Federal employees engaging in a substantially similar ca- pacity, there is no more justification for granting them the liberal salaries which the Federal Government is providing than there is for granting them to any other employee in the State govern- ments. The best service that Congress can render the people of this Nation is to stop the inflationary spiral. I repeat, the greatest service we can render the people is to stop the inflation- ary spiral. Instead of doing that, we seem to be adding fuel to the fire, which is completely wrong. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I yield myself one-half minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Oklahoma is recognized for one-half minute. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, this matter is under the joint jurisdiction of the Post Office and Civil Service Com- mittee and the Armed Services Commit- tee. They have a joint jurisdiction in a way, because the Universal Military Training Act came out of the Armed Services Committee. As I said a moment ago, if we cannot clear it with the Armed Services Commit- tee, then we will do it, if we have to yield to them. However, I certainly compliment my distinguished colleague for his efforts. I ask that the amendment be rejected on a voice vote. November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques- tion is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Maryland. The amendment was rejected. AMENDMENT Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment and ask that it be stated. Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. MONRONEY. I yield. Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on the Yarborough amendment to be proposed there be a time limitation of 10 minutes, the time to be equally divided between the Senator from Texas [Mr. YARBOR- OUGH] and the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. MONRONEY]. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma will be stated. The assistant legislative clerk read the amendment, as follows: On page 148, line 10, strike out subsections (a) and (b) and in lieu thereof Insert the following: \"(a) Under the conditions, directives, and terms specified in sections 8709-8712 of this title, the Civil Service Commission, without regard to section 5 of title 41, may purchase a policy which shall make available to each insured employee equal amounts of optional life insurance and accidental death and dis- memberment insurance in addition to the amounts provided in section 8704(a) of this title. \"(b) The optional life insurance and ac- cidental death and dismemberment insur- ance shall be made available to each in- sured employee under such conditions as the Commission shall prescribe and in amounts approved by the Commission but not more than the greater of $10,000 or an amount which, when added to the amount provided in section 8704(a) of this title, makes the sum of his insurance equal to his annual pay.\" Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. MONRONEY. I yield. Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be a time limitation of 10 minutes on this amend- ment, the time to be equally divided be- tween the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. MONRONEY] and the Senator from Dela- ware [Mr. WILLLIAMS]. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes. Mr. President, I made a \"boo-boo\" in overlooking certain inclusions. In the in- surance provisions which were designed to cover all Federal civilian employees, I omitted the inclusion of three very im- portant employees of the Federal Gov- ernment, which was discovered after the long, \"punchy\" sessions in which we worked on the bill. I probably would have proposed the amendment. I know most of the members of the committee would have supported it. The record will showthat all the Democratic members of thecommittee are cosponsors of the amend- ment. I understand from the distin- guished Senator from Kansas [Mr. CARL- SON), who has discussed it with all theminority members of the committee, that while they do not sponsor it, they are favorable to it. In taking all of the nearly 3 million employees into the insurance program, we provided for maximum insurance, which, for the average employee, will bring him up to a minimum of $10,000 insurance, no matter how low his Gov- ernment salary. He will have $10,000 worth of insurance, plus $2,000, that will partly be at Government expense. If his salary is over $10,000, then the coverage will be to the highest next thousand. If his salary were $10,500, his insurance coverage would be $11,000, plus $2,000. In the case of U.S. Senators, we will have insurance that we will be eligible to buy, with the Government providing a one-third contribution and two-thirds being provided by us, amounting to $30,000, equal to our salary, plus $2,000, as the Government's share. We will also be allowed to buy, as the lower paid employees are also allowed to buy, a $10,000 policy at our own ex- pense. This will allow us to purchase a group policy at lower rates, without cost to the Federal Government. This would have made an effective limitation on any insurance program to cover all Government employees, save three, up to $30,000. I found that we overlooked covering the President of the United States, who, as Senators know, receives a salary of $100,000. We overlooked covering the Vice President of the United States, who, I believe, has a $43,000 salary. I think we overlooked covering the Speaker of the House, who has a $43,000 salary. This amendment would make them, on the same terms, eligible to purchase insurance, at their own expense, to the limit of $32,000 with a Government par- ticipation of one-third of the cost, and two-thirds by the insured, with the right to buy additional $10,000 insurance-as we have the right to do, and as all other Government employees have the right to purchase the additional $10,000 of in- surance, plus the additional $2,000; but there is no provision to enable the Pres- ident, the Vice President, or the Speaker of the House to buy insurance above their salary level. Under the terms of the amendment, the Vice President and the Speaker of the House would have the right to buy a $1,000 policy at their own expense. The President, with a $100,000 salary, would be allowed to buy, at his own ex- pense, the difference between $32,000, in which cost the Government would share, and the $100,000 which is his total salary. I am frank to say that we are anxious to help our President. President Eisen- hower suffered a very difficult heart at- tack and was near death. The President is not only subject to hazardous health conditions, but to such tragic occur- rences as we witnessed a few years ago in the case of President Kennedy. I think this is the least we can do for our No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 officials in our Government. Mr. CARLSON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. MONRONEY. I yield.Mr. CARLSON. I had not realized that the Speaker of the House might not be included. Is it correct that he would not be included? Mr. MONRONEY. That is my under- standing. Our limit is $30,000 plus $2,000 insurance and we would be allowed to buy $10,000 worth. So he would be allowed to buy $42,000 worth. He would have $1,000 additional if he wanted to buy it. Mr. CARLSON. He would be allowed to buy how much more? Mr. MONRONEY. He would be allowed to buy $1,000 additional insurance. Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Mr. MONRONEY. I yield myself 2 minutes. Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. MONRONEY. I yield. Mr. CURTIS. How much would an em- ployee have to pay on the optional part after his retirement? Mr. MONRONEY. After retirement, as I understand it, the optional part is paid up, but the insurance declines at the rate of 2 percent every month. So each year the insurance would be 24 percent less. The residual insurance comes down to a minimum of 25 percent of the original insurance that he bought. That is after age 65. Mr. CURTIS. During his period of service the employee pays the cost of the optional part, but after retirement, if he is 65, he pays nothing? Mr. MONRONEY. That is right. The Government pays nothing on his policy. This is completely not at Government expense. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. President, I do not see why either the President or Members of Congress should have subsidized life insurance. I am skeptical about any provision covering just one or two or three people. We had one amendment yesterday for one for- mer Texas Congressman. Now we have a provision for three persons. I question the wisdom of providing the President, Vice President, or Members of Congress with subsidized insurance. Mr. MONRONEY. It is not subsidized insurance. He gets the advantage of a lower rate because we are insuring 3 mil- lion people under a group policy. There is no subsidization. I forget how many thousands of dollars a year it is going to cost. They can buy the additional $10,000. The Vice President and the Speaker of the House may buy the $11,000, and the President can get the other $78,000 extra. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Perhaps I misunderstood. I thought the Senator said something about a ratio of 1 to 2. Mr. MONRONEY. This is limited to $30,000, plus the $2,000. That is as high as anyone can go. The lowest paid em- ployee also is allowed a policy of $10,000 plus $2,000. The Government pays one- third. We pay two-thirds of the cost. This arrangement has been in existence for a long time. Of course, our salaries were at $20,000 at one time, and, as Mem- bers of Congress, we were paying two- thirds and the Government was con-34257 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 tributing one-third. That arrangement has not been changed since then. This provision brings the insurance up to the income of Members of Congress, the same as is provided for Federal workers. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I remind the Senator that on August 12 the Presi- dent vetoed the life insurance bill for Federal employees with a rather sting- ing veto message, stating that it would cost too much money. What is the dif- ference between that bill which he vetoed and this one, except that the President, the Vice President, and Members of Congress are included in this one? Mr. MONRONEY. There is a vast dif- ference in the insurance coverage be- tween that one and the present one. We provided that the policies would not shrink after retirement, but would re- main at the rate that they were under the existing policy. We hoped employees who had $10,000 policies would not have those policies reduced at the rate of 24 percent a year. This is where the big cost is, because if the level of insurance were kept the same after retirement, at Government expense, and the amount of the policy did not diminish at the rate of 2 percent a month, the insurance being paid up would be at a high rate for the people who had retired. Because the in- surance policy would be shrinking at the rate of 2 percent a month, it reduces the cost, and holds the cost to $45 mil- lion for the 2 million Federal employees, Members of Congress, the President, the Vice President, and the Speaker of the House. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. How much do the insurance provisions under this bill cost when the program gets fully operating? Mr. MONRONEY. Thirty-five million dollars. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. The President vetoed the other life insurance bill because its cost was more than the $13 million program which he had rec- ommended. Now I am asking, What is the dif- ference in that bill which he vetoed, ex- cept that he and Members of Congress are covered in this one? Mr. MONRONEY. I would hardly say that. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I am just asking. Mr. MONRONEY. Members of Con- gress are in it, too. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. That is right. Members of Congress are in it, too. Why? Mr. MONRONEY. Members of Con- gress and the President are in this one. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. And there was already some coverage in the existing law. Mr. MONRONEY. Yes. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. But he vetoed the expanded version of the pro- gram because it went beyond his $13 million projected cost. This bill is 3 times over his original recommendations. Mr. MONRONEY. Yes; it went up to about $100 million because we added a nondiminishing level of insurance. We sought to protect the retirees of the Fed- eral Government, including Members of Congress, at the level that they hadcarried the insurance while on salary, and that feature was objectionable to him because the rate was high-three times the cost we are talking about here. He subsequently supported a $30 mil- lion bill and said he would sign it, which we did not choose to pass, and we brought this one out after having given it care- ful study and thorough discussion. The only fault I raise is with myself, in that I failed to recognize that we would leave three very important persons with- out the right to buy the additional op- tional insurance up to the level of their own salaries, at their own expense; and restoring that right is all that this amendment would do. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres- ident, I question the wisdom of expand- ing this program at this time. Mr. MONRONEY. Is the Senator against the whole insurance program? Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. As far as including Members of Congress in this expansion is concerned, I do not see why the taxpayers should be asked to under- write an insurance program for either Members of Congress or the President of the United States. If the President and Congress want life insurance let them buy it. I admit that the President has just as much right to be in it as anyone else, but I question the wisdom of putting any elected officials under a subsidized insurance program. I do not see much difference between the program before us and the one vetoed except that the President and Members of Congress will be able to participate this time and the other time they would not have. I shall vote against the amend- ment. I ask unanimous consent that excerpts from President Johnson's veto message on H.R. 11089, a bill which would have increased life insurance coverage for Government employees, as submitted to the Congress on August 14, 1967, be printed at this point in the RECORD. There being no objection, the excerpts were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: To the House of Representatives: I am compelled to return, without my approval, H.R. 11089-a bill which would cause large increases in life insurance cover- age for government employees, officials and Members of Congress. I am returning this bill because it places too heavy a burden and levies too heavy a charge on the American taxpayer by provid- ing private insurance out of public funds. I am returning it because it sets an unwise precedent at a critical time in our history. Today, we dare not divert our resources for unnecessary demands, when there are many more crucial needs which urgently require our support. Life insurance is but one of many fringe benefits a government employee or official receives. Certainly government life insurance was never intended to meet entirely the needs of an employee or his family. It is meant primarily to supplement his personal cover- age. Nevertheless, we know that the life insur- ance program must be strengthened and im- proved. That is why last year I recommended needed changes in insurance benefits to Con- gress that I considered reasonable and fair. Congress, however, far exceeded my recom- mendation. And so last year I was compelled to disapprove the life insurance measure because it threatened to fuel the fires of in-fiatlon and to Impose an unwarranted burdenon the taxpayer. Again this year hoping for a sound pro.gram, I recommended another modest meas-ure. In June, I called for a $13 millionprogram designed to- Make the insurance system actuariallysound; and, Remove an inequity by providing addi-tional coverage. The bill which finally passed the Congresswas subjected only to brief debate. The rollwas not called in either House on the passageof this bill. It was passed by voice vote.If this measure were approved, the costto the American taxpayer would rise fromthe $13 million I recommended to a mini-mum of $61 million in the first year andcontinued commitments for the future. The bill would substantially increase life Insurance coverage at the taxpayer's expense for all government officials and employees: For most by 331/s percent-an unnecessaryexpense. For a selected few-the President and Vice-President, Cabinet and sub-Cabinet officials,the Members of Congress, Members of theJudiciary, and U.S. Ambassadors, all thosein the highest brackets who need it theleast-by 100 percent, to $40,000-an unwar-ranted expense. Finally, it would increase the govern- ment's contribution for each employee from 33/3 percent to 40 percent. This bill would impose an added burden on the American taxpayer just when we are asking him to pay a 10 percent tax surcharge And, because our budget is tight, it would syphon funds away from Americans who needour support much more: children, the poor, the elderly-and most important, American fighting men in Vietnam. In the face of a possible $29 billion deficit, we must scrutinize every dollar that we spend. To keep the budget within boundsand to head off the threat of inflation, I pledged in my Economic Message last weekthat \"I will make every possible expenditure reduction-civilian and military-short of jeopardizing the national security and well- being.\" H.R. 11089 does not meet this rig- orous test. Over the past ten years, the salaries of Federal employees have risen by nearly 75percent-and their life insurance coverage has risen by the same amount, 76 percent. Since I have been President, there have been four successive civilian pay increases- and four insurance increases. The total cost of these programs has amounted to more than $2 billion. And with the new 4.5 per- cent pay increase which I have proposed for this year, we will be adding almost an- other half billion dollars to civilian pay and insurance and another half billion dollars for military pay. Against this background, I can see no justification for the large life insurance in- creases voted by the Congress. Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a further question? Mr. MONRONEY. I yield. Mr. CURTIS. Is it true that the non- optional part decreases after retirement? Mr. MONRONEY. Yes; it reduces at 2 percent a month. Mr. CURTIS. Both parts? Mr. MONRONEY. Yes. That is the reason it is cheaper. After retirement it drops, as I recall, to a residual one- fourth. Mr. CURTIS. The nonoptional part the retiree does pay himself, does he not? Mr. MONRONEY. Yes; when he buys the additional- Mr. CURTIS. No; I mean after retire- ment, the retiree pays the nonoptional part, does he not?34258 November 29, 1967CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE Mr. MONRONEY. No. Mr. CURTIS. The bill so states. It says: \"During each period in which an em- ployee continues\"-- Mr. MONRONEY. He pays for the op- tional until he is 65. On reaching 65 or retirement if later than 65, he ceases to pay, but his insurance goes down at the rate of 2 percent a month until 25 percent remains. Mr. CURTIS. I thank the Senator. Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending amendment. The yeas and nays were ordered. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques- tion is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma. On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. BYRD of West Virginia.

I also announce that the Senator from Virginia [Mr. SPONG] is absent be- cause of the death of his uncle. I further announce that the Senator from Connecticut [Mr. DODD], the Sen- ator from Florida [Mr. SMATHERS], and the Senator from Missouri [Mr. SY- MINGTON] are necessarily absent. I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from Connecti- cut [Mr. DODD] and the Senator from Florida [Mr. SMATHERS] would each vote \"yea.\" Mr. DIRKSEN.

So Mr. MONRONEY'S amendment was agreed to. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment was agreed to. Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. AMENDMENT NO. 479 Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 479 and ask that it be stated. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be stated. The assistant legislative clerk pro- ceeded to state the amendment. Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the amendment be dispensed with and that the amendment be printed in full in the RECORD. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment, ordered to be printed in the RECORD, reads as follows: On page 91, between lines 14 and 15, in- sert the following: \"Subparagraph (6) of sec- tion 4554(a) of title 39, United States Code, is amended by inserting 'playscripts and' im- mediately following '(6).'\" Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, the pending amendment would correct a simple omission which has come to my attention. Fourth-class postal rates give preferential treatment to articles like books which are of an educational nature. It is in the public interest to stimulate exchanges of these materials. Over the years we have added to this category other items of an educational nature which might have been omitted, and today I would like to include play- scripts. Book manuscripts are included under fourth-class rates and playscripts, which are manuscripts or typewritten copies of plays, have been left out. Ordinarily we oppose extension of these preferential rates, but, as the Post- master General has pointed out to the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service: Because of the limited volume of play- scripts in the mails, and since the proposed legislation would remove a discriminating feature of the present law,and lessen opera- tional and rate problems for postal employ- ees pricing such matter, we would have no objection. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent to have printed at this point in the RECORD a letter from the Postmaster General under date of February 14, 1966, to Hon. TOM MURRAY, chairman of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Serv- ice of the House of Representatives, and a letter from Philip S. Hughes, AssistantHon. TOM MURRAY, Chairman, Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This is in reply to your request for a report on H.R. 6579, amending section 4554 of title 39, United States Code, to extend the special fourth- class postage rates to playscrlpts. Under existing law and postal regulations (Postal Manual, section 135.214f), the special fourth-class rates of 10 cents for the first pound or fraction thereof and 5 cents for each additional pound or fraction are avail- able for mailings of manuscripts for books, periodical articles, and music. A playscript, which is a manuscript or typewritten copy of a play, Is not eligible for these special rates under the present law. The Department generally does not favor the piecemeal extension of the special fourth- class postage rates. However, because of the limited volume of playscripts in the mails, and since the proposed legislation would re- move a discriminating feature of the present law and lessen operational and rate problems for postal employees pricing such matter, we would have no objection to the enactment of H.R. 6579. The Bureau of the Budget has advised that from the standpoint of the Administration's program there is no objection to the submis- sion of this report to the Committee. Sincerely yours, LAWRENCE F. O'BRIEN, Postmaster General. EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESI- DENT, BUREAU OF THE BUDGET, Washington, D.C. Hon. TOM MURRAY, Chairman, Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, House of Representatives, Cannon House Office Building, Washing- ton, D.C. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This is in reply to your request for the views of the Bureau of the Budget on H.R. 6579, a bill \"To amend section 4554 of Title 39, United States Code, to extend the fourth class educational and library materials rate to playscripts.\" In a separate report to your Committee, the Postmaster General states that he would have no objection to enactment of H.R. 6579. Generally, the Post Office Department is op- posed to extension of fourth class rates, but, as the Postmaster General points out, includ- ing playscrlpts would remove a discrimina- tory feature of the present law which al- ready makes the special rate available for manuscripts of books, articles, and music. The volume of playscripts is limited and therefore no significant revenue loss would be involved. The Bureau of the Budget concurs with the views of the Postmaster General and would have no objection to enactment of H.R.6579. Sincerely yours, PHILLIP S. HUGHES, Assistant Director for Legislative Reference. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, the committee has discussed the amendment. We will be very glad to take the amend- ment to conference. Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.34259 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, the question is on agree- ing to the amendment of the Senator from Texas. The amendment was agreed to. Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with and that the amendment be printed in the RECORD. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment, ordered to be printed in the RECORD, is as follows: On page 143, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following new section: \"WABASH VALLEY INTERSTATE COMMISSION \"SEC. 225. (a) The Federal representative to the Wabash Valley Interstate Commission appointed under section 2 of the Act of Sep- tember 23, 1959 (Public Law 86-375; 73 Stat. 698) is hereby covered into the competitive service under title 5, United States Code. Nothing in this subsection shall be con- strued to affect the provisions of section 2 of such Act relating to the compensation of such representative. \"(b) The Federal representative to the Wabash Valley Interstate Commission shall be subject to the provisions of subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, relating to civil service retirement, and to the provisions of chapter 87 of such title, relating to life insurance.\". Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It would pro- vide for the Federal representative of the Wabash Valley Interstate Commis- sion in the State of Indiana to be covered by the civil service retirement and life insurance programs, and put on an in- sured status. The people with whom he works are of the same status. Mr. MONRONEY. The distinguished Senator from Indiana has talked with the committee about his amendment. We will be happy to take the amendment to conference. Mr. HOLLAND. Mr. President, what group of employees is this? Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, this is the Federal representative of the Wa- bash Valley Interstate Commission, a interstate institution on which he serves. Mr. HOLLAND. It applies only to one person? Mr. MONRONEY. Only to one person. We will take the amendment to confer- ence. Mr. President, I yield back the re- mainder of my time. Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, the question is on agree- ing to the amendment of the Senator from Indiana. The amendment was agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is open to further amendment. If there be no further amendment to be proposed, the question is on the engrossment of the amendments and third reading of the bill. The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a third time. The bill was read the third time. Mr. BOGGS. Mr. President, previous statements by the distinguished chair- man of the Post Office and Civil ServiceCommittee [Mr. MONRONEY] and the ranking minority member of the com- mittee [Mr. CAR.SON] have indicated the complexities of the Postal Revenue and Federal Salary Act of 1967, as well as the determined efforts by the committee to resolve equitably the problems to which the bill is directed. As a member of the committee, it was a privilege to work with these dedicated Senators as we strove to bring a balanced bill before the Senate. Largely due to their leadership, I believe the committee has done this. As in any far-reaching piece of legis- lation, the bill naturally does not rep- resent completely the views of any one committee member. What it does represent is a compro- mise of various positions, hammered out in an atmosphere of cordiality and high- minded purpose. Both of the chief titles of the bill in- volved numerous difficult questions. In title 1 we faced the need to increase sharply Post Office Department revenue. We tried to distribute that increase equi- tably over the different classes of mall, keeping in mind not only the actual cost of handling that class of mail, but its importance to the public at large. Title 2 represents a long stride toward the principle of wage comparability, with special weight given to the situation in- volving the bulk of Post Office Depart- ment employees. Title 3 gives the individual citizen some redress if he receives unwanted and unsolicited mail. Hopefully, the ex- ercise of this provision by recipients of unwanted mail will put a decided crimp in the activities of those who mail ob- scene materials. Title 4 provides what I believe is a necessary improvement in the life in- surance protection of Federal employees. It is a reasonable increase in protection for Federal employees which we added with due consideration for the fiscal problems of our Nation. Mr. President, I believe the bill as a whole deserves the support of the Sen- ate. At the same time, I reserve the right to vote for amendments which I feel might make it even more effective. To my mind, the bill represents an outstanding example of the legislative process in action, with the most careful considera- tion given to the respective positions of all parties affected by the bill. Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, I am proud to support this bill, H.R. 7977, the postal rate and Federal pay bill of 1967. As a member of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee I would like to commend the leadership of its chairman, our distinguished colleague from Okla- homa. This bill was complicated because in addition to the always perplexing problem of postal rates, we had to con- sider an equitable pay raise for Federal employees. The hearings and the com- mittee meetings were as thorough as they were fair under the vigorous chair- manship of Senator MONRONEY. His great knowledge of both the postal rate sched- ule and the Federal pay scale is invalu- able to the Government. Mr. President, this bill will raise $917 million at a time when the postal service desperately needs additional revenue forthe modernization that will benefit all classes of users. Without increasing andImproving our facilities our postal sys- tem cannot meet the increased demands on it. We have only 6 percent of the world's population, but we send and re- ceive over one-half of the world's mail- over 82 billion pieces this year. The ef- ficiency of this postal system is an in- dispensable tool of America's modern economy, for over 80 percent of that vast volume of mail will concern business. And business will profit because of this bill. Increased modernization will also benefit the individual citizen who uses the mails. The Post Office has already begun action in anticipation of the benefits of this bill, and the Postmaster General should be commended for that. First-class mall will be airlifted when- ever possible, and this will result in sub- stantial improvements in service. This bill Indicates our endorsement of the De- partment's eventual goal of 1-day de- livery of first-class mail. In addition to increased moderniza- tion, this bill will allow us to continue the many public services which are often taken for granted There are certain pos- tal services which Congress recognizes as being of such value to the public that no cnarge or only a very minimal charge is made for them. Among these services are rural delivery; second-class mail privileges for nonprofit groups of a re- ligious, educational, veterans, or agricul- tural nature; low fourth-class rates so that books will be more readily available to more people; and free mailing of spe- cial materials to the blind and disabled. These services add to the quality of our national life. They are an expense we can afford, and one which is aided by this bill. Mr. President, H.R. 7977 also provides a long-needed wage increase for our many fine Federal employees. The U.S. Government is the largest employer in the world. Today there are almost 3 mil- lion civilian employees in all branches of the government. For many years, those who chose Federal service received less for their work than persons in private sectors of our economy doing comparable work. Those private occupations, based of course on profits and incentives, re- sponded more quickly to price increases and to individual talents of employees. Federal employees, with wages periodi- cally set by Congress, seemed destined to lag always behind. The result was that the Government had a problem in recruiting the many doctors, lawyers, engineers, and other professional and staff persons it needed. And even after recruitment, increasing salaries and fringe benefits in the pri- vate sector lured away many of the most promising employees. Our Government and the employees on which it depends must be second to none. And that means we must be a fair employer and pay a fair wage. Under the leadership of President Kennedy, the Federal Salary Reform Act of 1962 was passed. That act established as a goal of Government, and as a com- mitment to its employees, wages which are comparable to those paid in private enterprise. There is a direct and proved34260 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE relationship between adequate pay and the willingness of any employee any- where to do his best. The Government would be saving nothing and gambling much if it did not recognize and fol- low this principle of equal pay for equal work for Federal employees. Compara- bility will be established in a phased in- crease by July 1, 1969, on the basis of the latest survey of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and this pledge to 3 million American workers will be kept. Mr. President, I am proud that the committee unanimously struck out the provision of the House bill which would establish an Executive Commission on salaries. In the past we have benefited from the hard work of those serving on special commissions dealing with pay ad- justments and other changes in law con- cerning the compensation of Federal of- fleers and employees. Those commis- sions have served a useful purpose in in- forming Congress. But this new pro- posed commission would be unacceptable. It would vest in the executive branch the authority to establish the salaries of Members of Congress. We have a solemn constitutional responsibility to set our salaries. Whenever we deal with this issue we must face our constituents squarely. We will not shirk that duty by handing it to the President or his salary commission. Mr. President, it has been my privilege to work on this bill which will do so much for our nearly 3 million Federal em- ployees. The lengthy hearings we had before the Post Office and Civil Service Committee support the need for what we have done, and I urge the passage of this bill. FEDERAL EMPLOYEE PAY INCREASES WELL DESERVED AND OVERDUE Mr. GRUENING. Mr. President, his- torically it has been all too true that Federal salaries for classified and postal workers have tended to lag behind when the cost of living is on the rise. I am glad to speak in favor of H.R. 7977 which attempts to overcome some portion of this lag. The vast majority of Federal civil serv- ants are conscientious, loyal, capable: and hard working. Having spent a good many years in both the executive and legislative branches of the Federal Government and having during these years worked with thousands of career Federal employees, I know that I am not exaggerating in so describing them and their work. I am repeatedly told by highly placed executives in private industry coming to work for the Federal Government for the first time of their amazement to find Federal employees so dedicated to the best interests of the Government, so scrupulously fair in their dealings with the general public, and so highly intel- ligent and knowledgeable about the in- tricacies of our ever more complex gov-ernmental machinery. And they remain so despite the abuse to which they are all too frequently sub- jected. Thus we have recently seen an ex- ample of the entire body of employees of the Office of Economic Opportunity being singled out and refused a pay in-crease because there were some whowanted to express their dislike of thatprogram-a program enacted by the Congress and which those employees were duty bound to administer. I am pleased that that attempted discrimina- tion has been removed in the Senate version of the pay raise bill. I am happy to vote in favor of these increased salaries for Federal employees, just as I have voted in favor of similar increases in the past every time they were proposed in the Congress since I have been in the Senate. Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, the junior Senator from Virginia [Mr. SPONG] was on the floor this afternoon when he received word of a death in his family. He took a great interest in this bill and desired very strongly to be pres- ent to vote in favor of its final passage. However, the last transportation avail- able to him to permit to reach the fu- neral services left this afternoon at 6 o'clock and he was required, therefore, to absent himself from this vote. I might add that Senator SPONG took the care to determine the risk to the legislation by his early departure this afternoon and was assured by the leadership that the bill or any of its provisions would not be in jeopardy by his departure this late in the afternoon, since only the vote on final pasage remained and the lead- ership anticipated a generous margin to secure its final passage. In addition, I assured Senator SPONG that it was our intention to attempt to reach final passage on the military com- panion pay bill immediately after this vote and that the leadership anticipated another generous margin on that bill. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time on the bill. Mr. CARLSON. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, and all time having expired, the question is, Shall it pass? On this question the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. I an- nounce that the Senator from Louisiana [Mr. ELLENDER], the Senator from Ari- zona [Mr. HAYDEN], and the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. MCINTYRE] are ab- sent on official business. I also announce that the Senator from Virginia [Mr. SPONG] is absent because of the death of his uncle. I further announce that the Senator from Connecticut [Mr. DODD] and the Senator from Missouri [Mr. SYMINGTON] are necessarily absent. I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from Connecticut [Mr. DODD], the Senator from Arizona [Mr. HAYDEN], and the from Vir- ginia [Mr. SPONG] would each vote \"yea.\" Mr. DIRKSEN. I announce that the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. COOPER] and the Senator from Texas [Mr. TOWER] are absent on official business.

NOT VOTING-13 Kuchel Symtngton McIntyre Tower Miller Young, N. Dak. Scott Spong So the bill (H.R. 7977) was passed. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the bill was passed. Mr. MANSFIELD. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I move that the Senate insist on its amend- ments to H.R. 7977 and request a con- ference with the House of Representa- tives on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and that the Chair appoint the conferees on the part of the Senate. The motion was agreed to; and the Presiding Officer appointed Mr. MON- RONEY, Mr. YARBOROUGH, Mr. RANDOLPH, Mr. CARLSON, and Mr. FONG conferees on the part of the Senate. Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. MoN-34261 34262 CO] RONEY] has consistently demonstrated his broad understanding of the many prob- lems that face the Nation's postal sys- tem-has proved himself time and time again the champion of all Federal em- ployees. That fact was again displayed clearly during the past 2 days while the Senate considered the Federal pay and postal rate bill of this year. Senator MON- RONEY supported the measure with per- suasive advocacy. He managed the bill with the highest degree of skill and abil- ity. The Senate is deeply in his debt. The senior Senator from Kansas [Mr. CARLSON] is similarly to be commended. His leadership as the ranking minority member of the committee was clearly felt on this measure as on all proposals that gain his endorsement. While he offered his own sincere views on some features of the measure, he in no way impeded its efficient disposition and joined to assure its wide acceptance. Other committee members are to be singled out for their strong efforts. The contributions of the senior Senator from Texas [Mr. YARBOROUGH], the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. FONG], and the Sena- tor from Maryland [Mr. BREWSTER] were most welcome. They, along with the Sen- ator from Nebraska [Mr. CURTIS] and the Senator from Indiana [Mr. HARTKE] led a highly thoughtful and enlightening debate. Special praise is owed to the senior Senator from Delaware [Mr. WILLIAMS]. As always, his strong convictions were expressed with clarity and deep insight. His opposition to many features of the proposal was most sincere. Above all, his cooperation was sincerely appreciated and we thank him for joining to make possible the disposition of the measure today. With the passage of this measure the Senate may be proud of another achieve- ment obtained expeditiously and with full consideration for the views of every Member. Mr. CANNON. Mr. President, I am pleased to note that the postal pay bill has passed the Senate and takes appro- priate steps toward correcting the im- balance between the pay of this dedi- cated group of Government employees and workers in private industry. The leg- islative roadway is now clear for the mil- itary pay bill to be presented to the Senate for rapid action. I urge my fellow Senators to act affirmatively on this most worthwhile pending legislation. In this day of enormous sacrifice being made by our men in uniform the issue of com- parability for our fighting forces with Government civil servants is irrefutable. Mr. President, all Senators are fully as aware as I am of the heart-rending personal appeals which they frequently receive from hard-pressed families of our servicemen. Even with the allow- ances which have been provided by Con- gress the serviceman and his family is in a constant race to keep up with the cost of living. Certainly, the difficult tasks which they are called upon to per- form overseas for their country is not made easier by the plight of their fam- ilies. I am certain that Senators will want to read the very provocative and timely report on this very problem nar- rated in the current issue of Newsweek.NGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD an article entitled \"Going for Broke\" from this week's issue of Newsweek. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: GOING FOR BROKE Bill Taylor, 21, lives with his wife, Leilani, and their 13-month-old daughter in a cramped three-room apartment on one of San Diego's shoddier blocks. Each month, the family doggedly attempts the impossible task of making do with the $348.90 Taylor receives from the government. Aside from the $104 rent, a $75 food bill and $20 for phone and utilities, there are monthly in- stallments to be met on a seedy 1960 Ford, a television set and a sewing machine on which the pretty, 19-year-old Leilani turns out much of the family wardrobe. At the moment, the Taylors have $750 in bank loans to pay off. What's more, Leilani is expecting another baby sometime this month. \"Bill wants a boy,\" she says. \"But I'm hoping for a girl. That way we'll already have all her clothes.\" The Taylors' income does not come from any welfare agency. The government check is made out to Boilerman 3/c William Taylor, USN. Under Bill's E-4 pay grade, the Navy pays him a base salary of $222.90 plus an allotment of $126 to maintain his family. The Taylors live off-base because the San Diego Naval Station does not offer on-base housing for anyone below the grade of E-5. Last year, Leilani planned to return to her cashier's job which, before their first baby was born, net- ted them $350 a month. \"But then,\" she sighs, \"I turned up pregnant again.\" Now, the Taylors' financial future appears bleaker than ever. GAP The plight of the married enlisted man is by no means a new phenomenon. As far back as 1775-when a Marine private was paid $6.66 a month and issued a daily ration of grog-it was reckoned he simply couldn't afford a wife. Today, recruiters in all services refuse to take a man who has more than one dependent. But this regulation hardly affects what happens after a man enters the service-nor does it help draftees. Military wage hikes have been keeping pace with civilian raises since 1962, yet the historic gap between the two categories remains wide. At present, a bill calling for a 5.6 per cent raise for all military personnel sits in the Senate awaiting approval. If passed, how- ever, the bill would add a mere $5 to $7 to monthly family allotments up to the grade of E-5. \"The married enlisted man's salary,\" says a Pentagon official, \"never drops below the poverty level.\" But that would seem to de- pend on one's interpretation of poverty. For example, a lance corporal (E-3) in the Ma- rine Corps is expected to support a wife and one child on a total of $204.90 a month. Still worse is the fate of the private with one de- pendent and less than two years in service. Each month, he draws $152.10 which, in Camp Pendleton, Calif., is $38.90 less than he would receive on welfare. BUDGET Aside from free medical attention, the low grocery prices at the commissary are the only substantial assistance to the family budget. \"Thank God for it,\" says Cpl. George Hardy of Fort Jackson, S.C., who lives with his German-born wife, Ericka, and their three boys in a clapboard cottage in Colum- bia, S.C. He claims the commissary prices are about half those of the off-base supermar- kets. But this advantage is too often offset by the general cost of living. Some off-base land- lords, for instance, offer ramshackle housing for a premium price. Outside Fort Dix, N.J.,November 29, 1967 drab one-room apartments rent for $80 amonth. For many families, the only answer ismoonlighting. \"Every married airman Iknows,\" says Master Sgt. Joe Hayden of OtisAir Force Base on Cape Cod, Mass., \"has anoutside job, or his wife works.\" The officialfigure for moonlighting Air Force personnelis 68 per cent. Marine Cpl. Mike Morello, 20,works twenty a week as a police dispatcherin San Francisco, while 20-year-old PettyOfficer 3/c Bill Scarborough, of San Diego,knocks $10 a month off his rent by mowingthe lawn of his landlord-a Navy yeoman.The married enlisted man's manifold pres-sures often prove unbearable. In Rhode Is-land, Navy brass blew their top upon learn-ing that a number of married enlisted menfrom Quonset Point and Davisvllle NavalStation had applied to local welfare agenciesfor extra food. In San Diego, officers speakwearily of married men going AWOL to workfull time to feed their families. Ironically, one partial solution for manyis to re-enlist. Dangling before Boilerman3/c Taylor is a $5,400 bonus payable uponre-enlistment when his present four-yearhitch is up. Bill has already made his deci-sion. \"When I ship over,\" he says, \"well beable to pay off all our debts. Then, I guess I might just as well keep going.\" UNIFORMED SERVICES PAY ACT OP 1967 Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate turn to the consideration of Calendar No. 793, H.R. 13510. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be stated by title. The LEGISLATIVE CLERK. A bill (H.R. 13510) to increase the basic pay for members of the uniformed services, and for other purposes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the present consideration of the bill? There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill, which had been reported from the Committee on Armed Services, with amendments, on page 4, line 4, after the word \"equal\" strike out \"yearly installments\" and in- sert \"annual or semiannual installments, as determined by the Secretary of De- fense or the Secretary of Health, Educa- tion, and Welfare, as appropriate\"; in line 16, after the word \"was\" strike out \"made.' \" and insert \"made.\"; after line 16, insert: (c) The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare shall submit separate written reports each year to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives regarding the operation of the special pay program authorized by subsection (a) of this section and, whenever such special pay program is to be continued in operation, such report shall include the Justification for continuing such program. Reports under this section shall be made on a calendar year basis, beginning with the calendar year 1968, and the reports for any calendar year shall be submitted not later than April 1 of the succeeding calendar year.

However, no member is entitled to transportation at the expense of the United States under this section for travel outside the United States unless he is a bona fide resident of the place outside the United States that is selected by him under this section.\" Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I askfor the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. President, I desire to outline briefly the salient features of the bill that has just been motioned up by the majority leader. Mr. President, the pending bill, H.R. 13510, increases the basic pay for mem- bers of the Armed Forces and providesGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE for a number of other minor changes in military compensation. PRINCIPAL PURPOSE TO PROVIDE A MILITARY PAY INCREASE COMPARABLE TO THAT HAS JUST PASSED THE SENATE FOR FEDERAL CIVILIAN PERSONNEL Mr. President, the principal purpose of this bill is to provide our men and women in uniform with an increase comparable to the 4.5-percent increase which has been recommended by both the Senate and House for Federal classified em- ployees. The bill provides for such a compara- ble increase by authorizing a flat 5.6-per- cent increase in basic pay for all mem- bers of the uniformed services. This increase to 5.6 percent in basic pay does not mean that they would re- ceive a larger increase than 4.5 percent civilian increase. The reason for this 5.6- percent basic pay increase, rather than a 4.5-percent increase, is due to the fact that the quarters and subsistence allow- ances which make up a portion of mili- tary compensation are not increased under this bill. It was therefore neces- sary to provide for a slightly larger in- crease in basic pay in order to have an increase equivalent to the 4.5-percent civilian increase. In calculating the extent to which basic pay should be increased in order to have an increase equivalent to the 4.5-percent civilian increase, four factors of military compensation were taken into account- basic pay, subsistence allowance, quar- ters allowance, and the tax advantages of these two latter elements. The quarters allowance and the sub- sistence allowance are exempt from the payment of income tax. This bill does not affect this status in any degree. To have a comparable increase with that which we voted for classified employees it is necessary to have a slightly higher in- crease for the personnel in the armed services. These four elements constitute what is called regular compensation. The 5.6-percent increase in basic pay results in 4.5 percent in regular compensation. EFFECT OF BASIC PAY INCREASE Mr. President, I shall briefly discuss the -effect of this 5.6-percent increase on the military pay grades. For the total active duty force this bill would provide an aver- age increase of $15 per month; for all enlisted personnel, the average increase would be $12.30 per month, and for the total officer force the average would be $35.58 per month. With respect to the effect of the increase on particular pay grades, the E-1 recruit would receive an average increase of $5.32 per month; an E-5 sergeant, $16.39 per month; and an E-9 sergeant major, $33.62. For the com- missioned pay grades, the 0-1 second lieutenant would receive an average in- crease of $18.68 per month; the 0-4 major, $43.63; colonel, $65.72; and the 0-9 lieutenant general, $98.84. Mr. President, there is in the commit- tee report, table I, page 15, which sets forth examples of increases in compen- sation for each military pay grade. OTHER PROVISIONS OF BILL Mr. President, I shall now turn to the remaining portion of the pending bill34263 which contains a number of minor pro- visions affecting military compensation. INCREASES IN DEPENDENTS ASSISTANCE ACT RATES Mr. President, for a number of years there has been in effect in the military pay laws what is known as the Depend- ents Assistance Act, which applies only to enlisted personnel in the lower pay grades, those in E-1 through E-4-with less than 4 years of service. Special rates are provided for those in these grades who are not furnished Government quar- ters. This bill provides for an increase in these rates of approximately 9 percent for the brackets up to and including those with two dependents. The dollar increases range from $4.80 to $7.50 per months, with the new rates in these brackets ranging from $55.20 to $90.60 per month. The Dependents Assistance Act rates have not been increased since 1962. PERMISSIVE AUTHORITY FOR CONTINUATION PAY Mr. President, despite the special pay incentives already in effect for military physicians, the problem of retaining in active service career military doctors has reached the point where the Medical Corps are faced with serious deteriora- tion if this trend is not reversed. For in- stance, in 1 year, fiscal 1967, there was a loss of 27 percent of the total career forces for the Medical Corps. Mr. President, bear in mind that the career force of the military medical serv- ice amounts to only 17 percent of thetotal Medical Corps. The balance of them serve their obligated tours and then, as fast as they can, get out and go into civilian practice. The medical profession is becoming so attractive all over the United States that the 17 percent who are career men are rapidly diminishing innumber. This is due to the attractive cvvilian offers that are furnished for those with a medical education in civilian life. This bill contains permissive authority under which military physicians who have no obligated service may be paid up to 4 months' basic pay for each year they agree to extend their active service un- der the written agreement. This special rate will be offered only to those in criti- cally designated specialties. The com- mittee has been advised for the first year only about 2,500 medical officers will be offered this bonus, of which about 300 would receive 4 months' basic pay and 2,200 three months' basic pay. We hope that this continuation pay will stop the trend that is rapidly dimin- ishing the military service of career med- ical personnel. Under the language of the bill this system of pay could also be extended to dental officers. The bill came to us in that form from the House. The Depart- ment of Defense has indicated, however, that they have no intention of extend- ing this pay to dental officers in view of the fact that the dental officer retention problem is not comparable to the medical officer situation. Under these circum- stances, I saw no necessity to disturb that provision of the bill. CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 I may say that in view of the extraor- dinary nature of this pay, the committee added to the bill language requiring an annual report justifying the continued use of this special compensation. I might observe, Mr. President, that this system for military doctors is some- what comparable to the system of pay presently in effect providing for a vari- able enlistment bonus for enlisted men with critical skills. We have a genuine problem maintaining the career medi- cal force. I hope this will resolve our problem. ADJUSTMENTS IN CONSUMER PRICE INDEX FOR- MULA FOR INCREASING MILITARY RETIRED PAY Mr. President, as the Senate knows, since 1963 military retired pay has been increased under a statutory formula sim- ilar to that now in effect for civil serv- ants under which retired personnel re- ceive an increase whenever the Con- sumer Price Index advances 3 percent or more over a period of 3 consecutive months from the time of the previous increase. This system is basically sound but it has given rise to certain inequities which result from two problems. The first is that under present laws no period of active service is required under new military pay scales in order to receive the full benefit of the increases prior to retirement. One day is sufficient. The second problem arises from the fact that the only requirement for receiving the Consumer Price Index increase is to be on the retired list on the effective date of the increase. Due to the fre- quency in recent times of both statutory pay increases for the active forces and Consumer Price Index retired increases, persons have been able to double up and receive the advantages of both in a very short time. In July 1966, military pay scales for the active forces were increased 3.2 percent and in December 1966 a Consumer Price Index increase of 3.7 percent was authorized for those on the retired list. Individuals could therefore retire af- ter the July 1966 increase but before December 1966 and receive the advan- tage of both adjustments. At the same time, those who waited until after De- cember 1966 to retire did not receive the 3.7-percent increase, since they were not on the list on the effective date. This bill corrects these inequities in the following manner: First. It provides a one-time 3.7-per- cent increase for those retiring after De- cember 1966 and before the new scales in this bill take effect. Second. The bill takes away any undue windfall which might be acquired by going on the retired list immediately before an increase, by limiting the Con- sumer Price Index increases for such persons to only the advances in the Con- sumer Price Index that have occurred since the last statutory pay increase. Third. A penalty is avoided for those who might wait until the effective date of the retired increased to retire, by per- mitting Consumer Price Index advances to be reflected in their initial retired pay. Mr. President, the committee made no attempt at this time to deal with the other problem I initially mentioned un- der which the full advantage of new payscales are received for retirement pur- poses with as little as 1 day of service under the new scales. It was made clear, however, that this matter might be dealt with in some future legislation. POSSIBLE FUTURE AUTOMATIC INCREASES IN MILITARY BASIC PAY Mr. President, there is contained in section 8 of this bill a provision which might be considered in the nature of legislative insurance. This section, in ef- fect, provides that unless there is a sub- sequent provision to the contrary, there will be an automatic increase in military basic pay whenever the general schedule for salaries of the classified civilian em- ployees is increased. The military in- crease would be a flat across-the-board adjustment equal to the average of the civilian increase and would take effect on the same date as the civilian increase. Mr. President, I do not anticipate that in the normal course of events this pro- vision will become operative. The so- called quadrennial review of military compensation is now being completed in the Department of Defense and the Pres- ident in his pay message of last April in- dicated that he intended to recommend military pay changes. Moreover, the De- partment of Defense in a letter of No- vember 18, 1967, to the committee, stated that they anticipate that the adminis- tration's pay proposals would be forth- coming early in this next session. In view of the fact, however, that in the civilian pay bill just considered by the Senate, there will be two automatic raises for civilian employees without further leg- islative action, one in 1968 and one in 1969, it did not seem fair that there should not be some guarantee for timely military increases consistent with the forthcoming automatic civil service in- creases, if for some unforeseen reason the military personnel did not receive an increase under separate legislation next year. MINOR PROVISIONS Mr. President, the remaining provi- sions of the bill can be considered minor in nature and are fully explained in the committee report which is available to each Member. SUMMARY Mr. President, this bill will affect ap- proximately 4,578,000 persons, of which 3,454,000 are on active service and the remainder either reservists in a drill paid status, or are retired personnel. The cost of this bill for fiscal 1968 with the effective date of October 1, will be $632,800,000. On a 12-month basis, the additional cost will be $822,400,000. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to act favorably on this modest pay increase for our men and women in uniform. Mr. President, we have just enacted a bill to provide for those who offer their services to the Federal Government. Surely, we cannot do less than give an equivalent increase to those who offer their bodies as well as their services without regard to hours or conditions of service, and whose lives are also taken on the field of battle. I hope that the bill will be enacted into law. Mrs. SMITH. Mr. President, the pend- ing military pay legislation, H.R. 13510, has been ably discussed in detail byChairman RUSSELL of the Armed Serv- ices Committee, and I shall not attempt to repeat his discussion of this legislation. As the ranking minority member of the Armed Services Committee, however, Ishould like to emphasize that this mili- tary pay bill represents the unanimous affirmative vote of the committee. The principal purpose of the bill is to provide a flat across-the-board increase of 5.6 percent in basic pay for all mem- bers of the uniformed services. This in- crease, which is comparable to the 4.5- percent increase now being approved forFederal civilian workers, is well deserved.There can be no dispute that the mili- tary element of our Federal Government should receive increases on the same timely basis as the civilian element of our Federal Government. The remaining provisions of this bill,although minor in nature, represent im- provements in the military compensation system. These provisions include first, an upward adjustment of approximately 9 percent in the Dependents Assistance Act rates for the lower grade enlisted per- sonnel who are not furnished Govern- ment quarters; second, a system of per- missive continuation pay for medical of- ficers in critical specialties who agree to extend their period of active service; third, certain modifications in the Con- sumer Price Index formula for increas- ing military retired pay, all aimed at re- moving certain inequities in the present system; and, fourth, certain minor pro- visions relating to bachelor personnel which will extend to them the same quar- ters allowances and dislocation allow- ances now available to personnel with dependents. Mr. President, H.R. 13510 is needed and justified legislation, and I urge its unanimous approval by the Senate. Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I do not feel that this is the time to be rais- ing any Government salaries. However, the Senate has passed an increase for civilian workers and I feel that it would be only just and fair that an equivalent raise be given to our military personnel. Therefore, I shall vote for the mili- tary pay raise bill. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee amendments be considered and agreed to en bloc. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the committee amendments are agreed to en bloc. If there be no further amendments to be proposed, the question is on the engrossment of the amendments, and the third reading of the bill. The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a third time. The bill was read the third time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques- tion is on final passage of H.R. 13510.

Mr. President, the swift and efficient disposition of this measure that increases the pay of themilitary speaks abundantly for the out- standing manner in which it was handled by the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, the senior Senator from Georgia [Mr. RUSSELL]. His unsurpassed devotion, his skillful and astute leadership were again displayed as they have been on every achievement he has obtained. Senator RUSSELL has again earned the highest commendation of the Senate. It is richly deserved. The Senator from Maine [Mrs. SMITH] deserves the same high commendation. As the ranking minority member of the committee she, too, has consistently dis- played an immense devotion to the needs and problems of our armed services. Her outstanding effort today was no excep- tion. The Senate is most grateful. The Senate twice today has faced the issue of increasing the pay scale of those who serve the Nation. Twice it has voted favorably on that issue. I, personally, am very appreciative of the fact that we were able to accomplish this joint achieve- ment with dispatch and with great efficiency.

AMENDMENT TO SECTION 302 (c) OF THE LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELA- TIONS ACT Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, I introduce, for appropriate reference, a bill to amend section 302(c) of the La- bor-Management Relations Act in order to allow management and labor to bar- gain collectively over the establishment of trust funds in order to establish scholarships for the benefit of employees, their families and dependents for study at educational institutions or to estab- lish child care centers for preschool and school age dependents of employees.

The bill will be received and appropriately re- ferred; and, without objection, the bill will be printed in the RECORD. The bill (S. 2704) to amend section 302(c) of the Labor-Management Rela- tions Act of 1947 to permit employer con- tributions to trust funds to provide em- ployees, their families and dependents with scholarships for study at educa- tional institutions or the establishment of child care centers for preschool and school-age dependents of employees, in- troduced by Mr. YARBOROUGH (for him- self and other Senators), was received, read twice by its title, referred to the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, and ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: S. 2704 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That sec- tion 302(c) of the Labor-Management Re- lations Act, 1947, is amended by striking out \"or (6)\" and inserting in lieu thereof \"(6)\", and by adding immediately before the period at the end thereof the following: \"; or (7) with respect to money or other thing of value paid by any employer to an individual or pooled trust fund established by such rep- resentative for the purpose of (A) scholar- ships for the benefit of employees, their families and dependents for study at edu- cational institutions, or (B) child care centers for preschool and school-age de- pendents of employees. Provided, That the requirements of clause (B) of the proviso to clause (5) of this subsection shall apply to such trust funds.\" Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, section 302 of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947 permits, for cer- tain purposes, employer contributions to jointly administered funds established through collective bargaining. My bill, which I am introducing today, would amend this section so as to broaden the scope of the bargaining to allow inclu- sion of two additional purposes for such jointly administered funds. One purpose would be to provide em- ployees, their families and dependents with scholarships for study at educa- tional institutions. The other would es- tablish child care centers for preschool and school-age dependents of employees. Over the years, Mr. President, many significant steps have been taken to im- prove the educational opportunities of our citizens. Scholarship programs of many kinds, loan programs, work-study arrangements-all have opened the door of educational opportunity inch by inch. It has become increasingly possible for able and ambitious students of all eco- nomic backgrounds to further their edu- cational goals. And yet, we all know that educational costs today are rising. At the very time when higher education is becoming ur- gent for personal and national needs, the cost of getting it is moving out of the reach of low and moderate income fami- lies. As these costs climb, how many stu- dents will be financially squeezed off the education ladder. Faced with high tui- tions, how many will be unable to pursue an education beyond high school?Because the answers to these questions may preview a national crisis, I intro- duced legislation earlier in this session which would declare as the intent of Congress that universal educational op- portunity at the postsecondary level be made available through appropriate gov- ernmental assistance. The bill I am intro- ducing today would be a significant step forward in the march toward universal educational opportunity. The passage of this bill would allow labor and manage- ment to collectively bargain concerning programs which would make possible scholarship grants to children of eligible employees who enroll and maintain themselves in accredited institutions of higher education. These jointly admin- istered grants would be made as a matter of right, thereby helping all those qual- ified to receive additional education, not only the bright or exceptional student. Such a program would open up for the first time advanced educational oppor- tunities to the children of the working- man on a nongovernmental basis. Such a program would also provide an oppor- tunity for labor-management coopera- tion and investment for the improvement of the human resources of our Nation. An additional feature of this amend- ment, Mr. President, would permit labor-management cooperation in the establishment of child care centers for dependent children of working parents. After looking at the statistics of the kind of care preschool children of work- ing mothers receive, it is only too clear that too many of these children have care which could at best be considered questionable and, at worst, completely inadequate. Day care for the preschool child of the working mother has become a social necessity. This problem is not going to disappear if we continue to ignore it. The Federal Government is going to have to take an increasing concern with the problem of providing social services to dependent children of working women. Many Members of Congress have already offered legislation to meet this growing problem. The bill which I am introducing today will allow the private sector of society to cooperate and participate in both of these endeavors. It will permit labor- management sponsorship of both schol- arships and day care centers. Mothers already at work will be more comfortable in their employment knowing that their children are being properly cared for; mothers who must work to meet family needs will be freed to seek employment if they can make use of available child care services, and parents will be more secure in the knowledge that their children may obtain higher education after finishing high school. I am pleased to note that this bill is re- ceiving bipartisan support. A similar bill will also be introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman FRANK THOMPSON of New Jersey. It is my hope that this bill will show the way for the private sector of our society to expand the educational opportunity of all children. Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I would like to commend the senior Senator34267 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 from Texas for introducing this legis- lation today and I am pleased to be a cosponsor. The need for the programs which this bill would foster has been amply docu- mented. As the costs of education beyond the high school level increase, children from families of low and moderate in- come slip behind in the scramble for ad- mission to quality institutions. A college education has become and will continue to become increasingly necessary as a primary qualification for meaningful participation in our expanding economy. Yet, for the student from a low-income family it is becoming increasingly diffi- cult to obtain. This legislation, by per- mitting the establishment of programs under which scholarship grants would be available to the dependents of eligible workers, would make a significant con- tribution in a neglected area. In recognition of the need for provid- ing child care services to families of work- ing parents, I have introduced S. 1948 in this session of the Congress. I have also sponsored a day care amendment which has been incorporated in this year's pov- erty bill, now in conference. The purpose of the amendment is to provide day care for children of low-income families in order to enable the parents to undertake training, education, or employment. The provision in the bill being introduced to- day, which would permit collective bargaining on the establishment of such day care centers, is a parallel step in the private sector toward this goal. I would like to emphasize the signifi- cance of this legislation in permitting the private sector to make a contribution in these areas of national neglect. Both labor and industry have a stake in the educational development and economic growth of this Nation. The programs made possible under the terms of this legislation will also con- tribute to industrial stability. The work- ing mother whose child is being looked after while she is on the job will be a more productive employee, free of worry about her child's welfare. Absenteeism on the part of working mothers might also be appreciably reduced. And an em- ployee, recognizing the advantages to his dependents of continued employment in an industry which will provide scholar- ship aid to his children, would have an incentive to remain in the industry, thus reducing, for his employer, the costs of turnover and training of new workers. Thus, on all counts this is an excellent bill. I am proud to cosponsor it, and I hope the Subcommittee on Labor, of which the distinguished senior Senator from Texas is the Chairman, will give it prompt attention. FARMERS HOME ADMINISTRATION: HELP OR HINDRANCE? Mr. GRIFFIN. Mr. President, it is bad enough when an expensive, highly touted Federal program falls far short of its promises. But it is deplorable when an agency so administers a Federal program that it actually retards and blocks progress. Yet, this is the state of affairs with re- spect to a program enacted by Congress several years ago to help small commu-nities in their efforts to develop water supply and waste treatment facilities. The head of Michigan's Department of Public Health, Dr. R. Gerald Rice, is more than upset. He says that, as it is now administered: This federal program has done more vio- lence than good to the advancement of our public water supply and water pollution con- trol program here in Michigan. Responsible authorities in other States not only agree; they join in a chorus of criticism and complaint. In 1965 Congress amended the Con- solidated Farmers Home Administration Act of 1961 to establish a program of di- rect assistance to help small towns in rural areas improve their water supply and waste disposal systems. This program is administered by the Department of Agriculture's Farmers Home Administration, which is author- ized to provide Federal matching grants of up to 50 percent to rural communities with populations under 5,500. Under section 306(a) (3) of the act, the Secretary of Agriculture is author- ized to approve grant applications, pro- viding that a local project- (11) is designed and constructed so that adequate capacity will be or can be made available to serve the present population of the area to the extent feasible and to serve the reasonably foreseeable growth needs of the area, or (iii) is necessary for orderly community development consistent with a comprehensive community water or sewer development plan of the rural area and not inconsistent with any planned development under State, county, or municipal plans ap- proved as official plans by competent author- ity for the area in which the rural com- munity Is located ... It would seem clear that Congress in- tended to assure that projects financed under the program would not violate or outflank development plans duly estab- lished by State, county, and municipal authorities. Such development plans re- flect the needs and growth patterns of particular areas; they are formulated by planning officials who are attuned to local conditions and needs. Yet, with respect to my own State of Michigan, the PHA has shown what amounts to arrogant disregard of State policies established in the public interest. In effect, the operations of the FHA have served to retard progress in the very communities that Congress intended to help. Let me emphasize that my remarks to- day are not directed toward the many PHA personnel at the local level who have done a commendable job in han- dling the traditional functions of this agency. I am convinced that the difficul- ties stem primarily from bureaucratic bungling and unsound policy decisions at the Washington level in a field in which this agency has no experience and little competence. Furthermore, Mr. President, I wish to make it clear that I have no quarrel with the program itself or its objectives. Indeed, I wish to commend the chief sponsor of the basic legislation, the dis- tinguished senior Senator from Vermont [Mr. AIKEN], for his outstanding leader- ship in a valiant effort to provide as- sistance that is desperately needed at the local community level.Dr. Rice, who heads the Michigan De- partment of Health, has outlined a number of problems in a letter to me, dated October 30, 1967. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the letter be inserted in the RECORD at this point. There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: STATE OF MICHIGAN, DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, Lansing, Mich., October 30, 1967. Hon. ROBERT P. GRIFFIN, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR GRIFFI: This is further re- garding the matter which Mr. John Vogt, Chief of our Engineering Division and I dis- cussed with Messrs. Peter Holmes and Joe DeWeese of your staff on October 27, 1967 relative to the Farmers Home Admin- istration's financial grant and loan program for water supply and sewerage systems. I must submit that this Federal Program has done more violence than good to the advancement of our public water supply and water pollution control programs here in Michigan. Specifically and briefly: 1. The Federal Agency has such low stand- ards of engineering design for these systems and In particular water supplies which it re- quires consulting engineers to design in ac- cordance with, that the small urban areas are saddled with very substandard systems. The systems if built are actually more costly to the communities because it is soon estab- lished that the deficiencies must be cor- rected. 2. The Administration no doubt has in- formed you that plans for systems to be eligible for grants must meet minimum health standards of the various state health departments. Left unsaid however is the pressure and influence brought to bear by Administration staffers on health depart- ments to lower their standards to a point below their better judgment and accept and approve the substandard design. 3. Local representatives of PHA solicit ap- plications from communities. Although offi- cials of the Administration disclaim this practice and contend It is contrary to their policy, it is happening. This carrot dangling places local elected officials in a position that they are almost forced to submit an applica- tion. 4. Once the Administration gets an ap- plication, an interminable series of actions is set in motion to keep the community \"on the hook\" so it does not take steps to build the facilities with Its own financial resources. Obviously, it is political suicide for an elected official to propose to his people that they fi- nance facilities themselves when the Farmers Home Administration states that in one year, two years or five years they may make a grant to the city. First of all by that time increased costs will have wiped out any grant assistance. Moreover action on a needed wa- ter pollution control project will be side- tracked or will require the state agencies to invoke the enforcement provisions of our pollution control acts against a community which was ready to and able to move volun- tarily but was hooked by FHA. 5. Recently one of my staff members was in a public meeting at which a representative of PHA proposed that plans for projects be cleared by the consulting engineer with PHA first before submitting them to our office for approval as required by state law. We cannot tolerate such a practice. 6. The Administration contends that it is serving rural people and rural areas. We maintain that communities in the popula- tion density covered by PL 89-240 of up to 5500 population are small urban areas. 7. Our sister states in the Great Lakes region and elsewhere are experiencing the same problems. Evidence of this is the at-34268 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE tached resolution. This informal compact includes the states of New York, Pennsyl- vania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. In this connection, I am advised that Senator Prox- mire has expressed some concern about the FHA program. It would seem that one possible solution would be to transfer this entire program to another Federal agency which has experience and expertise in the engineering and manage- ment of grant programs for water and sewer utilities. The Department we would propose be given consideration is that of Housing and Urban Development. The Community Facilities Administration of that Department has had excellent experience under the ac- celerated public works program, economic development act and other financial grant and loan programs for public water supply and sewage systems. It has been our experi- ence that HUD has demonstrated a great capacity to administer such programs effec- tively, efficiently and timely following com- monly accepted good engineering practices. I am also attaching for your information an article which appeared in the Lansing State Journal last Friday on this same sub- ject which is a release by Representative Smit. Mr. Smit is a successful consulting en- gineer in private life and well acquainted with this subject. We greatly appreciate your interest and assistance in this matter which has been and continues to be very troublesome to us. Sincerely, R. GERALD RICE, M.D., Acting Director. Mr. GRIFFIN. Mr. President, a little investigation on our part has confirmed that the Michigan experience is not unique. As indicated by Dr. Rice, the Great Lakes-Upper Mississippi River Board of State Sanitary Engineers, rep- resenting an informal compact of officials from New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, In- diana, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Minne- sota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, adopted a resolution on March 31, 1967, calling on the FHA to \"immediately review its standards of engineering design\" and to make them \"conform with good engi- neering practice and those of the respec- tive State departments of health.\" Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that the full text of this resolution be printed in the RECORD following my remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See exhibit 1.) Mr. GRIFFIN. Mr. President, my office has been in contact with responsible authorities in a number of States. In each case, the appropriate official has ex- pressed great concern about the prac- tices of the FHA, and each has raised substantially the same criticism. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that a number of letters from offi- cials in other States and that several newspaper articles be included at the conclusion of my remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See exhibit 2.) Mr. GRIFFIN. Mr. President, the ad- ministration of this Federal program by FHA has seriously hampered the devel- opment of safe and adequate water re- sources in Michigan. The department of health in Michigan has appropriately required that water distribution systems be designed to pro-vide a level of flow reasonably adequate to meet fire-protection needs. This is es- sential, not only for fire protection, but for economic development. If such devel- opment is to be encouraged, considera- tion must be given to providing adequate fire protection which is reflected, of course, in the rates charged for fire in- surance. Michigan and other States have taken such factors into account in estab- lishing their standards. Let me point to another example of FHA judgment. In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, the severe winters can re- sult in frozen water pipes. Cast iron pipe is used in water systems in that region because it can be more easily thawed- electrically. But FHA officials have taken the position that small communities in Michigan's Upper Peninsula should use plastic water pipe. They argue that it has worked well in Mississippi. FHA officials complain about a lack of funds. But they seem to have enough money to send agents into the field to solicit more and more applications un- der the program-applications which will only gather dust in a Washington file drawer. This practice is particularly odious because it serves to raise false hopes in hundreds of communities where adequate and soundly designed water and waste systems are desperately needed. Only eight out of about 200 Michigan applications for funds under this pro- gram have been approved to date. The other communities have been waiting- and waiting-while the FHA insists upon plastic water pipe in Michigan and pres- sures for inferior engineering standards. The members of the Michigan Repub- lican delegation in Congress became so concerned about this situation that they recently dispatched a letter to the Sec- retary of Agriculture urging the Depart- ment to reappraise existing procedures with a view toward adopting more equitable practices. The letter sum- marized the problem very well, and I ask that it be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See exhibit 3.) Mr. GRIFFIN. While it may be all right to ask the FHA to \"straighten itself out,\" I have become convinced that the best way to proceed is with legislation which will direct the agency to do so. Therefore, I am today introducing a bill which would amend the Consolidated Farmers Home Administration Act to re- quire that safety and health standards established by a State be recognized by the FHA in considering applications for funds under this program. I have also considered the possibility of transferring administration of the program from the FHA to the Commu- nity Facilities Administration of the De- partment of Housing and Urban Devel- opment. While such a move should not be necessary, Congress may want to adopt it as well. Mr. President, enactment of this legis- lation will resolve what has become a bureaucratic tug of war, benefiting no one. I urge the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry to hold hearings on this billas soon as possible with a view toward its early passage. Mr. President, I ask also that a copy of the bill be printed in the RECORD. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately re- ferred; and, in accordance with the re- quest of the Senator from Michigan, the bill will be printed in the RECORD. The bill (S. 2705) to amend section 306 of the Consolidated Farmers Home Ad- ministration Act of 1961, as amended, to require water supply and waste disposal systems constructed in any State with funds under such section to comply with health and safety standards prescribed by the appropriate agency of such State, introduced by Mr. GRIFFIN, was received, read twice by its title, referred to the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, and ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: S. 2705 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That section 306 of the Consolidated Farmers Home Ad- ministration Act of 1961, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1926), is amended by adding at the end thereof a new subsection as follows: \"(d) No loan shall be made or insured under this section and no grant shall be made under this section for the construc- tion of any public water supply or waste dis- posal system in any State unless the pro- posed system has been submitted to the ap- propriate State agency and such agency has determined and certified to the Secretary that such proposed system complies with the standards for health and safety pre- scribed by such agency for the type of fa- cility to be constructed.\" ExHIBrr 1 RESOLUTION REGARDING WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SYSTEMS (By the Great Lakes-Upper Mississippi River Board of State Sanitary Engineers) Whereas, the Farmers Home Administra- tion, U.S. Department of Agriculture, under Federal act is authorized and does make financial assistance grants to communities and districts of 5,500 population and under for the construction of water supply and sewerage systems, and Whereas, The construction plans and specifications for the systems are reviewed and must be approved by the PHA, and Whereas, The basis of design used by the FHA for the review and approval of engi- neering plans for the systems are very low with respect to such items as pipe sizes, fire protection and materials for construc- tion, and Whereas, The systems under considera- tion are public systems which come under the supervision of state departments of health, and Whereas, The low standards of design of FHA which are different from those of the state departments of health has caused con- fusion and can and does result in the con- struction of substandard water and sewerage systems, and tend to compromise the health and fire protection afforded the people served. Now, therefore, be it resolved, That the Great Lakes-Upper Mississippi River Board Meeting in annual conference in Chicago on March 30 and 31, 1967, requests that the FHA immediately review its standards of en- gineering design and that they be made to conform with good engineering practice and further that in each state, the standards of design be in conformity with those of the respective state departments of health, and Be it further resolved, That copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Secretary of34269 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 Agriculture, the Administrator of the Farm- ers Home Administration, and the Director of the Bureau of the Budget. Adopted March 31, 1967. ExHIBrr 2 COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, Harrisburg, November 1, 1967. Hon. ROBERT P. GRIFFIN, U.S. Senate, Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR GRIFFIN: It is gratifying to learn of your interest and possible action in connection with the need for Farmers Home Administration to adhere to adequate en- vironmental and engineering standards in connection with water supply and sewerage projects. I am sure that there is a basis for corrective action to prevent substandard and inadequate water supply and sanitation in- stallations in connection with FHA projects. One of the most fundamental approaches which could be taken to improve not only the technical problems but also to achieve better over-all coordination would be to transfer this program to an agency which is now ad- ministering such grants. This would reduce somewhat the proliferation of agencies with which the local communities must deal. It is possible of course that this may not be feasible. Another desirable approach would be to establish through legislation as a clear in- dication of congressional policy that FHA projects would be required to conform with the standards in the states in which they are located. This would eliminate any question on such matters as pipe sizes, construction de- tails and applicability of various types of sew- age treatment. In Pennsylvania the principal problem with respect to sewerage systems have been-(1) Suggesting different (lower) types of sewage treatment on projects already well firmed up through engineering investigations and (2) Causing delays in treatment plant construc- tion by offering excessively optimistic predic- tions of fund availability. In connection with water supply systems there is a dilemma on provision of full water supply services in- cluding fire protection. We will be very happy to be kept informed of progress in this matter. Sincerely yours, WESLEY E. GILBERTSON, Director, Bureau of Environmental Health STATE OF NEW YORK, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, Albany, N.Y., November 6,1967. Hon. ROBERT P. GRIFFIN, Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR GRIFFIN: This is to confirm our recent telephone conversation regarding the resolution concerning the installation of water and sewerage systems by the Farmers Home Administration, adopted by the Great Lakes-Upper Mississippi River Board of State Sanitation Engineers, March 31, 1967. The resolution basically indicates \"That the Great Lakes-Upper Mississippi River Board Meeting in annual conference in Chi- cago on March 30 and 31, 1967, requests that the Farmers Home Administration immedi- ately review its standards of engineering de- sign and that they be made to conform with good engineering practice and further that in each state, the standards of design be in conformity with those of the respective state departments of health.\" Copies of this reso- lution were transmitted to the Secretary of Agriculture, the Administrator of the Farm- ers Home Administration, and the Director of the Bureau of the Budget. The resolution was adopted because, in some instances, the Farmers Home Adminis- tration was approving the installation of public water supplies which did not meetthe standards of other public water suppliesinstalled in that specific state and approved by that health department. In some in- stances, plastic pipe was being used, while the use of such plastic pipe was not permitted by the State Health Department in other public water supply systems in that state. Since all these systems installed by the Farmers Home Administration are actually public water supplies, although generally in- stalled in a rural area, they should of neces- sity meet the public water supply standards of the state within which they are being in- stalled and should have the approval of that State Department of Health. It would appear that the Federal govern- ment should be leading in setting high stand- ards in all of their agencies, rather than al- lowing some of their Federal agencies to per- mit installations which would not adequate- ly meet all the needs of a community. Sincerely yours, MEREDIrH H. THOMPSON, Assistant Commissioner. STATE OF OHIO, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, Columbus, Ohio, November 13, 1967. Hon. ROBERT P. GarFFIN, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR GRIFFIN: We have your let- ter of November 1, 1967, that requested that we provide you with our comments on the activity of the Farmers Home Administra- tion in the public water supply and sewerage field in Ohio. Major Items of concern are as follows: 1-It has been a longstanding policy of the Ohio Department of Health to require that water supply systems meet or be such that they can be economically converted to meet fire underwriters requirements so that fire protection as well as public health protection is provided. The FHA financed improvements provide water service for homes in built up portions of incorporated areas as well as farm homes that are served by long rural lines. We have accepted the FHA policy that fire protection may not be reasonable for economic reasons in the rural lines but are convinced that in the built up sections of incorporated areas, the pipelines and struc- tures should be of such design that they could be used or economically converted to provide the water necessary for adequate fire protection in these centers of population. The FHA authorize no grant participation if the fire protection is provided. 2-Experience in Ohio has been that prob- lems develop in water supply systems that are owned and maintained by property owner type nonprofit corporations. During the pe- riod that the system is being installed, every- one is very cooperative and adequate leader- ship is available. As time progresses the leaders of the first stage pass out of active participation, maintenance problems develop in the system. Funds for this maintenance are difficult to obtain and the attitude of the consumer changes. We prefer not to have our water utilities operated by property owner type non-profit corporations but to have the utilities operated by public entities. Recently the FHA has informed groups in Ohio that the group cannot obtain FHA in- sured loans if they are a public entity but they can obtain FHA insured loans if they are organized as property owner, non-profit corporation. It is obvious that the Ohio De- partment of Health received immediate pres- sure, from groups desiring loans, to make an immediate change in policy based on prom- ises that these new groups would provide adequate management. Ohio law is such that there is no review or control of the operation of non-profit public utilities by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. The FHA indicated that the reason that they had loan funds available for non-profit corporations but not to public entities (in- cluding incorporated villages) was due to thefact that they have two sources of funds. One source is the U.S. Congress and these funds are known as appropriated funds and are relatively small portions of their avail- able funds. The remainder and major part of their funds are from private investment sources and are known as \"insured funds\". A U.S. Treasury Department ruling was such that the \"Insured funds\" could not be used for public entities which means that they have very little real money available for municipal utilities or other utilities owned by public entities even though they have done a good job in contacting municipalities and soliciting applications for loans from them. 3-It is noted that any type of sewage treatment is acceptable to the FHA as long as the treatment is done by lagoons. It is the opinion of the Ohio Department of Health that sewage lagoons have a very defi- nite place in the field but that they are not an universal tool that can be used in any location. Consulting engineers have indicated that they have had very little success in obtaining FHA permission to use any other type treatment. Very truly yours, GEORGE H. EAGLE, Chief Engineer. STATE OF ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, Springfield, Ill., November 6,1967. Hon. ROBERT P. GRIFFIN, Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR GRIFFIN: I understand from your assistant, Mr. Joe Deweese, that you are considering introducing legislation to re- quire the Federal Farmers Home Administra- tion to conform with the design standards of the several State Departments of Health re- garding the design of water supply and sew- erage systems by the Farmers Home Admin- istration within each of the several states. We have had some problem with FHA with respect to the underdesign of water supply systems. The question principally involves the provision of adequate fire protection on rural water districts. We would certainly support your efforts to amend the federal law making it mandatory for the Farmers Home Administration to conform with good engineering practice and further that in each state, the standards of design of FHA be in conformity with those of the respective State Departments of Public Health or other state agency for the design of public water supply and sewerage systems, Very truly yours, C. W. KLASSEN, Chief Sanitary Engineer. STATE OF MINNESOTA, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, Minneapolis, November 13,1967. Hon. ROBERT P. GRIFFIN, U.S. Senator from Michigan, Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR GRIFFIN: As a member of the Great Lakes-Upper Mississippi Board of State Sanitary Engineers I was a party to the resolution adopted by the Board on March 31, 1967, regarding problems with the Farmers Home Administration. I have seen a copy of the letter written to you by Dr. R. Gerald Rice, Acting Director of the Mich- igan Department of Public Health, under date of October 30, discussing this problem. Although we have not had as much diffi- culty as some of the other states report, I am in concurrence with the statements in Items 2 through 6 of Dr. Rice's letter. I feel it is absolutely essential for FHA as well as other Federal agencies to conform to the standards of the states in which they operate. I believe we have had perhaps fewer prob- lems than some of the states largely because there have not been many applications to FHA. In addition, we have a very cooperative34270 November 29, 1967 CON State Director for FHA, so that an effort has been made to meet our standards within the framework of FHA authority. It would seem that specific legislation re- quiring cooperation would be in order. Respectfully, F. L. WOODWARD, Director, Division of Environmental Health. [From the Lansing (Mich.) State Journal, Oct. 27, 1967] LEGISLATOR RAPS U.S. \"RUNAROUND\" Practices of the Farmers Home Administra- tion brought fresh charges from Rep. Ray- mond J. Smit, R-Ann Arbor, that the fed- eral agency is stifling sewage and water treatment development. He accused the agency of requiring sub- standard designs for waste treatment and water supply, \"runarounds\" and ham- stringing community efforts to extend public health services. \"Farm agency loans require that no fu- ture extensions of water and sewer systems be made unless prior approval by the FHA is given,\" he charged. Even though the agency doesn't have the funds, Smit claimed that its agents con- tinue \"to beat the bushes for new FHA ap- plications.\" INSIDIOUS EFFECT \"Communities complain that they have also been duped into contracting for profes- sional services to plan their project,\" he said. Then, he added, the community faces the obligations for the professional services and the promised U.S. grant funds are not allocated. \"Such is the insidious effect of the false high hopes and great disappointments of federal promises,\" Smit said. Local officials, he added, have also com- plained of \"runarounds\" from the U.S. Farmers Home Administration. \"Communities contend they are strung along, not being told where they stand, but with perpetual bait of 'high on the priority list' held before them,\" he said. In other instances, local officials said the agency offers grants for portions of projects and federal loans for the balance. \"At least one community was prevailed upon to reject a private bid and accept a more expensive federal bid for their bonds,\" Smit said. EXPRESS CONCERN \"I contend,\" he added, \"that the United States government is not a savings and loan institution and that this 'loan brokerage' operation engaged in by the FHA is deplor- able. \"If a private investor were to do this it would be considered illegal, but the Farm Administration seems to feel they can ucer- ate beyond the ethics imposed upon private enterprise.\" Bonding attorneys, he contended, have re- ported that despite complicated FHA require- ments the agency has refused to permit the communities to hire competent counsel on bond issue questions. \"This prevents communities from getting straight answers and puts them at the mercy, such as it is, of the federal farm agent and causes unexpert handling of bond sales,\" Smit said. Smit said a legitimate question is why the farm agency should be involved in urban problems in the first place. Michigan congressmen and senators have indicated concern, and frustration over the problem, he added. [From the Lansing (Mich.) State Journal, Oct.19,1967] SEWAGE DISPOSAL'S FATE BIG QUESTION (By Mert H. Dean) ITHACA.-A cold wind from Washington has brought a chill to this community overJGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE the fate of its lagoon-type sewage disposal system. The cold wind came in the form of a fed- eral \"freeze\" on funds available through the Farmers Home Administration offices for any work projects which haven't been fully processed. The status of the Ithaca applications for both grant and low-interest loans is not offi- cially known here so whether these amounts are included under the \"freeze\" order cannot be immediately determined. It was more than a year ago FHA an- nounced to Ithaca city officials they would receive a $24,000 grant and a low-interest loan of $134,000 toward construction of the disposal system. To handle local share of costs, the city submitted an application for sale of bonds and received permission a month ago to make sale of such items. So that some idea could be gained on total cost of the project, bids were taken late in the summer with Smith Engineering and Ex- cavators of Lansing, the low bidder. Work- men from that company began shortly after the bids were opened to do some of the pre- liminary work, even though no formal ap- proval of a contract came through the city council. Now the work is almost completed by the firm, as hopes were held the system could be placed in use this fall before freezing weather arrived. Status of the project was not known by city officials or those of the Gratiot FHA office here when the city council discussed the delay in Tuesday night's council meeting. No action could be taken on the project, though authorization was given to sign a contract with Consumers Power Company for water department needs In electrical current which should bring up to a $500 per year savings to the city over present rates being paid. ExHIBrr 3 CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, Washington, D.C., October 30,1967. Hon. ORVILLE L. FREEMAN, Secretary of Agriculture, Washington, D.C. MY DEAR MR. SECRETARY: A matter of deep concern has come to our attention relating to the Implementation in Michigan of the Farmers Home Administration's water and sewage assistance program for communities and districts of 5,500 population and under. As you are aware, Section 3 of the author- izing legislation, Public Law 89-240, states in its pertinent part, that no grant shall be made unless the Secretary of Agriculture determines that a project: \"(ii) is designed and constructed so that adequate capacity will be or can be made available to serve the present population of the area to the extent feasible and to serve the reasonably foreseeable growth needs of the area, or (ii1) is necessary for orderly community development consistent with a comprehensive community water or sewer development plan of the rural area and not inconsistent with any planned development under State, county, or municipal plans ap- proved as official plans by competent au- thority for the area in which the rural com- munity is located. ..\" The Department of Public Health of the State of Michigan has in recent months re- peatedly expressed its dissatisfaction to the FHA over the administration of several as- pects of this program. These include not only the practice of soliciting and approving more projects than can be funded but also ques- tionable regulations covering bond arrange- ments and standards of engineering design as well. In a letter to FHA Administrator Howard Bertsch dated July 6, 1967, John F. Vogt, Chief, Division of Engineering, Michi- gan Department of Public Health concluded: Once again we would urge that the Farm- ers Home Administration critically review34271 its standards of engineering design for both water supply and sewerage systems with a goal of bringing them into conformity with commonly accepted good engineering prac- tice and latitude for exercising professional engineering judgment. Consideration should be given to seeking advice from state health departments, engineers in private practice and others and include representation from various areas in the country. Further, we would strongly urge that practices and proce- dures be discontinued which tend to discour- age local initiative. A similar view has also been expressed in a resolution adopted March 31, 1967, by the Great Lakes-Upper Mississippi River Board of State Sanitary Engineers, copy of which is enclosed. It is apparent from the authorizing legis- lation cited above that the intent of Congress with regard to this program was to facilitate rather than frustrate and complicate the orderly development of water and sewer fa- cilities. Furthermore, it is equally clear that the criticisms here expressed reach to ques- tions considerably more fundamental than simply the matter of the availability of Fed- eral money. Consequently, we the under- signed members of the Michigan Congres- sional Delegation strongly urge that you give this matter your earliest and most careful review. Sincerely yours, ROBERT P.

Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, it has come to my attention that 1968 marks a double anniversary for helium. In 1868-nearly 100 years ago-an Eng- lishman, Sir Joseph N. Lockyer, first dis- covered that the gases of the sun con- tained a new element, helium. However, it was not until 50 years later that helium was extracted from natural gas in other than laboratory quantities in the United States and Canada. The northwestern portion of my great home State, Oklahoma, is among the helium-producing areas of the Nation and a contributor to the future of our Nation through this production. This natural resource-vital to our na- tional security and welfare, in our Na- tion's nuclear, electronic, space, and underseas technology efforts-serves as a fitting example of effective natural re- source conservation through Govern- ment and industry cooperation. CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 We must-and can-profit in all natural resource conservation by follow- ing the fine example set by Government and industry teamwork in conservation of helium. I commend \"The National Helium Cen- tennial Year\" and urge Members of Con- gress to join with me in support of the joint resolution, which we should com- plete prior to the inaugural of the new year. ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY ED- UCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1967- AMENDMENT AMENDMENT NO. 480 Mr. RUSSELL submitted an amend- ment, intended to be proposed by him, to the bill (H.R. 7819) to strengthen and improve programs of assistance for ele- mentary and secondary education by ex- tending authority for allocation of funds to be used for education of Indian chil- dren and children in overseas dependents schools of the Department of Defense, by extending and amending the National Teacher Corps program, by providing as- sistance for comprehensive educational planning, and by improving programs of education for the handicapped; to im- prove authority for assistance to schools in federally impacted areas and areas suffering a major disaster; and for other purposes, which was ordered to lie on the table and to be printed. EXTENSION OF CERTAIN NAVAL VESSEL LOANS-AMENDMENTS AMENDMENTS NOS. 481 AND 482 Mr. CLARK submitted two amend- ments, intended to be proposed by him, to the bill (H.R. 6167) to authorize the extension of certain naval vessel loans now in existence, and a new loan, and for other purposes, which were ordered to lie on the table and to be printed. ADDITIONAL COSPONSOR OF BILL Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, at its next printing, the name of the Senator from New York [Mr. JAvITS] be added as a co- sponsor of the bill (S. 2134) to provide incentives for the establishment of new or expanded job-producing industrial and commercial establishments in rural areas. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. NOTICE CONCERNING NOMINATION BEFORE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY Mr. EASTLAND.

On behalf of the Committee on the Judiciary, notice is hereby given to all persons interested in this nomination to file with the committee, in writing, on or before Wednesday, December 6, 1967, any representations or objections theymay wish to present concerning the above nomination, with a further state- ment whether it is their intention to ap- pear at any hearing which may be scheduled. ADDRESSES, EDITORIALS, AR- TICLES, ETC., PRINTED IN THE RECORD On request, and by unanimous con- sent, addresses, editorials, articles, etc., were ordered to be printed in the REC- ORD, as follows: By Mr. MONRONEY: Speech by him entitled \"Oklahoma Foot- ball Excellence.\" PORTENTS OF FURTHER U.S. MILI- TARY ESCALATION IN VIETNAM Mr. GRUENING. Mr. President, Mr. James Reston in the New York Times for November 29, 1967, speculates not only on the reasons for Secretary Mc- Namara's rumored resignation as Sec- retary in order to assume the duties of president of the World Bank, but also on the timing of the spate of rumors. The speculation here-and it is no more than that-- Mr. Reston writes- is that the opposition to McNamara within the Joint Chiefs of Staff for \"interfering,\" as they put it, with the conduct of the war had built up to the point where there was at least a fear within the Administration that the President might be confronted with the resignation of two or three of his top mili- tary advisers. This is a very interesting speculation, coinciding as it does with the reports of a televised national broadcast by Gen- erals Eisenhower and Bradley the night before, in which they said: The United States should consider tempo- rary forays into North Vietnam, and, if necessary, hot pursuit of the enemy Into neighboring neutral Cambodia and Laos as well. General Eisenhower also stated he \"would favor pursuit, by air, even into China.\" It thus seems that the United States is about to escalate even further its mili- tary intervention. Almost 4 years ago-on March 10, 1964-I made a major speech on the subject of U.S. military involvement in Vietnam. The title of that speech was: \"The United States Should Get Out of Vietnam.\" Had that advice been heeded, then thousands upon thousands of U.S. cas- ualties would have been avoided. I have been repeating that advice over the years since then as the escalation of the U.S. military adventure in Vietnam has steadily increased. I continue to give this advice today with even more apprehension about the significance of this latest aggrandize- ment of the military influence. No more information is available to me than appears in the press, but I, too, can speculate. Do these latest moves mean that, with the avowed purpose of \"hot pursuit\" the U.S. troops will be making forays intoNorth Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and even mainland China? Will the forays in \"hot pursuit\" into North Vietnam on a temporary basis shortly turn into an all-out invasion of North Vietnam, as some unnamed offi- cial in Saigon was reported to have urgedat about the time Generals Eisenhower and Bradley were advocating the same thing on a \"temporary basis\"? It should be recalled that when the bombing of North Vietnam was first or- dered in February 1965, it was supposed to be on a tit-for-tat basis-steadily es- calated since then into daily missions to attack an ever-growing list of targets. How long will it be-if this course of escalation is followed to its logical con- clusion-before Haiphong harbor is mined and the dikes of North Vietnam will be destroyed, causing the deaths of thousands upon thousands of North Vietnamese civilians? How long will it be-if this course of escalation is followed to its logical con- clusion-until U.S. planes are destroying airfields in Communist China, on the bland assumption that the mainland Chinese Government will sit idly by and watch U.S. planes destroy its airfields without taking retaliatory measures? And, if China retaliates how can it be expected that the Soviet Union will not honor the mutual security pact it has with mainland China? The United States may reiterate ceaselessly that \"it seeks no wider war\" but its actions do not accord with its words. It is high time to assert civilian control over the military establishment and start to deescalate the military involve- ment in Vietnam. I ask unanimous consent that the ar- ticle by Mr. James Reston appearing in the New York Times for November 29, 1967, entitled \"Why McNamara?-And Why Now?\" be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: [From the New York Times, Nov. 29, 1967] WASHINGTON: WHY MCNAMARA?-AND WHY Now? (By James Reston) WASHINGTON, November 28.-The two main questions about President Johnson's new appointee to the presidency of the World Bank are: Why McNamara, and why now? The answer to the first is fairly easy. Mc- Namara wanted it. He is qualified to do it. And despite his reputation as a mechanical computer, he is much more interested in removing the causes of wars than In waging and directing wars. Read his Montreal speech, which identifies poverty as the root of war. and the point is clear. PRESIDENTIAL ASSURANCES Moreover, McNamara was at the top of the list of candidates for the presidency of the Ford Foundation in 1965, though opposed by some influential members, but the President fell ill at that time and McNamara asked John J. McCloy to take his name off the list. Accordingly, the Secretary of Defense had a call on the President for the bank job since the President had told him on several oc- casions that he could have almost any job he wanted. There is a partial answer to the timing question, but only partial. McNamara was34272 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE George Woods' candidate. Woods talked to his two predecessors in the World Bank presi- dency, Eugene Black and the same John J. McCloy. They agreed with Woods that Mc- Namara would be the best candidate, but while Woods pressed the Administration for a nominee, nothing happened for sixteen months. DECISIONS DELAYED Finally, the board of the World Bank asked Woods to stay on for a year beyond his regu- lar five-year term that expires on Dec. 31, 1967, and pressed the Administration for a decision by Oct. 31 last. That date passed without a decision. Meanwhile, Woods had talked to McNamara and urged him to con- sider the job and talk to the President about it. Apparently Mr. McNamara did so in gen- eral terms over the Armistice day weekend when he and the President made a long flight to the Pacific Coast and back. Two points are interesting here. First, the President's decision to appoint McNamara was made a week ago Monday and passed on to the bank a week ago last Thursday, but McNamara did not know about the actual nomination by the President until after it was made. And second, despite the pressure from the bank for a \"nominee\" or as some members of the bank board preferred, a \"choice of nominees,\" only the McNamara name was put forward, and even then the President was not obliged to put forward any name at that time. So the timing answer is inconclusive. The President could have waited until after the election if he liked. He did not respond to the bank's appeals for over a year, and then suddenly did so. The speculation here-it is no more than that-is that the opposition to McNamara within the Joint Chiefs of Staff for \"interfering,\" as they put it, with the conduct of the war had built up to the point where there was at least a fear within the Administration that the President might be confronted with the resignation of two or three of his top military advisers. HOCUS pOCUS Was this discussed between General West- moreland and the Joint Chiefs during West- moreland's recent visit in Washington? Was the danger of resignations passed on to the President by somebody on the armed serv- ices committees of the Congress? We do not know the answers to these questions, but they are the subject of lively conversation here, and the cause of considerable anxiety among those in Washington who regard Mc- Namara as a restraining influence on the generals and politicians who want to escalate the war. In any event, two or three facts are fairly obvious. The President could have avoided the whole issue for a year. McNamara did not resign or refuse to go on. He is tired, but not so tired that he has to be relieved, and, in any event, will undoubtedly stay on at the Pentagon for a while, even if he ac- cepts the job when it is offered to him later this week. Notice has been given by the President, however, that he is looking for a new Secre- tary of Defense. He has insisted-even to McNamara, according to one source-that he has no successor In mind and wants McNa- mara's help in choosing one. Thus the anti- McNamara faction gets something and Mc- Namara does too. This is, at least, a novel procedure. The hawks are pleased with it and the doves de- pressed. McNamara is going, but nobody knows when, to be replaced by somebody, no- body knows whom. Thus everybody gets something but not quite what he wanted: McNamara is on his way out, but not quite, and will still have his hand on the brake. Nobody knows how firmly or for how long. So everybody is wondering and doubting andspeculating about what the President is up to, and not, of course, for the first time. AMERICANS SUPPORT THEIR PRES- IDENT IN TIME OF STRESS Mr. RANDOLPH. Mr. President, Cam- bridge, Mass., site of Harvard Univer- sity and MIT, has given President John- son's Vietnam policies a sizable electoral victory in a November referendum. Cit- izens there have supported the purpose and directions of our national effort. It is significant that, in November, two cities-San Francisco and Cambridge- where one might expect the heavy dis- sent, voted support for our men in Viet- nam. These votes are, in my opinion, indic- ative of the feeling of the majority of Americans. I believe that if a referendum were taken in almost any American city, the results would be an endorsement for the President's reasoned policies. Americans do keep their promises to other nations. Americans do help people when they are under attack from hostile forces. Americans do stand with their Presi- dent in time of stress. Americans do rally behind gallant sons who are fighting for justice in the hills and rice paddies of Vietnam. Americans do persevere in the struggle against communism. MONTANA PUBLISHER RETIRES Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, one of the truly great institutions of our so- ciety is the weekly newspaper. The week- lies have produced some of our finest citi- zens and journalists. One of Montana's longtime publishers, A. H. Eiselein, re- tired this summer after 61 years. He had been associated with the Boulder Mon- itor since 1913. A. H. Eiselein comes from a family well disciplined in newspaper work. His father was an engraver in Germany; his late brother, A. W. Eiselein, published the Roundup Record-Tribune, and his four sons, all trained in engraving and newspaper work. Mr. Eiselein is an ar- ticulate spokesman in many areas and was an outstanding weekly editor who contributed a great deal to his com- munity. I have known Eisie since my early days in Montana politics. He is a man who has always had the respect of leaders and candidates in both parties. Mr. and Mrs. Eiselein are deserving of many more years of good health and productive en- deavor at a pace less rigorous than the past 61 years in the newspaper business. They have my personal good wishes and congratulations. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent to have printed in the RECORD a feature story published in the November 1967 issue of the Montana Fourth Estate. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: A. H. EISELEIN RETIRES APTER 61 YEARS' WORK A. H. Eiselein, who at the age of 78 had accumulated 61 years of experience in thenewspaper business, retired July 20 as pub- lisher of the Boulder Monitor, where he had worked since 1913. The new publisher is a son, Joseph Eise- lein, who has been in the engraving busi- ness, first at Great Falls and then at Twin Falls, Idaho. Joe Eiselein, was at the Great Falls Tribune for 12 years until 1946 and then bought a half interest in the plant at the Twin Falls Times News. A. H. Eiselein, or \"Elsie\" as he is known to his friends, was born in Wiconi, Minn., in 1889. His father was an engraver in Ger- many, who migrated to the United States. A. H. served his apprenticeship in a print shop at Buffalo Lake, Minn. The following was written by Dr. A. E. Westwell, Helena, long-time friend of Mr. Eiselein: \"Fortunately, his basic training for his career as an editor and publisher began early in life in a traditionally disciplined German family, which adequately prepared him for the self-discipline required in his chosen vocation. In those days of limited communi- cations media, the editor, the clergy and the politician to a lesser degree, were the mold- ers of public opinion, and as such the editor had to be a philosopher, judge, leader, de- bater, and in his spare time a news gatherer, printer and ingenious mechanic. A. H. de- veloped into being all of these. He had to, in order to survive in those rugged times.\" He came west in 1908 and worked with his brother Alfred W. Eiselein who established the Roundup Record at the time. Returning to Buffalo Lake in 1910 he married Gladys Sheppard, and became publisher of the paper at Danube, Minn., when he had the distinc- tion of being the youngest publisher in that state. Returning to Montana with his wife, he was at Harlowton and at Two Dot. A. H. Eiselein's name is on the roster of publish- ers of the Musselshell News, which had been founded in 1906 and was one of the predeces- sor papers of the Harlowton Times. His name is also on record as having been publisher of the Two Dot Tribune, founded in 1912 by S. W. Tindell. Eiselein succeeded Tindell and was succeeded by Paul King, during whose regime the paper's plant burned. It was in 1913 that Eiselein went to Boul- der where he went to work for Publisher Young of the Boulder Monitor. Here he pub- lished a Homesteaders Guide and in 1915 he purchased the paper from Young. Mr. and Mrs. Eiselein have four sons whom they trained in newspapering and in engrav- ing. They are Joe, Buz, Gordon and John. Buz has a lithograph shop in Kalispell. Gor- don is proprietor of the Billings Engraving Co. John abandoned the printing profession and is doing medical research in Livermore, Calif. Mrs. Eiselein helped operate the Monitor all through the years. It was her task to gather and write the local news. A. H. has one living brother, Henry Eiselein of Buffalo Lake, Minn. Following his retire- ment he and Mrs. Eiselein visited first in California and later in their old home town of Buffalo Lake. The elder brother, A. W. Eiselein remained at Roundup where he had arrived via the first regularly-scheduled train on the Milwaukee. There he purchased a lot, arranged for a building, and left to buy printing equipment. The first issue was April 3, 1908. The paper became the Roundup-Tribune in 1930. He re- mained as publisher until 1964 when he re- tired and was succeeded by his daughter, Mrs. Kenneth P. Rasmussen and her husband. A. W. Eiselein died at Roundup in January of this year at the age of 82. The following is from the pen of Dr. West- well concerning A. H. Eiselein: \"'Elsie' has the mark of a true editor. Budding politicians of both major parties34273 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 sought his advice in the early days. Some have risen to high places in national affairs, but despite heavy schedules they all take time to stop and visit with their old friend when they return to Montana. \"His service to the community and state are legend. Intensely loyal to Boulder, he lent his enthusiastic support to every endeavor designed to improve the town. He was the effective champion of the State Training School from the early days when It served both the blind and the deaf and during the later years when it has served only the mentally retarded. \"A few years ago when he and Mrs. Eiselein celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary hundreds of friends from all walks of life gathered in Boulder to celebrate the affair with them.\" AN EDITOR'S HONEST VIEWS: \"WHY WE NEED TO WIN\" Mr. FONG. Mr. President, a major factor in the shaping of American public opinion about Vietnam is the coverage given it by the press. Journalists are free to see and hear what they want in South Vietnam and to report their findings accordingly. Unhampered by military censorship, our newsmen are, and should be, the eyes and ears for Americans on the home- front. We rely on them heavily to keep us informed on the day-to-day events as well as on the overall picture in Vietnam. We expect the newsman to \"give us the news straight.\" We are not so much in- terested in what the newsman hoped to find in Vietnam, but we are vitally con- cerned about what he actually observed there. We want him to test his observa- tions by asking himself the question: \"Am I reporting what I want to see, or am I reporting what is really there?\" If the newsman meets the test by reporting what he actually sees there, he is true to himself and is living up to the highest ideals of journalism. He has indeed helped his readers to become truly imformed. I am pleased to call attention to such an example of excellent journalism. A. A. (BudI Smyser, editor of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, who was recently in South Vietnam, has written a news analysis of the Vietnam situation. It is both infor- mative and credible because he first asked himself whether he was reporting his preconceptions as facts or whether he was reporting the realities of the sit- uation as he in fact found them. I commend Bud Smyser's report to all who want integrity, candor, and intelli- gence combined in a dispatch from Saigon. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD the article by Smyser which was published in the November 21, 1967, issue of the Star- Bulletin. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: EDITOR Now MORE CONVINCED OF NEED To WIN (By A. A. Smyser) SAIGON. Sourr VIETrNAM.-There seems to be a tendency among Vietnam visitors, jour- nalists included, to find the facts that sup- port the views they held before they came. I came here and to this area of the world feeling that victory in Vietnam is important to both national and free world interests. I leave more convinced than ever.I came here feeling reasonably optimistic about the long-term prospects for victory. I leave more optimistic than when I arrived. I have asked myself whether I have simply fallen into the trap of seeing only what I wanted to see and learning only what I want- ed to learn. Or whether I saw only what people wanted me to see. My answer to myself is that I don't think so. Before reaching Saigon, I had visited seven other major Asian cities-chatted with news- men and officials on the scene, read the press reports and available literature, and looked for myself. Many of the people I met were people I had known before and in whom I place confidence and trust. Other contacts were recommended by such people. If I went to an international brain-washing, it was one I arranged for myself. The domino theory has been out of vogue for awhile. It holds that the nations of Southeast Asia are standing close to each other and that if one is tipped over the others will fall, too. In my view, the domino theory today has more validity than ever before-and South- east Asia recognizes it. That is why the war is winning more and more support from South Vietnam's neighbors even as it seems to grow more unpopular at home. It is not simply the fact that aggression unstopped in Vietnam may be followed by aggression elsewhere against a neighbor. There is also the fact of an emerging sense of regional interest and regional Identity. The nations in this part of the world are more interdependent than ever before. All of them except Indonesia are beginning to make real progress, to provide a better life for their people. All of them, even Indonesia, have hope and reasonable expectation of even bet- ter days to come. Most of them plan their progress in con- cert with their neighbors. In some cases it is as simple as one country sponsoring an engi- neering college to serve the area while an- other provides the school of medicine. But the need for cooperation also can be as dramatic as that with the Mekong River Development project. Its potential for devel- oping power and irrigation for Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and South Vietnam is enormous. But it has aptly been described as a treas- ure chest with four locks and four keys. The treasure can only be unlocked if all four will insert their keys. The four nations recognize this and have attended all 30 meetings of the control group and kept it moving ahead on schedule even though Thailand and Cambodia, for example, do not have diplomatic relations with each other. There are a dozen regional cooperative groups, many, like the Asian Development Bank. having quite a few more members than the relatively small Mekong group. Cooperation is not as imperative in some other areas as with the Mekong but it has some degree of urgency in many matters. This kind of cooperation offers the region its greatest hope-yet it could hardly hope to last if Red China moved aggressively into the area-and all Asia recognizes the impor- tance of the U.S. shield in Vietnam in pre- serving the present atmosphere. By the same token, if the Communists were to moe into power in South Vietnam, the neighbor nations would have to twist and turn to face the new reality. Most of the new, promising cooperative spirit would have to go down the drain. The present trend offers a path toward the kind of world organization and stability we seek as a nation. To permit them to be demolished would not be in Southeast Asia's interest nor in ours. On the Vietnam battle front, it may be said correctly that a five-day visitor is no expert,But even a five-day visitor can look, listen, read and evaluate what he has heard and seen. I found nothing to contradict Gen. West- moreland's statement that the enemy has consistently failed to achieve any single im- portant battle objective. The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese simply haven't won a thing they tried to win. They haven't taken any land from us or significant number of people from us. Their sources of supply are dwindling. Their movements are made steadily more dif- ficult. Their soldiers are deserting in increas- ing numbers. Vietnamese civilians are pass- ing along intelligence information to us at an increasing rate. We have troubles, but few Americans, even the worst critics of the war, would disagree with the officer who ended a summation by saying: \"I'd hate to be on the other side.\" My travels took me to no areas of high dan- ger-but they did take me to places that had been high danger areas in the past. We spent a day in a helicopter over the Mekong Delta, visiting two secure villages, landing on the deck of a ship that conducts amphibious operations against the Viet Cong, and talking to officers engaged in river pa- trols and in rural reconstruction work. We spent another day going 450 miles north to Da Nang, visiting three refugee vil- lages there and looking In on the reconstruc- tion of a bridge that had been mined a few months earlier. The adjoining town is con- sidered to still have substantial sentiment for the Viet Cong. There were films and lectures which Gov. Romney might call brainwash but which stand up factually in the view of reporters and observers who have no axe to grind. Out of all of this I gained a great sense of pride in the kind of Americans we have in Vietnam and in their dedication to their jobs. I was impressed by the leaders I saw. dedicated men who are convinced the cause is right. I was also impressed that we now are near- ing the end of a buildup period and can rea- sonably expect to see much more in results in the next 12 months. In the last two years, we have built more than $1 billion worth of airstrips, canton- ments and harbors in Vietnam, and finally are tapering off. We have pushed our troop level to 500,000 and gained more foreign sup- port. The civilian build-up has seen a constitu- tion written, government elected and govern- ment installed. We have able leaders on the scene who are convinced that the pay-off for all of this will soon come in the form of increasing civilian and military successes. Some worry, in fact, that the Communists will sue for and get a phony peace before we have the chance to realize the pay-off from all this effort. It is worth worrying about. I am convinced that we can win in Vietnam and will win if we persist on something approximating our present course. NATIONAL DATA CENTER Mr. LONG of Missouri. Mr. President, Prof. Arthur R. Miller, of the Univer- sity of Michigan Law School, appeared before the Subcommittee on Adminis- trative Practice and Procedure last spring to discuss the problems of pri- vacy and the National Data Center. Pro- fessor Miller impressed us not only with his intelligence but with his profound concern for the rights of the individual. Recently I read Professor Miller's ar- ticle entitled \"The National Data Cen- ter and Personal Privacy,\" published in SAtlantic magazine for November 1967. I34274 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: THE NATIONAL DATA CENTER AND PERSONAL PRIVACY (By Arthur R. Miller) (NOTE.-The computer age is not to be stayed, as anyone knows who has been billed for another citizen's charge account or has wondered what has happened to his paid-up magazine subscription. The computer sci- ence is already so advanced that experts en- visage a huge National Data Center to speed and simplify the collection of pertinent in- formation about Americans. Properly run, it could be a boon. But any person who has seen an FBI file or been party to a U.S. gov- ernment \"security check\" has reason to know how the abuse or misuse of dossiers of un- evaluated information can threaten an in- dividual's rights. A professor of law at the University of Michigan here discusses the precautions necessary to protect citizens from \"governmental snooping and bureau- cratic spinelessness or perfidy.\" Professor Miller has testified on the subject before the Senate Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure.) The modern computer is more than a sophisticated indexing or adding machine, or a miniaturized library; it is the keystone for a new communications medium whose capacities and implications we are only be- ginning to realize. In the foreseeable fu- ture, computer systems will be tied together by television, satellites, and lasers, and we will move large quantities of information over vast distances in imperceptible units of time. The benefits to be derived from the new technology are many. In one medical center, doctors are already using computers to moni- tor heart patients in an attempt to isolate the changes in body chemistry that precede a heart attack. The search is for an \"early warning system\" so that treatment is not de- layed until after the heart attack has struck. Elsewhere, plans are being made to establish a data bank in which vast amounts of medi- cal information will be accessible through remote terminals to doctors thousands of miles away. A doctor will then be able to determine the antidote for various poisons or get the latest literature on a disease by dial- ing a telephone or typing an inquiry on a computer console. A committee of the Bureau of the Budget has proposed that the federal government set up a National Data Center to compile statistical information on various facets of our society. Certainly the computer can help us simplify record-keeping by assigning everyone a \"birth\" number that will identify him for tax returns, banking, education, so- cial security, the draft, and other purposes. This number could also serve as a telephone number, which, when used on modern com- munication mechanisms, would make it pos- sible to reach Its holder directly no matter where he might be. But such a Data Center poses a grave threat to individual freedom and privacy. With its insatiable appetite for information, its inability to forget anything that has been put into it, a central computer might become the heart of a government surveillance sys- tem that would lay bare our finances, our associations, or our mental and physical health to government inquisitors or even to casual observers. Computer technology is moving so rapidly that a sharp line between statistical and intelligence systems is bound to be obliterated. Even the most innocuous of centers could provide the \"foot in the door\" for the development of an computer-based federal snooping sys- tem. CXIII- 2159-Part 25Since a National Data Center would be augmented by numerous subsystems or satel- lites operated by state and local governments or by private organizations, comprehensive national regulation of computer communi- cations, whether of federal or nonfederal origin, ultimately will become imperative. Moreover, deliberations should not be con- ducted in terms of computer capability as it exists today. New computer hardware is constantly being spawned, machine storage capacity and speed are increasing geometri- cally, and costs are declining. Thus at pres- ent we cannot imagine what the dimensions, the sophistication, or the snooping ability of the National Data Center will turn out to be ten or twenty years from now. Nor can we predict what new techniques will be de- veloped to pierce any safeguards that Con- gress may set up in order to protect people against those who manipulate or falsify in- formation they extract from or put into the center. Of course, it would be foolish to prohibit the use of data-processing technology to carry out important governmental operations simply because it might be abused. However, it is necessary to fashion an adequate legal structure to protect the public against mis- use of information handling. In the past, privacy has been relatively easy to protect for a number of reasons. Large quantities of information about indi- viduals have not been available. Generally decentralized, uncollected, and uncollated, the available information has been relatively superficial, access to it has been difficult to secure, and most people are unable to inter- pret it. During the hearings held recently by two of the congressional subcommittees in- vestigating Invasions of privacy, however, revelations concerning the widespread use of modern electronic and optical snooping de- vices shocked us. In testimony before the House Subcom- mittee on Invasion of Privacy, Edgar S. Dunn. Jr., a research analyst for Resources for the Future, Incorporated, pointed out that information in the center would not be intelligible to the snooper as are the con- tents of a manila folder. Computerized data require a machine, a code book, a set of instructions, and a technician in order to be comprehended. Presumably Mr. Dunn's thesis is that if it is difficult or expensive to gain access to and interpret the data in the center, there is little likelihood of anyone's trying to pry; if the snooper's cost for un- earthing a unit of dirt increases sufficiently, It will become too expensive for him to try to violate the center's integrity. Mr. Dunn's logic fails to take into account other factors. First, if all the information gathered about an individual is in one place, the payoff for snooping is sharply enhanced. Thus, although the cost or difficulty of gain- ing access may be great, the amount of dirt available once access is gained is also great. Second, there is every reason to believe that the art of electronic surveillance will con- tinue to become more efficient and econom- ical. Third, governmental snooping is rarely deterred by cost. Mr. Dunn also ignores a number of special dangers posed by a computerized National Data Center. Ever since the federal govern- ment's entry into the taxation and social welfare spheres, increasing quantities of in- formation have been recorded. Moreover, as recording processes have become mechanized and less cumbersome, there also has been centralization and collation of information. In something akin to Parkinson's Law, the increase in information-handling capacity has created a tendency toward more exten- sive manipulation and analysis of recorded data, which, in turn, has required the col- lection of more and more data. The creation of the Data Center with electronic storage and retrieval capacity will accelerate this pattern.Any increase in the amount of recorded information is certain to increase the risk of errors in reporting and recording and in- dexing. Information distortion also will be caused by machine malfunctioning. More- over, people working with the data in Wash- ington or at a distance through remote termi- nals can misuse the information. As infor- mation accumulates, the contents of an in- dividual's computerized dossier will appear more and more impressive and will impart a heightened sense of reliability to the user, which, coupled with the myth of computer infallibility, will make it less likely that the user will try to verify the recorded data. This will be true despite the \"softness\" or \"im- precision\" of much of the data. Our success or failure in life ultimately may turn on what other people decide to put into our files and on the programmer's ability, or in- ability, to evaluate, process, and interrelate information. The great bulk of the informa- tion likely to find its way into the center will be gathered and processed by relatively un- skilled and unimaginative people who lack discrimination and sensitivity. Furthermore, a computerized file has a certain indelible quality-adversities cannot be overcome simply by the passage of time. There are further dangers. The very exist- ence of a National Data Center may en- courage certain federal officials to engage in questionable surveillance tactics. For ex- ample, optical scanners-devices with the capacity to read a variety of type fonts or handwriting at fantastic rates of speed- could be used to monitor our mail. By link- Ing scanners with a computer system, the information drawn in by the scanner would be converted into machine-readable form and transferred into the subject's file in the National Data Center. Then, with sophisticated programming, the dossiers of all of the surveillance sub- ject's correspondents could be produced at the touch of a button, and an appropriate entry-perhaps \"associates with known criminals\"-could be added to all of them. As a result, someone who simply exchanges Christmas cards with a person whose mail is being monitored might find himself under surveillance or might be turned down when he applies for a job with the government or requests a government grant or applies for some other governmental benefit. An un- tested, impersonal, and erroneous computer entry such as \"associates with known crimi- nals\" has marked him, and he is helpless to rectify the situation. Indeed, it is likely that he would not even be aware that the entry existed. These tactics, as well as the possibility of coupling wiretapping and computer proc- essing, undoubtedly will be extremely at- tractive to overzealous law enforcement of- ficers. Similarly, the ability to transfer into the National Data Center quantities of in- formation maintained in nonfederal files- credit ratings, educational information from schools and universities, local and state tax information, and medical records-will en- able governmental snoopers to obtain data that they have no authority to secure on their own. The compilation of information by un- skilled personnel also creates serious prob- lems of accuracy. It Is not simply a matter of the truth or falsity of what is recorded. Information can be entirely accurate and sufficient in one context and wholly incom- plete and misleading in another. For exam- ple, the bare statement of an individual's marital status has entirely different con- notations to the selective service, a credit bureau, the Internal Revenue Service, and the social security administration. Consider a computer entry of \"divorced\" and the different embellishment that would be necessary in each of those contexts to por- tray an accurate picture of an individual's situation.34275 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 The question of context is most graphi- cally illustrated by the unexplained and in- complete arrest record. It is unlikely that a citizen whose file contains an entry \"arrest- ed. 6/1/42; convicted felony, 1/6/43; three years, federal penitentiary\" would be given federal employment or be accorded the gov- ernmental courtesies accorded other citizens. Yet the subject may simply have been a conscientious objector, And what about the entry \"arrested, disorderly conduct; sen- tenced six months Gotham City jail.\" With- out further explanation, who would know that the person involved was a civil rights demonstrator whose conviction was reversed on appeal? Finally, the risks to privacy created by a National Data Center lie not only in the misuse of the system by those who desire to injure others or who can obtain some per- sonal advantage by doing so. There also is a legitimate concern that government em- ployees in routine clerical positions will have the capacity to inflict damage through negli- gence, sloppiness, thoughtlessness, or sheer stupidity, by unintentionally rendering a record inaccurate, or losing It, or disseminat- ing its contents to people not authorized to see it. To ensure freedom from governmental in- trusion, Congress must legislate reasonably precise standards regarding the information that can be recorded in the National Data Center. Certain types of information should not be recorded even if it is technically feasible to do so and a legitimate administra- tive objective exists. For example, it has long been \"feasible,\" and from some vantage points \"desirable,\" to require citizens to carry and display passports when traveling in this country, or to require universal finger- printing. But we have not done so because these encroachments on our liberties are deemed inconsistent with the philosophical fiber of our society. Likewise, highly personal information, especially medical and psychi- atric information, should not be permitted in the center unless human life depends upon recording it. Legislation sharply limiting the informa- tion which federal agencies and officials can extract from private citizens Is absolutely essential. To reinforce these limitations, the statute creating the Data Center should pro- hibit recording any information collected without specific congressional authorization. Until the quality of the center's operations and the nature of its impact on individual privacy can be better perceived, the center's activities should be restricted to the preserva- tion of factual data. The necessary procedural and technical safeguards seem to fall into two categories: those needed to guarantee the accuracy and integrity of the stored information, and those needed to control its dissemination. To ensure the accuracy of the center's files, an individual should have an opportunity tocorrect errors in information concerning him. Perhaps a print-out of his computer file should be sent to him once a year. Ad-mittedly, this process would be expensive; some agencies will argue that the value ofcertain information will be lost if it Is knownthat the government has it: and there might be squabbles between citizens and the Data Center concerning the accuracy of the filethat would entail costly administrative pro- ceedings. Nonetheless, the right of a citizento be protected against governmental dis-semination of misinformation is so importantthat we must be willing to pay some priceto preserve it. Instead of an annual mailing,citizens could be given access to their files on request, perhaps through a network ofremote computer terminals situated in gov-ernment buildings throughout the country. What is necessary is a procedure for periodi- cally determining when data are outmoded or should be removed from the file. Turning to the question of access, the cen- ter's computer hardware and software mustbe designed to limit access to the informa- tion. A medical history given to a government doctor in connection with an application for veteran's benefits should not be available to federal employees not legitimately in- volved in processing the application. One solution may be to store information accord- ing to its sensitivity or its accessibility, or both. Then, governmental officials can be assigned access keys that will let them reach only those portions of the center's files that are relevant to their particular governmental function. Everyone directing an inquiry to the center or seeking to deposit information in it should be required to identify himself. Finger- or voice-prints ultimately may be the best form of identification. As snooping techniques become more sophisticated, sys- tems may even be needed to counter the possibility of forgery or duplication; perhaps an answer-back system or a combination of finger- and voice-prints will be necessary. In addition, the center should be equipped with protector files to record the identity of inquirers, and these files should be audited to unearth misuse of the system. It probably will also be necessary to audit the programs controlling the manipulation of the files and access to the system to make sure that no one has inserted a secret \"door\" or a pass- word permitting entry to the data by un- authorized personnel. It Is frightening to realize that at present there apparently is no foolproof way to prevent occasional \"mon- itor intrusion\" in large data-processing sys- tems. Additional protection against these risks can be achieved by exercising great care in selecting programming personnel. In the future, sophisticated connections between the center and federal officers throughout the country and between the federal center and numerous state, local, and private centers probably will exist. As a re- sult, information will move into and out of the center over substantial distances by tele- phone lines or microwave relays. The cen- ter's \"network\" character will require Infor- mation to be protected against wiretapping and other forms of electronic eavesdropping. Transmission in the clear undoubtedly will have to be proscribed, and data in machine- readable form will have to be scrambled or further encoded so that they can be rendered intelligible only by a decoding process built into the system's authorized terminals. Al- though It may not be worth the effort or expense to develop completely breakproof codes, sufficient scrambling or coding to make it expensive for an eavesdropper to intercept the center's transmission will be necessary. If information in the center is arranged ac- cording to sensitivity or accessibility, the most efficient procedure may be to use codes of different degrees of complexity. At a minimum, congressional action is necessary to establish the appropriate bal- ance between the needs of the national gov- ernment in accumulating, processing, and disseminating information and the right of individual privacy. This legislation must be reinforced by statutory civil remedies and penal sanctions. Testimony before Congress concerning the intrusive activities of the Post Office, the In- ternal Revenue Service, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service gives us cause to balk at delegating authority over the Data Center to any of the agencies that have a stake in the content of data collected by the government. Some federal personnel are already involved in mail-cover operations, electronic bugging, wiretapping, and other invasions of privacy, and undoubtedly they would try to crack the security of any Data Center that maintains information on an individual basis. Thus it would be folly to leave the center In the hands of any agency whose employees are known to engage in antiprivacy activities. Similarly, the center must be kept away from government officials who are likely to become so entranced withoperating sophisticated machinery and ma- nipulating large masses of data that they will not respect an individual's right to privacy. The conclusion seems inescapable: con- trol over the center must be lodged outside existing channels. A new, completely inde- pendent agency, bureau, or office should be established-perhaps as an adjunct to the Census Bureau or the National Archives- to formulate policy under whatever legisla- tive guidelines are enacted to ensure the pri- vacy of all citizens. The organization would operate the center, regulate the nature of the information that can be recorded and stored, ensure Its accuracy, and protect the center against breaches of security. The new agency's ability to avoid becom- ing a captive of the governmental units using the center would be crucial. Perhaps with proper staffing and well-delineated lines of authority to Congress or the President, the center could achieve the degree of independ- ence needed to protect individuals against governmental or private misuse of informa- tion in the center. At the other end of the spectrum, the center cannot become an island unto itself, populated by technocrats whose conduct is shielded by the alleged om- niscience of the machines they manage and who are neither responsive nor responsible to anyone. The proposed agency should be established before the center is planned. To date there has been virtually no meaningful exchange among scientists, technicians, legal experts, and government people on the implications of the center. The center also might consider supporting some of the planned non- federal computer networks, such as the Interuniverslty Communications Council's (EDUCOM) plan to link the major univer- sities together, using them as models or op- erating laboratories to test procedures and hardware for the federal center. To satisfy those who argue for the early establishment of a purely statistical Data Center, it might be possible for the proposed agency to set up a modest center in which information which does not invade privacy could be made available to government offi- cials, educators, and private researchers. Other federal agencies might establish satel- lite centers that would contain information too sensitive to be recorded in the statistical center during that institution's formative period, although the data in satellites ulti- mately might be transferred to the national center. The threat to Individual privacy posed by the computer comes from the private sector as well as the proposed federal Data Center. Each year state and local governments, edu- cational institutions, trade associations, and industrial firms establish data centers that collect and store quantities of information about individuals. Because the high cost of computer installation forces many organiza- tions to operate on a time-share basis, the nonfederal centers pose a special danger to privacy. Without effective screening and built-in security devices, one participant, ac- cidentally or deliberately, may invade and ex- tract or alter the computer files of another participant. Moreover, because many time- share systems operate over large geographic areas, their transmissions will be vulnerable to tapping or malicious destruction unless they are scrambled or encoded. Right now, a mailing list containing 150 to 170 million names, accompanied by addresses and finan- cial data, is being compiled. The list is so structured that it yields sublists of people in various vocational and avocational cate- gories. Where the necessary information to produce this monster came from and how one gets off the list are mysteries. Currently there are more than two thou- sand independent credit bureaus In the United States, many of whose files are be- ing computerized. Eventually, these bureaus will make a network of their computers,34276 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE creating a ready source of detailed informa- tion about an individual's finances. The ac- curacy of these records will become increas- ingly crucial; an honest dispute between a consumer and a retailer over a bill may produce an unexplained and unexpungeable \"no pay\" evaluation in the computer and re- sult in considerable damage to the buyer's credit rating. In testimony before the House subcom- mittee, the director of the New York State Identification and Intelligence System de- scribed a data bank containing files on \"known\" criminals that ultimately will con- tain millions of entries. He expressed a will- ingness to exchange information with police officials in other states as soon as the state systems could be meshed. If this system is tied Into the National Data Center or New York's Bureau of Motor Vehicles or welfare agencies, it would permit someone to direct an inquiry to the computer file of \"known\" criminals, find an entry under the name of his subject, and rely on that entry to the subject's detriment without attempting to verify its accuracy. Congress should consider the need for legislation setting standards to be met by nonfederal computer organizations in pro- viding information about private persons and restraining federal officers from access to certain types of information from non- federal data centers. Nonfederal systems should be required to install some protec- tive devices and procedures. This is not to suggest that Congress should necessarily im- pose the same controls on nonfederal systems that it may choose to impose on the federal center. But a protector file to record the source of inquiries and modest encoding would probably prevent wide-scale abuse, although security needs vary from system to system. Since security may be facilitated by installing protective devices in the computer hardware itself, the possible need for regula- tion of certain aspects of computer manu- facturing also should be taken into account. The possibility of regulating transmission between federal and nonfederal centers and the interaction among nonfederal centers also should be considered. The specter of a federal agency, such as the Veterans' Admin- istration, reaching into a citizen's medical file in a data center operated by a network of hospitals to augment the federal center's file is a disturbing one. Regulating the secu- rity of the transmissions and imposing sanc- tions for non-compliance and eavesdropping would preserve individual privacy against governmental snooping and bureaucratic spinelessness or perfidy. AVIATION ACADEMY Mr. FANNIN. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to inform my colleagues of how one agency of Govern- ment is working with an Arizona uni- versity to solve a growing national prob- lem. The agency is the Economic Devel- opment Administration, the school is Arizona State University at Tempe, Ariz., and the problem which they are work- ing together to correct is the shortage of trained pilots and other aviation per- sonnel. For some time now, officials at Ari- zona State University, especially Presi- dent G. Homer Durham and Prof. Wal- ter E. Burdette and Victor E. Rothe, have been urging the construction of a na- tional aviation training center in cen- tral Arizona, where climate and re- sources for such an undertaking are ideal. But it was not until officials from the Economic Development Administra- tion became interested in the proposal that it was given much of a chance of being realized. Seeing the growing needfor trained aviation personnel, and rec- ognizing the potential of the university's proposal, the EDA officials immediately sponsored a feasibility study which rec- ommended the establishment of such a center at the Goodyear Auxiliary Air- field, located in the northeast corner of the Gila Indian Reservation approxi- mately 15 miles from Phoenix. The cen- ter would train more than 2,000 fliers and technicians annually, and Arizona State University would operate the academic facility. What this demonstrates to me, Mr. President, in addition to the likelihood that a growing national problem can be solved, is that we are perhaps entering a new era in Pederal-State-community relations-an era in which cooperation will be the prevailing spirit. Certainly, that has been the attitude of EDA offi- cials throughout this program, and I congratulate and thank them for it. And I also want to express my thanks to all the Arizona State University officials, as well as State and local political and busi- ness leaders, for their leadership in and support of this program. At this point, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Executive Summary of the feasibility study beprinted in the RECORD. It provides a startling insight into the serious nature of this national problem and it recom- mends steps that can be taken-indeed, must be taken-to correct it. There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: A STUDY To DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING A NATION- AL PROGRAM FOR TRAINING SKILLED AVIATION PERSONNEL (Prepared by Arizona State University, Tempe, Ariz., for the Economic Develop- ment Administration) (NoTE.-This technical assistance study was accomplished by professional personnel under contract with the Economic Develop- ment Administartlon.

PREFACE The final report of the Feasibility Study bearing the same title as this Executive Summary is 350 pages in length and presents the detailed results of five areas of investiga- tion. This Executive Summary has been pre- pared for those who do not have the time to study the 350-page reference document. The results of the quantitative personnel requirements portion of the study are con- sidered to be a valid assessment of these re- quirements and should be of great value to the aviation industry. The mathematical model developed for projecting air carrier cockpit crew and mechanic requirements should be of particular value to the air car- rier industry, in that it can be used for in- dustry-wide or for single-carrier projections. Because of the dynamic growth of the in- dustry, the study should be re-done approxi- mately every two years. This would improvethe study techniques, as well as bringing the data up to date on a periodic basis. Other aviation skills should also be considered in future studies.

GENERAL INTRODUCTION Powered flight, which did not exist sixty- four years ago, has grown until it is now, and has been since July 1962, the largest single non-agrarian employer of people in the American economy. The employment figure in the manufacturing phase of aerospace ac- counted for 1,400,000 people at the end of 1966. The manufacturing of airframes alone accounted for the employment of more than 600,000 persons. The significance of aviation can be evaluated best it. light of the overall spec- trum of transportation. America has shifted from a production economy to a distribution economy to such a degree that consumer ex- penditures for transportation have grown at a rate twice as great as consumer expendi- tures for all other goods and services since World War II. In 1965, the Gross National Product was $697 billion. This is forecast to increase to $967 billion by 1970. Expenditures for trans- portation in 1965 were $209 billion and are expected to grow to $290 billion a year by 1970. Air transportation was 7% of the total national transportation expenditure in 1965 or $14.6 billion. This is expected to grow to $40.6 billion by 1970, or approximaetly 14% of the total national transportation expendi- tures. The changing patterns and modes of travel resulting from this dynamic growth have al- tered the economic and social structure of the nation. People have become accustomed to mobile ways of living and businesses have become accustomed to depending on mod- ern means of travel for carrying on their ac- tivities. The growth picture cited above is based partly on the fact that aviation technology is, today, on the threshold of significant ad- vances in a number of areas. Specific devel- opments which are presently underway in- clude the development of the supersonic transport, short-haul transport, stretched jet, and very large passenger/cargo jet air- craft, such as the C-5 and Boeing 747. In general aviation, the numbers of aircraft are expected to increase from slightly under 100,- 000 units in 1965 to over 300,000 units in 1980; from slightly over 16 million annual flight hours in 1965 to over 60 million in 1980. These developments will open new pas- senger and airfreight markets and will result in significant increases in personal flying, as well as in productivity in commercial service. The increase in number and complexity of aircraft will also generate requirements for greater numbers of more highly skilled per- sonnel. At a time when aviation is entering itsgreatest period of growth, a critical problem has developed with respect to availability ofhighly skilled personnel, particularly pilots and mechanics. This problem has been de- veloping slowly since 1960. Its historical back- ground is as follows: 1. Twice during the period 1945 to present, the labor market for pilots and mechanics was flooded with a large surplus of trained personnel released from the military services following World War II and the Korean War. It was extremely difficult for many pilots, even with extensive training and experience, to find flying jobs in the civil aviation field. 2. In 1958, the industry entered a new era through the introduction of jet aircraft. The new jets were capable of greater payloads and higher speeds, and one aircraft could do the work of many. For example, one 707 could replace as many as seven DC-7 aircraft in34277 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 service at that time. The introduction of the jets reduced the requirements for pilots and some low seniority flight personnel were ac- tually furloughed. 3. The interest of our nation's youth de- clined somewhat as they observed these de- velopments. An atmosphere had been created that made aviation an unattractive choice for young people seeking stable, secure careers. The following comments were fre- quently submitted In response to questions raised by researchers studying flight skills and training: \"Why select a career that was already over-crowded?\"-\"Aircraft mechanics are underpaid and many must find jobs in other industries, so why should I pay money I don't have to learn a trade for a job which is not available?\" Consequently, enrollment in aviation courses dwindled and the number of schools offering aviation training slowly decreased. 4. The lack of interest and the reduction in training of new pilots has also occurred at a time when World War II pilots now flying in civil aviation were being lost in ever-increas- ing numbers due to retirement, for medical reasons, or due to promotion. Early In 1964, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency, Mr. Najeeb Halaby, established an Aviation Human Resources Study Board because of his growing concern with the number of indications that civil aviation might be facing potentially serious shortages of highly skilled workers requiring extensive training. The Board's study was given the working name of \"Project Long Look\". The Board was authorized to conduct necessary research and analysis to measure current manpower resources In military, com- mercial, and general aviation. The Board determined that significant numbers of flight and maintenance personnel would be required to meet the growth needs of the industry and that annual attrition losses of personnel due to retirement, dis- ability, or promotion will increase substan- tially between 1965 and 1980. It was further determined that fewer military pilots are available than in previous years and the per- centage of military pilots continuing on in civilian aviation is dwindling. The report stated that adequate numbers of trained flight/mechanical personnel will not be avail- able at present training and attrition rates. On the basis of the future quantitative and qualitative needs, as indicated in the foregoing discussion, and because of its in- terests in and responsibility for the develop- ment of skills and knowledge in the field of aviation, Arizona State University embarked on a program to determine the feasibility for establishing an aviation training operation as a continued part of its functions. Because of the economic development po- tential for such a training operation, the study was sponsored by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Economic Development Ad- ministration. Many contributions were also made to the study by local and national organizations with interests in the fields of aviation and education. The immediate objective of this study was to determine the feasibility for the estab- lishment of a program for training skilled flight and non-flight personnel which are critically needed by the nation's aviation industry. The training program visualized would provide for academic training of both ground support and flight personnel, in- cluding a four-year baccalaureate degree in Aeronautical Technology earned in an ac- credited university, with primary and ad- vanced flight training conducted at an ap- propriate training base. The Feasibility Study would include an accurate determination of the needs with respect to both types and numbers of per- sonnel to be trained, the establishment of detailed curricular for the various training courses, the selection of the most suitable training base for the flight operations por- tion of the program, and the development of detailed costs and methods for financingsuch a program. The study was conducted in coordination with and extensive cooperation from the aviation industry. The study was initiated in December 1966 and continued for a period of six months, culminating in this final report. The study included five major areas of Investigation, the results of which are presented in the report under Sections I through V. Follow- ing is an abstracted summary of the work performed, along with major conclusions and recommendations from the five sections of the report. BUMMARY Section I-Quantitative Requirements for Skilled Aviation Personnel: This part of the overall study was conducted in three parts- the civil air carrier requirements, the general aviation requirements, and a projection of the supply and demand for professional pilots. Requirements for non-commercial pilots or those who fly for personal reasons were not treated in this study due, primarily, to the lack of documentation in this area of aviation operations. (Total aircraft units and total flight hour estimates did, however, include personal flying.) In the civil air carrier requirements part of the study, data was acquired from load- ing carriers, aircraft manufacturers, aircraft equipment manufacturers, Air Line Pilots Association, Air Transport Association of America, Civil Aeronautics Board, Federal Aviation Administration, International Civil Aviation Organization, and from numerous key individuals. The data were translated into revenue passenger and cargo ton-miles of operation and aircraft fleet size projec- tions, with due recognition of the various potential growth limiting factors. A basic planning statistics used through- out the industry is that of revenue passen- ger miles (RPMS). Because of this, a num- ber of independent forecasts of RPMS existand several alternative approaches to fore- casting are found. A number of these fore- casts were collected from the organizations cited above. The forecasts were made for differing purposes and adjustments were, therefore, necessary to make them compara- ble. The problem was compounded by the need to include only the U.S. civil air car- rier group, since many were developed for the entire Free World. Since the growth in revenue passenger miles in the past has averaged approximately 13% a year, many of the forecasts consist of an estimate of the growth rate to be applied over the next several years. In cases where there was a discrepancy in the 1965 actual RPMS, it was assumed that the growth rate was accurate and the 1965 value was adjusted. In all cases, the forecasts were corrected to total Free World and total U.S. air carrier revenue passenger miles for com- parability. It is surprising the extent of agreement that exists between these forecasts, consid- ering the variety of reasons and techniques behind them. For purposes of this study, a composite of the various forecasts is used. It is less than the Boeing \"probable\" and General Electric forecasts. It is slightly less than the FAA and ATA projections but more than the corrected Douglas and Lockheed forecasts. It is considerably higher than the CAB forecast, which is the lowest of the group. It appears reasonable in light of the various validations of the other forecasts that have been made. These forecasts are pre- sented in Figure 1. [Graphs not printed in RECORD.] Uniform opinion exists in the industry that the most rapidly growing sector of civil aviation is that of cargo. The traditional planning statistic in this area has been revenue cargo ton-miles. A number of fore- casts of this statistic were evaluated for use with the revenue passenger mile forecasts to develop aircraft requirements. The rela- tively new high growth rates of cargo have made forecasting in this area a very difficulttask. Insufficient historical statistics and in- different marketing eflorts in the past have made It difficult to apply past trends or to use past relationships to determine cargo volume in the future. Most forecasts in this area involved estimates as to what the cargo growth rates will be In the future. The fact that it is difficult to get better forecasts on revenue cargo ton-miles is not too disappointing. The high cargo growth rates, applied over the period from 1965 to 1980, do not, however, make it a major ele- ment in the industry by 1980. The forecast figure for U.S. domestic air cargo in 1980 is still less than 1% of the forecast total com- mon carrier intercity ton-miles. This total, for revenue cargo ton-miles, represents less than 10% of the total forecast revenue ton- miles carried by air in 1980. The forecast revenue cargo ton-miles used in this study are shown in Figure 2. [Graphs not printed in REcoRD. ) One approach to determining overall air- craft requirements was used for most of the forecasts reviewed. It consisted of taking a revenue passenger mile forecast and revenue+ cargo ton-mile forecast and computing the number of airplanes required to carry that traffic. The process starts with estimates of load factors, productivity, ground time, speed, capacity, stage lengths, aircraft types, and schedules. These, in turn, are used to com- pute aircraft utilization and productivity, whleh then converts to numbers of aircraft required to support the forecasts. The dis- position of the current fleet must be ac- counted for, so estimates were made of air- craft losses and replacement. Differences be- tween forecasts could usually be attributed to differences in the assumptions made for these various parameters, rather than dif.. ferences in the basic revenue passenger mile or cargo forecasts. This Is supported by thi general agreement between the RPM forecast evaluated for this study. All of the forecasts evaluated included the Concorde, the U.S. supersonic transport, and the Boeing 747. In those forecasts where specific aircraft types were identified, the introduction of now aircraft types generally included another short-range jet type, stretched versions of the present short-range jets, and some form of airbus. The question of whether or not the supersonic transport will fly over land affects the forecasts to some extent because of its productivity but not greatly during the time period covered. The forecasts fell into two broad categories: (1) those with constantly increasing fleet size (Boeing, Douglas, and FAA), and (2) those which have a decreasing fleet size dur- ing some time period (General Electric and Lockheed). They are summarized in Figure 3. [Graphs not printed in RECORD.] To deter- mine what forecast to use for this study, a more detailed investigation of the require- ments for the latter part of the 1960's was made. The determination of the fleet size for the latter part of the 1960's was approached by taking the \"on-order\" aircraft delivery schedule as of year-end 1965 and adding to that the current fleet minus the retiring propeller aircraft. This placed a floor under the forecasts and gave a minimum expected fleet size for any given year. In the past, committed aircraft orders for future years have been less than the actual orders filled during that year. This has been true even during years when deliveries of aircraft have been delayed. The minimum fleet size thus derived was greater than the General Electric forecast for all years and greater than the Lockheed air- craft forecast for the early years. Because of this, it was felt that one of the constantly increasing forecasts would be more likely during the latter part of the 1960's. Since the introduction of the Boeing 747 is planned for 1969 and the supersonic transport Is expected in the mid-1970's, it is likely that the growth rate of the fleet would be declining during that period, as in the Douglas forecast. For34278 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE these reasons, the Douglas forecast was se- lected as the basis for projecting new hire requirements. This forecast shows a continually increas- ing number of aircraft in the fleet through 1980. This raises the question of whether or not it will be possible to continue to increase fleet size over this period. A corollary ques- tion is whether or not the increases in traffic growth are maintainable, Possible limitations to these forecasts do exist and were investi- gated. A mathematical model was then developed for use in computer prediction of future cockpit and mechanic work forces, based on historical relationships between all of the key growth factors and the growth data ob- tained from the sources cited. The pilot and mechanic work force projections were then treated to sensitivity analysis by varying some of the input data factors in the mathe- matical model for the purpose of determining those factors which have the greatest influ- ence on the projections of future needs. The factors which contribute to the de- mand for new pilots and are isolated for study are shown in Figure 4. [Not printed in REC- ORD.] The projection and its components, plus the annual pilot loss rate and its com- ponents, formed the basis of a computer model for determining the annual new hire requirements. The model was developed both for the calculation of these requirements and for testing the sensitivity of the results to changes in the assumptions or Individual components. The pilot employment levels are summar- ized in Figure 5. INot printed In RECORD.] The forecast levels developed here were com- pared to a projection based on an Air Trans- port Association of America survey. The ATA asked their members to project their pilot hiring rates and employment levels until 1975. The majority of the carriers responding to this survey supplied data only through 1970. That group of carriers employed 75% of the pilots. Assuming that the employers of the remaining 25% would have the same trends In hiring rates, an adjustment was applied to the sample to equate it to the total civil air carrier industry. The number of respondents projecting to 1975 were consid- ered too small to warrant correcting and comparing. The adjusted sample projected total pilot employment of 40,100 by year-end 1970. This is considerably higher than the forecast of 34,935 pilots employed in 1970 developed in this study, as seen in Figure 5. [Not printed in RECORD.] There are problems in simply asking the carriers for hiring rate projections to'use as a basis for overall projections. One ex- ample will serve to illustrate this point. One airline projected a pilot new hire rate aver- aging 475 a year in mid-1966. Toward the end of 1966, their projected rate was 800 a year. In early 1967 their projected hiring rate for pilots was reported as being between 550 and 600 per year. Any of a number of possible reasons would account for these dif- ferences. Different persons may have re- sponded to the questionnaire. The same person, in responding at different times, might react to an immediate and temporary situation. Most important, perhaps, was the apparent lack of a framework or model for developing their projections. The model de- veloped here, adapted to the individual airline's needs, could serve a a useful pur- pose in this regard. Cumulative new pilot requirements through 1980 were compared to the results of the FAA study of 1964. Both are plotted in Figure 6. [Not printed in RECORD.] The FAA study forecast a requirement of 14,878 new pilots between year-end 1965 and year- end 1980. This was based on 8,878 replace- ment pilots over the period and 400 new pilots per year for growth. Those figures are considerably less than even the low figure of 31,814 new pilots required, as forecast in this study. It is important to point out thatthe FAA study was based on a questionnaire submitted to the carriers and, therefore, was subject to the types of problems that were illustrated in the preceding paragraph. The derivation of pilot requirements from a model, such as that developed for this study, avoids these problems. The computer output for the projection of mechanic employment levels and new hire requirements is based on the factors similar to those developed for new pilot hires. The format was identical to that of the pilot forecast. For the mechanic run, only the average requirements were developed due to a lack of data upon which to base probability distributions. The attrition rate is constant at 5%. Retirement age is 65 years (adjusted to 60 for computational purposes), with no early retirement option. The projection shows a growth in me- chanic employment from 43,667 at year-end in 1965 to 80,224 by year-end 1980. To meet this increase and replace the annual losses, a cumulative total of 95,392 new mechanics must be hired in the period. The annual em- ployment and new hire requirements are summarized in Figures 7 and 8. [Not printed in RECORD.] The age distribution remains relatively constant throughout the period, although the model age group shifts back and forth among all groups between age 25 and 44. The number of new hires goes up or down each year, as with the pilots, depend- ing on the relationship between growth and replacements. The ratio of mechanics to pilots In 1965 was almost 2 to 1. By the year 1980, the projected ratio has changed only slightly (2.2 to 1). This change Is consistent with the increasing complexity of the air- craft envisioned for this period. In the general aviation category, the total fleet size and annual hours of operation were forecasted, using two different growth rates. Using the fleet size and annual hours of op- eration projections, the future (1965-1980) requirements for commercial pilots and total mechanics were projected. Three successive FAA fleet size forecasts were reviewed as part of this study. On page 51, Project Long Look states ...\"current trends in aircraft sales seem certain to out- distance the Federal Aviation Agency esti- mate of 102,000 aircraft in the active fleet by 1970 (Aviation Forecasts, Fiscal Years 1964- 1969) \". This was indeed the case. The 104,000 mark was actually passed in 1966. The July 1966 FAA forecast predicts a fleet of 160,000 aircraft by 1975. The January 1967 (latest) FAA forecast predicts a 1975 fleet of 173,500 aircraft. It is noted that each successive forecast is for greater growth. In 1963, general aviation sales increased 13.1% over 1962. Since 1963, sales have in- creased each year over the preceding year by over 20%. Since 1962, general aviation sales have doubled. In recent years, air carrier industry activity measured in revenue pas- senger miles and revenue cargo ton-miles has increased rapidly. A substantial number of future air carrier activity forecasts were reviewed in connection with the air carrier portion of the overall study. Excellent cor- relation was noted between all forecasts re- viewed. All predicted continued, rapid growth. Many of the underlying causal factors re- sponsible for the recent surging growth of air carrier business and general aviation growth are thought to be related. For ex- ample, the exchange of passengers at air hubs between air carriers and air taxi op- erators is beneficial to both. Air carrier growth stimulates air taxi growth. The fleet growth rate predicted for this portion of the study was based on the as- sumption that general aviation fleet growth will continue to increase at a rate of slightly over 8% per year compounded to 1980, a somewhat more conservative rate than that used by Cessna. The predicted fleet growth rate is also less than industry-wide predic- tions for air carrier passenger mile and cargoton-mile growth. It is, however, believed a reasonable lower limit when compared with the FAA and the Cessna projections. On the basis of the foregoing, the total general aviation fleet is forecast to grow from slightly over 104,000 aircraft at year- end 1966 to 315,000 aircraft by year-end 1980, as shown in Figure 9. [Not printed in REC- ORD.] The Cessna forecast to 1975 is approxi- mately 20% higher and the FAA forecast is approximately 20% lower than the trend line forecast by the Arizona State Univer- sity team. Civil aviation in 1965 accounted for 38 million aircraft operations reported at those airports having FAA air traffic control tow- ers. Of all these operations, 70.2% involved general aviation aircraft; 20.6% involved air carriers; and 9.2% involved military aircraft. Had there been methods for determining the number of operations at airports without control towers, the number of general avia- tion activities and the per cent of the total operations for general aviation would have been much larger than the 70.2% figure reported. Of some 20 million aircraft hours flown by civil aviation during 1965, approximately 17 million were flown by general aviation. Preliminary figures for 1966 announced by the Education Committee of the Utility Air- plane Council (UAC) of the Aerospace In- dustries Association of America set this figure at more than 17 million hours. Since calendar year 1965 is the latest year for which reports are available, based on FAA Forms 2350, the 1965 figure is reported here- in. General aviation aircraft utilization meas- ured in flight hours per aircraft per year has been increasing over the years. A comparison of FAA data for 1954 and 1964 reveals that utilization has increased 22%. This aver- ages just over 2% per year compounded an- nually. It is believed that this increase is, at least in part, the result of improvements in both aircraft capabilities and capabilities of the federal airways navigational and traf- fic control systems. This historic improvement for all of gen- eral aviation is forecast to continue at an average rate of approximately 1% per year throughout the forecast period. Flight hours flown per aircraft are thus forecast to in- crease at 1% per year through 1980. On this basis, the total flight hours flown annually in general aviation are forecast to increase from 16.7 million flight hours flown in 1965 to 63 million flight hours in 1980. The fore- cast curve Is shown as Figure 10. [Not print- ed in RECORD.] Of the 16.7 million hours flown in 1965, 12.7 million were flown in other than the personal flying category. That is, 12.7 million hours were flown in flights presumed to require at least com- mercial level pilot skills. Flight hours flown in other categories than personal flying have been very close to 76% of total flight hours flown for some time. In 1960, this professional flying was 75.8% of the total and, in 1965, it was 76.0% of the total. It is forecast to remain at 76% of total to 1980. As with the aircraft fleet forecast, the Cess- na and PAA forecasts vary from the predic- tion of the Arizona State University study, one is higher and the other lower. In projecting the commercial pilot require- ments for general aviation during the period 1965-1980, it was assumed that the need for these professional pilots would increase at the same rate as the increase In flight hours, as projected in Figure 10. In addition to those needed to increase the work force, pilots are also needed to replace those lost through attrition. The pilot age distribution data from the Project Long Look report was plotted against age distribution data for all licensed com- mercial pilots taken from the FAA Statistical Handbook of Aviation. The Project Long Look data is for early 1964 and the FAA34279 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 data is for 1965. The Project Long Look data is considered accurate and was used as a basis for computing pilot retirement (a retirement age of 60 was used). Replacements are also required because of losses caused by diversion of commercial pilots from general aviation to air carriers and to employment outside aviation and for medical and disability retirement reasons. For trunk airline pilots during 1965 this non- retirement attrition factor was 1.7% of the total pilot work force. For general aviation, this attrition has been assumed at 2% of the work force through 1980. On the basis of the information developed by Arizona State University, the cumulative commercial pilot requirements were calcu- lated at approximately 182,000 over the pe- riod 1965-1980. Two curves are plotted in Figure 11 [not printed in RECORD], one show- ing the Arizona State University estimate for the period 1965-1980 and the other show- ing the Cessna estimate for the period 1986- 1975. The Cessna information contained in the figure indicates that a total of 140,897 new commercial pilots will be required in general aviation during the nine-year pe- riod (1966-1975), including both augmenta- tion and replacement of the existing pool of pilots. The Cessna projection is approxi- mately 20% higher for the period covered. The two curves are assumed reasonable as the probable upper and lower limits for the commercial requirements. Unlike the pilot force whose productivity is assumed constant, it is believed that the productivity of mechanics is increasing. It is also believed that improved reliability and maintainability of new aircraft, coupled with improved tools and techniques, will result in increased mechanic productivity at an average rate of 1.67% per year. This means that productivity will increase more than 25% by the end of 1980. It is assumed that the mechanic work force needed varies with flight hours. Were mechanic productivity constant, the work force growth would be assumed equal to the Arizona State University forecast flight hours growth rate, 9.27% per year. Applying the productivity factor, the resultant growth rate is 9.27% minus 1.67% equals 7.6%. This factor was applied to the 1965 work force of 40,000 mechanics to arrive at a projected work force of 120,000 mechanics by 1980. To determine the numbers of mechanics needed to replace those who leave the work force by 1980, mechanics age distribution data was taken from the Project Long Look report. This was applied to the mechanics initial work force to determine the number of retirees each year through 1980. A retire- ment age of 65 was used. For non-retirement attrition which in- cludes factors such as diversion from gen- eral aviation employment to the airlines or airframe manufacturing, an attrition rate of 5% was used. Based on inputs from a num- ber of sources, this rate is believed to be realistic. The 1965-1980 estimates for the total num- ber of mechanics required in general avia- tion were developed by Arizona State Uni- versity and a trend curve of cumulative new hire mechanics for this period is shown in Figure 12. The figure indicates a cumulative need of 138,483 mechanics for the general aviation industry between 1965 and 1980. The Cessna study covered general aviation mechanic requirements but analyzed only the requirement for certificated mechanics, while the Arizona State University study covered total mechanic requirements. The Cessna study also covered the period through 1975 only. Because of the wide variation in numbers, the Cessna data was not plotted In Figure 12. [Not printed in RECORD.] Finally, the commercial pilot require- ments were analyzed in terms of supply from military releases and from non-military pilot training programs. A \"critical projection level\" method was established to aid in de-termining production levels of commercial pilots to supply the needs of the future. Section II--Curriculum Study: This part of the overall study concerned itself with analyses of existing mechanic and pilot cur- ricula and a determination of the improve- ments that should be made to meet the cur- rent and future qualitative needs of the industry. As a result of these analyses, current Ari- zona State University curricula were up- graded and are now considered qualitative improvements over existing curricula pri- marily in their assessment of and provisions for meeting the future needs of the industry. With respect to the maintenance techni- cian task, the basic framework of a curricu- lum was developed after a detailed analysis of the Allen study, the proposed changes to FAR-147 by the Federal Aviation Adminis- tration, a survey of offerings by other schools, and the predicted effects of technological change, as indicated, by an industry survey. The proposed maintenance curriculum covers subjects offered in junior or com- munity colleges and the Alien study, and also offers greater technical depth and subjects which meet the general educational require- ments for collegiate credit. There is some question regarding the num- ber of clock hours required by subject area to meet FAA certification requirements. It is hoped that, with continued improvements through curriculum development programs and the introduction of new educational technologies in the proposed training center, future certification emphasis will be on student achievement rather than on course hours of instruction. A professional set of performance criteria tests should be developed which would be used to determine whether the student should be certificated for all or any part of the overall curriculum. If properly developed, the performance criteria tests could be used for \"sub-certification,\" i.e., as a welder, sheet metal specialist, hydraulic specialist, elec- tronic specialist, etc. Each of these specialty certificates would be added to and become a part of his overall A&P license. A literature search revealed that some limited efforts have been made to research the nature of pilots' tasks. Efforts have been made by the U.S. Air Force at the Aero- medical Research Laboratories, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, and by the other military services. Some work has also been undertaken by the pilot training functions of the commercial carriers. Personal investiga- tion and interrogation of directors of pilot training programs of various commercial carriers revealed that there is universal con- cern, some limited experimentation, and much interest in pilot training program renovation and innovation. In the academic universe, Federal Aviation Regulations (Part 141) for pilot training set the parameters and guides for curriculum content and course duration, primarily with respect to flying hours. Conformity with the Regulations achieves government certifica- tion which is a prerequisite for pilot certifica- tion at all levels. While an in-depth analysis of pilot tasks was found not to exist, even though it is vitally needed, the nature of that type of research effort was well beyond the stated scope of purpose and financial resources of this Feasibility Study. Accordingly, the deci- sion was made to undertake an analysis of in- stitutional literature related to the Federal Aviation Regulations for pilot certification. In the absence of any precedential studies, such as the Allen study in the maintenance technician area, it became necessary to first develop a listing of job skills and knowl- edge requirements in a topical array for sub- sequent analysis. This was done by securing and analyzing FAA regulations for general and, where possible, specific subject matters related to pilot training. Institutional cata- logs and bulletins were also analyzed forsemantic/subject conformity with PAA re- quirements. The end product of the procedure described above resulted in a job skills/knowledge listing of fifty-three (53) items. It should be noted that all items were not \"required\" but were included, inasmuch as the fulfill- ment of general education degree require- ments was involved as well as major fields of specialization. The job skills/knowledge requirements were then compared with projected industry estimates, derived from a survey of the in- dustry, and with the current offerings of six universities, including Arizona State Uni- versity, two colleges and two flying schools. As a result of this analysis, a proposed curric- ulum was developed, with three options, as follows: Option I-Aeronautical Technology, which is the broad technical program. Option II-A Professional Pilot Training curriculum. Option III-An Air Transportation Man- agement curriculum. The clock hours offered in the proposed curricula are considerably more than re- quired for FAA ground school certification, The flight hours will consist of 250 hours, plus synthetic trainer time. This will provide for a commercial pilot's license with an instru- ment rating. The relationships between the academic and flight portions\" of the baccalaureate, three-option program and the maintenance technician program for the proposed aviation training center are shown in Figure 13. [Not printed in RECORD.] The three options are shown under the major heading \"Aeronautical Technology\". Options I and III are non-flight and Option II includes approximately 250 hours of pri- mary and advanced flight training. The tech- nician program, as described previously in this section of the report, will be conducted under the heading \"Support Personnel\". The \"Special Courses\" area pertains to short- term, contract-type courses, such as flight training for ROTC students, aviation sem- inars, etc. As in all flight training activities, a sig- nificant percentage of the students drop out because of aptitude and attitude deficiencies. In this program, they will be able to select one of the non-flight options regardless of when they drop out of the flight program (within reason, of course). This provides for a considerable amount of flexibility for the student. This flexibility goes beyond the bacca- laureate program, in that the student can drop back to the maintenance technician program and obtain a certificate in the As- sociate in Applied Science degree level or be- come a specialist in one of the technician areas. Conversely, the maintenance techni- cian student can move upward into the Aero- nautical Technology area for a Bachelor of Science degree, if he chooses to do so, with his earned credits applying toward the degree. Taking into account the constraints on this part of the overall Feasibility Study, it is felt that the initial step for improving exist- ing curricula has been achieved. It is antici- pated that accelerated improvements will occur in the proposed aviation training center through curriculum and educational tech- nology developments. As these improvements are disseminated and put into practice, avi- ation students of the future will be equipped with the qualitative skills and knowledge necessary to meet the emerging job require- ments of the aviation industry. The role of new educational technology and the part it can play in the improvement of aviation training was studied in consider- able depth. A number of conclusions and recommendations for the future continued improvement of aviation curricula were de- veloped as a result of these studies. Section III-Site Selection Study: In this section of the overall study, consideration34280 November 29, 1967 was given to the possibility of utilizing one of two sites as a location for the proposed training center. The two sites were the Litch- field Naval Air Station west of Phoenix (being closed by the Department of Defense) and the Goodyear Auxiliary Airfield located on the Gila River Indian Reservation. Fig- ure 14 [not printed in RECORD] shows the location of the two sites and their geographi- cal relationship to Phoenix and surrounding communities. Both sites were examined in detail with respect to availability and suitability of land, runways, buildings, utilities, etc. In addition, the proximity of the two sites to other air operations in the area was examined and analyzed in light of a proposed training op- eration. On the basis of the foregoing, it was determined that the Goodyear Auxiliary Air- field was the most suitable site for the pro- posed aviation training center. The Goodyear Auxiliary Airfield is present- ly being used by Williams Air Force Base for training of T-38 pilots. The use of the Good- year Auxiliary Airfield by Williams is a temporary measure to relieve congestion at the Williams Air Force Base. If reductions in training activity by Williams (not visualized at this time) developed or if the congestion at the Williams AFB could be relieved with other measures, such as a third runway at that location, the Goodyear Auxiliary Airfield could be used as the flight area of the pro- posed training center. It is planned to under- take negotiations with the U.S. Air Force during the second phase of the study to determine the steps necessary to establish the Goodyear Auxiliary Airfield for use as a civil aviation training center. The proposed training center locations, along with other development programs on the Indian Res- ervation, are shown in Figure 15. [Not print- ed in RECORD.] The economic impact on the Indian Res- ervation site was then analyzed in detail from the standpoint of potential jobs and income for the community and for individ- uals residing on the Reservation. Section VI-Cost and Financing: In this section of the study, costs for the facilities of the proposed training center were estimated after developing a number of cost factors related to enrollment, space allocations, and unit costs. Equipment costs were also esti- mated, including the educational equipment, aircraft, ground support equipment, and syn- thetic trainers required. These estimates, along with the annual operating costs for the proposed training center, were all developed on the basis of 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 stu- dent modules. The significant cost estimates are shown in Figure 16. Historical sources and the distribution of funds for educational institutions were ex- amined, and a general plan for the financing of the proposed center was developed. In this general plan, the roles of the University, the aviation industry, and the federal govern- ment were outlined. Section V-Implementation Plan: In this section of the study, both short- and long- range plans were developed. The short-range plans included the immediate actions re- quired, such as negotiation with the Tribal Council for long-term land leases and site development; the establishment of an indus- try-sponsored, nonprofit educational organi- zation; and the design and development pro- grams for both the academic and flight train- ing facilities of the proposed center. Figure 17 shows the implementation schedule for the short-range program. [Not printed in RECORD.] The long-range plans included an exami- nation of the research and development ac- tivities necessary to integrate new educa- tional technologies in the overall training center operations. Figure 18 shows the pro- gram schedule for implementation of the long-range program. [Not printed in RECORD.]CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE CONCLUSIONS Some of the major conclusions derived from the studies summarized above are: 1. Revenue passenger miles for U.S. civil air carriers will increase from 76 billion passenger miles in 1965 to 315 billion passenger miles in 1980; cargo ton-miles from 3.1 to 38.1 billion ton-miles; and the aircraft fleet will grow from 2,125 to slightly over 3,000 air- craft. 2. The employment of civil air carrier air- craft cockpit crew members will increase from 22,972 in 1965 to 43,665 in 1980, with a total cumulative requirement of 35,906 new pilots for that period. 3. The civil air carrier mechanic work force will increase from 43,667 In 1965 to 80,224 in 1980, with a total cumulative requirement of 95,392 new mechanics for that period. 4. The general aviation fleet will increase from 104,000 to 315,000 units, with total flight hours increasing from 16.7 to 63 million flight hours per year by 1980. 5. Commercial pilot requirements in gen- eral aviation will increase from 48,760 in 1965 to 184,750 in 1980, with a total cumulative requirement for 182,075 pilots for that period. 6. The number of mechanics in general aviation will increase from 40,000 in 1965 to 120,000 in 1980, with a total cumulative re- quirement for 138,483 new mechanics dur- ing that period (approximately one-third would be certificated). 7. Relatively little research has been exe- cuted which relates to pilot and mechanic qualitative curriculum design and its opera- tional effectiveness. This is also true for other aviation curricula. 8. A comprehensive, qualitative research program utilizing a variety of methodologies is greatly needed in a broad variety of im- portant aspects of aviation education. 9. Instructional time in terms of clock hours, despite its limitations as a qualitative standard of proficiency, remains as the \"core logic\" of curriculum design in institutions involved in aviation education. 10. Better defined standards of competence and improved measurement techniques for achievement should be important objectivee in upgrading and revising curricula. 11. The proposed pilot and maintenance technician curricula derived from this study represent qualitative improvement over existing curricula primarily in their assess- ment and provisions for meeting emerging needs. 12. The joint Arizona State University/ General Learning Corporation research effort In vocational/technical curriculum develop- ment based on a computer-aided multi- media approach will provide great assistance and impetus to the application of technology to aviation education. 13. The location of an aviation training center on the Goodyear Auxiliary Airfield will result in significant benefits to the Indian population and will also provide job opportunities to the disadvantaged of the surrounding communities. 14. An inventory/analysis of job skills on the Indian Reservation should be made and a training program undertaken to teach the required skills to qualified personnel for the jobs created by the establishment of a train- ing center and other developments which are occurring on the Reservation. 15. The total cost for all facilities and equipment for the proposed training center will be approximately $7,000 per student and the annual cost of operation will be approxi- mately $2,000 per student, plus the costs for flight training. 16. Because of the national implications and direct benefits to the aviation industry, the proposed aviation training center should be established and operated as a cooperative effort between the University, the aviation industry, and the federal government. 17. A single organization to represent all of the aviation industry's needs will be required34281 for the cooperative effort cited above. A non- profit, membership corporation should be considered for the purpose. 18. The functions of the aviation training center could be most effectively performed by the University assuming the responsibility for conducting the academic portions of the training program and the industry-estab- lished organization conducting the flight training portions of the total program, with research and development being performed separately and jointly as appropriate. 19. The development of the site and facili- ties, procurement of equipment, and estab- lishment of faculty and staff should be com- pleted by 1 September 1968 for the flight cen- ter and by 1 September 1969 for the aca- demic center. RECOMMENDATIONS Following are some of the major recom- mendations contained in the report: 1. Because of the difficulties experienced in assembling the data necessary for analyzing future personnel requirements, particularly in the general aviation segment, a data cen- ter should be established with continuous inputs provided by every segment of the industry. 2. The mathematical model developed for predicting air carrier pilot and mechanic re- quirements be further developed and utilized in connection with recommendation \"1\" above. The model could also be expanded for use in general aviation and with other modes of transportation. 3. Full consideration be given to the es- tablishment and operation of an aviation training center, as described and discussed in this report. Such a center would help meet some of the quantitative requirements for the aviation industry, as well as some of the qualitative requirements discussed in other sections of the report. 4. Consideration be given to the imple- mentation of the proposed pilot and aviation maintenance technician curricula as the nu- cleus of a future and broader aviation oc- cupational group of curricula, and that such implementation be considered in the con- cept of the aviation training center, as ex- plored in this study. 5. Concentrated efforts be made to initiate an organized aviation education research program to attack vital problems, some of which are: A. Pilot Task Analysis (Terminal Behavior Analysis): A study, comparable in depth and duration, is needed to ascertain civilian pilot tasks in terms of what a pilot does and the sequence in which he does it; the relevance of tasks, one to another; the priority of learn- ing sequence of tasks he performs; the fre- quency with which he performs tasks; and the degrees of manipulative skills required of specific tasks. B. A Comparative Cost Analysis of In- Depth Specialty Training for Pilots and Non- Pilots: Undoubtedly, individual carriers are conducting on-going cost analyses of their own training investments. A collective analysis concentrating on what is being taught; how it is being taught; measure- ment factors of productivity; temperament factors effect on training; aptitude identifi- cations and correlations, if any; and other areas need to be determined. The products of such research could then be related to what can and should be done by pre-profes- sional education and training institutions to reduce the on-the-job training Investments of the carriers. C. Instructor Personnel Education and Training for Aviation Curricula: Research and training activities are needed, especially in the use of currently available media, mod- ules, and methods, but, more importantly, in the potential applications of new educa- tional technology to aeronautical technology curricula. 6. An aviation industry/education research and development center be established with- CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 in the context of the proposed aviation train- ing center to initiate, conduct or coordinate these studies as appropriate. Further, it is recommended that careful attention be given to plans for national dissemination and im- plementation of the anticipated research findings, curricula, instructional materials and systems. 7. Within the context of the proposed avia- tion training center, consideration be given to the establishment of a (civil aviation in- dustry) education/training documentation center, providing for automated retrieval and remote access provisions for the civil avia- tion industry. 8. That encouragement and assistance be provided the aviation industry in the estab- lishment of a private, non-profit organiza- tion whose primary function will be to estab- lish and operate the flight training portion of the proposed aviation center as a coopera- tive venture with the University. 9. A program be established, in coopera- tion with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, for the Identification of skills, aptitudes, and attitudes of the total population on the Reservation, followed by a comprehensive prevocational, vocational/technical and so- cial training program to prepare the Indians for the advantages to be derived from the training center and other area development programs. 10. An early conference be scheduled for representatives of the civil aviation industry, the federal government, and Arizona State University. The purpose of the conference will be to develop a plan for a joint coopera- tive effort to establish an aviation training center of national significance, as discussed throughout this report. 11. The division of responsibility for the establishment and operation of the aviation training center be for the industry-spon- sored, non-profit education organization to establish and operate the flight training pro- gram, and the University establish and op- erate the academic program. The federal government should provide both organiza- tions with financing and operations as- sistance. EPILOGUE It is obvious from the information pre- sented in this report that a combination of powerful factors are at work in aviation today which, when assessed, dictate equally powerful and perhaps radically different ap- proaches in aviation education. The primary factors referred to are, of course, the mas- sive and accelerating growth in aviation and a corollary and equally dynamic technologi- cal progress. While there are a variety of lesser but important factors operating, the third major factor which gives rise to great national concern is the apparent absence of an accompanying dynamic response on the part of civil aviation education. Even a cursory examination reveals a \"business as usual\" and traditional education/training operation and little or no research and de- velopment in aviation curriculum structure or methods. A similar and somewhat more intensive examination will reveal a small but growing area of research and development of great promise in the application of newer educa- tional technology In academic disciplines other than aviation education. Importantly, there appears not to have been evolved or deliberately developed in America a mech- anism, structure or center capable of the research, demonstration, implementation and wide dissemination which could activate dynamic educational response to meet emerging civil aviation needs. The brief attempt at assessment given here is intended to be realistic as opposed to being simply negativistic. Certainly, it pre- supposes a great pride in America's monu- mental progress in aviation and commends those individual efforts in aviation educa- tion in attempting to service that progress to date.It must be universally accepted that the great growth in civil aviation of the Immedi- ate past is the product of numerous factors but, importantly, it is a product of the ac- celerating technology, which sets up a dynamic interaction with growth to the end that the factors of growth and technology become mutually stimulating. It is equally apparent that oven in this recent rapid growth period, the aviation industry is on the threshold of what might be termed a \"quantum leap\" in growth. Unfortunately, no comparable prospect of a \"quantum leap\" in aviation education can be antici- pated from the existing aviation education structure and its present capaballty. It was from this frame of reference that the concept of a civil air academy or civil aviation training center was conceived. The concept was developed as the prospective in- strument of the aviation community, cer- tainly not to be viewed as the \"place\" where all personnel trainee quantitative require-ments would be met, but far more signifi- cantly as the \"place\" where innovative and creative aviation curricula and instructional materials systems are designed, tested and perfected for implementation nationally, inorder to mobilize efficiently the existing and emerging aviation education agencies of the nation. In short, It is visualized as the vehi- cle required to generate an aviation educa- tion \"quantum leap\". To paraphrase a noted philosopher, \"Noth- ing is so powerful as an idea or concept whose time has arrived\". Informal explora- tions of the aviation training center concept and its \"timeliness\" with a variety of lead- ers in the aviation industry resulted in en- couragement to the end that this Feasibility Study was undertaken. Having now been completed, it is sincerely hoped that the study findings will serve the leadership of the aviation community as a useful tool in meeting the challenges faced.

Mr. President, I was delighted that the Housing Subcommit- tee and the full Banking and Currency Committee have approved a recommen- dation proposed by Senator JAVITS and myself concerning the college housing program. Under the present college hous- ing program, the Department of Housing and Urban Development can make direct loans at 3 percent interest to colleges and universities for the purpose of construc- ing student housing. Although this as- sistance is badly needed by our hard- pressed colleges and universities, the ex- istence of 3-percent money has had a dis- ruptive impact upon college housing. Since the present law only authorizes $300 million a year for college housing, the demand for these loans far exceeds the limited supply. As a result, many col- leges and universities tend to postpone their college housing construction plans in the hopes of obtaining a 3-percent loan, if not this year then perhaps next year. Rather than stimulate the con- struction of college housing the programStudent modules 500 1000 1500 2000 $1,350,000 1,640,625 57, 575 64,000 3,112,200 305,000 have the opposite effect. Since the directors of our colleges and univer- sities are accountable to a board of trust- ees or similar body, the head of a college or university would be hesitant to bor- row funds on the private market at 4 or 5 percent when a 3-percent Government loan is or might be available. In order to break this logjam, Senator JAVITS and I sponsored a proposal which permits the Federal Government to subsidize the rate of interest on a col- lege housing loan in addition to provid- ing direct loans. The interest rate subsidy method is a far more efficient way for providing as- sistance to college housing and substan- tially reduces the impact upon the Fed- eral budget. The $10 million interest rate subsidy authorized by the amendment could finance as much as $300 or $400 million a year in college housing. I be- lieve that this new provision in conjunc- tion with the existing program and the private market can adequately finance our college housing needs. I am delighted that this provision has the wholehearted34282 November 29, 1967CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE support of many colleges and universities across the country. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that a number of letters I have re- ceived on this subject be Inserted in the RECORD. There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, Columbia, S.C., October 2, 1967. Subject: College Housing Loans (Bill S. 2000). Hon. WILLIAM PROXMIRE, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR PROXMIRE: We were extreme- ly interested in your August 29th letter concerning the above proposed legislation. There is no question concerning the need of help in alleviating the present college housing shortage. For example, the Uni- versity of South Carolina has been trying to submit applications for new housing loans for more than a year and a half but as you point out, DHUD has been unable to even accept the applications. While the University of South Carolina is acutely concerned with the availability of low cost loans, we in South Carolina are also concerned about the desirability of keeping Federal expenditures from expand- ing while the Viet Nam conflict continues. It seems to us that your proposal might meet both of these objectives. Your suggestion would almost double the present $300 mil- lion direct loan program and yet would in- volve a Federal expenditure of possibly only $10 million dollars. As you indicate in your letter, it would be desirable for the government to use the loan differential program for institutions such as ourselves who can generally borrow money at a favorable rate. This would then free up the direct loans for the smaller and private colleges who have a more difficult time bor- rowing money. Your legislation might in- volve some flexibility in awarding direct loans versus differential payments so as to get maximum utilization out of the Fed- eral Funds. There should probably also be some provi- sion as to the maximum amount of in- terest that could be used for the loan dif- ferentials. We can visualize that in some specialized situations, a small institution might become involved with a private investor who might charge an exorbitantly high rate of interest. In summation, the University of South Carolina definitely needs the ability to bor- row low interest money for additional col- lege housing. The University of South Caro- lina is also concerned about getting the maximum advantage out of Federal funding. For these reasons, your proposed legislation appears quite attractive. I am so advising the South Carolina delegation, Yours truly, THOMAS F. JONES. THE CALIFORNIA STATE COLLEGES, Los Angeles, Calif., October 10, 1967. Hon. WILLIAM PROXMIRE, Hon. JAcoB K. JAvrrs, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATORS PROXMIRE AND JAVITS: Chancellor Dumke has asked me to respond to your recent letter regarding proposed leg- islation designed to ease the chronic student housing shortage. We share your concern that many qualified students across the nation may not be able to attend the college of their choice because of inadequate housing. The California State Colleges with eighteen publicly supported colleges and 190,000 stu- dents, comprise the largest and fastest-grow- ing higher education system in the nation.This dynamic growth has intensified our need for student housing. The Trustees of the California State Col- leges have a policy on financing student housing which allows the State Colleges to enter into agreements with any agency of the federal government for the construction of housing and other education facilities for students and faculties of any college under the jurisdiction of the trustees if they de- termine that the income, rent and charges for the use of the facilities will be sufficient in amount to repay the principal and interest on the amount secured from the federal gov- ernment for the construction of the facilities. On April 27, 1967, the Trustees approved an amendatory loan agreement with the Depart- ment of Housing and Urban Development to construct thirty dormitory buildings to house approximately 2886 men and 2618 women students and resident staff on ten of the eighteen campuses. The DHUD loan commit- ment for the project was $34,750,000. These facilities are now under construction and are expected to be occupied during the 1968-69 academic year. The next phase of California State College student housing construction program in- cludes plans to build facilities for approxi- mately 5600 students to be ready for occu- pancy in 1970 at the estimated cost of $40 million. With the completion of this development, we will only have facilities tohouse around 10% of our full time students. (See attachment.) Our tentative master plan objective is to provide on-campus housing for approximately 25% of the full time stu- dents. With the possibility that federally-guaran- teed loans at 3% interest will not be avail- able, our only alternative will be the sale of revenue bonds at the prevailing rate of interest which would increase the cost of housing to our students. We believe that S. 2000, which would pro- vide loan differential payments covering the difference between the market rate of inter- est and 3%, Is a significant step forward in assuming continued development of ur- gently needed student housing. Please be assured that Chancellor Dumke, and particularly Mr. John Kehoe, the State Colleges' Special Assistant for Governmental Affairs, headquartered at 1310-19th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., will work closely with you in your endeavors in behalf of this legislation. If at any time we can be helpful in supplying you with data on higher educa- tion, please do not hesitate to let us know. Thank you for your continuing support and interest in the higher education com- munity. Best personal regards, Sincerely, LES COHEN, Director, Governmental Affairs.

Senator WILLIAM W. PROXMIRE, New Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR PROXMIRE: I have been re- quested to reply to your communication re- garding S. 2000 (loan differential payments), now under consideration by the Senate Bank- ing and Currency Committee. The University of Houston favors this leg- islation, which in our judgment offers a most practicable means of supporting some $300 to $400 million in college housing funds to be sold to private investors. At this institution, as on so many other campuses, there is a critical and growing shortage of dormitory space. Through rela- tively high priorities which can be clearly established, it has been possible for us to obtain a 3% loan from the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the max- imum amount of $3,000,000. Only by com- bining this with a private gift of $1,000,000were we able to bridge the gap between pro- ceeds of revenue bonds and the total esti- mated cost of a complex for 1,200 students. Yet almost before construction begins, we face the need for a similar facility. Without S. 2000, the University of Houston will have to compete again with our sister institutions (many of them perhaps less able to arrange loans in the private market) for a Government loan. How much simpler and more equitable, as you point out, to provide differential payments for the larger institu- tions. You can understand our dilemma still fur- ther, and our support for S. 2000, when I report the registration figures for 1967-1968 which became available here only today. They indicate that the University of Houston will enroll approximately 22,000 students, or just twice the number registered eight years ago. Sincerely, PATRICK J. NICHOLSON, Vice President, University Development.34283 34284 THE MERRILL-PALMER INSTITUTE OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND FAM- ILY LIFE, Detroit, Mich., October 9,1967. Hon. WILLIAM PROXMIRE, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR PROXMIRE: Your bill (S. 2000) being considered by the Senate Banking and Currency Committee represents a very re- alistic approach to the most serious problem now faced by expanding institutions. The present $300 million direct loan program has been inadequate and has hampered our in- stitution in making adequate housing plans. The need for the type of legislation you are proposing is an immediate one and $700 million dollars available to meet the college dormitory shortage would be most helpful. Because of the shortage of funds we have been forced to consider private financing at a much higher rate of interest than the 3% you are seeking to make available to a greater number of institutions than can be supported by the present inadequate direct loan pro- gram. We are most interested in this legisla- tion being considered and extend our support. Sincerely, J. WILLIAM RIOux, President. THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE, Knoxville, September 14, 1967. Hon. WILLIAM PROXMIRE, Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR PROXMIRE: It is a pleasure to speak for the continuation and expansion of the availability of 3.0 percent loans to colleges and universities under the Depart- ment of Housing and Urban Development program. Never in our history has higher education been more essential to the progress of the individual, the state, and the nation than at present. Never has there been greater demand for facilities and personnel to transmit our rapidly increasing knowledge and technology to young people. Extremely heavy pressures have been brought to bear on state administrations and legislatures to appropriate sufficient sums to pay not only for increasing operating costs but also for additional physical plant facilities. In the past few years plant fund appropriations by state legislatures have been insufficient to pay for needed academic facil- ities as witnessed by the success of the Title III Loan Program under Public Law 88-204. At The University of Tennessee little or no state appropriated funds have been made available in recent years for housing service facilities. To teach thousands of our children we must provide food and housing accom- modations, financed largely with borrowed money. Colleges and universities are not in the housing and food service business to make money. Such services are only necessary ad- juncts of teaching and research in areas where the local communities are unable to absorb the impact of growing campus pop- ulations. Our only hope in operating these facilities is to break even and to spread op- erating and capital costs over as many stu- dent and parent beneficiaries as possible. In 1965, the State Legislature enacted a law establishing the Tennessee State School Bond Authority enabling all colleges and universities in the State to finance with tax- exempt bonds the construction of facilities formerly eligible under the College Loan Pro- gram. The first bond sale by the Authority was made in May, 1967, at a 4.1 percent in- terest cost on a $43.8 million bond issue. Of this amount $30.1 million was for The Uni- versity of Tennessee of which $20.8 million would have been obtained from HUD if funds had been available. On our various campuses throughout the State, the University has completed, or con- tracted for, nearly 10,000 dormitory beds,CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 1,500 married student apartments, and six suiting service to help the smaller institu, cafeterias.

I should like to point out that this year freshman enrollment has been held to the previous level due to the lack of housing fa- cilities.

Sincerely, J. W. BUNN, Vice President for Business and Finance. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, September 8, 1967. Senator JAcoB K. JAVITS, Senator WILLIAM PROXMIRE, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SIRS: As President of the University of Virginia, and as Chairman of the Executive Committee of the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, I write to express my conviction of the urgent need for the passage of the legislation (S. 2000), which you have introduced to ease the chronic college housing shortage. Last week, at a meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges-an association with a membership of 99 major state institu- tions in each of the 50 States-the Associa- tion reiterated its unanimous support of the solution to the problem that your bill pro- vides and the urgent necessity for its passage. Both the direct loan program and the in- terest subsidy, which your bill provides, are necessary to assist the different kinds of col- leges. As you indicated in your letter of 29 August, $10 million in the loan differential payments, together with the existing direct loan program, could make available as much as $700 million to meet the college dormitory shortage. Many institutions are now having to turn away qualified students simply be- cause there is no place for them to live. Un- less immediate steps are taken the situation will be compounded in subsequent years. I hope indeed that the Senate Banking and Currency Committee will see fit to report out your bill and that the Senate and the Con- gress will take early favorable action upon it. Sincerely yours, EDGAR F. SHANNON, Jr., President. BAYLOR UNIVERSITY, Waco, Tex., September 5, 1967. Senator WILLIAM PROXMIRE, Senator JACOB K. JAvrrs, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SIRs: Thank you for your letter of August 29 concerning S. 2000. I support your bill and believe it meets a pressing need and does it in a manner vastly superior to the present method. You may be aware that because of South- ern Baptist policies based upon Baptist phi- losophy concerning separation of church and state most of the more than fifty Southern Baptist colleges do not now make federal loans to build dormitories. Let me suggest for your consideration an alternative fea- ture of your bill which might make these loans for dormitories more acceptable to Southern Baptists and others who believe in a strict separation of church and state. The loan differential payments could be made directly to the bond holder without direct envolvement of the lending school. Itwould also make the loans more acceptable to strict church-state separatists if instead of the federal government making payments to the bond holders, they could take credit on their income tax for interest differential, listing a registered number of an approved bond issued by a university. This would greatly reduce the cost of administration of the plan. Since the current rate of interest on such dormitory bonds is about 6%, this credit could be made 3% of the bond and raised or lowered annually by the H.E.W. or some other designated agency. I am not certain that this would satisfy all the strict church-state separatists but be- lieve it would be acceptable to some and that the administration of this plan would be less expensive. Sincerely, ABNER V. MCCALL, President. LOYOLA UNIVERSITY OF Los ANGELES, Los Angeles, Calif., September 6,1967. Senator JACOB K. JAvrrs, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR JAVrrs: I have received your letter of August 29 concerning S. 2000. I am well aware of the crisis in college housing and of the serious backlog in housing loan applications. Your proposal for loan differential pay- ments would release funds which are not now available and would do much to reduce the backlog which exists now and must be dis- solved now, not ten years from now. Sincerely yours, CHARLES S. CASASSA, S.J., President. JOHN CARROLL UNIVERSITY, Cleveland, Ohio, September 8,1967. Senators WILLIAM PROXMIRE and JACOB K. JAvrrs, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATORS PROXMIRE AND JAVITS: Thank you sincerely for your correspondence concerning the legislation (S. 2000) which the Senate Banking and Currency Committee is now considering. John Carroll University will have to increase its housing facilities in the relatively near future. The guarantee of a 3% interest rate is necessary if we are to be able to operate these facilites from their own revenue. We at John Carroll shall appreciate efforts to pass this legislation. Sincerely yours, JOSEPH O. SCHELL, S.J., President. THE UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA, Norman, Okla., September 14,1967. Hon. JACOB K. JAVIrS, Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR JAvrrs: Thank you for your letter regarding Senate Bill 2000 which you are sponsoring. The University of Oklahoma is happy to enthusiastically support your efforts in regard to the passage of the bill. The bill is an excellent step in the right direction. The University of Oklahoma is just com- pleting a $13,600,000 housing addition to provide facilities for 3.096 additional stu- dents. The financing for the project was arranged through the sale of bonds on the open market. The interest in connection with the bonds provides an effective rate of 4.91 percent plus. It will probably be a few years before the University of Oklahoma will be in a position to benefit from Senate Bill 2000, but I should like to urge your continuous vigorous support of the measure. I am also writing to the Oklahoma dele- gation to urge each of them to support the bill. Cordially yours, G. L. CRoss, President.UNIVERSITY OF DAYTON, Dayton, Ohio, September 12, 1967. Senator JACOB K. JAvrrS, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR JAVITS: Thank you for your joint letter with Senator Proxmire of August 29 giving me the opportunity to comment on your proposed legislation (S. 2000) to ease the severe college housing shortage. I enthusiastically support your letter and the legislation in every detail. In my ex- perience not only at the University of Day-ton but as President of the Ohio College Association, I know that most colleges anduniversities are too hard-pressed to provide additional academic and housing facilities forincreasing enrollments. The Higher Educa-tion Facilities Act helps some, but not all, colleges toward their academic facilities; but federal support for college housing has been woefully inadequate. Your bill is encouraging and I hope it passes at an early date. Respectfully, Very Reverend RAYMOND A. ROESCH, S.M., President. UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS, Chicago, Ill., September 6,1967. Hon. WILLIAM PRoxMIRE, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR PROXMIRE: In response toyour letter of August 29, concerning Sen-ate Bill 2000, I welcome the opportunityto record the view that this measure, ifadopted, would be exceedingly helpful to thehigher education community generally atthis time of great financial stress. The University of Illinois in the past has benefited through the College Housing LoanProgram in securing funds to finance the construction of residence halls and union buildings at relatively low interest rates.The availability of such financing has en- abled the University to hold down the costto students since our residence halls and related facilities are self-liquidating. Obviously, a continuation of any plan which continues low-cost borrowing for col- leges and universities will be of ultimate benefit to the students and will ease the general financial stringency faced by the in- stitutions and students alike. Sincerely, DAVID D. HENRY, President. UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, Philadelphia, September 6,1967. Hon. WILLIAM PROXMIRE, Senate Ofice Building, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR PROXMIRE: Since the most pressing physical need of the University ofPennsylvania lies in student housing, weare very much interested in favorable con-sideration of S. 2000. We have already been intouch with the national legislators fromPennsylvania to express our hope that every-thing possible will be done at the Federal level to facilitate the construction of col- lege housing through whatever devices would appear to be most appropriate. The Bill which you and Senator Javits are sponsor- ing would seem to be a very sensible ap- proach to this critical problem. Very sincerely, GAYLORD P. HARNWELL.

WILLIAM PROXMIRE, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR PROXMIRE: I approve thor- oughly of your idea of college bonds, with the Government paying the difference be- tween 3% and the market rate of interest. It would probably mean the greatest spurt in the building of new college facilities. Sincerely yours, PETER SAMMARTINO, Chancellor. DEPAUL UNIVERSITY, Chicago, Ill., September 12, 1967. Hon. WILLIAM PROXMIRE, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR PROXMIRE: Thank you for the information concerning the considera- tion being given to legislation (S. 2000) which would provide funds to ease the chronic college housing shortage. We are very concerned about the shortage of loan funds for college housing, but recog- nize the implications of appropriations for college housing at a time when urban prob- lems are so sharply in focus.November 29, 1967 DePaul University is but one of many col-leges and universities whose planning mech. anisms have been slowed by the inability to predict the availability of such funds. Currently the University is forced to reject many applicants for admission because it isunable to provide dormitory facilities; hence, we are planning to build facilities to accom. modate 750 students. To bring this plan tofruition we need not only the assistance of a low interest rate loan but the assistance of Urban Renewal to acquire the needed land. This dual need gives rise to a practically in. solvable planning problem. The Department of Urban Renewal insists that we give them a firm date for beginning construction before they will acquire the site and we are unable to provide a firm date until we are assured that college Housing Loan Funds are available. The pending bill would cut this Gordian knot smoothly and clearly. With best wishes for your continued well beig and appreciation for your dedicated serv- ice to our nation, I am, Cordially yours, Very Reverend JOHN R. CORTELYOU, C.M., President. UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI, Coral Gables, Fla., September 11, 1967. Re: Senate Bill No. 2000, College Housing Bill. Hon. WILLIAM PROXMIRE, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR PROXMIRE: The University of Miami Is extremely interested in the proposed Bill which the Banking and Currency Com- mittee is now considering. Recently I wrote to Congressman Fascell and to Senator Smathers concerning the needs of the Uni- versity of Miami for additional college dor- mitory loan money. I am taking the liberty of sending you a copy of the letter I addressed to Senator Smathers and to advise you that Senator Smathers assured me that this pro- gram would be given his careful considera- tion during deliberations. Speaking for the University of Miami, but knowing well the serious housing shortage of all campuses in the United States, I com- mend you and Senator Javits for sponsoring this critically needed legislation. If the University of Miami can be of any further assistance In any way in support of this most important legislation it would be pleased to assist in any way possible. Sincerely, EUGENE E. COHEN, Vice President for Financial Affairs and Treasurer. JULY 27, 1967. Re: College Housing Loan Program. Senator GEORGE A. SMATHERS, Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. DEAR GEORGE: The University of Miami and the total higher education community ur- gently need additional funds through the established College Housing Loan Program. This lending program has been of inestima- ble value to the colleges and universities and is of critical importance to the total public's interest. Adequate housing is as integral a part of the campus requirements as is the classroom and the laboratory. Recently the independent University of Miami had to borrow better than $5 million for student housing at an interest rate of 612 %. The financing was considered reason- able in present money market conditions where the University cannot issue tax exempt bonds. This high money cost available to in- dependent institutions adds tremendously to long range operating expenses. Assistance is urgently needed now as the University plans for additional housing over the next three years which is estimated will cost an additional ten million dollars. Any assistance and support you can give to this November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE loan program (with a record of 100% repay- ment to date) will be appreciated. Sincerely, EUGENE E. COHEN, Vice President for Financial Affairs and Treasurer. HAVERFORD COLLEGE, Haverford, Pa., September 7, 1967. Hon. JACOB K. JAVITS, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR JAVITS: Since we last talked, on the subject of your interest in attracting private business interests into ghetto-type problems, I have left the Ford Foundation to take up this position. Obviously I hope things will go well in your proposed corpo- ration-the idea is far too important to let anything deter action. I write now in response to your inquiry of August 29 on the proposed legislation (S. 2000) for easing the college housing short- age. The general approach which you and Sen- ator Proxmire propose In this bill strikes us as imaginative and valuable. I need add no words to your present knowledge about the seriousness of the college housing shortage; Instead I can simply state that you appear to have found an unusually constructive way to ease the shortage. I would have to do some more homework to find out whether this particular college could in fact sell bonds in private markets; perhaps some change in our bylaws would be necessary to achieve that end. But that in- ternal problem, if it is one at all, does not detract from our support for your approach. We are now borrowing at a rate of 6% to finance new dormitories here; clearly, we would welcome a way of easing that burden in future building plans. With all best wishes, Sincerely, JOHN R. COLEMAN, President. THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH DAKOTA, Grand Forks, September 5,1967. Hon. WILLIAM PROXMIRE, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR PROXMIRE: I appreciate the letter I received from you and Senator Javits on August 29 concerning the proposed Sen- ate legislation S. 2000 designed to ease the college shortage. This would be helpful to us in the future for we still need to look forward to building an additional dormitory to accommodate the anticipated enrollment two years from now and following. I am sure your bill would provide us the relief we need. Sincerely, GEORGE W. STARCHER, President. NEW MEXICO HIGHLANDS UNIVERSITY, Las Vegas, September 5, 1967. Senator WILLIAM PROXMIRE, Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR PROXMIRE: I am writing to you to endorse (S. 2000) which the Senate Banking and Currency Committee is con- sidering. Our institution, as in the case of so many others, is unable to keep pace with student housing needs. Since (S. 2000) will help meet the problem, I am strongly in favor of it. Sincerely, THOMAS C. DONNELLY, President. UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH, September 12, 1967. Senator WILLIAM PROXMIRE, Senator JACOB K. JAVITS, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR Sins: The legislation described in your letter of August 31, 1967 (S. 2000)would provide major assistance to the col- leges and universities in meeting their hous- ing needs. A major obstacle to long-range planning by most American colleges and universities today is the lack of assurance that construc- tion programs can be implemented when needed and that funds will be available at interest rates which they can afford. Even though, as a state-related institution, we are eligible for facilities built by the General State Authority of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the proposed legislation would provide more flexibility in our planning. It would enable the University to proceed with long-range development of dormitory facili- ties, confident that adequate funds at a reasonable rate of interest would be available in the event the State is unable to provide the necessary support. The benefit to institutions which are not eligible for state assistance would, of course, be even greater. Sincerely, WESLEY W. POSVAR, Chancellor. WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY, Pullman, Wash., September 19,1967. Hon. WILLIAM PROXMIRE, Senate Offlce Building, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR PROXMIRE: This is in response to the letter of August 29, 1967, signed jointly by Senator Javits and yourself, pertaining to S. 2000, which is legislation that both of you have proposed as a solution to the chronic college housing shortage. It is our view that this proposed legislation, which is currently being considered by the Banking and Cur- rency Committee, would have a substantial impact on our ability to finance and con- struct essential college housing facilities on this campus. Our projections indicate that we will need to spend a minimum of $12,000,- 000 for college housing during the next five years. The feature of the proposed legislation providing for the Federal Government to make loan differential payments for interest in excess of 3% is highly desirable. The ad- vantage to a student of a 3% over a 5% loan is approximately $90 per school year. This savings is critical, if we are to be successful in our endeavors to curb the rising costs which students attending institutions of higher education are experiencing. Frankly, we do not feel that the $10,000,000 per year in loan differential payments pro- posed in this legislation will be sufficient. Be- cause of the considerable demand, $20,000,000 to $30,000,000 per year might be more realis- tic. We do concur, however, that the concept of differential loan payments will be a valua- ble contribution to higher education and is urgently needed. We appreciate the opportunity to present our views on this important legislation. Sincerely yours, GLENN TERRELL, President. KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY, Manhattan, Kans., September 8, 1967. Hon. WILLIAM PROXMIRE, Hon. JACOB K. JAVITS, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATORS: If adequate loan funds for college residence halls for students are not or will not be made available under the pres- ent direct loan program, Kansas State Uni- versity would support the legislation as out- lined in your letter of August 29, 1967. The dual program of direct loans under the present program and the loan differential interest payment program as outlined in your letter has one specific advantage over the present program. Those colleges and uni- versities that cannot now participate in the direct loan program advantageously because of pre-existing bonding arrangements with private investors could, under the differen- tial interest payment program, obtain thesame net low interest rate benefits as those institutions who are borrowing directly from the Department of Housing and Urban De- velopment now enjoy. Kansas State University needs to continue to construct additional college housing on its campus to provide adequate housing for the ever increasing number of students that enroll each year. Although this September we have completed a new dormitory which will house 600 students, we should have an- other such dormitory under construction this fall and ready for occupancy by the fall of 1969. We have had a loan application ready for filing with the Department of Housing and Urban Development since last January but, as noted in your letter, the Depart- ment of Housing and Urban Development has been unable to accept any new loan ap- plications. Therefore, I would recommend that the Congress enact the necessary legislation to provide adequate loan funds to enable the colleges to secure long term, low interest rate loans to meet the continuing need for addi- tional on campus housing for the ever in- creasing student enrollment in the nation's colleges. Sincerely yours, JAMES A. MCCAIN, President. PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, Princeton, NJ., September 8, 1967. Hon. JACOB K. JAVITS, Hon. WILLIAM PRoxMIRE, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. GENTLEMEN: Your letter of Aug. 29, 1967, addressed to President Robert F. Goheen, with respect to the legislation (S. 2000) now being considered by the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, has been referred to me in President Goheen's absence from the University. I know I can speak for President Goheen as well as the University administration gen- erally in endorsing strongly the objectives you seek to obtain through S. 2000. Prince- ton University has taken advantage of loans for the construction of married graduate stu- dent housing under the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Indeed, we have another application which has been tentatively granted for a second grouping of 250 married graduate student units on which we hope to start construction in the very near future. Without such assistance, we would be forced to follow the traditional route of seeking from our alumni, and other constituents, the necessary funds in the form of gifts. In the growing competition for the charitable dollar from many different types of philanthropies, including, I might add, the publicly supported educational Institu- tions, obtaining necessary funds by gifts has become increasingly difficult. Princeton University has chosen to expand its Graduate School facilities to meet the increased demand for talented manpower with advanced training for Government, in- dustry and education. Costs related to ex- panding graduate programs are not confined alone to the need for additional faculty, li- brary facilities, classrooms and laboratories. A growing percentage of graduate students are married and, in the typical suburban community, adequate housing to meet their needs is not available. The alternative to re- quiring these students to commute from long distances is for the institution to provide modest housing for them and their families. We would strongly endorse your program, which would encourage the participation of segments of the private economy to enter the field of financing student housing. Un- der the present conditions of the money mar- ket, educational institutions would be at a serious disadvantage in obtaining private funds without some assistance from the Fed- eral Government. The valued privilege of tax exemption operates to the disadvantage of tax-exempt institutions in competition for34287 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 private funds. Tax deductions for interest charges and depreciation are of no advantage to the tax-exempt organization. Also, and more importantly, the clientele for student housing cannot afford to pay a competitive rent structure, and thus most student hous- ing is subsidized to some degree. Heavy in- terest costs added on top of this subsidy would make it virtually impossible for edu- cational institutions to provide this much needed additional housing. Again, we would urge a continuation of the present program of direct loans, as well as your proposal to provide loan differential payments, to the advantage of all types of institutions. Sincerely yours, RICARDO A. MESTRES. LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY, Baton Rouge, La., September 7, 1967. Hon. ALLEN J. ELLENDER, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR ELLENDER: We received a letter recently signed jointly by Senators Javits and Proxmire asking or our comment on the need for Federal assistance in financ- ing college housing. The unavailability of Federal housing loans and the relatively high interest rates on housing bonds in the open market have resulted in a reappraisal by us of our hous- ing policies and plans for the future. The lack of funds at reasonable interest rates has resulted in our delaying the construc- tion of several housing units during the last year. For those projects that we have had to continue, the high interest rates plus increasing construction costs have re- sulted in our reducing the quality of hous- ing to some extent in order to keep rental rates to students at acceptable levels. In spite of this, housing costs to students have been increased and will continue to increase so long as financing problems exist and con- struction costs continue to rise. We have had applications ready for sub- mission to the Department of Housing and Urban Development to finance dormitories and married student housing for nearly two years now. Of course, as you know, applica- tions have not been accepted since early 1966. By separate letter we are also calling our severe housing problem to the attention ofSenator Long. Sincerely, JOHN A. HUNTER, President. THE CREIGHTON UNIVERSITY, Omaha, Nebr., September 7, 1967.Hon. WILLIAM PROXMIRE, Hon. JACOB K. JAVTrs, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SIns: The Creighton University isvery interested in legislation (S. 2000) re-lated to the easing of the chronic college housing shortage. We believe that a relationship betweenprivate investors, universities, and the Fed-eral Government is a very healthy relation-ship. We have built four dormitories during thepast eleven years and hope that money isavailable to permit us to build one or twomore in the next five years. We believe that Federal aid in the advance-ment of undergraduate higher education, for example, through assistance in the build-ing of dormitories, will in the long run be money well spent in the solving of the na-tion's many sociological problems. I am sending the same letter to Senator Roman Hruska, Senator Carl Curtis, and toRepresentative Glenn Cunningham. Sincerely, H. W. LINN, S.J., President.UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII, Honolulu, Hawaii, September 8,1967. Hon WILLIAM PROXMIRE, U.S. Senate, Committee on Labor and Public Affairs, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR PROxMIRE: Thank you for telling me of the status of S. 2000 having to do with the provision of a greater amount of 3% loan money to ease the college housing shortage. Let me make it abundantly clear that I enthusiastically endorse this bill. The University of Hawaii has a very serious housing shortage. A study which was done a little over a year ago indicates that the University should build dormitories contain- ing 6,000 beds over the next few years. Whether this estimate is precisely correct or not is a little beside the point because thus far we have not been able to attain anything like this rate of growth in housing facilities. In common with many public universities we are expected to amortize the cost of dormitories. To do this with the present high rate of interest on the open market places an almost impossible burden on students and their families. S. 2000 undoubtedly would expand to a considerable degree the amount of 3% money avaliable to us. This will as- sist not only the University but, in turn, the students and their families. I certainly endorse Senate Bill 2000 and hope it becomes law. Sincerely yours, THOMAS H. HAMILTON, President. MICHIGAN TECHNOLOGICAL UNI- VERSITY, Houghton, Mich., September 8, 1967. Hon. JACOB K. JAvrrs, Hon. WILLIAM PROXMIRE, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. GENTLEMEN: This will acknowledge re- ceipt of your communication dated August 29, 1967 directed to the President asking for an indication of interest on the part of the University in Senate Bill No. 2000, the ob- jective of which is to give greater Federal assistance than is now available in meeting college housing needs. I can assure you that Michigan Techno- logical University is very interested in legis- lation that will effect this purpose. At pres- ent we have one project at the University now under construction to provide housing for married students on the Houghton Cam- pus and another project on which we will open bids within the near future for com- pletion at Lake Superior State College of Michigan Technological University in Sault Ste. Marie, both projects of which must be financed with private monies at about 5'/2 %. These projects total $1,530,000 and $350,000 respectively. Moreover, we are presently in the prelimi- nary planning stage for a new men's dor- mitory complex that will cost an estimated $6,840,000 for which we have, as of this time, no prospect at all for assistance from the Department of Housing and Urban Develop- ment in the form of a housing loan. As you can readily understand, the much higher interest rate on private funds means that the University either limit enrollment or charge board and room rates so high that many students are very hard pressed, if not actually unable, to carry the cost of their education. We are certain that if Senate Bill No. 2000 were to be passed it would be of inestimable help to our institution. Yours very sincerely, R. L. SMITH, President. WAYNE STATE UNIVERsITY, Detroit, Mich., September 26, 1967. Hon. WILLIAM PROXMIRE, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR PROXMIRE: Thank you for your letter of August 29 concerning SenateBill 2000. As you undoubtedly know, many educational associations have supported the principle behind the Bill, and I would like to add that Wayne State University is par- ticularly eager to have it adopted. We are located in the heart of downtown Detroit with an enrollment of approximately 32,000 students. In the past we have been able to meet our major educational objec. tives by serving a commuting student popula- tion. Recently, however, the needs of our students have changed greatly and we now feel that the commuter does not enjoy equal educational opportunities with the resident student. Approximately 2,500 young men and women have sought to compensate for this by moving into privately owned residences within a radius of a mile of the campus. Many of these houses and apartments are unsatisfactory from almost every point of view except that of closeness to the libraries and laboratories of the University. If we are to meet our responsibilities to the urban population we primarily serve, we must begin immediately with a construction program to provide a minimum number of student resi- dences. I hope that Wayne State University can carry out a housing program for about 5,000 students over the next several years. Because many of our students come from the less affluent and most disadvantaged families, it is imperative that we be able to finance these residences at the lowest possible cost. I would be very happy to testify in behalf of the Bill, which I feel would not only help our students but which would also assist in rehabilitating an important area of the central City of Detroit. Sincerely, WILLIAM R. KEAST, President. REED COLLEGE, Portland, Oreg., September 19, 1967. Hon. WILLIAM PROXMIRE, Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. SIR: We are pleased to respond to your let- ter of August 29, 1967, and to be able to have the opportunity to tell you of our concern over the difficulty of obtaining satisfactory financing for college housing, and of our in- terest in the legislation (S. 2000) now before the Senate Banking and Currency Commit- tee. Approximately 18 months ago, the Board of Trustees of Reed College authorized the College to proceed with the construction of a new dormitory for 125 students. At the same time. they also gave their approval, subject to review, for the later construction of addi- tional dormitories for another 175 students. These decisions were the result of a critical shortage of dormitory space at Reed, which, even after the utilization of substandard fa- cilities and considerable over crowding, re- sulted in only half of our students being able to live on campus. This shortage has created serious problems, in that Reed has been a residential school since it was founded, as the result of a firm belief that a residential college offers sub- stantial educational benefits to students that are not found at non-residential colleges. Above and beyond this, we are finding that those students forced to live off campus are having an Increasingly difficult time locating adequate housing at a reasonable price and within a reasonable commuting distance. Reed is committed to a gradual expansion of its student body for both academic and fi- nancial reasons. As a result, further delay in building new dormitories will only aggravate an already serious problem. Since the decision to build the new dor- mitories was made, Reed has taken every op- portunity to submit applications for a College Housing loan. We have been advised each time that our application was complete and satisfactory in every respect, but that funds were simply not available.34288 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE We have, of course, carefully considered al- ternative methods of financing the dormi- tories, but have not found a satisfactory answer. Reed does not have the money it- self. The State of Oregon does not have a program to assist private colleges with dormitory financing. Private financing, with its high interest rates and short repayment periods, is prohibitively expensive, especially at schools like Reed that have been forced to raise their tuition to very high levels. Our concern with this problem is demon- strated by the fact that Reed's Acting Presi- dent has been corresponding with our Con- gressional representatives (Senators Morse and Hatfleld and Congresswoman Green). This correspondence has concerned the $300 million for College Housing loans that has been authorized by Congress for this year but not released by the Budget Bureau. You are aware, of course, that even when this money is released, it will not begin to meet the demand. The legislation before your Committee has great merit in our opinion. It would provide desperately needed funds at a cost that col- leges can afford, and would do so at a mini- mum cost to the Federal Government. There is some precedent for such an approach to the problem in, for example, the Guaranteed Stu- dent Loan Program. We would like to note that the legislation now being considered by your Committee would be most effective if it somehow en- couraged private lenders to make loans that would be repayable over a 35 to 40 year period, rather than some shorter span of time. Given the financial situation of most institutions of higher education, the total annual debt service (interest plus principal payment) Is the critical factor in determin- ing whether a particular financing method is feasible. Because of our previous correspondence with them and their expressions of concern with this problem, we are taking the liberty of sending copies of this letter to Senators Morse and Hatfield and Congresswoman Green. Sincerely yours, Ross B. THOMPSON, Financial Vice President. SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY, Carbondale, Ill., September 18, 1967. Hon. WILLIAM PROXMIRE, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR PROXMIRE: Southern Illinois University supports pending legislation (S. 2000) now before the Senate Banking and Currency Committee which will help to alle- viate the chronic housing shortage at col- leges and universities. The proposed legislation, in conjunction with the existing direct loan program, will provide a financing flexibility urgently needed. College housing requirements are changing rapidly. Some universities are in- creasing their undergraduate programs and need single housing; other universities are expanding graduate programs and need hous- ing for married graduate students. Our hous- ing needs vary between our two main cam- puses at Carbondale (19,000 enrollment) and Edwardsville (8,000 enrollment). Our Edwardsvllle Campus urgently needs student housing, but is partially blocked in its efforts by high rates of interest requiring rental rates which students would have diffi- culty paying. Our Carbondale Campus has benefited greatly through the years from the College Housing Loaa Program and currently does not require additional college-owned housing for single students. We do need mar- ried student housing. At the present time 304 apartments are being constructed under the provisions of the FHA 221-D-3 program, with an interest rate of 3 per cent. This hous- ing is being provided for the rapidly growing number of graduate students who could notattend school without apartment rentals in their income range. The plan as proposed will combine the power of private financial resources with the aid of Government support, and the direct action of the College Housing Loan Program. It will permit flexible programming for all sizes and types of college housing needs which are present and real. Southern Illinois University recommends the approval and activation of this program. Sincerely, JOHN S. RENDLEMAN. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, Berkeley, Calif., September 14,1967. Hon. JACOB K. JAvITS, Hon. WILLIAM PROXMIRE, U.S. Senate, Washington D.C. GENTLEMEN: This is in reply to your letter of August 29, 1967, concerning the Uni- versity of California's position on S. 2000. We favor the plan proposed in that legisla- tion and are urging its adoption as a supple- ment to existing programs. Our advocacy of S. 2000 is being conducted through the American Council on Education, the Associa- tion of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges, and the University of California's Washington office. As a matter of interest, you may wish to know that we estimate residential housing needs for the nine campuses of the Univer- sity will total approximately 160,000,000 for the period of the next five years. If further details concerning the Uni- versity's position on S. 2000 would be help- ful, we shall be pleased to have Dr. Mark Ferber of our Washington office meet with you at your convenience.

WILLIAM PROXMIRE, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR PROXMIRE: President Kirk has asked me to acknowledge your letter of August 29 describing legislation (S. 2000) to implement the college housing loan pro- gram. The funds available from the direct loan program have proven quite inadequate. The situation is becoming more and more criti- cal as the colleges and universities try to plan expansion with no means of financing the student housing that is so necessary to accommodate the increasing student popu- lation. Both the short and long term expansion plans at Columbia call for sorely needed stu- dent housing facilities. To offer these accom- modations at rates that will enable the greatest number of qualified students to ap- ply for admission it is essential that we have access to college housing loans to supplement our own fund raising efforts. This legislation (S. 2000) now being con- sidered by the Senate Banking and Cur- rency Committee would greatly alleviate the current obstacle-lack of capital funds-and enable us to develop our housing plans with greater assurance of success. We strongly recommend favorable consid- eration of S. 2000 and know that its passage will prove to be of inestimable value to higher education in our country. Cordially, THOMAS A. MCGOEY. UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO, Boulder, Colo., September 14, 1967. Hon. WILLIAM PROXMIRE, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR PROXMIRE: The assistance we have had in the form of Federal loans forstudent housing at the University of Col- orado has been a decisive factor in our ability to provide the facilities which we have con- structed. No state funds have ever been supplied and we must borrow to build these revenue funded housing units at the lowest possible cost to the student occupants. We support wholeheartedly the testimony which President David Mullins, University of Arkansas, presented to the Senate Sub- committee on Housing and Urban Affairs on July 24 concerning the critical need for addi- tional loan funds for college housing and related construction. We assure you of our endorsement of Sen- ate Bill 2000 as a supplement to the existing authority for direct loans by the Federal government. Sincerely yours, J. R. SMILEY, President. STATE OF DELAWARE, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, Dover, September 26, 1967. Hon. WILLIAM PROXMIRE, Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR PROXMIRE: Your interest in providing for an expansion of the College Housing Loan Program is appreciated. I have myself taken a very personal interest in the problems of higher education in the entire country, most recently as the first Chairman of the Education Commission of the States, and more especially in the State of Delaware. The rapidly increasing costs of higher edu- cation are creating financial problems for the students, for the institutions, and for the states. We cannot allow tuition and other fees to increase so substantially that a col- lege education is beyond the reach of many of our citizens. As you are aware, institu- tional resources are already strained, and the states' sources of revenue are being hard- pressed by financial demands on all fronts. I have been informed and I am especially concerned that the present inadequate fi- nancing of the College Housing Loan Pro- gram seems to preclude the University of Delaware from getting a $3 million Federal loan at 3% to complete the financing of a dormitory complex we must have in the Fall of 1968. Your proposal to make additional funds available through a Federal subsidy of interest in excess of 3% on loans place in the commercial market would seem to be the most desirable solution from every point of view. Please convey to the Senate Banking and Currency Committee my full support of your bill (S. 2000). Sincerely yours, CHARLES L. TERRY, Jr., Governor. UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA, Minneapolis, Minn., September 22, 1967. Senator JACOB JAvrrs, Senator WILLIAM PROXMIRE, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATORS JAVITS AND PROXMIRE: First, I want to express our appreciation to you for your support of our moving off dead center on support for our college student housing shortage. I have seen correspondence from Mr. Charles Schultz, Director of the Bureau of the Budget, in which he expresses the feeling that the statutory interest rate of three per cent has been a significant con- tributing factor in using up the presently available loan fund resources. Indeed, he states, \"It has attracted applications from colleges which could borrow in the private market without having to pay unreasonable interest rates.\" It Is to this particular point that I want to address myself, but it is the judgment of great numbers of college presidents in the United States that we need to provide col- lege housing at the lowest possible price to students who need access to such housing.34289 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 At the University of Minnesota, for example, we find that the typical student who has to live in campus housing comes from a town some distance away from the Twin Cities. He has no choice but to go either into a rooming house or into University-provided housing. This means he does not have the advantage of being able to make the choice of living at home for his room and board. This student's costs start out being almost $1,000 above those of a commuting student. So it is essential that we try to keep prices in our dormitories as low as possible. I sim- ply cannot agree with Mr. Schultz's appraisal of the situation. The extra two per cent or three percent on a student housing loan spread over 30 or 40 years makes a great deal of difference. In our University of Minnesota situation, we especially need housing and food service facilities at the University of Minnesota, Duluth, and housing facilities at the Uni- versity of Minnesota, Morris. We already have a 25% appropriation from our State Legis- lature for both of these projects. On our Twin Cities Campus we have immediate needs for over $3 million worth of married student housing. Viet Nam veterans will be principal users of the more than 200 units this will provide. Nor is our problem unique. We earnestly hope that the Congress will recognize the unbalanced approach being made to some problems of higher education. Again, I wish to express my appreciation for your support of some deliberate move- ment in assisting colleges with low interest rate loans for student housing. Cordially, MALCOLM Moos, President. CAMIBRIDGE VOTERS SUPPORT U.S. POSITION IN VIETNAM Mr. CANNON. Mr. President, for the second time in recent weeks an American community has voted in favor of the United States staying in Vietnam until the job there is done. Yesterday, a majority of voters in Cambridge, Mass., voted in a city-wide referendum for the United States to stand by its commitment. By so doing, Cambridge joins the voters of San Fran- cisco who recently voted the same way. It is interesting to note that while Cambridge includes the university com- munities of Harvard and MIT, where there is considerable opposition to the administration's policies, the vote against immediate withdrawal passed by a 3-to- 2 margin. I think this vote is a true indication of how the overwhelming majority of the American people feel about honoring the Nation's commitment in Vietnam. The meaning of this vote is clear: The American people understand that we are in a war that nobody wants but the Communists in Hanoi. But we are deter- mined to stand fast against aggression until ways can be found to get Hanoi to the conference table. I regard this vote as an affirmation of the rightness of our cause in Vietnam. I regard it also as a vote of confidence for President Johnson's policies of remain- ing firm but flexible against a persistent and stubborn enemy who has yet to demonstrate a sincere desire for peace. CORPORATE ESPIONAGE Mr. LONG of Missouri. Mr. President. the Wall Street Journal of November 10. 1967, reports that the chairman of Amphenol Corp. has recently chargedthat someone \"bugged\" his home tele- phone. This is believed to be a case of corporate espionage. The Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure, of which I am chairman, has held hearings on the ad- ministration's right of privacy bill. The bill, which is now pending before the full Judiciary Committee, would go a long way toward protecting the American citizen against this form of private eaves- dropping. Although there appears to be some differences of opinion on wiretap- ping and eavesdropping by law enforce- ment officers, I believe Senators join me in wanting to prohibit bugging and wire- tapping by private individuals. By way of illustrating one form of private eavesdropping, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD the Wall Street Journal article entitled \"Corporate Espionage Claimed by Amphenol-Chairman Says Home Phone Was 'Bugged.'\" There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: CoRPORATE ESPIONAGE CLAIMED BY AMPHE- NOL-CHAIRMAN SAYS HOME PHONE WAS \"BUGGED\" (By K. Ames Smithers) CHICAGo.-Matthew L. Devine, chairman of Amphenol Corp., one of the New York Stock Exchange's most active issues for more than a month, said someone \"bugged\" his home telephone. \"I believe this to be a case of corporate espionage,\" he told a news conference. But he didn't name any suspects. Mr. Devine, whose company makes elec- tronic devices, said the \"bugging\" unit was a short-wave radio transmitter, about the length of a regular cigaret. that had been in- serted into a telephone on the second floor of his home in the Chicago suburb of Win- ne:ka, Ili. The unit, he said, was custom made. He said it was capa-sle of picking up telephone conversations and transmitting them to a receiving unit five to 10 miles away. The angered official, who said he would personally pay a -50.000 reward for the arrest and conviction of anyone who participated in the installation, said he could \"see no other motive\" for the bugging other than '*corporate espionage.\" \"This must also be one of the most sordid examples of this type of espionage that has come to public attention-placing a bug- ging device immediately outside a husband's and wife's bedroom.\" He quickly noted, how- ever, that the device was effective in picking up only those conversations spoken on either end of a telephone line. He said it wasn't capable of picking up voices from the general hallway area. Amphenol stock has been one of the hot- test issues on the New York exchange since late September on reports that the company was a target for a merger or acquisition. SANGA.MO ELECTRIC TRANSACTION In response to the first wave of activity, the company got together in early October with Sangamo Electric Co.. and quickly ar- ranged a merger over one weekend. That pro- posed transaction called for the exchange of Sangamo stock valued then at about $120 million for all of Amphenoi's shares out- standing. A week later, however, the merger was called off because the continued ad- vance in Amphenol's stock price, from 837.375 to $44. threw the terms out of kilter. Even while the merger was still alive, though, Amphenol had another suitor in Solitron Devices Inc., also a manufacturer of electronics devices, based in Tappan. N.Y. Amphenol officials have been aloof to theSolitron bids. Mr. Devine at one point saidAmphenol was studying Solltron's operations,but even that study, he said, has since beenterminated. Even so, Solitron is pressing ahead with itsacquisition plans. Paul Windels Jr., Solitron's secretary and a director, said in New Yorkthat the company is planning to make atender offer directly to Amphenol sharehold- ers for Amphenol stock. All during the Sangamo and Solitron courtships, Amphenol stock continued to riseon hectic trading on the Big Board. In earlyOctober, when the stock was trading at near 844, Amphenol asked the New York StockExchange, the American Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission tostart investigations. The stock closed yesterday at 845.50, up $4.25 from Wednesday, on a turnover of 140,700 shares. It was the most actively tradedissue on the Big Board yesterday. Mr. Devine, even while insisting that the bugging of his home phone was \"corporate espionage,\" refused to comment when asked who he thought was responsible for planting the device. Asked about the reported bugging. Mr. Windels said yesterday in New York that Solltron \"knows nothing\" about it and hadn'tbeen notified of it by Mr. Devine or Am- phenol. 'Whoever Is responsible,\" Mr. Win- dels commented, \"we are anxious that the authorities apprehend the wrong-doers.\" Mr. Devine said he first became suspicious of possible espionage \"during the past weeks.\" because, he said, \"we have had reason to believe that unauthorized information con- cerning the affairs of Amphenol was being leaked in some manner to persons outside our organization.\" DETECTIVE AGENCY HIRED Last Friday, he said, the company hired a detective agency \"to review all aspects of in- ternal security at our company.\" Declared Mr. Devine: \"In the course of the investigation that followed, a survey v; -s made of the homes of certain of our key executives. On Saturday morning, Nov. 4. at approximately 11 a.m., a 'bugging' device was discovered by representatives of the de- tective agency in one of the telephones in my home in Winnetka.\" Mr. Devine showed the device to newsmen. It was a black cylinder, about 2%3 inches long, with two red wires extending from it. \"This device,\" said Mr. Devine, \"had been wired into the telephone mechanism itself. To insert the device the top of the telephone box had been removed.\" Mr. Devine said the investigators found that a telephone in a library downstairs \"had also been tampered with and also very likely had had a \"bugging\" device inserted into it.\" He said screws in the base of the phone had been cut and mangled and the dial mecha- nism was very loose. But for \"some reason or other.\" this device apparently had been re- moved. A MAN AT THE DOOR The Amphenol officials said, \"My wife re- calls that sometime in late summer a man appeared at the door of our home and pur- ported to be a representative of the telephone company and asked to check the two tele- phones in our home. Mrs. Devine admitted him and he remained in our home for ap- proximately 30 minutes.\" Continued Mr. Devine: \"We have checked with the telephone company and have deter- mined that no authorized representative has paid a visit to our home since April 28, 1967.\" The angered chairman said investigators haven't found any similar devices at the homes of other Amphenol officials or at the company's new executive offices at Oak Brook, Ill. He theorized his home was easier to bug than his office, so that is why the spy prob- ably struck there. Mr. Devine charged, \"The person or per- sons who violated the privacy of my home, November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE by unlawful entry, to carry out this despica- ble act, and any other individuals who aided or abetted or planned the acts in question, are guilty of serious Federal and state crimes.\" Both state authorities and the Federal Bu- reau of Investigation have been asked to investigate, he said, \"At this point in time I am making no charges against anyone. However, when the full facts are determined, Amphenol, and I personally, intend to institute appropriate civil suits. Somebody will pay dearly for this outrage,\" he asserted. TEXTILE IMPORTS Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the dis- tinguished Senator from North Carolina [Mr. ERVIN] is SO famed as the constitu- tional authority of this body that it ob- scures his other talents. Senator ERVIN is not just concerned with the adherence to our founding charter. He is even more concerned with people. He realizes through years of ex- perience that the desire to work and the ability to work lies at the bottom of most of our ills. When Government hampers, in any way, a man's ability to work, this is ty- ranny. The Government's policy toward the textile industry turned, under Presi- dent Kennedy, from callous disregard to concern. President Kennedy was unable to complete this program and the major- ity of us here in the Congress are look- ing to the Johnson administration for its completion. Earlier I introduced S. 1796 to provide a tool to President Johnson in securing further agreements to protect the jobs of our American textile workers. It has been an inspiration to watch Senator ERVIN in his zeal that right be done for the workers of North Carolina and the sev- eral States. No one is better informed on this subject than Senator ERvIN and no one has worked harder and more patiently. I had no sooner drawn my measure than Senator ERVIN joined me. You will notice he is our first cosponsor. He was our lead witness at the Senate Finance Committee hearings 2 weeks ago and some of his thoughts are very cogently expressed in a recent article in We the People entitled \"Textiles: The Import Crisis.\" The membership should read and study these thoughts. I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: TEXTILES: THE IMPORT CRISIS (By Senator SAM J. ERVIN, JR.) As a result of the reduction on textile tariffs made by the Kennedy round of tariff agreements, and the textile imports which are flooding our nation, the prob- lems which confront our country's second largest industry have become the subject of increasing concern in Congress. Hearings were recently concluded by the Senate Fi- nance Committee on legislative measures de- signed to protect this important industry, and one bill, S. 1796, which imposes textile import quotas, has been co-sponsored by 67 Senators. North Carolinians should be particularly concerned because there are 323,000 workers in our State presently engaged in the textile, apparel, and man-made fiber indus- try. This means, that 52 percent of the totalnumber of manufacturing employees in the State of North Carolina are affected by the present Congressional studies on import quota legislation. In addition to these in- dustrial employees, the thousands of families engaged in the growing and han- dling of cotton in North Carolina are also affected. The economic influence of the textile in- dustry is certainly not confined to North Carolina for there are four million jobs throughout the United States representing the fiber-textile-apparel industries. The textile industrial complex is our nation's second largest industry and its economic well being is definitely important to each of us. For many years, I have been totally in- capable of understanding our government's attitude towards the textile industry. For example, one of the greatest problems this nation is having to face is the deficit in our balance of payments. This deficit has per- sisted over the years and last year amounted to 1.4 billion dollars. Because of our govern- ment's policy towards textile imports, total textile products brought into this country last year exceeded exports by approximately 890 million dollars. This means the balance of payments deficit attributable to textile Imports is approximately two-thirds of our total deficit, and yet, we continue to allow these imports to flood our nation, killing more and more of our jobs each year. From July 1966 to July 1967, there were 46,000 jobs lost in the textile industry in this country. Why do we let this continue to happen if by protecting our textile industry and the jobs it represents, we could help solve the deficit in our balance of payments and the growing storm that deficit represents to our nation's fiscal health? Also, in connection with the agricultural problems which confront this nation, we are engaged in many farm programs trying to bring the earning capacity of the farmers up to a parity with other workers in the cities. However, there has been a tendency on the part of those In charge of our trade policy to ignore the self-evident fact that the best customer which the cotton grower in the United States has is the domestic textile industry. On one side of the fence, we maintain rigid import quotas on cotton, while on the other side, we allow cotton in the form of manufactured articles to enter this country at a rate of over one million bales annually. Another inconsistency can be found in our government's dealings with the Appalachian Region. On one hand, this nation has been engaged in trying to give Appalachia equal basis with the rest of the country in its ef- forts to better itself. However, this govern- ment's policy towards the textile Industry places in jeopardy 26 per cent of all the manufacturing jobs in that area. In North Carolina most of our counties in the Appalachian Region have over 50 per cent of their total manufacturing employ- ment working in textile manufacturing. In two North Carolina counties, Polk and Ruth- erford, 89 per cent of all manufacturing jobs are in the textile industry. Here, as in the case of the deficit in our balance of payments, and in the case of the relationship between our cotton growers and our textile industry, we have a contradiction in terms. While the government is attempt- ing to lift the level of the economic state of the people in Appalachia, it is following a trade policy which has exactly the op- posite effect, and which has a tendency to deprive the means of livelihood from those who work in the textile industry in Appa- lachia and immediately adjacent to Appa- lachia. It seems to me the only sensible course for this government to pursue is to take steps that will preserve the entire textile indus- try-cotton, synthetic and wool. I feel thatthe obligation we owe to our own country has to be greater than we owe to the four or five nations that are currently supplying most of our textile imports. The fact is that these imports are not entering our country because the textile industry is more efficient elsewhere. They are entering this country for one reason: the labor costs are cheaper And they are cheaper because of working conditions we would not allow in the United States. For example, an American textile worker is paid five times as much as the Japanese performing exactly the same function. Hourly wage rates in other countries that are large exporters of textiles are: Singapore 1'7 cents; Hong Kong 29 cents; and Portugal 19 cents. Our textile industry has tried to modernize to meet these challenges, but no efficient management could overcome these wage differentials. I am certainly not a trade isolationist; however, we must encourage reasonable and workable international trade policies. We cannot allow the tragic consequences of a trade policy which could destroy a major American industry and millions of Jobs only because a foreign country offers nothing more than low wages. I agree with former Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, who was one of our greatest experts on foreign trade, when he stated that the only satisfactory trade between na- tions in the long run is based on the prin- ciple of reciprocity; and that any trade based on this principle has to be, in es- sence, an exchange of surpluses. The United States should make trade agreements with other nations under which we export goods which we produce in surplus quantities and import goods which we cannot produce or cannot produce effectively. As Secretary of State Hull pointed out, any trade policy which encourages the im- portation into the United States of goods which we already produce in surplus quan- tities has three inevitable results. The first is that American investors are denied a fair return upon their investments. Second is that an American industry is denied its domestic markets, and the third Is that American working men are deprived of their jobs. Even though those who advocate imports at the expense of American domestic econ- omy are usually pictured as altruistic in- dividuals actuated by righteous motives, the truth of it is that those who import from abroad and those who manufacture at home are actuated by the same motive: Profit in- centives. The importer who seeks to import at the expense of the loss of American jobs and the domestic markets of American man- ufacturers wants to sell cheaper imports at profit in the United States; and, of course, the American manufacturer and the Ameri- can worker desires to make something as a result of their efforts. The difference is that the importer is willing to make his profits even though it entails a loss to American manufacturers and the destruction of the jobs of the American worker to the benefit of workers in foreign lands. So, the motives are the same and they are lofty ones despite the tendency today to decry the profit mo- tive. I think the man who manufactures at home and wants to see that he is allowed to retain his domestic markets and who fur- nishes jobs to Americans, certainly is per- forming, as far as our country is concerned, the greatest service to our country. I happen to believe that St. Paul spoke the truth when he said in the 8th verse of the fifth chapter of the first epistle to Timothy: \"But if any provide not for his own and especially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith and is worse than an in- fidel.\" Accordingly, when it comes to trying to promote the prosperity of the textile indus- try and retain the jobs for 323,000 North34291 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 Carolinians who earn their livelihood in that industry, I am going to stand on St. Paul and I think it is not only carrying out good sound economy as far as the United States is con- cerned, but involves a high standard of righteous conduct. The American textile industry deserves a chance to compete with its foreign rivals on equal terms and I believe we should act now to make it fair by setting up a system of import quotas on textile products. After the reduction on textile tariffs made by the Kennedy round of tariff agreements, we are left with little choice but to impose these import quotas. In this regard, I was glad to join Senator Hollings when he introduced S. 1796, a bill to impose quotas on the importation of tex- tiles. Briefly, this bill would limit the impor- tation of textiles in any year to a base period level plus an adjustment to reflect increases or decreases in the consumption of textiles in the United States market. This would es- tablish a reasonable volume for textile im- ports and would establish the machinery necessary for orderly growth in the future. Additional Executive studies are fine, but I strongly hope we will enact S. 1796 as soon as possible. By not doing anything, until the ultimate injury has taken place and our tex- tile industry has been liquidated and the losS of jobs has become permanent, this gov- ernment will be guilty of making the sick patient die in order to prove that he is suf- fering and needs help. I hope we will help the patient now. THE SOUTH: LAND OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, we are exceedingly proud of the tremendous economic advancement that has been made in the State of Georgia and other States of the South in recent years In just about all areas of industrial and business activity the growth rate in Georgia and the Southeast has exceededthat of almost all other States and the national average For example personal income has been steadily rising and statistics show that wages and salaries received in Georgia increased more than 104 percent in a 10-year period between 1956 and 1966. It is heartening indeed that the South is now regarded as the Nation's No. 1 land of economic opportunity, rather than the country's No. 1 economic problem, as it was just a few short decades ago. At the same time, much remains to be done. One of the gravest inequitiesthat exists is the difference between wages paid in some major industries in the South and those paid in other parts of the country, although there may not be any significant difference in the cost- of-living index. Major industrial and business wages paid in the South fall considerably short of the national average, and it is im-portant to the continued economic pros- perity of people in the South that this disparity be eliminated and that the wage gap be closed. I am confident that in the interest of what is just and fair, every effort will be made to do so as fast as is reasonably possible. MILITARY PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES Mr. DOMINICK. Mr. President, I havelad growing concern over the increasingpercentage of our military procurement which is accomplished without open competition. Certainly, in some in- stances, national security reasons might justify some such noncompetitive actions, but when the average percentage of non- competitive procurement reaches 86 per- cent, and the 100 largest business firms continually get a larger and larger share of our military procurement, there is cause for alarm. I discussed this matter previously dur- ing my remarks on September 19, Sep- tember 28, and October 4, 1967. I began delving into this situation last year when one of my constituents-Custom Packag- ing Co.-a small business firm in Aurora, Colo., which developed a shoulder-borne, portable, recoilless flame weapon, was given what I felt was very unfair treat- ment by the Army. After expending its own funds to develop and demonstrate the weapon to the Army, Custom was low bidder on the invitation for bids for the initial development of the weapon. The Army, however, awarded the develop- ment contract to Nortronics, a division of Northrop Aviation, at more than double the price bid by Custom Packaging Co.- costing the taxpayer more than $200,000 above the low bid by my constituent. Looking into other Army procure- ments, I found a pattern: Whenever pro- curement was open to competition, the price was reduced dramatically. This was true in the case of the AN/ PRC-25 radio set where the unit price dropped from $2,156.91 each in the first production contract to less than $600 per unit when exposed to open competition. It was true in reverse with the AN/ GRA-6 control chest set. From May 1961, through June 24, 1964, the Army bought this control chest set under six different contracts at unit costs ranging from $145.50 to $200 each. Since June 24, 1964, this equipment has been removed from open competitive procurement and the price has more than doubled. The most recent award announced January 19, 1967, by Commerce Business Daily in the total amount of $1,220,665, shows an average unit price of $418.94 for this same equipment. There are literally hundreds of these cases which need investigation. With my limited staff, I certainly cannot under- take such a large task, but I hope this can be done by the appropriate com- mittee of the Senate. I am also greatly concerned about one practice I have discovered being carried out by the Navy which, if allowed to continue and expand, could completely destroy open competitive procurement in the future. This involves a practice called \"leader-follower\" procurement proce- dure. It is an incredible story: The Naval Research Lab, Washington, D.C., scored a breakthrough in airborne transponder development in late 1964 and early 1965. The Naval Research Lab assigned the nomenclature APX-72 to its transponder, which was more than 95 percent developed \"in-house\" by the Navy. A transponder is a small electronic device mounted in an aircraft which emits a signal permitting ground sta- tions or other aircraft to identify it asfriendly or hostile and can itself sim- ilarly interrogate other aircraft. In April 1965, the Navy awarded acontract in the amount of $58,000 to Ben- dix Radio Division, Baltimore, to \"polish\" or \"package\" the unit into a mass-pro- duceable model. The value of the con- tract with Bendix was increased to $124,- 000 when a requirement was added for several more prototypes and to make some minor improvements to meet the military's AIMS program. Less than a year later, Bendix de- livered a model to the Navy which was flight tested and conditionally approved for production, although certain im- provements were still needed which the Navy felt could easily be made while preparation for volume production was underway. Bendix Radio was only one of several major firms working to develop a new, lightweight, flexible transponder. Sev- eral of these firms working with other services, had been persuaded to invest their own money into this development on the promise that whichever new transponder was eventually chosen, all competing firms would have an oppor- tunity to bid on volume production of that transponder. The Navy persuaded the Department of Defense that the Navy-Bendix trans- ponder was superior to others in devel- opment. And in June 1966, Bendix was very quietly given a sole-source produc- tion contract for 2,300 APX-72 trans- ponders. was cited as jus- tification for the sole-source contract and first production units were due for delivery in June 1967. It was thereafter decided by the Navy Department to award Bendix an \"extraordinary\" type of contract called a \"leader-follower.\" Under this arrangement and without any of the usual notification through the Commerce Business Daily, Bendix's ex- traordinary contract provided that Ben- dix was to be given a contract for 8,500 additional units of the APX-72 trans- ponders with the further proviso that of the entire total of 10,800 units, 40 per- cent would be shared with-or subcon- tracted to-a \"follower\" company whom Bendix would take under its wing. The Navy justified this approach on two grounds: First, that in the normal course of events Bendix would not have a data package for almost a year. But by hav- ing a Bendix handpicked \"follower\" to understudy the initial production, at least 6 months time could be gained in getting a second source into production, and, second, being able to hold Bendix responsible for the quality and precision of the \"follower's\" product, complete in- terchangeability or commonality could be assured. The absence of a technical data pack- age is open to question because Bendix issued such a technical package to its component subcontractors and to poten- tial \"followers\" at the time of solicita- tion. In its second point, the Navy admitted, in effect, that it did not have the ability to demand or obtain from manufacturers performing Navy contracts equipment common with or identical to the same34292 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE equipment, turned out from identical drawings by another manufacturer. A further part of the agreement be- tween the Navy and Bendix is still more disturbing. This agreement with Bendix held that to perpetuate the commonality feature on future production, Bendix and its handpicked \"follower\" would be per- mitted to share all future production. This is no small factor when you consider that the APX-72 is destined to be the transponder on all military aircraft in the future and will be bought in a ci- vilian version by the Federal Aviation Administration. The first notice that anyone had of these proceedings came in May 1967, when the fact was announced in the Commerce Business Daily that Bendix was conducting competition to choose the \"follower.\" Bendix announced that it would require a complex management and technical proposal to be submitted within 10 days. Other requirements listed by Bendix were so restrictive that all small business firms were discouraged from bidding. Bendix also held a bidders conference and disclosed at that confer- ence that Bendix intended to put a Bendix team in the \"follower's\" plant to keep an eye on production. Furthermore, Bendix would demand detailed cost fig- ures and other similar data. At this point, a number of major firms dropped out, unwilling to have a competitor given ac- cess to so much information which nor- mally is confidential within the company itself. The result was a further limiting of competition. Bendix was unable tn work out a satis- factory contract with the eventually chosen \"follower,\" Wilcox Electric Co., of Kansas City, until November 8, at which time Bendix itself had been able to deliver only 10 units instead of 200 units of the APX-72 as scheduled. Al- though the Navy has refused to disclose the \"follower\" price officially, the Navy has said unofficially that the follower price is just under $2,200 per unit. How- ever, the Navy-Bendix price, which will be higher than the \"follower's\" price to Bendix, is still under negotiation. There is obviously no real meaningful competition involved in this procure- ment, either with regard to price or in the choice of producers-and it is equally obvious that there will be no meaning- ful competition in future contracts under the Navy's proposed procedure. The cur-rent Navy plan to limit production to Bendix and Wilcox Electric Co., in effect,hands a free patent to a private con-tractor for exclusive production in per- petuity of an item developed not only taxpayers' expense, but by Governmentpersonnel. The finality with which the Navy viewsthis transaction is evident in the re- sponse received by the Senate Select Committee on Small Business from the Honorable Graeme C. Bannerman, As- sistant Secretary of the Navy, Installa- tions and Logistics. Mr. Bannerman said, and I quote: Your comment that small producers oftransponders, not participating in the cur-rent procurement will, to al intents and pur- poses, be foreclosed from supplying trans-ponders to military departments in the fore- seeable future, applies only to this partic-ular transponder. Since this particular transponder is to be the unit installed in all future mili- tary aircraft and the military need has been projected in the first 5 years at 30,- 000 units and will cost in excess of $70 million, it seems to me that this entire transaction is open to very serious ques- tion, and I would hope that further in- vestigation might be conducted without delay. FAILURE TO RATIFY HUMAN RIGHTS CONVENTIONS HAS TAR- NISHED U.S. IMAGE Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, I con- tinue to be mystified by the Senate's im- mobility in the matter of ratifying the Human Rights Conventions on Forced Labor, Freedom of Association, Geno- cide, and the Political Rights of Women. There have been a number of times in our history when the Federal Govern- ment has required some determined di- rection and prodding from American cit- izens and loyal organizations to reach some necessary goals. I have, for many months now, con- tinued to speak in the Chamber and ask that the Senate vote ratification of these treaties and halt the embarrassment being suffered by our country. It was just over 3 weeks ago when I said that we would have the opportunity to go on record, not only approving the Slavery Convention, as we did, but all the Human Rights Conventions. Not to proclaim to the world our gen- uine faith in our own culture and social and political ethics is sheer folly. We must set the example and end our pro- fessed righteousness. The United Nations long ago adopted as necessary human rights goals, a number of conventions-all dealing with basic human equities. The goal for the ratification of these conventions by all Member States of the United Nations is 1968. The failure of the Senate to ratify the remaining con- ventions would be a national shame. It is indeed a perplexity to see this con- tinuing failure to demonstrate responsi- bility for endorsement of the exact basic ingredients which distinguish our idea of government from all and any types of tyranny. President Kennedy reminded the Sen- ate in 1962 that the fact that our Con- stitution already assures us of these rights does not give us license to remain free of the need to ratify these ideals. Again, our failure to act is a terrible mis- take being noted by both friendly nations and those of totalitarian beliefs. Our national prestige has been badly dam- aged and our inaction is being shaped into a convenient piece of propaganda by those who do not share our basic regard for human concern. Our image is not bright and is in need of refurbishing. I once again urge the Senate to vote into the written record of this forum the ratification of the Human Rights Con- vention on Forced Labor, Freedom of As- sociation, Genocide, and the Political Rights of Women.THE COPPER STRIKE Mr. FANNIN. Mr. President, during the Thanksgiving recess in Arizona, I was re- minded again and again of the plight of mining community families as a result of the protracted copper strike. I was im- pressed with an editorial in the Chicago Tribune which brought into clear focus the monopoly power of certain labor unions involved in this copper strike. The editorial pointed out the relationship be- tween the monopolistic power of the labor unions in England and that country's serious economic difficulties culminating in its need to devaluate its currency. I ask unanimous consent that this edi- torial be placed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: [From the Chicago Tribune, Nov. 28, 1967] MONOPOLY POWER IN THE COPPER STRIKE For more than four months the nation's copper industry has been paralyzed by a strike of 50,000 unionists, most of them members of the United Steelworkers. The Steelworkers union absorbed the old Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers of America last July 1 and now heads a coalition of 26 unions in the bargaining with copper producing and fabricating companies. The strike has attracted little attention because, until now, stockpiles of copper have prevented a shortage. But Inventories are nearly exhausted, and if the shutdown con- tinues much longer the nation's economy will suffer and production for war needs will be endangered. The danger point would have been reached earlier except for increased gov- ernment purchases of foreign copper. One issue of the strike is the unions' de- mand for industry-wide bargaining, which means agreements that disregard differences in production costs from plant to plant. The companies oppose industry-wide or company- wide bargaining, as well as mining company settlements tied to manufacturing company settlements. The producers are aware that copper is an international commodity, and much of the United States supply comes from abroad, even in normal times. Copper also faces competition from other materials such as aluminum, plastics, and stainless steel. A recent report by the Chase Manhattan bank noted that consumption of copper has been declining, particularly in western Europe, and the industry faces the prospects of a surplus. Under these conditions the unions are not exercising common sense when they make demands that would raise costs to a point where jobs would be destroyed. The first demands were for wage increases and other benefits amounting to more than $2 an hour. The companies offered 48 cents. The unions sat tight for three months, then made a counter-proposal which the companies esti- mated would cost $1.35 an hour. Industry bargainers calculated that even 99 cents an hour in a three-year contract would be equivalent to an increase of 8 per cent annually. The Steelworkers union wants a settlement at least as good as the 6 per cent annual raises won from Ford and Chrysler by the auto workers. Even more important, the Steelworkers want to set a pattern for com- ing negotiations with the can manufacturing industry, the aluminum industry, and even- tually the steel industry. So bargaining no longer is between one union and an employer. It Is no longer even between one union and all the employers in one industry. It is bargaining between one union and many industries. The word for this is labor union monopoly34293 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 power. Labor unions in England, with mo- nopoly power, were able to Jack up wages steadily, which drove up prices and brought the country to its present economic plight. The United States is headed in the same direction. CREDIT BUREAUS AND PRIVACY Mr. LONG of Missouri. Mr. President, during the course of the hearings before the Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure on invasions of privacy, and spccifically our inquiry in- to the proposed National Data Center, we began to realize that our Govern- ment maintains considerable files on the activities of American citizens. A great deal of information comes from private credit bureaus. Early next year, the subcommittee in- tends to hold hearings on the relation- ship between these private credit bu- reaus and the Federal Government, and its potential impact on the proposals to create a National Data Center. The November issue of the Reader's Digest contains an article entitled \"What the Credit Bureaus Know About You.\" I ask unanimous consent that tit be printed in the REconn. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the REcoRD, as follows: WHAT THE CREDIT BUREAUS KNOW AnouT You (The depth of detail may surprise you- but it's all-important to your credit rating) (By Joe Alex Morris) A secretary recently signed an agreement to rent an apartment in Washington, D.O. She gave the usual references. When she re- turned to the rental olllce later to complete the arrangements, she was handed a lease to which a form was attached, listing her em- ployer, her monthly salary, and other data lncluding the fact that she had once let a bill go unpaid for three months. She was reading the report when the rental agent snatched It back. \"That got there by mis- take,\" he explained. \"It's just routine. Every- body gets checked on.\" The young woman was indignant. \"Doesn't a person have any privacy these days?\" Many Americans would have the same re- action If they knew what Inquiries are made, and what Information is exchanged, each time they open a charge account, finance a new automobile or arrange payments for having the children's teeth straightened. The system that enables prospective credi- tors to know so much about you is based on the more than 2500 local credit bureaus scattered throughout the United States. Some of these bureaus, servicing stores, banks, finance companies, hospitals, doctors and businessmen, are privately owned; others are cooperatively owned by those who use their services. Credit bureaus are designed to protect their members from the four percent of credit applicants who grossly neglect pay- ment and the one percent who try to skip out without paying. The great majority of the local bureaus-about 2100-belong to the Associated Credit Bureaus of America, Inc., an organization which facilitates the ex- change of information about you if you move from city to city. ACBA members maintain files containing information on about 110 million American citizens. The chances are that one of those Iles has your name on it. This is so because credit and the demand for credit information have expanded tre- mendously in recent years. Most Americans today live on credit-on their future earn- ings-with about 60 percent of the average individual's net income going to credit ob-ligations of one form or another. \"When I was young,\" says the credit manager of a famous Now England store, \"I bought a $100 overcoat on credit. The store notified my em- ployer, and he called me in for a harsh lec- ture on the evils of owing money. But today, if you paid cash here, some of our clerks wouldn't know what to do with the money. Credit has become a way of life.\" This \"way of life\" has added millions of in- dividual records to the files. It has also brought the credit-bureau system under scrutiny by the House Government Opera- tions Subcommittee, which is currently studying invasion of privacy. WIAT'S GIVEN OUT? When a credit-grantor asks about you, if you've always paid your bills promptly, the information given from your file may be only your name, address, marital status and bank references, plus a notation of your bill-paying habits. But if you plan to charge a large amount, buy on tle installment plan, borrow money, rent an apartment, or perhaps if you seek a now job, more Information about you will be requested. Then the bureau may sup- ply, from your file, data on such things as: your job, how long you have hold it, a record of past employment; your monthly salary (or approximation thereof); number of depend- ents; your living accommodations-owned or long you have lived there; your approximate bank-account balance; a record of loans, mortgages, installment pur- chases or other debts, and how you have paid them; any legal involvements and their results. Your file might also be used to compile personnel reports which some bureaus will make for their members. For example, a New England electronics firm recently was con- sidering an engineer for a job as assistant to the president. Ho appeared well qualified. But a credit-bureau investigator found that he had twice quit well-paid jobs to join rival companies In the same highly competitive field. The president of the electronics firm interpreted this as lack of loyal to his em- ployer. The man was not hired. Bureaus normally do not rate your credit: they supply facts on which the credit-granter can make his own decision. There might, for example, be a notation without comment in a man's file that he is paying off loans on three automobiles In the family-a relevant fact if his circumstances appear to warrant only one or two. Or there might be a notation that he is-or is about to be-divorced. A store credit manager might find that important. Wives sometimes load up in department stores just before filing for divorce, running up large bills for which both husband and wife may later disclaim responsibility. Who supplies the Information? You, of course, supply certain facts when you fill out a charge-account application. The references that you name supply further information about you. Additional information comes from other local credit-granters who, when they join the bureau, agree that they will supply pertinent data on all buyers-on- credit-such things as slow-payment or non- payment habits in bill-paying, bad checks or \"overloading\" (that Is, credit purchases that seem excessive in relation to the subject's income). In addition, credit bureaus collect informa- tion on you from public records, such as real estate deeds, tax liens or court actions. Large bureaus also maintain special staffs to scan newspapers and to file pertinent data, such as obituaries, business failures or a husband's announcement that he will not be respon- sible for his wife's debts. Bank transactions are strictly confidential. But when you give your bank as a reference. you thereby authorize it to provide the bu- reau with general information to support your request for credit. Thus the bank may report that you have a checking or savingsaccount \"in the middle three-figure category\" or \"In the low four-figure category.\" Or if you have borrowed money, mortgaged your home or bought on the installment plan, the bank may provide the bureau with general infor- mation, including your repayment habits, Who Bees Your File? Credit bureaus are not regulated by law, but their members, who pay annual dues of $25 to $50, must be leglti- mate credit-sellers and agree to keep all in- formation confidential. Each credit-granter has a code number with which he must iden- tify himself to the bureau. The bureau will not automatically supply a subject's entire record, but will give out only the informa- tion needed by the credit-granter, who pays a fee for each inquiry. For example, the Credit Bureau of Greater New York maintains eight million individual files, and gets about three million inquiries a year from members, mostly by telephone, It charges a member 55 cents for \"in file\" data on a subject's paying habits and any litigation involving him, plus IL check on two of his references. If a report on the sub- ject's occupation and business connections is also requested, the price is $1.10. If a re- port on mortgage loans is wanted, the price goes up to $4.50. If the subject recently moved to Now York, the bureau will supply a credit report from his former place of resl- dence for $2.80. Special reports on prospec- tive employes or on buslness transactions cost a minimum of $10 plus expenses. In providing such data, most local credit bureaus use a standard ACBA fact form which says: \"This information has been ob- tained from sources deemed reliable, the ac- curacy of which this organization does not guarantee. The inquirer (member) has agreed to Indemnify the reporting bureau for any damage arising from misuse of this information. It must be held in strict con- fidence.\" Courts have hold that such credit information is privileged as long as it Is held confidential and not used maliciously. Despite such precautions, credit-bureau in- formation necessarily is available to a con- siderablo number of authorized persons. A large city bureau, for instance, may have 300 to 400 employes with access to some files. The Now York bureau has 3,000 credit- granters, most of whom have several em- ployes with authority to call for Informa- tion. Certain law-enforcement agencies, and some federal agencies such as the Federal Housing Administration, can get informa- tion from credit-bureau files. It is also possible for a nonmember to pay a fee and get information from many credit bureaus, if he can establish a logical busi- ness reason and will sign an agreement to keep the data confidential. Are There Mistakes? Most credit bureaus require members to agree not to reveal spe- cific data to the subject reported on. Al- though an individual cannot see his record to check Its accuracy, the bureau will give him a general idea of why he has trouble getting credit, and often will suggest ways to improve his situation. For example, the owner of a small radio shop in New Haven was recently refused a charge account at a department store because of very slow pay- ment of bills over a two-year period. He called at the credit bureau and told an in- vestigator that he had been incapacitated as the result of an automobile accident, but that he had recovered and was now back in his shop and doing well. The investigator confirmed his story, adjusted the file to show all the facts, and the department store re- stored the man's credit. In another recent case, a New Jersey man visited his local bureau and explained that his credit rating was low because he had gone bankrupt in 1961. However, he said, he had since opened a drive-in movie theater, was doing well, and wanted to get his credit upgraded. The bureau manager agreed to help, but a search of the record showed that34294 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE the man had \"forgotten\" to say that he had also gone bankrupt in 1954. (One can declare bankruptcy again, but only after seven years). A record of the apparent attempt at deception was entered In the files. One man was refused credit because his file contained an outdated record showing that he had been sued for nonpayment of a bill. The fact was that the suit had been brought 15 years earlier by a racketeering agency which sent him publications that he had never ordered. The suit had boon thrown out of court-but that information was not in the file. There have also boon instances when a man's credit was damaged because his record was confused with that of another person with a similar name. ACBA officials hold that errors, while possible, are rare, and will be adjusted immediately if brought to the bu- reau's attention. Many, but not all, bureau managers believe that etliciency, accuracy and effectiveness of credit reporting will be improved as a result of automation, which the AOBA is pushing. Pilot projects have boon started at the Dallas and Houston bureaus. The proposed ACBA network of computerized centers would, by 1972, give local bureaus (and some large grantors of credit) almost instant access to credit records across the continent. It would enable bureaus to keep files updated auto- matically with member-supplied informa- tion, help pinpoint individuals who are over- extending their credit, and reduce the cost of obtaining information for credit-grantors. How to Maintain a Good Rating. Since credit Is an increasingly important fact of life, the individual is well-advised to take his credit record seriously. Experts in the field recommend the following practices: 1. Pay all bills within 30 days or according to agreed terms. 2. If you are unable to pay bills on time because of illness or some other legitimate reason, arrange with your creditors for a delay. 3. Don't exaggerate favorable facts on credit applications, and don't omit unfavor- able facts. Honesty and sincerity are Impor- tant to credit managers. 4. If you are moving to another city, ask the local credit bureau to forward your file. It will save time and avoid complications when you open new charge accounts. 5. If you are refused credit, consult your local credit bureau. It will gladly advise you on steps to establish your credit. STRAWBERRIES FROM OREGON Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, Senator HATFIELD and I are very pleased to an- nounce that in the Senate restaurant on Friday there will be strawberries from Oregon which have been made available to us through the courtesy of Mr. R. E. Ward, assistant general manager of United Flav-R-Pac Growers, Inc., of Gresham, Ore. We both very much hope that Senators and their guests will find this product of Oregon to be as good as we are convinced that it is. We hope that it will not be the first nor the last time that they will be able to enjoy it. NATIONAL GRANGE CELEBRATES 100TH YEAR Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, last week the National Grange concluded its centennial session. It is typical of the Grange that instead of dwelling on its proud 100-year history, it looked ahead, to the problems confronting rural and urban Americans alike.As the Nation's only rural-oriented organization, the Grange correctly as- signed itself the major task during the next century of leading rural America into a more fruitful relationship with urban United States. The Grange at its national convention in Syracuse this year recorded among its goals parity of income, opportunity and public service for rural residents through the acceleration of programs geared to producing more job opportuni- ties and new medical, water and sani- tary facilities for rural areas. The 620,000-strong farm-rural orga- nization also called for a new national land policy aimed at improving rural communities and conserving natural re- sources, as well as effective farm pro- grams that include nonrecourse loans to stabilize markets and support farm com- modity prices. These goals reflect the traditional, for- ward-looking quality of the Grange. The Order of Patrons of Husbandry- Grange-was created out of the frus- tration of farmers to obtain a fair share of the Nation's economic benefits. Its ranks swelled in the 1870's as it became identified as the organization which was out to break the tenacious grip the rail- roads and other monopolies then had on the economy of the country. Grange grassroots efforts led to the so- called Granger laws, which established- through Supreme Court interpretation- the now taken-for-granted concept that the Federal Government had the right to intervene in behalf of the people whenever it appeared that corporate ac- tions endangered the public welfare. From these laws sprang the Sherman Antitrust Act and legislation creating the Interstate Commerce Commission. The rollcall of legislation fostered by the Grange embraces acts that helped mold modern America: legislation es- tablishing our current system of inter- state highways; creation of Agriculture Department services that brought much- needed technical assistance to the local farmer; establishment of our parcel post system and rural free delivery; extension of electricity and telephone service to rural America; and the basis for the his- toric Food and Agriculture Act of 1965. Connecticut has played a key role in the development of the Grange since its inception. William Saunders, the first master of the National Grange and one of its seven founders, had his first job in my State as a gardener. He later be- came superintendent of propagating gardens for the Agriculture Department and his office became the founding site of the Grange. Furthermore, Mr. President, our State master, Kingsley Beecher, of Winsted, last week was elected a national officer- assistant steward-of the National Grange. In addition, Mrs. Donald K. Peck, of Litchfield, is the longtime and able national director of women's ac- tivities-formerly known as the home economics committee-for the National Grange. In terms of membership, Connecticut ranks eighth among the 38 States which have State granges, with 27,158 mem- bers in 186 granges.Mr. President, I would like to take thisopportunity not only to commend the National Grange and the Connecticut State Grange and its local granges for their outstanding contributions to this country, but I would like to extend to the National Grange, on its 100th birthday December 4, best wishes for an equally productive second century of service. REFERENDUM SHOWS THE AMERI- CAN PEOPLE DO NOT SUPPORT WITHDRAWAL FROM VIETNAM IFIT MEANS THE REWARDING OF COMMUNIST AGGRESSION Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. Presi- dent, for those who wonder aloud what the position of the American electorate is on the American presence in Vietnam, the recent vote in Cambridge, Mass., and an earlier vote in San Francisco, Calif., should answer all questions. Voters in Cambridge recently voted 3 to 2 against withdrawal. In San Fran- cisco, a similar proposal on ceasefire and withdrawal was soundly beaten 2 to 1in early November. The consensus is clear. The vast ma- jority of American voters support Amer- ica's continued commitment. The vast majority of Americans are demonstrating with their votes and their voices that America's obligations will bekept. The vast majority-the so-called silent center-is making its desires known. It is significant that Cambridge, Mass., is a university center, and this is where we have told that the great dissent istaking place across America. What do the dissenters say now, whenone of their own university centers has, in effect, voted strong support for Presi- dent Johnson's Vietnam policies? In my opinion, this vote merely re- affirms the fact that the United States will not be bluffed out or talked out of its commitment to freedom. And I take these votes in Cambridge and San Fran- cisco to be concrete proof of that fact. FOREIGN POLICY AND TRADE RELATIONS Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, Mr. Wil- liam Janeway has written for the Spec- tator magazine of November 3 a thought- ful article on the manner in which the administration has chosen to deal with both Congress and the rest of the world in the area of our foreign policy and trade relations. Mr. Janeway has seen the gap between what the administration has said it was doing in these fields and what has in fact been achieved. I ask unani- mous consent that the article be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the REC- ORD, as follows: AMERICA: BARRIERS UP (By William Janeway) Four months after the conclusion of the Kennedy Round trade negotiations, the Finance Committee of the United States Sen- ate is considering a sheaf of bills which would impose quota restrictions on nearly 40 per cent of American imports. William Roth, the President's Special Representative34295 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 for Trade Negotiations, reflected general Ad- ministration concern when he warned that the bills could undo what was accomplished at Geneva and even reverse the postwar trend towards freer trade. Backing him up, five Cabinet members, starting with Dean Rusk, have been sent up to Capitol Hill to testify against the proposed legislation and the Pres- ident has put his own prestige directly on the line with a diatribe against Congres- sional protectionism. The White House, in fact, has panicked. Three circumstances account for the fact: the nature of the sponsorship of the legis- lation; the case set forth by the sponsors; and, above all, the wider issue which the fight over trade liberalization has raised. The legislation before the Finance Committee is the joint product of Senator Everett Dirk- sen-Republican leader, Vietnam Hawk and the President's one remaining envoy to Con- gress-and Senator Vance Hartke-a Great Society Democrat whose opposition to the Vietnam escalation is as explicit as is his position among those Democrats from whom the President has deliberately dissociated himself. In both policy and political terms, the union of Dirksen and Hartke constitutes a consensus. Moreover, trade liberalisation Is an issue on which the Administration is vulnerable. The Trade Expansion Act 1962, under whose aegis the GATT Kennedy Round talks on tariff reductions were held, and agreement eventually reached, was grossly oversold throughout its five year statutory life. First, Britain's exclusion from the Common Mar- ket made irrelevant its one truly revolution- ary provision, under which the President was empowered to eliminate tariffs entirely on goods of which more than 80 per cent of world trade was accounted for by the US and the EEC. The relatively minor reductions in tariffs on manufactured goods which were finally negotiated came as a triple disappoint- ment: the size of the proposed cuts were far less than had been promised over the years; no progress at all was made in freeing agricultural trade where the US could only gain and where the Administration had fully committed itself to Congress; and, even to get the agreement which was reached, the executive branch had to commit the legisla- tive branch to reduce, on a non quid pro quo basis, America's non-tariff barriers to trade. The gap between the Kennedy-Johnson Administration's promise to revolutionise trade relations and its actual performance has engendered a belief in Congress that the Executive gave up interest after interest in Geneva in order to gain an agreement, any agreement, which could be claimed as a vic- tory. Three additional factors contribute as well to the strength of the Finance Commit- tee's case. The first is the latent protection- ism always present to some degree in Con- gress. The second is the dramatic rise in imports of such basic industrial commodities as steel products, whose American producers are well organised to influence Congress on both the labour and management sides. And the third is the growing recognition that the orthodox commitment to free trade is in- creasingly irrelevant: cartel-oriented, na- tionally backed competitors in Europe and Japan do not accept the principles of free trade; the haphazard integration of the western economy thanks to American foreign investment raises problems undreamt of by the theoreticians of free trade; and, as well, the needs of the developing countries appear to require some sort of specific trade dis- crimination in their favour. Thus the specifics of the challenge with which the Administration must deal grow out of disillusionment with the Administra- tion's handling of trade liberalisation, plus old-fashioned protectionism and, in addition, a more sophisticated view of the problems of trade policy today. But the varied merits of the Finance Committee's case cannot aloneaccount for its sweeping acceptance to date. As with every other political and economic issue in Johnson's America, the underlying significance of the struggle over trade libera- lization grows out of the Vietnam war. What Dirksen and Hartke have done, in fact, is to identify a major issue of foreign policy on which every member of Congress may feel free to assert the legitimate pre- rogatives and responsibilities of the legisla- tive branch, as many cannot feel free to do on Vietnam itself. The depth and extent of the Congressional revolt against two years of unilateral Presidential foreign policy-making may be measured by the response to the Dirk- sen-Hartke initiative. The immediate threat to Britain and to the world due to the outbreak of economic na- tionalism in America depends upon two open questions: what sort of restrictive trade leg- islation (and some legislation seems certain) is finally passed and whether or not the President will veto such legislation despite the political pressures of an election year. It is at least conceivable that the Congressional revolt could make the Kennedy Round agree- ment a dead letter before any major party to it, besides the United States, has formally adhered to it. For the longer term, Britain and the Free World are on notice that eco- nomic nationalism is on the rise in America, the product of the isolationism which the President has chosen for himself vis-a-vis Congress and which he has imposed upon America vis-a-vis the rest of the world. Cer- tainly the prospects for further trade libera- lisation or for any such new departures as Atlantic Free Trade appear now to be non- existent. THE RISING PRICE OF PROTECTIONISM Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I invite the attention of the Senate to an excel- lent editorial, entitled \"The Rising Price of Protectionism,\" published in the No- vember 24 issue of the Wall Street Jour- nal. The editorial shows the very impor- tant connection between the stability of the dollar and the drive for import quo- tas on textiles, steel, lead and zinc, dairy products, and other commodities. Not only would they endanger our trade sur- plus by inviting retaliation by other countries against our export but, as the editorial puts it: Foreign countries would be likely to re- gard the import curbs, at this particular time, as a desperate measure to defend the dollar. Their confidence in America's currency, far from rock-solid as it is, would be further weakened. The editorial further states that pro- tectionist legislation would also weaken the already fragile ties among Western nations and weaken confidence in dem- ocratic governments as \"one special in- terest after another is able to persuade government to do its bidding.\" I strongly urge Senators that before we embark on an extremely dangerous road toward dismantling our trade policy and nullifying the Kennedy round-the results of which were sent to Congress by the President yesterday-let us carefully consider what the consequences would be for our Nation and our people. I ask unanimous consent that the Wall Street Journal editorial be printed in the RECORD. I also ask unanimous consent that the President's message, transmitting a copy of the multilateral trade agreementsigned in Geneva this June and sum.marizing the great benefits that these ne-gotiations can be expected to bring to thisNation over the next 5 years, be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the REcoaD,as follows: [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 24, 1967] THE RISING PRICE OF PROTECTIONISM Britain's devaluation of the pound provides a fresh reason to resist the pleas of the steel textile and other industries for new importquotas. It points up the fact that a plunge back into protectionism could have repercus- sions that are not solely economic. The economic impact alone could be bad enough. In fact it's rather ironic that Con. gress can resist the Administration's tax sur- charge plan and at the same time seriously consider imposing hidden taxes on con- sumers, taxes paid through the higher pricesthat import restrictions would bring. There is, moreover, no getting around thetruth that the curbs amount to subsidies to certain favored domestic Industries. Either quotas or tariffs tend to distort markets, pro- mote misallocation of resources and lessen the pressures for increasing industrial effi- ciency. With the pound's devaluation raising ques- tions about the stability of the dollar, a move to curb imports .would also attack what has up to now been the strongest element in America's international accounts, its excess of exports over imports. Other nations would be sure to retaliate with restrictions against exports from the U.S.; some are already planning steps they would take. Outside the area of pure economics, foreign countries would be likely to regard the im- port curbs, at this particular time, as a desperate measure to defend the dollar. Their confidence in America's currency, far from rock-solid as it is, would be further weakened. On a political level, a stepup in interna- tional trade warfare-and that's exactly what the protectionists are inviting-would fray the already fragile ties among Western na- tions. The friendlier the trade relations among countries, the easier it is for them to work together in other endeavors. Besides the heavy economic costs at home, a new outburst of protectionism could, if pushed far enough, actually weaken our na- tion's democratic principles. A system of import quotas, after all, usu- ally does not evolve from any thoughtful, overall study of a nation's economic condi- tion. Instead it grows willy-nilly as one spe- cial-interest group after another is able to persuade government to do its bidding. Government thus takes on one of the as- pects of totalitarianism: Blatant economic discrimination. In a number of countries in recent years, trade favors have been won not merely by loud and persistent lobbying but by covert payoffs. Such a situation may seem remote for the U.S., but when any government has valuable privileges to dis- pense, the danger of corruption cannot be completely dismissed. Then, too, trade restrictions can dis- criminate in favor of certain areas of a country, since a region often specializes in one or more favored products. Canada, for instance, has tried to protect the industries of Ontario and Quebec; this has led to bar- riers against Canadian exports, making it more difficult for other, raw-material-pro- ducing provinces to sell abroad. The result has been, in some degree, disruptive of Cana- dian unity. Even so, a move toward protectionism, once started, is often difficult to reverse. Do- mestic oil producers already are shielded by a quota system; now they would like stronger barriers. The textile industry al-34296 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE ready has quotas on cotton goods; now it wants to extend them to practically all its products. Congressmen, being human, can find the pressure pretty heavy. Many of the adverse effects of import quotas are not easy to see, and the impact on consumers is spread over millions of Americans, touching few of them hard enough to get them to fire off letters to their lawmakers. The pro-quota forces, on the other hand, are well-organized and financed and lobbying powerfully. Members of Congress, however, supposedly represent all the people, not a few favored industries. We can only hope they will recog- nize that protectionism's price, too high in any case, now has become more prohibitive still, To the Congress of the United States: I am pleased to transmit to the Congress, pursuant to Section 226 of the Trade Expan- sion Act of 1962, a copy of the multilateral trade agreement signed in Geneva on June 30, 1967. The agreement brings to a successful conclusion what we all know as the Kennedy Round of trade negotiations. It fulfills the purposes and high hopes of the Trade Ex- pansion Act passed by the Congress in 1962. The documents contain a mass of detail. On paper those details appear dry and tech- nical. In reality they represent new factories, more jobs, lower prices to consumers, and higher Incomes for American workers and for our trading partners throughout the world. These decisions recorded in these docu- ments rest on solid experience. The remark- able post-war expansion of international trade brought strength and growth to the free world economy. It enriched the lives of people everywhere-and thus it served the cause of peace. We and our trading partners had an enormous stake in the further re- moval of trade barriers. Trade expansion would continue to benefit us all-the more so because of our growing prosperity. Protec- tionism and trade wars would hurt us all- the more so because of our growing inter- dependence. This report celebrates the wisdom of these decisions and the success of this tremendous effort. As a consequence, international trade can continue to be the world's biggest growth industry. We must continue to provide lead- ership in international trade policy to realize its vast potentialities and share fully in its benefits. The results of the trade negotiations are of unprecedented scale. We received tariff concessions from other countries on between $71/2 to $8 billion of our industrial and agri- cultural exports. We reduced duties on about the same volume of our imports. The gains will be even greater in future years as world trade grows. In approaching the trade negotiations, two fundamental standards governed our actions. First, we sought-and achieved-reciproc- ity in trade concessions. Our consumers will benefit by lower import costs. Our export industries will benefit by greater market op- portunities abroad. Second, we sought to safeguard domestic industries that were especially vulnerable to import competition. We accomplished this through procedures worked out in accord- ance with guidelines wisely established by Congress in the Trade Expansion Act. On October 21, 1963, we issued the first of a series of public notices of our intention to negotiate. Public hearings were held by the Tariff Commission and by the interagency Trade Information Committee. From these hearings, and from special studies carried out by the Office of Emergency Planning, we were given advice on each article under review for possible concession. When this expert examination revealed that a particular in- dustrial and agricultural product was ex-ceptionally vulnerable to import competition, it was withheld from negotiation. These background studies also guided our nego- tiators in determining how large a concession we could reasonably make on each item. Because of the care exercised in these preparations, the selectivity with which re- deductions were made, and the fact that most of these reductions will come into effect gradually over a 5-year period, we can be as- sured that the vital interests of American labor, agriculture and industry have been safeguarded. Throughout the negotiations my Special Representative for Trade Negotiations worked closely with the bipartisan Congressional Advisors. The thoroughness of our preparation has borne fruit. As we made many concessions, so did our leading trading partners-the West European nations, Canada, and Japan. The major features of the basic agreement illustrate its depth and potential benefits. Tariff cuts of 30% to 50% on a very broad range of industrial goods. For example: Canada reduced tariffs on a wide range of machinery from 22.5% to 15%, on metal furniture from 25% to 17.5%, and on coal from 10% to zero. Japan cut tariffs on bearings and parts from 25% to 12.5% and various types of radio transmission apparatus and parts from 20% to 10%. Great Britain cut its tariffs on American electric typewriters from 16% to 7.5%, on circuit breakers from 16% to 8%, and on air conditioners from 12% to 7.5%. The nations of the European Economic Community cut tariffs on U.S. pumps and compressors from 12% to 6%, on refrigerat- ing equipment from 10% to 5%, and on au- tomobiles from 22% to 11%. Agricultural concessions that will open new trading opportunities for our farmers and set a valuable precedent for bringing the benefits of competition to world agricultural trade. For example: Canada eliminated all tariffs on American apples, halved its tariff on orange and grape- fruit juice from 10% to 5%, reduced its tariff on tallow from 17.5% to 10%. Japan reduced its tariff on soybeans from 13% to 6%, on turkey from 20% to 15%, and on prunes from 15% to 10%. The European Economic Community cut tariffs on dried peas and beans from 9% to 4.5%, on variety meats from 20% to 14%, and on unmanufactured tobacco from 28% to 23%. Great Britain cut duties on soybeans from 5% to zero, on variety meats from 20% to 10%, and on raisins from 7.5% to 3.5%. We gave comparable concessions on a wide range of products that we import. From them, we will gain the opportunity to choose from a wider variety of consumer goods, in- dustrial materials, and capital equipment at lower prices. Other parts of the Geneva agreement will also promote trade and encourage economic growth in all free world nations. These are: The basic elements of a world grains ar- rangement. This understanding provides for higher minimum trading prices and a pro- gram under which other nations will join us in the task of supplying food aid to the un- dernourished people in many of the develop- ing nations. A significant accord on antidumping pro- cedures. This accord-consistent with exist- ing American law-binds our trading part- ners to insure fair procedures to American exporters, while safeguarding American in- dustry. Progress in dealing with particular com- modity groups. A 3-year extension of the Long Term Cotton Textile Arrangement was concluded. Useful approaches were developed in negotiating tariffs for steel, aluminum, chemicals, pulp and paper. A separate bargain on the American SellingPrice issue. The U.S. stands to gain additional tariff concessions on chemical exports and liberalization of some European non-tariff barriers in exchange for abolishing the Ameri- can Selling Price System of valuating certain chemicals. This package will require special legislation. Significant benefits to the developing countries. Those countries will get help from the food aid provision of the grains arrange- ment and from concessions they received from all industrial countries on export prod- ucts of particular interest to them. Each member of the Congress has already received a copy of the Report on United States Negotiations. This report summarizes the concessions granted by other countries and the results of special multilateral nego- tiations in the Kennedy Round. It also lists all tariff concessions granted by the United States in the Kennedy Round. An additional report will soon be transmitted showing the tariff concessions each of the major Kennedy Round participants granted on principal commodity groups in the negotiations. I expect to issue a proclamation shortly making the reductions in the United States tariffs effective beginning on January 1, 1968. I shall seek the advice and consent of the Senate regarding United States participation in the World Grains Arrangement. Interna- tional agreement on this arrangement was recently reached in Rome as a consequence of the understanding on grains negotiated in the Kennedy Round. Finally, I shall submit to the Congress a Trade Bill to make effective the American Selling Price agreement in the Kennedy Round, to revise the Adjustment Assistance Program for firms and workers, and to pro- vide authority that will enable us to make further progress in promoting world trade. The Geneva Conference set a solid record of achievement, unmatched in world trade history for its constructive and beneficial re- sults. The results represent a monument not only to our late President who gave the nego- tiations his name, but also to another great American, the late Governor Christian A. Herter, whose inspiration and leadership guided us through the difficult first three years of negotiations. I commend this agreement and these re- ports to your attention. LYNDON B. JOHNSON. THE WHITE HousE. SENATOR CHURCH'S AMENDMENT TO THE FOREIGN AID BILL Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, I was pleased to see a news item by Mr. Sam Ochiltree, published in the Idaho Daily Statesman of November 2, concerning the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Idaho [Mr. CHURCH] to the foreign aid bill. It is encouraging to know that the efforts of Senator CHURCH to reduce world tensions by bringing the arms sales program under control have not gone unnoticed in his home State press. His dedication, per- severance, and hard work paid off in what I consider to be one of the most significant changes Congress has ever made in the foreign aid program. I might add that the Senator from Idaho was also instrumental in cutting back very substantially the amounts re- quested for military assistance and sup- porting assistance. He has rendered yeoman service in bringing about a more effective and economical aid program, geared to the realities of the world and the needs of our own society. I ask unanimous consent that the34297 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 article from the Idaho Daily Statesman be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: CHURCH OUTRACES LOBBY IN SEEKING TO CURB SALES OF WEAPONS TO NEUTRALS (By Tom Ochiltree) WASHINGTON.-Despite the pressure of ad- ministration lobbyists, Sen. Frank Church, D-Idaho, appeared Wednesday to have a good chance of winning a major victory in his campaign to check the sale of American arms to under-developed countries. It seems now that the Senate is deter- mined to dig in its heels and insist that the House accept Church's amendment abolish- ing the Defense Department's $383-million revolving arms sales credit fund. Sen. J. William Fulbright, D-Ark, chair- man of the Senate Foreign Relations Com- mittee, said so far as he is concerned he would rather have no foreign aid authoriza- tion bill at all than give way on this point. SUPPORT PLEASES Aides said Church, presently engaged in courthouse conferences with constituents in Idaho, was pleased at this support from Fulbright. The Senate conferees, of whom Church is one, had offered to agree to postpone liquida- tion of the revolving fund from Dec. 31 to next June 30, but this was turned down by the House conferees. Congressional liaison men from the State Department and the Pentagon have urged restoration of various Senate cuts in mili- tary assistance and have directed their heavi- est fire at Church's amendment. They have convinced the House conferees that aboli- tion of the revolving fund would mean that countries in Latin America, the Middle East and elsewhere would turn to foreign arms and that United States influence would de- cline in those areas. SENATE PASSES BILL The Senate passed the foreign aid authori- zation bill on Aug. 17 after a debate that revealed particularly strong support for Church's amendment. The House version, passed on Aug. 24, provided for the revolving fund. Conferees from the two chambers have met 10 times. They have split the difference in the total authorization between the Sen- ate's $2.6 billion and the House's $2.8 billion to arrive at a figure of $2.7 billion. But they remain hung up on various as- pects of arms aid and particularly on the revolving fund amendment. If the revolving fund ultimately is dropped, the result would be to kill the Pentagon's program of using the export im- port bank to finance arms sales to under- developed countries. Pentagon and state de- partment sources have argued that foreign nations cannot borrow money for American arms on their own and that the loans must be guaranteed. EISENHOWER AND BRADLEY ON VIETNAM Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. Presi- dent, last evening the Columbia Broad- casting System presented a special pro- gram entitled \"Who, What, When, Where, Why,\" which took the form of an interview with former President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Gen. Omar N. Bradley on the Vietnam conflict. I ask unanimous consent that a verbatim transcript of this interesting and enlightening program be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the tran-script was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY: EISEN- HOWER AND BRADLEY ON VIETNAM (Broadcast over the CBS Television Network, November 28, 1967) Reporter: Harry Reasoner. Executive producer: Burton Benjamin. REASONER. The two men you see walking behind me are the only living Five-Star Gen- erals in the United States Army. Dwight D. Eisenhower, the 34th President of the United States, was the Supreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary Force in Europe during World War II. His West Point classmate in 1915, Omar N. Bradley was the GI's General, in Africa, Sicily, Normandy and on to Victory in Germany. General Bradley has just re- turned from Vietnam. In the former Presi- dent's office, in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, we talked to Generals Eisenhower and Brad- ley about Vietnam. Gentlemen, most conversations about Vietnam, these days, begin with a classifica- tion of the people talking ... Would you say you were Hawks or Doves, Mr. President? EISENHOWER. I'm neither, and I'm certain that General Bradley isn't. As a matter of fact, I don't believe our country is ... And that's the reason I deprecate the use of the word for the individual. A \"Hawk\" is a predator, and neither the Individual nor the United States wants to seize somebody else's property; and a \"Dove\" is usually a helpless prey of a predator. I don't want to be either. REASONER. Would you agree, General Brad- ley? General BRADLEY. Yes, sir, I do. Exactly. REASONER. What about this new Commit- tee that I believe you're Co-Chairman of, General Bradley. It's called the \"Committee For Peace With Freedom\"? BRADLEY. Well, some of us have felt for some time that the whole picture is not being presented to the American Public. The ten- dency in news is to print the sensational and the bad ...I suppose that's what peo- ple buy papers for, or listen to TV about. But they leave out the good part of the War, and why we're fighting, and what we're fight- ing for-and morale of the men ..The good parts they don't print. We think the Committee can do some good. REASONER. Would you say, Mr. President, that this was the most unpopular war this country's ever had? EISENHOWER. Well, I think in many ways it is. But remember this, we have not de- clared it a war, and therefore all discussion can be very argumentative and is completely free. ...Historically, look at the number of people that were killed in New York City during the Civil War in resisting the Draft. S. And there was a tremendous movement for Peace in the North ...And if what you aptly call the \"Doves\" of that day, if they'd have had their way, why we'd have been a fragmented continent, and certainly no na- tion like we are today. REASONER. As well as the war being some- what unpopular ...A lot of polls indicate that people don't approve of the way the President is handling it. Assuming we've got the war, do you think he's handling it prop- erly? EISENHOWER. I don't believe anyone is in a position, that isn't living this problem all the time, to criticize in detail the conduct of this war. Now General Bradley and I had quite a bit to do with one war, and both of us have been criticized, I think, for what we did or didn't do. But these critics didn't know the problem. They didn't know what the situations were then, and none of us, I think, can really live this thing ...But I do know this, that there are always going to be critics of the conduct of the war, during it and after it's done .... And I think that most of 'em would be better advised to waitand look for the facts, and do more think- ing, rather than talking. REASONER. I'd like to get back to the his- tory of this for a moment, Mr. President. One of the things we hear a lot about is your famous 1954 letter to President Diem, offer- ing help. EISENHOWER. Yes. REASONER. How did you see that at the time? Did you envisage a military operation? EISENHOWER. Well, I didn't at that time.... For this reason: Laos was causing much more trouble than Vietnam, and when I turned over to President Kennedy, I had two long talks with him about that situation. But at that time, Vietnam was not giving us real concern. Except that Diem-he believed in Nepotism. He trusted his sister-in-law and his brother, and that's about all the people he would talk to. And we were trying to cor- rect that situation. Otherwise, we weren't go- ing to worry at that time. REASONER. I think there's another thing that's been confused in people's minds .. . the fact that we did not sign the Geneva Accords. EISENHOWER. Well, this has been called a great mistake. Actually, we, at Geneva, pledged in good faith, that we would sup- port the decisions reached there, about the protection of this particular-or this general area. But I, after talking with Foster Dulles, I suggested to him, myself, that we not sign it. Because I didn't want to put my name on some paper that was surrendering a con- siderable area, and it is a considerable area, to the Communists. And I believed that would provoke 'em only to further action. And while people like to-to deprecate and make fun of the so-called \"Domino Theory\", I think there is no question, whatsoever, that any success with the Communists just breeds the opportunity for the next success. And you can see where that could happen in Asia, if we let it go. REASONER. After the Geneva Accords, when the elections were scheduled in 1956, the assumption was that Ho Chi Minh would have won by about 80% of the vote. We were probably instrumental in seeing that those elections were not held. Was that the reason, Sir? EISENHOWER. Well, I think it was really Diem, himself. Like we said, it just wasn't time. But I think we agreed to it. But there's this about it, at that time we had a dictator that was now controlling more than half the country. And with a great deal of his population, he would get 100% of the vote. Now, Diem would have to take the elec- tions-absolutely free, and so therefore the whole thing would probably be free. Now, on the surface, they might have been free all across the country, but not with the Communists operating as they do, in the areas they were then occupying. REASONER. I think that one thing that puzzles a great many people is that we don't even have any agreement among the Gen- erals on the war now. We've got a couple of Generals here, that are in agreement. But a number of your colleagues, General Bradley, are \"Dovish\", or at least would disagree with your views. How do you explain that division among professional military men? BRADLEY. Well, I don't think they under- stand it. Our whole public is confused about this war, and I think that includes some of the Generals. I know I just could not vis- ualize the situation until I went over there. ..The first thing that strikes you, is how you get round. You used to jump in a jeep or something, now you go everywhere by helicopter. ... You fly, and you come down and land in a place held by our troops, and maybe with VC all around-a considerable distance, or close, as the case may be-and you don't just get out and go up to a front line and say, \"Well, over there is the enemy, and here are friendly troops\". You do that in little spots, yes, but you just don't know34298 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE where the enemy is. And that, to me, was the first thing that hit me. You used to get good intelligence reports, the enemy was in such and such a place, and he was usin' such and such loads, and so on. Now, your intelligence reports are very piecemeal. You have to put 'em all together, and try to find out where there is a battalion, and to go out and try to locate him and scatter him. But it's just confusion, even on the battle-field. In a way. Of course, they know what they're doing. But I mean, when you first look at it, for an observer, you say, \"Well, what's going on?\" ..And then you dig into it and you find out ...We're used to seeing progress on a map. For example, when President Elsenhower and I were in Europe, our map was probably published in the papers every day. You could see it going forward. That's a great satisfaction, to have to move your command posts forward. But over here, you don't do that. You don't have a line, but your progress is marked by the fact that you're placing more and more of the popu- lation under Government control. And you make it more and more difficult for the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese to function effectively ... It's just going to take pa- tience. We don't have much patience in this country. We're used to getting things done in a whale of a hurry. And you can't do it that fast over there. REASONER. I suppose one of the problems is fighting it out in the open. Would you have been handicapped, for instance, if you'd had to announce your troop strength on D Day? EISENHOWER. My Goodness! Or your plans, or anything else? Man-or when you're re- placements are coming, or when you're rein- forcements are coming? Why of course you'd be handicapped. Matter of fact, in war, there is certainly one truism that is still correct; and that is, \"never tell your enemy any- thing.\" And if you have to tell anything publicly, to us, today the enemy can see it in his dispatches of that evening. Our reinforce- ments, or what we intend to do, or what our new weapons are, and anything else. I've never-I'd certainly had someone before a court if that'd ever happened in my Theatrel REASONER. Is that an argument, sir, for having Congress declare war now? EISENHOWER. Well, I think, here-I-I-I've proposed a question once in awhile. Some peo- ple have said I advocated it, and I don't. Be- cause I'm not intimate enough with the polit- ical dangers and risks that the other people see. Now, I will tell you this ...I-I dis- count any attempt of either Russia or China coming into this war on a major basis. I dis- count it because Communists operate on the basis of their own plans. Whether they be ag- gressive, or for the moment they want to be quiescent-whatever. They do not do this by reaction, or some firm action they see else- where. REASONER. Mr. President, you said you can't fight a war with \"gradualism.\" How do you mean that, sir? EISENHOWER. The first principle of war is to win quickly, because it's the time that you're engaged in the thing that brings about the costs and particularly in blood as well as treasury. And I think that if you're going to appeal to force, and disregard all interna- tional means of getting this thing settled, then get all the force you can as quickly as you can. REASONER. You'd feel it was possible, then, sir, to win the war-militarily. .. .Of course, some people say you can never win ...? EISENHOWER. YOU know we've had defeat- ists In every war we've ever had. If you go back to 1942, just after Tobruk had fallen, and Bataan had fallen, why the people in this country-Look, I was then Operations Officer In the War Department, and we had cities sending in telegram after telegram- hysterically calling for aircraft defenses. They were just shouting for Regiments of CXIII-2160-Part 25Anti-Aircraft artillery. We didn't have any. But nonetheless, that was the kind of thing that happens. And people say, \"Oh, you can't win. What are we going to do? Better stop right here!\" Well, that's silly. And I say, of course they can do it .... I talked to Gen- eral Westmoreland just a couple of days ago. And he pointed out, even when he got his earlier forces, when he got up to 184,000, he didn't have any logistic or what the soldiers call \"infra-structure.\" He didn't have it set up. So he had to spend his first Army in de- veloping the necessary logistic arrange- ments. He has now six deep ports. And he has even pipelines, running from the Coast up to the places where he might have to concentrate, and he's got a splendid logistic range-system ...and now, the soldiers that he gets are fighting, because he's got this already preparatory work that-all through 1965, apparently occupied most of his soldier's and most of his time. BRADLEY. Seeing all this base he's built up caused me to suggest that we invite Ho Chi Minh down and let him see all of this fine base we're working from. I think he'd be very discouraged ... if he really had a truthful report about what we have now, ready to function from. REASONER. It's all true, isn't it, sir, that our Vietnamese don't fight as well as their Vietnamese. Why is that? BRADLEY. I wouldn't say that. I don't think that's an accurate assumption ...No, we always give credit to the VC, for example, for being such terrific fighters, and we say that sometimes about Communists in other places. They seem to be more Imbued with desire for success than our people. I don't think it's necessarily so. The South Viet- namese are making good soldiers. They're fighting for their country. EISENHOWER. Not only do I agree with that, but I want to point out this ...All reports, including Bradley's from out there, talk about the wonderful morale of our soldiers. Now, we've always thought that the morale of an Army, a fighting Army was supported by the enthusiasm and the sound support of its population. Now, they are giving us all an example, of Fortitude, Cour- age and Gallantry. In doing things that they believe are necessary. And you find in every one of their letters-and I get quite a few of 'em myself-and they are talking about \"We know what we are doing, but we don't understand about these 'kooks' and 'hippies' and all the rest\" that are talking about surrendering-get out of this country. They're-I think that their morale is something that most of us ought to think about a little bit more, and remember the sacrifices that they are making. REASONER. General Bradley, I want to get back to the war itself for a moment. What about the bombing, sir? Isn't it true that bombing has never really won a battle? BRADLEY. Bombing in itself. But it's a great contribution to your ground results. For example they estimate that at least 500,000 people are being kept busy in North Vietnam, manning the guns, supplying them, and repairing the damage. Well, if they weren't being diverted doing that, they might be coming down the trail to act as ground troops. And furthermore, they're having to fire, they estimate over there, that a hundred times as much ammunition is fired at our planes as is fired at our .. . as on the ground ...You can multiply the ground fire by 100 and you also have some more troubles. And they can't get those supplies down as quickly as they can. They lose a lot of trucks and cars and they have to haul a lot of it by hand. Carry it on their backs. All of that reduces the amount of effort against our ground troops, which after all, is where we will eventually be success- ful-or I suggest that we usually are. It's usually the ground action that's decisive.But the air makes a great contribution to their success. It always does. REASONER. Mr. President, we've had a series of quite optimistic statements lately, Gen- eral Westmoreland, Ambassador Bunker, and some others. There have been periods like this before, when the Government exuded optimism. Do you think that's helped to con- fuse the American people? EISENHOWER. The predictions are probably honest, when the man makes them. But it's just a dangerous thing to do. But now, you notice these last predictions of Westmore- land, and what we've been hearing these last few days: They say, \"In two years, we'll be seeing the end of their final deterioration\"- that is the beginning of the end... And this is a very cautious prediction, I should think. Because they are making real progress. But I think the-very glowing predictions made a couple of years ago, here and there, and this came from some Generals, I think, as well as some civilians, I think that did help to confuse the Americans very much. REASONER. Mr. President, I wonder about the effect on the nation of a long period of war, or preparation for war. And I think back to your final address where you warned about the dangers of a military-industrial complex. Has that danger been increased by the Vietnamese war? EISENHOWER. Well, of course it has. We have lived so long that the thing we must remember is that we must not become a Garrison state ...Now, strangely enough, this little talk that I made, has caused, I think, so far as I'm concerned, more cor- respondence, and more questions. But the fact is, when you've got a manufacturer, who is wholly dependent upon military supplies, and you have a Congressman, each wanting a military facility in his own District. When you've got the military forces, in order to get on with the job, each wanting more of its particular kind of a thing, you have a tremendous influence in this country. We don't like what we see happening; but the fact is we have to do it. And all I was urging, and still urge, is that for the average citizen to watch what is happening, and seeing whether he's being bulldozed a little bit-or confused, if you want to put it that way, but also we have a whole horde of Americans who are being advantaged by being so deep in this war-like effort. REASONER. General Bradley, what do we do now? Do we go on doing what we're do- ing? Is there something else we could be doing? BRADLEY. Well, I think so. Unless we want to declare war and go and invade North Viet- nam, and I don't think any of us are in favor of that. I sometimes think we talk too much about trying to get them to the negoti- ating table. I think we should say that once, and then shut up. Because they take it as a sign of weakness. They think we're in a bad way. And intelligence indicates that's what's keepin' 'em going, is the attitude here in the States; which is similar to the movement that started in France-opposition to the war, it grew and grew, until finally France got out of Vietnam. They're counting on the same thing here. And I just don't believe the American people are that weak. I think their fiber is stronger than that, they're not going to give up and get out. And, as soon as the Communists realize that, maybe we will have a stop-cessation in the fighting. EISENHOWER. YOU know, Harry, one other thing. This respecting of boundary lines on a map. I think you can overdo it. Now we don't want to invade North Vietnam and destroy it, but they're right down in the DMZ and right north of it, and now it seems to me, If we wanted, to put on an operation that would get this menace eliminated, I think this wouldn't be invading-then this would be removing a thorn in our sides. That's the way I look at-war-I think you do too. BRADLEY. In other words, you're suggesting,34299 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 one operation might be to make an end run around-the DMZ-and knock their artillery out-- EISENHOWER. That's right, either from the sea, or from the hills- BRADLEY. -from the hills. In other words they didn't respect the DMZ that was put in there and everybody was supposed to stay out of there. They disregarded that agree- ment and they came on through and built up in it, and shoot over it right behind the protection-maybe we should-who with. I'm not saying let's do It, but it's something we certainly have to consider-- EISENHOWER. NO ...But what I'm say- ing is, that sort of sacrosanct idea of a line on the ground that no one can see, but it's on your maps, and you must respect it in- to the ultimate ...This, I just don't agree with ...and this is not an invasion, this is just removing an annoyance, and a menace. Now, I don't care where this happens. As far as I'm concerned, I would be for what we call \"hot pursuit\", even in the air-if- BRADLEY. Or on the ground? EISENHOWER. Hm? Or on the ground, that's right. And if you're chasing some people and they just step over into Cambodia or Laos, I wouldn't-it wouldn't bother me. I'd go at 'em as long as they'd come in there in the first place. And in the same way, the air. If an airplane attacked me, and we wanted to chase him, I'd go in wherever his base was. As far as I'm concerned. REASONER. Including China? EISENHOWER. Yes, Wherever his base comes. As a matter of fact ...This was the first .difference that I told 'em we would make in the Korean War, unless that- Armistice was promptly signed, then we were going to do this ...And I think it's just only defense-self-defense, that all it is ... If you come in my house, to do some- burglarize me-and I start chasin' you, I-I think I got to chase you anywhere as long as I know you're the guy ... That's what I think here. REASONER. Thinking back to Korea, Mr. President brings up another question. A lot of people think that Ho Chi Minh is waiting for next year's election. And they believe that in the case of Korea you were able to do things to settle the war that the incumbent couldn't have done or another Democrat couldn't have done. Do you think that there will be a change in the war as a result of our election? EISENHOWER. I would doubt it. I'll tell you ...This is what I believe .. .I think that a thing that has gone on in the Inter- national World, I don't care what the prob- lem is, if it's gone on for months, and been tacitly accepted by everybody, it's pretty hard to change it and make it aggression on your part. You see? So, while we are weary of this thing in Korea, we let it be known to the Communists that we were not going to be bound by some of these so-called \"Gen- tlemen's Agreements\" or understandings- common understandings ... I don't believe that there would be much change in the actual conduct, because apparently, West- moreland has about as many troops as he would like, or as he's asked for. Personally, I would like to see him have another 100,000 to just clean this thing up more quickly. BRADLEY. Speed it up, yeah .... EISENHOWER. Yes, speed it up. Because, as I say again, the costs of war are measured largely by its length. It's endurance. Because you-all the preparations you have, even in a small war are pretty heavily-heavy. So I would like to see it get over, and I would like to give him everything that he thinks he needs. And I think that any method-the only change that I could think of-that a change of Administration might make. REASONER. DO you think the War will be a serious factor in the campaign? EISENHOWER. Well, certain things, I'm sure. But I do think that they-they will be people who will go over the history o' the wholething, and probably want to criticize con- duct ...because that's-that's par for the course. And I would be amazed if it didn't happen. But I don't believe that there will be any challenge made of the character; \"We ought to get out now, and we're fighting for the wrong purposes. ... We're fighting-to use Bradley's phrase ...\"we're fighting a right war at the right place\". REASONER. General Bradley, Mr. President, thank you very much. RETIREMENT OF MRS. SUANEE DUSENBURY AS MANAGER OF SOCIAL SECURITY OFFICE IN FLORENCE, S.C. Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to call to the attention of the Congress the long and distinguished record of public service of Mrs. Suanee Moorhead Daly Dusenbury who will re- tire December 1, 1967, as office manager of the social security district office in Florence, S.C., following 31 years in this important position. Few citizens in our Nation can claim a record of service such as that compiled by Mrs. Dusenbury. In addition, she has excelled as a citizen of Florence and has made numerous contributions to the wel- fare of her State and Nation. A native of Seneca, S.C., Mrs. Dusen- bury received an A.B. degree from Win- throp College in 1919 and began her career as a public school teacher. In 1920 she married Julian D. Dusenbury, an attorney, and three sons were born of this marriage prior to Mr. Dusenbury's untimely death in 1931. During this time Mrs. Dusenbury was president of the Florence County Coun- cil of Farm Women for 6 years. She also was vice president of the State Council of Farm Women for 4 years and State citizenship chairman of the State Council of Farm Women for 4 years. The first time our State legislature was ever pre- sented with any mention of vocational guidance, Mrs. Dusenbury brought it to their attention when she was vice presi- of the South Carolina Council of Farm Women. In 1933 Mrs. Dusenbury was appointed as a member of the Reconstruction Fi- nance Corporation Council for Florence County, on which the members served without ray. The function of the council was to establish the RFC relief organiza- tion and to put it into operation. Upon Mrs. Dusenbury's motion, while she was with the RFC, the first school lunch pro- gram in America was instituted. A dele- gation from Washington came down to study the program, which later became a national project. When Mrs. Dusenbury's youngest son commenced school, Mrs. Dusenbury felt that it was possible for her to take a job outside the home. In 1933 she was ap- pointed director of the department of public welfare of ERA, Florence County. Mrs. Dusenbury had the responsibility of organizing the new department. In August 1933, the National Reem- ployment Service office opened and Mrs. Dusenbury commenced her duties as manager. At that time, her son Julian went to Washington as a page in the U.S. Senate, when he was 12 years old, serv- ing from 1933 to 1937. In 1936 Mrs. Dusenbury left the na-tional reemployment service to becomemanager of the Social Security Admin-istration at Florence. At the time shetook the position, social security was anew program, and her duties includedorganization of the Florence office. The office of which she is now manager hasjurisdiction in seven counties in South Carolina. Mrs. Dusenbury commenced the operation of her office with a staff of four people, and the staff has grown since then to 41, with two branch officesin other counties. The seven-county dis- trict which she supervises includes Chesterfield, Darlington, Dillon, Flor- ence, Horry, Marion, and Marlboro Counties. The area has a population of 354,000 people. Some 37,554 people in the area are currently receiving Social Se- curity checks, which total over $22 mil- lion per year. Approximately 165 claims a week are handled by her office. During these years that Mrs. Dusen- bury has worked in Florence, she has participated in many community activi- ties and held numerous offices. She held offices in the State Federation of Wo- men's Clubs, Florence Federation of Wo- men's Clubs, City Federation of Women's Clubs, Association of College Women, Pilot Club, Altrusa Club, Graham Bible Class of the First Presbyterian Church, Florence County Health Council, Pee Dee Social Workers' Conference, and Flor- ence Community Concert Association. For 1 year Mrs. Dusenbury was the only woman member of the South Carolina Recovery Board, as State chairman of the Women's Division of the National Recovery Act, and for 5 years she served as State chairman of the Women's Di- vision of the Southeastern Council. She was in the National Speakers Bureau in 1936 and 1937. Mrs. Dusenbury was city chairman and secretary of the Florence Chapter of the National Foundation for Infantile Pa- ralysis for 5 years. During this time Mrs. Dusenbury organized and headed the campaign for funds for the polio drive in the city of Florence. Mrs. Dusenbury has remained an ac- tive member of the Winthrop College Alumnae Association. She was a mem- ber of the executive board of the Win- throp Alumnae Association for 2 years, vice president of the local Winthrop Daughters for 4 years, and served as State president of the Winthrop College Alumnae Association. She is a past president of the Amer- ican Association of University Women, Florence branch; chairman of the inter- agency committee in Florence, and is a member of the International Platform Association. Mrs. Dusenbury is listed in \"Who's Who of American Women,\" \"Who's Who in the South and Southwest,\" and the \"Dictionary of International Biog- raphy.\" Although a great deal of her time has been devoted to her work and com- munity activities, Mrs. Dusenbury has never neglected what she considers her prime responsibility-her family. As an example, in November of 1946, when her oldest son, Julian, was wounded on Okinawa and sent home to the Naval Hospital at Bethesda, Md., Mrs. Dusen- bury took a 6-month leave of absence34300 November 29, 1967CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE from her work and moved to a rooming house in Bethesda as near to the hos- pital as possible, in order to spend all of every day with Julian at the hospital. Mrs. Dusenbury has instilled an in- terest in people and public affairs in her three sons. Her oldest son, Julian, a war hero of World War II, is a retired Marine major. He is a former member of the South Carolina House of Representatives. Richard, a lawyer, is a former mem- ber of :.ny staff and served two terms as solicitor for the 12th judicial circuit of South Carolina. Bernard, a lawyer, is a former member of the South Carolina House of Rep- resentatives. Mrs. Dusenbury, after 34 years of out- standing and faithful service to her gov- ernment and the people, is officially re- tiring on December 1, 1967. Few women in the history of South Carolina have served others as well as Mrs. Dusenbury. She has rendered a distinct and exten- sive service to mankind both in her role as a professional in government and as a leader in community affairs. In addi-tion she has given our State and Nation three sons who have distinguished them- selves by outstanding service in war and peace Her retirement after 31 years as man- ager of the Florence district social secu- rity office is well deserved, but knowing her as well as I do, I am confident she will have many more contributions to make to her fellow man. I welcome this opportunity to call to the attention of the Congress and the Nation a truly great lady of South Caro- lina-Mrs. Suanee Moorhead Daly Dusenbury. ADJOURNMENT Mr. BYRD of West Virginia.

MIKE MONRONEY OF OKLAHOMA IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES Wednesday, November 29, 1967 Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, yes- terday my good friend the distinguished senior Senator from Tennessee [Mr. GORE] and I engaged in a discussion of the merits of the Nation's No. 2 and No. 3 rated football teams, the University of Tennessee and the University of Okla- homa. These two fine teams will meet on New Year's Day in the Orange Bowl, and the outcome of that game will settle the' debate which the Senator and I began yesterday. Today I invite attention to one out- standing member of the University of Oklahoma Sooners football squad, Mr. Granville Liggins. Mr. Liggins has been named to the All-America team by three different sources and is now receiv- ing the recognition his fine contribution to football deserves. Granville is a graduate of Booker T. Washington High School in Tulsa, and is Oklahoma's All-America linebacker. Also, I should like to point out that another winning grid team from my great State, the Golden Norsemen from Oklahoma Northeastern A. & M. College, in Miami, was last week the winner of the Shrine Bowl and crowned undisputed national junior college football cham- pions. This fine team finished the season with nine wins and a single loss, capturing the national championship under the able guidance of Coach Chuck Bowman.Like Coach Chuck Fairbanks at the University of Oklahoma, Coach Chuck Bowman at Northeastern A. & M. is in his first year as head coach of a college foot- ball team. These two teams, the University of Oklahoma Sooners and the Golden Norse of Nortaeastern A. & M. College, are fit- ting ambassadors of the State of Okla- homa and are helping in a most appro- priate manner with the celebration of the 60th anniversary of Oklahoma state- hood. The Kee Report: Thanksgiving EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. JAMES KEE OF WEST VIRGINIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, November 29, 1967 Mr. KEE. Mr. Speaker, under leave to extend my remarks in the REcoRD, I in- clude last week's public service television and radio newscast, \"The Kee Report.\" The subject discussed in this report is the observance of Thanksgiving. The report follows: This is Jim Kee-bringing you the Kee Report. Our thoughts this week are centered on the observance of Thanksgiving, the day on which we give thanks to Divine Providence for the blessings bestowed upon the people of America. By tradition, this is a day of family re- unions and bountiful feasting. Thanksgiving is one of the first holidays designated by the Federal Government for national observance. However, before considering the significance of this day, I would like to inform you of a far-reaching change now under considera- tion in your Congress. This is a movement to change the dates offive Federal holidays so that each may be observed on a Monday, thus providing a three-day weekend. Under the proposed plan, Independence Day would be celebrated on the first Monday in July, instead of July 4th; Memorial Day on the last Monday in May; Veterans' Day on the last Monday in Octo- ber; Thanksgiving Day on the 4th Monday in November and Washington's Birthday would be shifted to the third Monday in Feb- ruary and renamed Presidents' Day to honor all of our Presidents. This radical change can be adopted if the American people want it. However, before taking this step. I think it might be well to review what these holidays mean in the spiritual life of our country. The observance of Independence Day on July 4th is as old as the country itself. There was wild rejoicing throughout the colonies when the people learned that on that fateful July 4th, 1776, the Delegates at Philadelphia had cast off the yoke of Great Britain finally and forever. This day marked the beginning of freedom for our country. In a larger sense, it marked the beginning of political freedom throughout the world. We may, if the people wish, convert Wash- ington's Birthday into a day to honor all our Presidents. But, without the courage and determination of George Washington, the Revolution might not have succeeded. A short time later, it was Washington's leader- ship which held the Republic together dur- ing those early days when many believed it could not survive. I think Washington de- serves one day a year to honor his memory. The observance of Memorial Day arose spontaneously from the hearts of the people after one of the costliest Civil Wars in his- tory. This day had a dual purpose in the minds of its sponsors, to honor the dead, and in Lincoln's words, to help bind up the wounds of war. The date of its observance has been fixed for nearly a century. Our present Thanksgiving is modeled after the celebrated feast of the Pilgrims at Plym- outh to give thanks for a bountiful harvest. The traditional family dinner of turkey, pumpkin pie and cranberry pie, had its origin on that occasion. But, while feasting played a prominent part, this was essentially a day of religious observance.34301 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 The first Thanksgiving Day proclamation, issued by a President of the United States, was issued by George Washington in grati- tude for the adoption of our Constitution. The first proclamation fixing the fourth Thursday in November as Thanksgiving Day was issued by another great President, Abra- ham Lincoln. There is no legal barrier to the proposed change of dates. My own view is that certain ones-like the 4th of July-have become sacred in the minds and hearts of the Amer- ican people. I believe the national holidays should remain as they are, unless there is an overwhelming public demand for a change. Thank you for listening. Remarks of Hon. Wayne Hays at the North Atlantic Assembly EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. JACK BROOKS OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, November 29, 1967 Mr. BROOKS. Mr. Speaker, last week I had the honor of serving as a U.S. representative to the North Atlantic As- sembly. As a member of our delegation, I was particularly impressed by the abil- ity demonstrated by our chairman, the distinguished gentleman from Ohio, WAYNE HAYS. On November 23 at a plenary session, Chairman HAYS delivered an extempo- raneous address which I feel was in- dicative of the outstanding manner in which he served our Nation. His remarks, which were made fol- lowing those of the leader of the French delegation, Mr. Boscher, were an elo- quent, yet simple and easily comprehend- ed statement of the relations between the nations of the Atlantic community. As I am confident that my colleagues will find his statement enlightening and beneficial as I did, the text, taken from the transcript of the meeting, follows: Mr. WAYNE HAYS (United States). It gives me great pleasure to follow Mr. Boscher of France who, I think, made a very balanced presentation of the views of his government, as I take it, and the dominant political party in France. I should just like to emphasize at the very beginning that it seems to me that all of us here have more in common than we have differences. In saying that, I would not wish to paper over the fact that perhaps our dif- ferences have been sharper and more appar- ent in this conference than in others I have attended, but we do have a common concern about the well-being of our countries, of our peoples, and the Atlantic community, and I think this has been evident throughout our discussions. I suppose it is fair to say that a good many of our problems in the Alliance are similar to the problems we have within our own countries, which are compounded by our mass media communications, because it has been my observation that they will take a molehill and very quickly make a mountain out of it, and they seize upon the sensational because they are in the business of selling advertising and newspaper space, at least in my country, and sometimes overlook the fundamental basic hard work that goes into a lot of the decisions made, not only in na- tional governments but in international or-ganizations. I speak specifically of a headline I saw in the paper yesterday, which says the French are mounting an attack upon the dol- lar. I said in the Standing Committee that I do not know whether it is true or whether it is not. I would hope that it is not, and until I see more evidence of it I will believe that it is not. But I would say, if it is, that this could be ultimately not only an em- barrassment to the United States but a de- feat for France as well. It might serve in passing to mention that the gross national product in France, a country of fifty million people, is only equal to the total gross prod- uct of the State of California, a state of twenty million people. I think as I said in the Standing Committee, that the interna- ional economic situation is so fragile that no country, or group of countries, can stand alone in the free world if someone else in the free world is trying to destroy them econom- ically. Why do I say this? Well, it seems to me that, if you look at the picture of the rivalry between the free world and the communist world in a balanced way, with the exception of China-and even their former partners in Russia admit they cannot fathom what goes on in Peking, nor does it make any sense to them-but if you look at the struggle out- side that it seems any sensible view would be that we have moved more into an economic and political competition, than we at the moment, into a military confrontation. At the risk of being a bore, I repeat what I have said to this Organization both in Committee and Plenary before, that the free nations of the world have proved with NATO and during World War II and World War I that they could stand together in times of military stress but that they could not stand together in times of economic stress. I think it is significant that some statistician pointed out that 50% of all the people living in Europe cannot remem- ber World War II. If that be a true statistic, certainly it must be true that three-quarters of the people living in Europe and America today cannot remember the great depression of the late twenties and early thirties. Many people say there is a tremendous parallel be- tween that time and what is happening today. I am not an economist, so I cannot say, but I do know that if economic stress comes we had better stand together or, as the old American saying in the revolution goes, \"We had better hang together or we will all hang separately\". I do not know whether the governments of any of the na- tions in the free world could stand another economic debacle comparable to that which occurred in the twenties and thirties, and if they tried to do it alone I think they would not survive. So I am for the NATO Alliance being more than a military alli- ance, and I guess in that particular degree I disagree with some of my French col- leagues, but I think the time will come when they will see this more clearly. I hesitate to become a prophet, because I am neither omniscient nor omnipotent, but I do think we ought to be making ar- rangements not to try to destroy each others' countries, not to try to destroy each others' economic well-being, but to help. I would just like to point out that this rising tide of protectionism which Senator Javits spoke about is a real thing in the United States. It is not only because of competition af- fecting American industries. I live in a constituency that has been seriously affected by European competition for the whole nineteen years I have repre- sented them, because one of the big indus- tries in my constituency was the making of dishes and glassware. I have heard this over and over again, but it is affecting more in- dustries now, and there will be a serious ef- fort, I think-if we keep reading in the Press about various attacks on the dollar and var-ious schemes to get around the tariff lower-ing which we have agreed to in the KennedyRound, as the Senator said, by road taxesand other things which are just as effectiveas tariffs in barring our products from yourcountries-there will be a serious effort, andmaybe a successful effort, to do away with all the gains of the Kennedy Round. So Ithink it is to our interest to look at that,and I think it is to our interest as an Allianceto try to see that this does not happen. I hesitate to speak about Great Britain's difficulties. I can only say this, that if deval-uation is more than a temporary solution to their problems-and most economists think it is only a temporary solution-nobody willbe happier than the United States, because we have no more desire to see Great Britainbrought to the brink of disaster economicallythan we have to see France or Holland orNorway, or any other country in the free world. I think it has been fair to say that while my country has accepted a lot of criticism, If you look back over the past history-and we expect no appreciation, let me say that inadvance-of the American attitude towards its partners in Europe, starting with our in-tervention in World War II, succeeded by the Marshall Plan, we have been interested In the well-being of Europe, not only fromthe standpoint of its political aims, its free- dom, but its economy and everything thatgoes to make life for mankind a better life. I say this, as I said, not expecting any ap-preciation because this is a commodity that is in short supply in the world, and I am notcriticising Europe, because I want to tell you I can turn it around and say it some other way. The other day I was speaking to an au. dience in my own constituency. It was aquestion and answer period, and some fel- low got up and said \"Where is our European alliance when we are engaged in a struggle with our people dying in Vietnam? Whereare they?\" I said, \"I guess they are exactly where we were, my friend, when Hitler rapedAustria, attacked Czechoslovakia, marchedinto Poland, France fell, and he was stand- ing on the Channel, and we were not inter- ested until the first bomb fell on Pearl Har- bour.\" So when I say that sometimes we feel a little hurt because Europe is not so muchinterested in our problems, I point out to you that this is a characteristic of people,and a characteristic of nations, and the fur-ther you are away from a conflict the less it really interests you. I do not criticise Eu- ropeans for this, because we have a lot of people in the United States who would rather go on with the business of deciding which kind of a third television set they would buy and which model of a second car they would buy than face up to the reality that we are living in a world with two competing systems, and one or the other ultimately, in my opinion, is going to have to prevail. So if you felt any hurt in anything that I said,or felt that I was speaking badly about Eu- ropeans, it was not that at all, it is justhuman nature. The only thing I can pass on to you that has been of any value in my almost lifetime in politics is a definition which the teacher in the secondary school I went to wrote on the blackboard on the first day I went to the world history class. She said, \"History is a record of the past, a guide to the present and a forecast of the future.\" All of us here in this organization are literate, all of us have read history, and it seems to me that if we cannot draw the conclusions from it to guide us in the future we really will have failed our people. I would like to conclude these remarks by just pointing out one simple thing that I think is really overriding in the competition between Communism and Capitalism. The United States has had a problem for many years of producing more than it could con-34302 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE sume in the way of food, and we have con- cocted all sorts of plans for getting rid of it around the world for nothing or for little or for something. Our great competitor in the world, or, as many of you like to call it, the other super power, has more acreage and more potential than we do and Its problem in all of my political lifetime has been try- ing to find enough to feed its people. Now, certainly, Ladies and Gentlemen, that ought to be some kind of a commentary upon the two systems, and all you have to do to find the proof of what I am saying is to look around in any of your own cities-this one, Brussels, Paris, London, Rome, Amsterdam- you name it. When I first saw them before the war and when I first saw them after the war you could cross any street in any city in Europe with your eyes closed and have no fear of a traffic accident or of becoming a statistic. I only cite the automobile as one sign of the tremendous economic recovery Europe has made. I think it is fair to say that before the war the great mass of people in Europe aspired to some day riding in an automobile; today the masses aspire to own- ing an automobile and most of them do. This has been our system in competition with the Soviet system. When I first visited Moscow you could walk down the street blindfold and cross it and not be hit by a car, and when I went there two months ago traffic was still no problem and for the first time in many months, for the duration of my stay there, I was not bothered by traffic jams. So I think it is fair to compare our system with theirs and it is fair to say that we ought to do what we can to preserve and protect ours so that it is not overwhelmed by theirs. Thank you. [Ap- plause.] Speech by U.S. Senator Joseph M. Mon- toya, Democrat, of New Mexico, to Students of Inter-American Defense College, November 9, 1967 EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. E. S. JOHNNY WALKER OF NEW MEXICO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, November 29, 1967 Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, on November 9, the distinguished junior Senator from New Mexico, the Honorable JOSEPH M. MONTOYA, addressed this year's class of the Inter-American De- fense College. As the Members of this body are no doubt aware, each year the Latin American countries are invited to send their brightest young military minds to this college headquartered at Fort McNair. This year's class includes outstanding young men from 15 of our Latin American neighbors, and I know of no person better qualified to address such an audience than Senator MONTOYA. His ability to give this speech in both English and Spanish was prima facie proof to those in attendance that we here in America share much more with them than simply being members of the Western Hemisphere. I am pleased to have this opportunity to call his remarks to the attention of my colleagues because I think the course he has mapped for these future leaders is one which must be followed by them and supported by the American people ifour hemisphere is to continue its joint progress and understanding. I include Senator MONTOYA'S remarks at this point in the RECORD: WHAT THE FUTURE WILL DEMAND OF YOU (Speech by U.S. Senator JosEPH M. MONTOYA, Democrat, of New Mexico, to students of Inter-American Defense College, Washing- ton, D.C., November 9, 1967) General Henry, General Garcia, General Molina, my friends, a revered American and sincere friend of Latin America once said: \"The price of liberty is eternal vigilance.\" Thomas Jefferson was no lover of war or believer in everlasting conflict. He was aware of the realities of international life. He knew human progress is never fast enough for some, and there were those who would de- stroy freedom and injure liberty in order to attain their idea of a better world. He knew these men often masqueraded be- hind slogans of liberty in order to impose upon others a rule of tyranny. So he warned us against such men. He spoke of a need for vigilance if we are to protect and retain for all men the precious rights so many have struggled for. In our western hemisphere, we have learned pain- fully how precious our rights are. Every nation in this hemisphere has had to fight, often bloodily, to be free. Each na- tion, once free, has had to defend its nation- hood against aggressors from without who have sought to enslave them. We have been successful up to now in re- pelling these challenges from abroad. We have been eternally vigilant in defense of our respective nationhoods. Each nation of our hemisphere has also been successful in repelling threats confront- ing them from within. There are always ele- ments within society that seek power for themselves rather than orderly progress for all. Our era has seen a new ideology confront us from without and challenge us from within. It seeks to take advantage of every geographical feature or political mistake on our part. It cleverly seeks to exploit internal turmoil and dissatisfaction among our populations. While national governments devote in- creasing efforts and resources to peaceful internal progress, these disrupters seek to defeat progress, even if it means hurting the prospects of those most in need. They are willing to see the underprivileged suffer even more, rather than allow demo- cratic regimes time to bring about reforms. Seekers and fomentors of violent revolu- tion, bloodshed and destruction, they thrive on hate and arousing of passions. They are not interested in building, as democratic regimes are. They have no vocabulary that includes roads, schools, hygiene, trade and honest international dealing. They pay lip service to these ideals and goals, speaking of them to disadvantaged people. But they have in mind only power, war and aggrandisement. It is up to us to defeat their purposes, and to frustrate their schemes and ambitions. It devolves upon us to bare our breasts to their challenge. We dare not fail. Slavery for generations to fol- low is the cost if we do not succeed. Free men and progressive regimes must, therefore, prepare themselves for any chal- lenge. A call to struggle may come at any time, as recent events have shown. It is regrettable that we must speak of force and be ready to meet might with might. But it is essential to the future of our hemi- sphere. Fidel Castro has drawn us a graphic pic- ture of what awaits those who fall prey to such men. See how free Cuba is! Note how fat the Cuban people grow on one egg a month! Watch how much they enjoy the Russian military presence among them! Markhow free their press is! Observe the liberty they enjoy under Fidel! Freedom-loving men never take up a sword gladly. But every time a tyrant or potential tyrant has seized the sword of enslavement and sought to bend others to his will, an- other has taken up the shield of liberty and interposed it between him and his victim. That is your duty, responsibility and perma- nent task. Intelligent, politically knowledgeable and progressive military men are what nations of our hemisphere must have. A blind obeyer of orders is not enough. A political profes- sional lacking military knowledge who is not master of his craft is inadequate. Modern military professionals in our hemi- sphere must be tacticians and skillful lead- ers. But they must also be students of the history of their countries and our hemisphere. They must possess understanding of new currents moving in Latin America. They must exercise compassion for and under- standing of yearnings and needs of their countrymen. Yours is therefore a double task. Provide security, but possess understand- ing. Be able to defend, but be ever ready to instruct. Stand firm, yet be versatile. oet ex- amples but never lose sight of your prime task. Be nation-builders as well as nation-de- fenders. The Fidel Castros are waiting and hoping for you to fail. Like so many vultures they await an opportunity. As I look at this group, I have a feeling they will wait in vain. You impress me as a new, progressive breed. Everywhere change is on the march. It need not be change that levels cities and decimates populations. Latin America's peo- ple are aware of these rising expectations. They ask to share in them. Your continent bursts with vitality, re- sources and eager hands. Nations are emerg- ing one after the other into a new age. They require talents, ideas and leadership men like you can and must provide. We look to you with hope and a desire to help. No reasonable request by progressive men would be rejected unthinkingly. We take pride in your progress and suffer if you sustain temporary setbacks. We share your aspirations for a better life for all under the umbrella of democratic institutions. We have created a new world together. We have suffered together and glared at one another across our borders. Now we must stand united in the front ranks of freedom, determined to make our new world the best of all possible worlds. This we shall do with- out the lash of enslavement or the sword of dictatorship. Your behavior and accomplishments will be a foundation to build and live on. It is my hope, as I know it is yours, that our names will be praised rather than cursed. Let us get to work, secure in the knowledge that we are free men in free countries, struggling towards attainable goals. Capt. David L. Wiseman Receives Navy Medal EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. CLARENCE D. LONG OF MARYLAND IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, November 29,1967 Mr. LONG of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, Capt. David L. Wiseman, son of Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth L. Wiseman, of Baltimore,34303 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 Md., was recently presented the Navy Commendation Medal for meritorious service in South Vietnam. Captain Wise- man previously won three Purple Hearts while serving with the 1st Marine Divi- sion in Vietnam. I wish to commend Captain Wiseman for his service to our country and to con- gratulate his parents on their fine son. The Edge of Dissent EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. ROBERT N. C. NIX OF PENNSYLVANIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, November 29, 1967 Mr. NIX. Mr. Speaker- Men are qualified for civil liberties in exact proportion to their disposition to put moral chains on their appetites- Wrote Edmund Burke two centuries ago. Society cannot exist- He continued- unless a controlling power upon will and appetite be placed somewhere, and the less of it there is within, the more there must be without. It is ordained in the internal constitution of things that men of intem- perate minds cannot be free. Their passions forge their fetters. We are confronted today, in the United States, with a situation which inevitably calls our attention to these eminently practical words of counsel. I mean, spe- cifically, that we are faced today with a crisis testing the durability, the very capacity to survive, of our democratic process-a crisis identified by the name Vietnam. I do not mean that the con- flict itself is a threat to our security; it never has been. I mean, rather, that by a curious paradox, our system of de- mocracy, which guarantees as a sacred right the voice of dissent, is threatened as it seldom, if ever, has been in our history-threatened by the appetites of intemperate minds, which know the meaning of neither restraint nor com- monsense, and who are using the demo- cratic system to force their own private opinions upon a freely-elected and duly- invested government. Those who do this defy constituted authority in order to usurp the right to dictate public policy in the name of private morality, thereby ignoring the voice of the corporate social ethic. What we have, in effect, is the destruction of dissent by the triumph of demagoguery, the yielding of argument to brutish force, the inundation of reason by primitive emotion. We are forced every day, by means of the news media, to witness the \"dissent\" of those who claim to be concerned and responsible citizens-\"dissent\" which is conceived at best in ignorance and at worst in malevolence. In a democracy such as ours, to be sure, dissent of the proper sort is not only tolerated, but en- couraged by the very nature of the sys- tem. The concept of democracy is one which inherently demands of its citi-zenry responsible interest in political is- sues and the expression of that interest through rational discussion. It follows that dissent is an inevitable concomitant of the democratic process which imple- ments the will of the people through constitutional government-if we mean by dissent its dictionary definition: \"dif- ference in sentiment or opinion, espe- cially from the majority; disagreement; withholding of assent.\" Too many people, however, apparently do not apprehend the proper meaning of dissent, as it ap- plies in the context of democratic gov- ernment. I do not think that what has re- cently been passing as \"dissent\" is con- formable to the accepted definition of the word. Nor do I think that much heed is being paid in certain quarters to the meaning of discussion and the place it should occupy in a free society. Discus- sion, if I may remind you, is defined as \"consideration or examination by argu- ment, comment, debate.\" And discussion, if it is to serve the purpose of human ac- complishment, must be characterized by reason-a uniquely human quality, and one which was valued highly by the inventors of democracy-the ancient Greeks. Reason is \"the power of intel- ligent and dispassionate thought, or of conduct influenced by such thought.\" And it is upc n the efficacy of rational dis- cussion that the process of constitutional government depends for success. With- out reason, there is no order, and in the words of Othello, \"chaos is come again.\" The alternative to reason is anarchy. We have come to the point where we are faced with at least the possibility of that alternative. We have come to that point because a highly vocal, though proportionately small, segment of the population is, for whatever rea- sons, wittingly or unwittingly, devoted to the destruction of our system-a sys- tem which assumes that reasonable dis- cussion is the most effective means by which to achieve justice through law. There are those, of course, who dis- agree with the President's Vietnam policy, who dissent through the process of rational discussion. This is as it should be. Then, there are those who dissent through the process of civil dis- obedience-those who, it would seem, are misinformed as to the nature of the con- stitutional democracy and the way in which it functions. I quote from a re- cent article in Look magazine by Robert McAfee Brown, a professor of religion at Stanford University, to illustrate my point: I will \"counsel, aid, and abet\" ... students to find whatever level of moral protest is consonant with their consciences, and when for them this means refusing service in the armed forces, I will support them in that stand. In so doing, I am committing a Fed- eral offense, for the Military Selective Serv- ice Act of 1967 specifically states that any- one who \"knowingly counsels, aids and abets another to refuse or evade registration or service in the armed forces\" opens himself to the same penalties as are visited upon the one he so counsels, aids and abets, namely up to five years in jail or up to $10,000 in fines, or both. Professor Brown states that he is so moved to act because, in the final analysis, \"the vacuum within the twomajor parties leaves voters opposed to our Vietnam policy with rather bleak alternatives.\" What he means by that is that none of the major contenders for the office of the Presidency-including not only the President but also his mostserious challengers-that none of themajor contenders for the Office of thePresidency is in agreement with his- Professor Brown's-point of view. It seems to me that Professor Brown, and others like him, are forgetting thatthe alternative open to them is to dissent through rational discussion, and then to vote as they see fit, in support of theirpoint of view. If no candidate is available who expresses their views, they are at liberty to put one up who does, and if enough people agree with what they be- lieve, they will triumph at the polls. It is as simple as that. What Professor Brown and others like him really mean, is that the majority does not agree with them, and since this is the case, the minority must disobey the laws in order to force their opinion upon the majority. This at- titude is hardly consonant with the ideals of our democratic heritage. This attitude can serve only to erode and destroy the system by which the majority at any given time is entrusted with making policy but which at the same time must vindicate the rightness of that policy or face defeat at the polls. The Nazi regime of Adolph Hitler for- feited its claim upon the allegiance of the German people not only because it violated every known tenet of the code of human morality but also because its totalitarian nature precluded discussion and free choice. The tragedy of Germany was that so many Germans did not realize this. Our tragedy is that so many Americans today seem to feel that their country has likewise forfeited its claim upon their allegiance. When men defy the constituted authority of our Govern- ment-which unlike the Hitler regime, has gone out of its way to protect the rights of dissenters and to assure the equity of its laws-when men defy the constituted authority of our Government through illegal action, they imply that Jefferson was wrong when he predicted: I have much confidence that we shall pro- ceed successfully for ages to come, and that .. .it will be seen that the larger the extent of the country, the more firm its republican structure, if founded ... in the principles of compact and equality. I do not believe that Jefferson's hope has been vitiated. Nor do I believe that refusal to cooperate with Government policy is anything but inimical to the national interest-which is, after all, a collective expression of all the individual interests which comprise that national interest. More serious, however, than the threat posed by these illegal critics who assume a posture of moral superiority, is the threat of those who willfully and mali- ciously violate the boundary between dis- sent and demagoguery-the threat of those who earnestly desire and con- sciously attempt to destroy the social or- der which allows them the very freedom which they utilize for their destructive purposes. I have in mind, in particular, demonstrators like those who recently34304 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE invaded Washington and the Pentagon, in a concerted and obviously organized attempt to disrupt the machinery of Gov- ernment processes. In regard to their ac- tions I quote from a recent newspaper editorial which was inserted in the CON- GRESSIONAL RECORD, and which puts the issue clearly: If the cause of dissent is the obscenity and violence of war, one does not make a good case against it by committing obscenities and violence. It holds further, as Senate majority leader MANSFIELD recently pointed out on the floor of Congress, that \"the right of dissent guaranteed under the Constitu- tion should always be allowed, but that right does not entail license, anarchy, or a breaking of the law. .. .Insofar as the Office of the Presidency is concerned,\" continued Senator MANSFIELD, \"it should be treated with respect and courtesy, and that applies to the individual who hap- pens to hold it at a given time. In other words, all Presidents, who only hold the office temporarily, should be entitled to the respect which the permanent Office of the Presidency calls for and is entitled to.\" It would be naive to assume that the intention of some of these violent demon- strators is anything less than the de- struction of the United States itself. It is tragic that although this is not the intention of many other of these an- archy-minded people, they are neverthe- less contributing to that very cause. For it is patently clear that with each new demonstration, and each new lawless protest, the enemy receives aid and com- fort and is strengthened in its resolve to continue the conflict in the hope that American resistance will weaken and finally collapse. It need not be reiterated that the longer the conflict endures, the greater the number of American soldiers who will lose their lives. In this connec- tion, Speaker MCCORMACK recently noted that a high-ranking North Vietnamese official calls opposition to the war in the United States a \"valuable mark of sym- pathy\" to the Communist cause. A re- cent article in the New York Times serves to vindicate the accuracy of Speakler McCORMACK'S perception. This article in the New York Times reports that the of- ficial newspaper of the North Vietnamese Government considers the \"campaign in the United States for an end to Johnson's aggressive war in Vietnam\" to have \"en- tered a stage of active resistance\"-and that \"an important aspect of the Wash- ington rallies was that they marked the end of protest and the start of a 'fierce struggle' against the war.\" Thus, because of evidence within the United States it- self, observes the British Daily Tele- graph: Ho Chi Minh [cannot be] blamed for in- sisting on American withdrawal or for mak- ing it a point of honour not to reciprocate in any way for the cessation of bombing. As the Telegraph concludes, however: The sooner Ho realizes that he cannot win on American campuses and boulevards the war he is losing in Viet Nam, the sooner will he come to the conference table. I therefore submit that in the interest of preserving both our democratic sys- tem and the American lives which pro-tect it; in defense of both reason and the national security-the American people must address themselves to adopting a position in support of the President of the United States and the policy which he, as the duly elected head of state, has implemented toward what he considers a necessary course of action. So long as other countries are able to condemn us on the basis of what our own citizens say and do-in violation of the principles on which our system of government is predicated-so long as force and unlaw- ful action are allowed to replace reason and legal dissent-so long will the credi- bility of our own faith in our country and all that it has ever stood for be counter- feit in the eyes of the world. Worse still, when we shall allow democracy to be trampled under foot by the rampant mob, our civilization shall have run its course. Let us hold fast to the judgment of law and civilized dialog. Benjamin N. Car- dozo said: For law is restraint, and the absence of restraint is anarchy. U.S. Flights Over China Are a Danger to Us All EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. JOHN G. DOW OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, November 29, 1967 Mr. DOW. Mr. Speaker, on November 15, I alluded in both the permanent and the daily RECORD, to an editorial in the Saturday Review, based on a statement by a spokesman for the State Depart- ment-and I quote the editorial: There Is nothing new about flights by United States planes over Chinese territory. United States planes have been flying au- thorized missions over Communist China for years. Since then, Mr. Speaker, the Saturday Review has published, in its November 28 issue, word of a disclaimer from the U.S. Department of State, which reads as follows: The U.S. Department of State has informed SR that it was in error in quoting a State Department spokesman [\"The Tragic Trap,\" SR, Oct. 21] as saying that U.S. military planes had been authorized to fly over Com- munist China for several years. The State Department says it was referring to acci- dental flights over China by planes author- ized to carry out missions in North Vietnam within specified distances of the Chinese bor- der. The editors are pleased to put this cor- rection on the records. In order to further elucidate the posi- tion of the Department of State on this grave matter of U.S. military flights over Chinese territory, I submit the complete text of a letter to me dated November 21, from Assistant Secretary of State Wil- liam P. Bundy. The letter follows: ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE, Washington, November 21,1967. Hon. JoHN 0. Dow, House of Representatives. DEAR CONGRESSMAN Dow: I have noted your remarks of November 15th in the House(H 15285), concerning statements in a re- cent editorial in the Saturday Review. I read that editorial with some shock, be- cause it completely mis-stated what I (the spokesman for the Department) had said to the editor. As my contemporary record of the conversation reads, with the support of a witness in my office, I said nothing of the sort attributed to me in the editorial. What I did say was that none of our bombing mis- sions had been directed over China at any time, which was the clear implication of the earlier Saturday Review editorial of Septem- ber 9th. I went on to note that there had been accidental overflights of China in con- nection with our North Vietnamese opera- tions, but that these had taken place over a long period and were not in any sense \"re- cent\"-the term employed in the original Saturday Review editorial of September 9th. I went on to discuss Chinese Communist reaction, but in much more sophisticated terms than this second Saturday Review edi- torial quoted me. What I said was that the Chinese have from time to time reported overflights and that, when verified by us, we have confirmed the facts and the reasons- faulty navigation, pilots under fire, etc. I went on to say the Chinese Communists had protested these actions but the sum total of their reaction did not suggest that they regarded them as deliberate intrusions or a threat to China itself. I said that of course the question of Chinese Communist reaction was one that we kept always in mind in framing operations, and would continue to do so. Finally, I said that it was our present judgment-which I believe to be shared by a consensus of China watchers, as reported by the New York Times shortly after the first raids nearer the Chinese border, for ex- ample-that the likelihood of Chinese Com- munist major reaction did not appear sub- stantial at the present time, and that it re- mained our basic view that the Communist Chinese would certainly react if they believed their territory deliberately threatened or if they believed that we were out to destroy the regime in North Vietnam. I said that I did not think they now held either of these beliefs, and that these were certainly not our objectives, as we had tried to make clear both by word and deed. In view of the substantial degree of mis- understanding and inaccuracy in the Sat- urday Review editorial, I discussed the mat- ter with Mr. Norman Cousins, its editor. As a result of these discussions the Satur- day Review has printed a correcting box in the issue of November 25, which I enclose. The record of our bombing operations in North Vietnam, the occasional accidental overflights, and our judgment of Commu- nist Chinese reaction is not a new one. We have repeatedly discussed the subject with the relevant committees of the Congress and will continue to do so. I can assure you that we take it most seriously. I leave it to you whether you may wish to insert the Saturday Review's correction in the Congressional Record. But I wished you have it for your own information in any event. Since Senator Hartke inserted the whole of the second Saturday Review editorial in the Congressional Record, I am taking the liberty of sending him a copy of this letter. Sincerely, WILLIAM P. BuNnY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the State Department's clearly sincere effort to clarify a most difficult issue. Yet, I cannot understand why our Government will for one instant make it possible for military flights over sover- eign Chinese territory to occur or permit flights that could come even remotely close to the Chinese border. Knowing, as we do, that all of the bombing of North34305 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE November 29, 1967 Vietnam is of questionable efficacy, then bombing of areas near China must be of slight value. I submit that such bombing is indeed of slight value when compared to the danger it poses of worldwide nu- clear war. The judgment in Assistant Secretary Bundy's letter that \"the likeli- hood of Chinese Communist major reac- tion did not appear substantial at the present time\" is all very well, yet scarce- ly convincing. However competent this State Department judgment may be it is still too slender a thread for us to hang the destiny of the world upon. Mr. Speaker, I question this judgment. The fate of the world should rest not on speculation, but only upon the most sol- emn counsel and constitutional checks that are within the power of our democ- racy to provide. Ukrainian Anniversaries EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. THADDEUS J. DULSKI OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, November 29, 1967 Mr. DULSKI. Mr. Speaker, this year the Ukrainian Community of Greater Buffalo, N.Y., under the auspices of the Buffalo chapter of the Ukrainian Con- gress Committee, observed a double anniversary-the 50th of the Ukrainian liberation struggle, and the 25th of the creation of the UPA-Ukrainian Free- dom Army. The objective of this observance by the Ukrainian communities is threefold: First, to give manifest expression of their strong ties with their kin in the Ukraine who are oppressed by the Rus- sian occupants, and with their national aspirations for freedom and independ- ence. Second, to publicly take a stand sup- porting stability, strength, and security of the United States and our Government in all just endeavors to guarantee the right for freedom, justice, and national Independence for all people and nations in the world. Third, this is meant as a Ukrainian- American manifestation against the 50th anniversary of the Russian Communist imperial system. The week-long double anniversary ob- servance began with a Freedom Festival on Saturday, November 25, at Buffalo's Kleinhans Music Hall. Mrs. Iryna Law- riwska was the toastmaster, and Dr. Nestor Procyk, chairman of the observ- ance committee, greeted the enthusiastic gathering at the festival. With permission, I wish to include Dr. Procyk's introductory remarks and a copy of the Freedom Festival program at this point in the RECORD: REMARKS BY DR. PROCYK I am honored and privileged to welcome you, on behalf of our \"Freedom for Ukraine\" Week Observance Committee to this open- ing program of the week-long observance in tribute to the Ukrainian people on the 60th Anniversary of Ukraine's struggle for liber-ation and 25th Anniversary of the Ukrainian Freedom Army-U.P.A. Shakespeare once said: \"While you live, tell truth and shame the devil\". The truth of Ukraine has been told again and again and must be repeated till the chains will fall and Ukraine will join the family of free nations. For the past fifty years, the struggle to attain sovereign nationhood was marked by suffering, martyrdom and sacrifices. Fifty years of dedication in the service of the Ukrainian nation has claimed millions of nameless victims. Not only the great in spirit were willing to pay the utmost sacri- fice, but also the humble nameless masses willingly gave their lives in their effort to achieve the ultimate of a people-a sovereign and independent life. A half a century of dire oppression from the heavy hands of the Russian Commu- nist rulers has taken Its toll-the infamous symbol of their \"progress\". The tide, however, is slowly but surely turn- ing. The surge toward independent national life could not be stemmed by modern and no matter how efficient suppression. Yet, neither jails, deprivation, hunger or Siberian exile could permanently extinguish the steady Ukrainian flame for freedom. It is to this magnificent spirit that we are dedicating the evening of Ukrainian music, songs and dance tonight. This musical tribute to the undy- ing spirit of the Ukrainian Nation is a token of our support in their rightful quest for liberation. Tonight we pay homage to a a sturdy people who created a valiant Free- dom Army-UPA, a people Who refuse to bend to the Russian despot and steadfastly adhere to their own image of a deeply Christian people. God and Country is the rallying call and in the name of this everlasting truth-we shall prevail! FREEDOM FESTIVAL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 1967-6:30 P.M., KLEINHANS MUSIC HALL I 1.

DULSKI Mr. Chairman, members of the Buffalo Chapter of the Ukrainian Congress Commit- tee of America, distinguished guests, and friends. To say I am glad to be here this evening at the opening of your double anniversary observance would be a gross understatement. It is always a distinct pleasure to be with a group such as this, but it Is even more so today because of the occasion for this ob- servance-the 50th anniversary of the Ukrainian Liberation struggle, and the 25th anniversary of the creation of the UFA (the Ukrainian Freedom Army). I commend you for arranging this week- long observance in our community to focus attention on the plight of the oppressed peoples of the Ukraine. It also serves to em- phasize our country's awareness of the con- tinued national aspirations of these peoples for freedom and independence. We need to let the world know that we will not waver one bit in our endeavors to guarantee the right for freedom, Justice, and national in- dependence, for all peoples and all nations of the world. During the ninth observance of Captive Nations Week last July, our City of Buffalo fittingly commemorated the subjugation of the countries of Eastern Europe and else- where in the world. The expansion and increased fervor of these observances is indeed encouraging, but we must nonetheless be concerned that the plight of the captive nations of the world is always before us and that we must look for solutions to their problems. It should be indelibly clear that we are not just con- cerned during Captive Nations Week, but that we are continually dedicated to assist- ing them in regaining their freedom. And this is what you are doing here this week. The 50th anniversary of the Russian Bolshevik Revolution is not the only \"50th\". Free Ukrainians, and many other non-Rus- sians will be observing 50th anniversaries of independence and freedom, which Soviet Russian Imperio-colonialism snuffed out. Their free voices will be raised in behalf of captive Ukrainians and the other captive non-Russian nations in the U.S.S.R.-yes, equally, and also in behalf of the freedom and open opportunities of the long enslaved Russian nation itself. In every sense, this oncoming period is a real occasion for us to make a special effort to obtain authority to establish a Special House Committee on the Captive Nations. Early in this session of Congress I again spon- sored a resolution to establish such a Com- mittee. I feel strongly that this would be a con- structive first step in bringing freedom to these unfortunate people. Such a Committee would symbolize our free answer to the basic fraudulence of the Russian Bolshevik Rev- olution and the real tragedy of this 50th anniversary of that deceptive revolution. It would also pay shining tribute to the non- Russian \"50ths\", for the non-Russian rev- olutions in the years of 1917-23 were of the same essence and nature as our own Amer- ican Revolution nearly 200 years ago.34306 November 29, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE Let me give you renewed assurance that I will continue to press our leadership in the gouse, for positive action on legislation to create this special House committee. Sev- eral of my colleagues in the House are join- ing me in this effort. I am grateful for the support of the Ukrainian Congress Committee. It is heart- warming to see the efforts being made by your Chapter here as well as elsewhere in our country. Yours is a continuing concern for the op- pressed in your homeland. It is also a re- flection of the support of the American peo- ple for every endeavor aimed at guarantee- ing the right of freedom and national in- dependence for all people. I also include below a copy of the schedule of activities for the remainder of the week of this double anniversary observance, along with a copy of the proclamation issued by the mayor of the city of Buffalo, the Honorable Frank A.

PROCLAMATION Whereas, the year 1967 marks fifty years of continuous struggle of the Ukrainian people for their national independence and against Communist Russian occupation and oppres- sion of their land; and Whereas, this half-century-long fight against the fraudulent Russian Communist Revolution brought millions of victims to the cause of freedom; and Whereas, during World War II, while In the throes of two giants, Nazi-Germany and Communist Russia, the Ukrainian people arose again and created the Ukrainian Free- dom Army-UPA with the ultimate aim to re- gain long sought freedom from the two ad- versaries; and Whereas, these two anniversaries-the 50th Ukrainian struggle for national Independence and the 25th of the creation of the UPA Army constitute milestones in the history of mankind's eternal quest for freedom and human dignity, Now, therefore, I, Frank A. Sedita, Mayor of the City of Buffalo, do hereby proclaim this week of November 26 to December 3, 1967 as \"Freedom for Ukraine Week\", and urge all CXIII--- 2161-Part 25people of greater Buffalo Metropolitan Area to pause and participate in the activities planned to pay tribute to the Ukrainian na- tion's struggle for freedom and national sovereignty. FRANK A. SEDITA, Mayor of Buffalo. Attorney General Clark Reports on Campaign Against Organized Crime EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. EMANUEL CELLER OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, November 29, 1967 Mr. CELLER. Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government, under President Johnson's leadership, is waging its most effective campaign in history against organized crime. The campaign has resulted in an in- crease from 19 in 1960 to 1,197 in 1966 of indictments returned in cases handled by the Organized Crime and Racketeer- ing Section of the Justice Department. Of the 182 Federal indictments or con- victions of known Cosa Nostra members during the past 12 years, 66-more than one-third-have come within the last year. The Federal campaign, already the most intensive and effective yet under- taken, is being bolstered through devel- opment of new strategy. The \"strike force\" concept, involving special intra- agency teams of Government prosecu- tors and investigators, is a promising new technique. Attorney General Ramsey Clark re- ported on the campaign in an address in New York City this month. The address, delivered before the National Emergency Committee of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency in New York on November 14, 1967, also contains a thoughtful analysis of the problem of organized crime. I respectfully include the address to be printed in the RECORD as part of my remarks: Crime in America has many faces. Each exists because we are what we are. Our na- tional character and condition create these capabilities for crime, cause us to suffer them, inhibit commitment to their control. The motives of most are economic. Ninety percent of all serious crimes are against prop- erty. Many of the crimes against persons- muggings, kidnapings, assaults and mur- ders-are incidental to property crimes. White collar crime-embezzlement, fraud, swindling, price-fixing, tax evasion-often the acts of respected and successful peo- ple, wrests millions annually from the public. The consequences to its victims are often as dire and direct as those that follow the thief, the burglar and the robber; frequently more so, because white collar crime can dig deeper than the purse in the bureau drawer or the wallet in the pocket to wipe out the savings of a family or a firm and its stockholders. Few crimes so corrode moral standards. Crime in the streets, as it has come to be called, the widespread occurrence of general crimes, plague the nation. A steady rise in re- ported crime is a source of deep concern to our people. Over three million serious crimes were reported last year with perhaps as manyunreported. Here is our most pervasive and dangerous crime. It strikes capriciously, fre- quently; anywhere, anytime, anyone. But mostly it strikes the poor and the defense- less. It enlists our youth by the tens of thou- sands and sets them against society. It cre- ates an atmosphere of fear that can destroy the self-confidence of a nation and the free- dom of Its people. It is by far the greatest challenge crime presents America today. It will be by far the most difficult to control. An emerging defiance of law to demon- strate dissent or to disrupt is often a cause more of inconvenience than of injury. It has rarely elevated human dignity or the worth of the individual. Perhaps more significantly it lends to an atmosphere of contempt for social stability. Extremist groups of the right and left- the Ku Klux Klan, the Minutemen, the Revo- lutionary Action Movement, Deacons for De- fense and Justice-present another face of lawlessness. Capable of violence and intimi- dation, they are a concern to law enforce- ment and a threat to the public. Rioting with vast property destruction, looting and sniping, injury to thousands and death to scores has visited the nation over four consecutive summers now. It threatens our quest for equal justice, our ability to build great cities where every American child will have his chance for fulfillment. Wild and irrational, riots destroy property, people, opportunities and dreams alike. Today we examine organized crime. Here is planned, systematic continuous criminal ac- tivity: organizations, large and small, loose and tight, that live at the expense of society through the violation of its laws by force and stealth. As with the other faces of crime, it must be viewed in context. All are interrelated as social phenomena, as criminal activity and as crime control problems. Each must be ap- proached with perspective and balance. Many find it difficult to believe there is organized crime. But of course there is, as history, experience and reason all prove. The Mafia made its presence known in the United States in the last decades of the 19th Cen- tury. Each decade of this century has known various conspiracies of professional criminals. In a society in which nearly every form of human activity is organized, is it realistic to believe criminal activity will not be? Crime has proven to be far too profitable in our society to expect an absence of organization in its execution. No simple definition or description of or- ganized crime is possible. Our society is too complex for that. There is no single massive organization that manages all or even most planned criminal activity throughout the country. There are cohesive groups exhibit- ing similar patterns of criminal conduct, with deference for the interests and areas of each other, that reach major parts of the nation. There are many small groups active in particular geographic areas that are in- dependent of outside control. Together, these professionals constitute a major problem for law enforcement and an important challenge to society. President Johnson's Crime Commission surveyed 71 cities in its study of organized crime. Nineteen acknowledged the existence of organized crime in their city. Nine failed to respond. Of these, six are known to have some organized crime. Four of the five cities with more than one million citizens indicat- ed the presence of organized crime. Of the cities surveyed, only one in five with popula- tions between 250,000 and 1,000,000 acknowl- edged any organized crime. More than half of the handful of smaller cities surveyed be- tween 100,000 and 250,000 thought they had organized crime. Federal intelligence indicat- ed the presence of organized crime in some cities where local reports denied it. Of the 19 cities reporting the presence of organized crime, only 12 had specialized po-34307 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATENovember 30, 1967 lice units to deal with it and only six had prosecutors specifically assigned to it. The activities of organized crime are wide ranging, but gambling is by far its greatest source of income. Gambling lends itself to criminal conduct. Loan sharking, often called shylocking or juice, is generally believed to be the second most significant source of income. Here, as with gambling, organized crime must deal with large numbers of people. To protect its interest and accomplish its purpose, as in collections, pressure and violence are used as necessary. The end justifies any means. Extortion, blackmail, and shakedowns are frequent practices. Importation and whole- saling of narcotics engage many groups in organized crime though in recent years the retail trade is often left to the small time pusher. Prostitution, bootlegging and related alcoholic beverage violations are common en- terprises. Increased sophistication and affluence have led organized crime into many legitimate businesses, labor activities and government services and contracts, licensing and zoning. Here they bring all the strong-armed tactics, violence and unprincipled conduct they prac- tice in illegal areas. Firms have been bilked of assets, fraudulent stocks issued, planned bankruptcies executed, trust funds and loan accounts manipulated, and competitors driven out by unfair trade practices and criminal acts. Generally organized crime as distinguished from ordinary crime supplies goods or serv- ices wanted by a large number of people: the chance to gamble, the loan of money, nar- cotics, prostitutes. An aroused community leadership can do much to limit its sales. Because it is an on-going business, with payrolls to meet, dealing with hundreds or thousands of people, organized crime cannot flourish without protection. At the very least local law enforcement must be neutralized because major organized crime activities cannot be effectively concealed. Significant continuing gambling, shylocking, narcotics traffic, prcstitution, extortion and other wide- spread organized criminal acts cannot long escape the notice of law enforcement. Perhaps the greatest harm to come from organized crime is the corruption of officials. This affects a community in ways well be- yond the reach of the criminal activity itself. Where some police are corrupt, law enforce- ment generally is likely to be bad. Where government officials are bribed, the moral climate of the whole community is likely to be affected; public confidence is undermined, cynicism takes hold. Organized crime is a major concern of federal law enforcement. For seven years the federal government has waged an intensive campaign against a tenacious and deeply rooted enemy. The current drive is the most comprehen- sive and successful yet undertaken. The Organized Crime and Racketeering Section of the Department of Justice which, directly and through U.S. Attorneys' offices, handlesorganized crime cases, has the largest legal staff of its history now working exclusively in organized crime. Indictments returned as a result of its ef- forts have risen from 19 in 1960 to 1,197 in 1966. Convictions over the same period have risen from 45 to 477. Between fiscal years 1964 and 1967, convictions or organized crime and gambling figures resulting from FBI investigations have risen 300 percent, from 64 to 197. Of 182 federal indictments and convictions of known members of the Cosa Nostra in the last 12 years, 66, more than one-third, have come in the last 12 months. Included are some of the highest ranking members of this major crime syndi- cate ever caught. Criminal intelligence supplied to local law enforcement by federal agencies has had an even greater impact on organized crime. In fiscal 1967, the FBI disseminated over 250,000 items of intelligence regarding organized crime resulting in 3,600 arrests for violation of state law. Criminal intelligence supplied by the FBI has resulted in 174 raids of or- ganized crime operations and 674 arrests in the past four months. A new and highly effective technique al- ready tested in a major northeastern city in- volves the \"Strike Force\" concept. A special team, the \"Strike Force,\" staffed by Or- ganized Crime and Racketeering Section at- torneys and selected federal investigators from several key agencies, carefully coor- dinate with state and local law enforcement. An intensive correlation of intelligence guides special investigation, raids, grand jury inves- tigation and action followed by prosecution. Superimposed on regular law enforcement and with no other assignment than to find and prosecute organized criminal conduct, the \"Strike Force\" can deliver major blows to organized crime and leave local law en- forcement in control. A series of strike forces are being planned for centers of organized crime. For better than a year now, the Depart- ment of Justice has conducted meetings in major cities across the country to alert local law enforcement and to intensify and bet- ter coordinate local, state and federal action directed at organized crime. The Department will continue its efforts against organized crime in the months ahead. This is an area where the federal government must play a major role. The interstate nature of much of the more extreme organized crime activity and its ability to neutralize local law enforcement make this imperative. But we must not look to the federal gov- ernment to eliminate organized crime any more than we can look to it to control crime in the streets, or riots. Excellence in local law enforcement is the sine qua non of any effort to eliminate organized crime. Without this, little can be permanently accomplished. It is local police that patrol the streets and alleys and see and know the activities of the people. It is local police that are present in adequate numbers to deal with organized gambling, shylocking or prostitution. It isstate and local laws that are violated by most organized crime activity. It is the duty of local police to enforce those laws. Crime in the streets can only be controlled and reduced. Organized crime can be elimi- nated. There are whole nations and societies relatively free of its scourge. A key will be the professionalization of local law enforce- ment: raising standards, training officers to meet the varieties of criminal conduct com- mitted, paying salaries that will attract the best among us, providing adequate force, research and development, organization and leadership to bring excellence to local law enforcement throughout the nation. It is a happy fact, though no coincidence, that ful- fillment of this same great need will aid in the arrest and reversal of the trends toward lawlessness in the other faces of American crime. Executive Briefing on United States- Russia Fisheries Agreement EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. JOHN D. DINGELL OF MICHIGAN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, November 29, 1967 Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, in Octo- ber of last year the Congress passed a law which would prohibit foreign vessels from fishing within 12 miles of our coastal waters, except as expressly pro- vided by an international agreement to which the United States is a party. On Saturday of last week, the United States and Russia entered into a fish- eries agreement concerning our Atlantic coast fisheries. Similar agreements con- cerning our Pacific coast fisheries were entered into between the United States and Russia and the United States and Japan, respectively, in February and May of this year. On Monday, December 4, 1967, at 10 a.m., in room 1334, Longworth House Of- fice Building, before the Merchant Ma- rine and Fisheries Committee, there will be an executive briefing by representa- tives of the State Department and the Department of the Interior on the above- mentioned agreements. There will also be a discussion on fishery negotiations between the United States and certain South American countries and the United States and Mexico. Because of the importance of this meeting to our U.S. fishing industry, I would like to invite all Members of the Congress to attend this classified briefing. SENATE THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 1967 The Senate met at 12 o'clock meridian, and was called to order by the Vice Pres- ident. Rev. Edward B. Lewis, pastor, Capitol Hill Methodist Church, Washington, D.C., offered the following prayer: Dear Father, we are grateful for the inner call of service to God and man. Be with these who have been called by the people of this Nation to lead. May theyfeel the call of the God of history as they make history today. We are grateful for the solution to the conflict on the island of Cyprus. For those who were messengers of peace, we give Thee thanks. Give to this small na- tion the blessing of inner peace. Give us guidance, O God, to new av- enues of finding peace in the continuing conflict we face in Vietnam. May these worthy statesmen feel the strength of faith, hope, and love in this perplexing hour of history. We pray in the Master's name. Amen.THE JOURNAL Mr. MANSFIELD.
