The recommendations of two men, were sent to President Walter C. Langsam, and were received by him, said Mrs. Eva Ruppert, Administrative Assistant. Langsam will not take action on the recommendations until some time next week, stated Mrs. Rupert. \"In considering the recommendatio~s, he (Langsam) could either agree or disagree with the candidates the committee suggested,\" stated Thomas N. Bonner, Vice President and Provost for Academic Mfairs. Bonner served as chairman of the dean search committee. The final selection, added Bonner, will be made by the University Board of Directors. Greenberg, when questioned of his being recommended by the search committee, stated he had not received any confirmation of the committee's nomination. \"Because I have not been notified of the nomination,\" said Greenberg, \"I care not to make a statement at this time.\" for Training and Higher Education \u00b7 since 1966. Crockett feceived his BA degree in philosophy from UC in 1940. He received both his MA and Ph.D degrees from UC in 1941 and 1949 respectively . He was appointed instructor in the Department of Philosophy in 194 7. In 1959 he was made Dean of the Graduate School (now the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences). At the (Continued on page 2) Cap&_Gown Ditched By Law Students The graduating class in the College of Law has voted not to wear caps and gowns at commencement . Money to be appropriated to the \u00b7 graduation regalia will go instead to a fund to aid law school students. The class voted 55-5, binding the. entire class to a decision on the caps and gowns issue, according to Ed\u00b7 Kurent (law senior). He further recommended, \"a more equitable means of electing the student representatives to the University Senate must be found for 1972-73. Greater communication not only between government and its constituents, but within the government structure itself, must become a reality.\" Tannehill Draws 300 Crockett, when questioned on his nomination by the committee, cared not to comment. Any further comment should come from President Langsam's office, he said. Greenberg, a professor of political science, has been dean of the Arts and Sciences College at lllinois State since July 1, 1969. He received his B.A. Degree in political science from Brooklyn College in 1949. He received both his M.A. Degree and Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin . :He received the M.A. degree in 1950 and was granted the Ph.D. in 1955. \"The class then proceeded to vote on the main issue,\" Kurent continued. \"The vote of those present was 32-28 in favor of not wearing caps and gowns.\" Three proxy votes were added, which brought the final tally to 32-31 in favor of not wearing the caps and gowns. Schnure stressed a closer, working relationship among the Residence \u00b7 Hall Association and the Office of Greek Mfairs \"to liberalize the student housing policies.\" Senate approved cabinet and student court appointments, as well as the appointing of Milt Duclaux (UC sophomore) as a delegate to he Ohio Confederation of Student Governments. A bill endorsing the Vote l8 amendment to the U.S. constitution and urging the Ohio General Assembly to ratify the amendffi:ent by July 14, 1971, was passed. The bill also urges members of the University community to sign the petition available in the student government office, urging the adoption of this proposed amendment. A bill urging UC's student government to join the National Student Association was referred to the External Affairs committee. Legislation requesting a revision of the academic calendar was referred tp the Facilities and Servic:s committee and to the Academic Affairs committee. If implemented, this plan would start th'e year on the first Wednesday after Labor Day, in early September. Tuesday Close to 300 people filed into Amory Fi~ldhouse Tuesday to watch an exhibition table tennis match between John Tannehill (A&S freshman) and Burt Jacobs {grad. stu den-tined. psych.) his coach. Tannehill recently returned from the People's Republic of China. Tannehill is the second ranked table tennis player in the U.S. Jacobs is the 1Oth ranked in Ohio. The players went through a wami-up period which consisted of practicing \u00b7different types of shots. \u00b7 The crowd was very attentive and quiet for a sporting event, as David Litt (A&S, junior), moderator, described the player's actions. \"What John and Burt are doing now are called push shots,\" echoed Litt's voice in the P.A. system. It was suggested that the mike should be disgarded. Taimehill, dressed in a navy sweat suit with Ohio across the back, bounces the ball on his paddle a few times and served. His opponent, wearing striped navy and red socks, returned the serve and the volley but not for too long. Jacobs misses. A man who misses a ping-pong ball looks like a man who is bothered by gnats. All power is put into his swing, but with little success. Tannehill misses. \"Yeah! underdog,\" yells a girl in the audience. Board Rejects 'Responsibility' The Board of Directors decided Tuesday, May 11, to vote ~C's General Motors stock proxy agamst three proposals of the \"Project for Corporate Responsibility, Inc.\" The University, Senate and Students had urged the Board to consider the Project's proposals. They are: That a new by-law be adopted allowing shareholders to nominate candidates for the GM Board by petitions signed by l 00 shareholders or a shareholder of 1500 or more shares. \u00b7 That a new by-law be adopted to permit employees, consumers and dealers to participate in the nomination of three directors. That GM publish in its annual report new techniques of automotive air pollution control and motor vehicle safety, employment data by job category and minority groups, amounts of money spent on programs to improve pollution, safety and training, recruitment ~f minority groups and the increase m the number of minority owned dealerships. The Board's Budget and Finance Committee gave \"serious thought\" to the proposals and studied the GM management response. The committee said it \"clearly recognized the importance of greater safety of automobiles , protection of the environment, nondiscrimination in employment, etc. \"However, the Committee finds that the reasoning of the Corporation in recommending a vote against the proposals of the Project is more compelling than that of the Proj7ct\" \"The Committee further beheves that the most effective means of achieving the Project's objectives is not through moves against individual corporations but rather thr~ugh legislative channels. The Committee therefore endorses approval of Management's recommendations.\" John Schnure, student body president and representative on the Board, said, \"It is unfortunate that the Board ignored many of the arguments for the Project for Corporate Responsibility.\" \"The proposals attempted to remove some of the monopolistic concepts of General Motors and their process of proxy voting,\" Schnure concluded . Tannehill puts a spin on the ball, which hits on Jacobs' side on the table, and returns to Tannehill's side on its own, without Jacobs having touched it. The crowd was becoming more enthusiastic and more oos and ahs could be heard, as well as murmuring. Most spectators seemed to be amazed at the speed of the players and the distance they covered. Tannehill wins the flrst game and the players change sides to begin the second. During the second game, Tannehill gives the ball a little more energy by trying to blow it over the net. The ball fails to reach Jacobs' side. After Tannehill wins the second game, Dr. Eric Weise, assistant . professor of political science an_d former Ohio ranked table tennis player, rises from the stands to compete with Tannehill. Tannehill uses a small paddle, about half the size of a regular 1 paddle, until his lead narrows, 6-5. He then replaces this paddle with a regular size paddle. After Tannehill wins the third game, Tannehill, Jacobs, Dr. Weise, and Dr. Herbert Shapiro, assistant professor of history, discussed the political and cultural aspects of the visit to China. habrow Eleele A & S Tribunal President Eric Chabrow, former student senator, was elected Wednesday night president of the Arts and Science Tribunal. Karen Mignerey, a political science major, was elected vice-president. Other officers elected were Tom Zafers, treasurer; Juley Zimmerman, recording \u00b7 secretary ; and Ruthie Klette, corresponding secretary. \"The primary objective of the new Tribunal for the upcoming year,\" Chabrow said, \"is the establishment of departmental organizations enabling students to participate in departmental decisions.\" These organizations will be designed after the Political Science Student Association which recently helped eliminate the senior readings requirement from that department, Chabrow added. The Tribunal will also maintain a continuous watch over the A&S co-op concept, changes in present college requirements, and the institution of a General Studies program. An evaluation of Insight (A&S course evaluation) will also be studied by Tribunal during the next few months. Tannehill \u00b7 said table tennis is sponsored by the Chinese government and is the \"national hero sport\" of China, comparable to football in the U.S. The money will go to a fund to be used by the Dean of the Law School at his discretion to aid law students in the fomi of a scholarship or a temporary loan. In citing the difference between U.S. and Chinese culture, Tannehill said, \"The system in China is set up to produce as much as possible; our system is set up to consume as much as possible.\" Insight Inside Since 1955, and up to his appointment at lliinois State, Greenberg has served in. a number of positions at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo . He served as chairman of the political science department, and was a full professor, an associate professor, and an assistant professor. In a recent meeting of medical school seniors there was a 35-35 vote concerning the concept of donating cap and gown fees to a charity. The medical students tried to solve the dilemma of a tie vote but failed, according to Jerry Kurent '(medical senior). The prevailing sentiment at the meeting's conclusion, Kurent said, was an \"all for yourself attitude.\" Insight, the A&S course and teacher evaluation magazine, appears between pages 4 and 5 .. Insight was unable to appear in its regular magazine format this year for the . lack of an editorial staff. Richard Suarez, (A&S sophomore) is Insight's present editor. From 1952 to 1955, Greenberg was Instructor arid Research Associate of the Political Science Department and Bureau of Public Administration at the University of Tennessee. He noted that those medical students not wearing caps and gowns will meet in the near future to decide where their donations will go. John Purcell (undergraduate senior class president) said there were no plans for undergraduate graduates to do away with tradit~on and they will be wearing caps and gowns. Crockett was \u00b7appointed Acting Dean of A&S Sept. 1, 1970. He has been the director of the UC Institute RHA Holds Elections Tuesday\u00ad . Candidates to Speak at Forum RHA's frrst posterless election opens its polls Tuesday from 10 a.m.-7 p.m. in each residence hall. \"We have tried to discourage an election based on campaign posters by prohibiting any displays ~f thi~ . kind,\" said Ken Rosen, Election Comrruttee! Chairman. Instead of a paper campaign, two forums were scheduled to give the students the opportunity to meet and talk with the candidates .. The flrst was held Thursday. The second forum will be at Coffee House in Sidall Cafeteria at 8 p.m. Speeches will follow at 9. These forums, Rosen said, will promote direct and personal communications with the students. . \"Students will be able to vote for a person, not JUSt a name on a campaign poster,\" Rosen stated. The following is information concerning the presidential and vice-presidenti!d candidates . Presidential Candidates Steve Peritz (A&S Junior) believes \"that the residence halls should govern themselves ... \"The administration should realize that the people in the residence halls are mature men and women who no longer need to be coddled by a bureaucracy which acts in loco parentis,\" he said .. Peritz has served on the RHA Executive Council and as a member of the student government Legal Department. Experienced as a floo~ pr.esidel).t an9 Calhoun Hall Parlimentarian, he is also a member of the University Food Commission and chairman of the RHA Food Commission. \u00b7 Theresa Edell (CCM Junior) current President \u00b7 or Daniels Hall, thinks that \"the coming year should be directed towards the development of long range plans for residential living.\" Miss Ede11 has also had previous experience as a floor p~esident. . \"If elected,\" she said, \"I wtll see to It that the accomplishments of RHA reach their desired standards of excellence .\" Vice-Presidential Candidates Michael W. Cristiani (DAA Sophomore) contends that \"choice of facilities is the most important question.\" A former president of Dabney Hall, Cristiani believes that resident hall living \"can be an educational experience for those who choose it, but that it must be adaptable to the changing values, needs and desires of the students.\" Cristiani has served as a student on ijle Academic Affairs Department, Facilities and Services Committee, the University Building Committee, and the Advisory Committee to the University Registrar. He is also experienced as Chairman of the RHA Sander Hall Information, and Co-Educational Committees. \"The most important thing residents can do at this point is to have a real and responsible voice,\" he said. \"We have the power, let's accept it!\" Rob Sherman (A&S Junior) is the current president of RHA. \"Serving as president this year, I have been able to watch RHA grow into a thriving organization. Rather than leave the group completely, I am hoping to add imput as Vice President,\" he stated. \"The position does not make the man, the man makes the position!\" Running uncontended Conn (T.C. Freshman). Elections for Sander Hall were to be held at the same time, but a temporary restraiqing order has been issued by Greg Rose, chief justice of RHA court. The procedure for elections is defined in the Sander Hall Constitution which RHA ratified last week but a question was raised as to the leg)timacy of RHA ratifying Sander's Constitution. According to unofficial interpretations, the constitution must be ratified by those living in the hall itself. No students will occupy Sanders until next autumn. The contention is that if th~ Constitution is illegal then the elections are also illegitimate . The' RHA court met yesterday to consider the case. Page 2 UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI NEWS RECORD May 14, 1971 It's Happening At Brad Seiser XAVIER UNIVERSITY'S Black Studies Committee has released its final report, deploring what it called, \"ignorance and indifference toward black history and culture.\" The committee made this statement with its recommendations for a Black Studies Program at Xavier. The report noted that the primary purpose of the program would be to \"remedy the total indifference of the .Ameri'Can sy~tem of education to the needs of black people.\" How much does the average freshman spend on dates per week? Are women more impulsive buyers than men? These were some of the questions asked by a home economics major at ASHLAND COLLEGE . In response to the frrst question, 44 per cent of the freshmen polled said that they spend under five dollars, 47 per cent between I 0 and 15 dollars, while three per cent spend over 15 dollars per week. Other results showed that on a whole women are more impulsive buyers than men. Freshman applications for admission to OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY for the fall quarter 1971, are down I ,634 from the same period in 1970. It is believed by some at State that the economic slowdown has caused many students to put college off until the economy improves. Another reason for the drop in applications is due to the draft lottery and the increasing number of good community colleges. Barber shops in the vicinity of BRADLEY UNIVERSITY are having a difficult time making ends meet due to the increasing length of men's hair at that school. In the past 18 months, 25-30 barbers in the Peoria, Illinois area have turned to other vocations with steadier incomes. In an effort to get the Dean of Students office to have a greater understanding of the problems of the handicapped, each staff member, from deans to dorm directors at HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY, will spend a day in a wheelchair. The purpose of the program will be to have those who direct policies concerning handicapped students see the world as the handicapped see it. A WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY engineering researcher has employed a laser beam to help determine the function and flow properties of blood. Dennis K. Kreid, professor of mechanical engineering and a specialist in thermal and fluid systems, said \"The blood flow in small vessels was measured by employing the use of a laser and the phenomenon known as the Doppler effect.\" , Over 280 TEMPLE UNIVERSITY law students protested the attendence system in the Law School by walking to the sides of the classroom when attendence was taken in a recent class. The protest came less than two weeks after the Law School faculty voted by a narrow margin to continue with the existing system of taking attendence.

Elections for the PSSA were rained out Tuesday as only a dozen people were present at the groups meeting. It had been planned to select a fifteen member steering committee and a chairman for the group from those fifteen. A little arithmetic would show that it would be slightly difficult to pick fifteen, so PSSA will fmish the year under its present temporary leadership . According to the group, a handfull of people have done the work this year, but hopefully next year the group will encompass more students. If, by necessity, a small group of people will steer the group working for departmental improvements, according to Chip Zoller, acting chairman. Members hope to have next week, a newsletter to go to all political science majors, to familiarize and inform them of the association's activities. Petitions for next year's steering committee will soon be available in the Political Science office. The group has ratified its constitution, making it an official campus activity, and is now eligible to apply for funding from Budget Board. Bill Kump (A&S sophomore) exsponded on some of the group's goals. They include annihilation of political analysis requirement, placing more students on departmental committees, and including the American government course as going toward the 54 hours required for majors.

The people who caine weren't lobbying against the war or even meeting the stated goal of stopping the government. They built a unity, maybe even a spiritual alliance between people who are disillused with some basic American precepts. The first impression of the Mayday festival which took place in a several block area around West Potomac Park in Washington was that that there was an almost mystical atmosphere pervading the area. On April 24 almost half a million people had joined together to march against the war, to pressure the government to end it. This time however people had come to build a life style which is strongly opposed to not only the war, but what the people considered injustices which are inherent in the American government. Saturday's speakers spoke of self-liberation, women's liberation, gay liberation, meditation, Zen Buddism, and stopping a government which they regarded as totally immoral. The speakers spoke not only against U.S.\u00b7 involvement in Southeast Asia, but of the \"exploitive\" attitude of the American government which resulted in the Vietnam war, and alleged repression in the U.S. against Blacks, women, gays, dope smokers, and others. They talked of building a unity between the people in Washington based on cooperation . The atmosphere Saturday was purely festive. Groups such as the Beach Boys, Mitch Rider and the Detroit Wheels and folk singers such as Joan Baez, and Phil Ochs entertained the gathering of 100,000-200,000 people. Between the groups speakers such as Rene Davis spoke. The audience either sat and listened, roamed about, watched the Mari Grishna dancers, played their own instruments , or just talked. There was also a rather large quantity of dope openly available which later resulted in a number of overdoses. The atmosphere was similar to a pop festival and if one wanted to define \"Woodstock Nation\" I guess thi~ would be it. There were lines of tents, buses, trucks, sleeping bags, a Vietcong, peace, and American flags. Sunday the people were thrown out of the park at 6:00 a.m. by riot police, many hovering just over the ground in helicopters. About half the people left the city when the park was closed and the remaining people scrambled for places to meet, organize, and lodge. This was furnished by Washington churches and universities. The organization was unique. Everyone divided into affinity groups of 4 to 1 0 people, which comprised contingents representing cities which in turn comprised regions several states. Each region was assigned to a different main artery entering Washington. The purpose of the affinity groups was to prevent interference from Federal agents and so that the people in a group would take care of any member who was arrested or hurt. The atmosphere was tense Sunday night. Troops were coming into the city and already were patrolling the streets in jeeps. Police were guarding every store in the downtown area. Monday the troops were well prepared and the contingents were not able to stay together and block the designated areas intermitently . Affinity groups ended up wandering through downtown Washington blocking traffic here and there and then running and going somewhere else when the police came. Some affinity groups remained in their own cars and faked flat tires or engine trouble in order to block traffic. Other groups placed trash and other materials in front of traffic. The demonstraters did manage to tie up traffic in some areas, but were for the most part helpless against the police reaction. Teargas was widely used and many demonstrators were beaten, often without any direct provocation, aid many police as well as commuters simply tried to run them over. Tactically. the Mayday actiyitie_s were a loss. During the week there were over 10,000 arrests (the highest Danny Fishbein nurhber of arrests at one event ~ U.S. history) and traffic was delayed at most a few hours. Yet most of the people that were there felt it was a victory in another sense. There was sort of a new found unity. In spite of great risks, the people there had banded together to blo~k traffic and had certainly disrupted the city enough to require almost 10,000 police, guardsmen, and troops. In the face of generally violent policy opposition, the protests generally remained nonviolen t. Furthermore, while traffic was blo~ked people talked about the war to those commuters that would listen. Here and there someone was . receptive. There was a bus driver for example who helped use his bus to bloqk traffic. There were also a number of troops that actually joined the demonstration they were supposed to block. The significance of Mayday lies in the establishment of a sort of anti+war lifestyle. One that was also evident at the Chicago convention. A lifestyle which won't tolerate what it regards as an exploitive and inhumane government. One thing \u00b7 that was clear however was that the United States is now~re nearing a physical revolution. PQIJI{aps a moral or spiritual revolutlffn, but the government remains tacticly far ahead of those who oppose it.

Also on the cabinet in Chip Zoller, student body vice-presiden t. Although all the executive departments strive to carry out legislation passed in the Senate, Duclaux of academic affairs, foresees the possibility of initiating new' legislation through his department. A new grading standard, establishment of \u00b7 college grievance committies , teacher-course evaluations and cross campus accredidation , are some of the ideas the departmen t will be considering, according to Duclaux and Schnure. Duclaux also noted that the Academic Affairs Department will serve as a liason between student government and Dr. Warren G. Bennis, president elect of UC. The Communicati ons and Relations Department plans to bring the student body into closer communication with student govern'ment by distributing a ~tionl_:laire . on ~he relevancy of student government and what it means to students. The department also has plans to involve more students in the summer orientation pro$rams and will publish a newsletter pertaining to government affairs, according to Schnure. -\u00b7 Non:academic affairs such as parking, the physical plant and student organizations will be the concern of the Internal Affairs Department and Secretary Braden. Parking lot improvements and an investigation into numerous appeals of parking offenses backed up in student court will be studied. Also plans to relocate WFIB and investigate the possibility of library services being cut because of a lack of funds. Among the responsibilities of the External Affairs Department 'will be to maintain official relationships with other universities and also to be aware of any local, state or national actions that might concern the student body. A study of student life insur~nce programs and meetings with other schools to fmd out what policies they have that might be implimented at UC, Schnure pointed out. In addition to being the official representative of the student government before the student court, Attorney General Conn will serve as legal advisor to the president , cabinet and senate and will a8sist ) May 14, 1971 Innovation Group To Attain Better Communications Ronald W. Aitken Feature Writer Attention, A&S students! Do you have an idea, a complaint, or a suggestion that would benefit everyone? If the answer is yes, then the Committee on Innovation in Student Contacts is enlisting your support. It wants to know what the student feels are the grass-root, nitty-gritty problems of the college. The Committee was started last spring to seek out ways of obtaining better communication between faculty, administration, and students. It consists of nine A&S faculty staff members, four undergraduate students, and is headed by Dr. Kenneth Donnelly Head of the Speech & Theater Department. The majority of the members were appointed by Guy Stern former acting dean of A&S'dand the remaining mem\u00ad bers volunteered. When a problem or suggestion is received a solution is discussed in the main committee, and recommendations are made to the college office. Sub-committee's follow-up and develop the full \u00b7 committee discussions. One of the first problems considered was the facutly advising system. It. was found that a vast majority of A&S students did not even know who their advisor's were. The committee \u00b7 analyzed the problem, made recommendations to the college Dean and now claims a new advising system that has had great success. A problem that one of the sub-committees is working on now is a commuter room in McMicken. They are seeking a large room \u00b7without vending machines and music, primarily for the students use as a study. area. \"Another problem we are discussing is registration. We find that the student is penalized because of class closings in the registration lines,\" said Dr. Donnelly. -\u00b7 \"We are devising a system where a board is set up outside the registration rooms showing what classes have been closed. There would be someone from the college at the board for immediate assistance to the student. This system is designed so that the student will not have to chase all over ~ampus to complete the registration process,\" he continued. If everything goes according to plan, A&S students will be taking advantage of this next year in the . autunin registration. \u00b7 Now, you have something to say?

R.H.A. treasurer, Frank Eilberg (B.A. freshman) attributes this phenomenon to a policy of conservative spending in this, the organization's initial year. Eilberg explained that the RHA felt such parsimony expedient until a clear picture of the association's total expenses could be realized. President of RHA, Robert Sherman (A&S junior) noted further that due to last Spring's pre-mature closure, RHA elections could not be held until the autumn quarter of the current academic year. In consequence, RHA has been f~nctioning for only_ two quarters, Frisbee Tonite Students throwing a frisbee for accuracy, for distance, and for ''doing their own thing\" can be seen tonight at the Frisbee Tournament to be held at the trackfield 8:30 tonight. Frisbees from the Whamo-0 Inc. as weU as cash prizes will be awarded to those contestants who are judged the best in each of the three categories. A rock band will be present. R~sidence Hall Association and the University Program Council are sponsoring the event. thus advancing on an economic cushion. E ilberg, estimates that the $4,000 remaining this year constitutes about 12% of RHA's total budgetary allocation. Unlike most other UC student activities, RHA is financed not through the Budget Board, but directly from resident student fees. This factor may in part account for the organization's financial stability. Presently, RHA is considering various options for the disbursement of its surplus. The only finalized plan to date calls for the expenditure of $500 or more on the association's Symposium, being held this week. No definite expense ceiling has been affixed 'to this proj~ct. Perhaps, the most elaborate proposal still under consideration, calls for the purchase of several refrigerators, rentable by dorm students at a cost comparably favorable to maintaining their own. As described by Sherman, . RHA would realize a small profit in such an endeavor. An~ther recent' proposal, described by Eilberg\u00b7, is the creation of exercise room in Sander Hall, similar to the one being added to Calhoun. Currently, no precise dollar figures have been attached to these possible designs. I Sherman emph~sized that these are only proposals. RHA apparently has no itchy fingers for spending the surplus in the immediate future. \"Financially, we're in great shape,\" stated Sherman, noting afterward that RHA had actually begun this year plagued by. debt, transferred from the no+t defunct Men's Residence Hall Association. Sherman spoke confidently of greater things to come next year; primary was the sponsorship of a distinguished spe~er series. Both he and IEilberg-predicted larger dormitory allocations in 71-72, and promised a more liberal, codified expenditure of RHA funds. RHA can, indeled, find testimony to its enviable fir\\ancial status in the assurance of treasurer Eilberg, \"We have a lot of plans for the money. It'll be put to good use.\" : SeX IS YOUR BUSINESS : birth eontrol guRs We believe y~ privateiite should be-your own.

WFIB-Ciouded Future WFIB Radio, UC's student station recently celebrated its tenth birthday. There seems to be doubt in minds of some as to how many more birthdays they will celebrate at least at their present location. Under pressure because of a space shortage in CCM, WFIB has been told by the radio-television department of CCM that the station's room allocation will be cut back if it remains in its offices there. A cutback in WFIB's operations and services would probably result, especially since there are not sufficient University funds to re-establish the station properly elsewhere on campus. Talk of any cutback of WFIB's operation is' disturbing. We believe WFIB is important to its listeners and to UC in general, in addition to its training value to the WFIB staff. The station is regarded as one of the top student stations in the country by professionals as well as by other college broadcasters. WFIB's importance as a news source has been proven repeatedly, particularly in the Spring demonstrations last year. The matter is to be decided in a hearing May 26 before the University Space Allocations Committee. We believe the following critical points merit the committee's attention: Is WFIB, as the only fully-functioning broadcast facility in the radio-television department, part of that department; if not, why not? Does CCM have the authority to move the station or cut back its operation without consent of the University Space Allocations Committee? What are the future plans for WGUC-FM in CCM? All of these questions need careful examination. WFIB itself has not requested a move. Station management personnel note that they would prefer to remain where they are now. They emphasize that in a move' initiated by others, any cutback of their operation is unacceptable. We would add that a cutback is unacceptable ta the university community as well. General Motors Vote On Tuesday, the Board of Directors rejected a proposal referred to it by the University Senate that the University vote its General Motors stock proxy in favor of proposals advanced by the \"Project for Corporate Responsibility.\" We consider the Board's action unfortunate, for two reasons: they chose to overrule the expressed will of the University Senate, and by extension the collective University judgement, and second, because they turned their backs on considerations of pressing public interest. Key provisions in the \"Project's\" proposals aimed at gaining greater voice on the GM Board of Directors for ecological considerations. The measures urged, for example, that a new by-law be adopted allowing shareholders to nominate candidates for the GM board by petition signed by 1 00 shareholders or a shareholder of 1500 or more shares. The second proposal called for a new by-law to permit employees, consumers, and dealers to participate in the nomination of three directors. The \"Project\", a student group founded in 1968 at the Georgetown Law Center to make corporate business more mindful of broad social needs, hoped through these measures to place persons on the GM board who are interested in industry-caused environmental problems. A third proposal would have required GM to publish new techniques of automotive air pollution control and mbtor vehicle safety, and related information, in its annual report. We would like to observe that the proposals would help bring about increased awareness of environmental problems in an industry. In addition to the social desirability of such awareness, we point to the vote of the University Senate in favor of the proposals. We can only voice regret that UC's Directors did not act upon these considerations. UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI NEWS RECORD May 14, 1971 Blues From D.C. Jail ..__--------------~John Small----~ Ed. Note: This is the first part of a three part series by John Small, A&S '71. John was a\"ested in Washington during the May-day demonstrations and spent some time in the D. C. jaiL BLUES FROM D.C. JAIL, Part 1 Whatever you read about last week's anti-war demonstrations in Washington, don't believe it. Most press reports labeled it a flop. It was not. Many anti-war activists called it a \"victory.\" It was not. This column, though, will not concern itself with the success or failure of the week's events, only one aspect of them-the jails. I arrived in Washington at 1:30 a.m., Tuesday morning, May 4. We had no trouble fmding a church to sleep in but few felt like sleeping. I stayed up' all night talking to those who had suiVived Monday's round and gradually became aware that the Washington authorities had no good feelings towards those who had come to redress their grievances. Traces of tear gas still lingered within the church which had been gassed early that afternoon for harboring demonstrators. Being the type who likes to ~e for himself, I sauntered out onto the streets at 7:00a.m. and found what appeared to be a normal morning's activities. There were businessmen and secretaries going to work, traffic was flowing freely, and only a few protestors were anywhere to be seen. I took a rather nice tour of the city sort of following the helicopters which noisily flew overhead. By about 9:00, I was entering Dupont Circle which, again, was clogged more by police and soldiers than anyone else. We stood at a crosswalk waiting for the light when a squad of scooter cops buzzed by and advised us to \"move on or be arrested.\" We chose to move on and headed down Massachusetts Ave. AWAY from Dupont Circle. We were discussing that whole experience when we heard the old scooter boys again. We had made it halfway down the block when they roared alongside, jumped the curb, and stopped right in front of us. The sergeant arrived and hollered, ''I want him and him and him and him. Give them a disorderly. If they run, split their heads.\" One man ran immediately and they clubbed him hard. I threw my hands straight up and said nothing. I was scared. I didn't know what was going on. A policeman moved toward me and told me to sit down. I did. He threw my friend down. He wanted my name and address. I asked him what I had done wrong. He still wanted my name and address. I told him. Conspicuously absent was his badge and nameplate. A paddy wagon soon rumbled 4own the street, made a U-turn, and halted near us. We were taken to the rear of the wagon, photographed with our arresting officer (polaroid style), and tossed into the wagon. \"Don't hit your head on the rooT,\" an officer told each of us. No one answered. The minute the door slammed shut everyone lit up a cigarette. Really, what else could you do? There were eight of us and each began to tell his tale: a Vietnam vet out for less than a month, several students, two Women's Lib freaks. It was also a good geographical cross-section. A social worker could have run an interesting study on us. Minutes later, we were backing into a precinct house. ' \u00b7 I was really excited. This was my first arrest and I was quite unprepared for it. The smoke was by\u00b7 now quite dense inside the van but I could see several policemen chatting and joking outside. The door opened and out we went. \"Another load,\" an officer yelled. The Reader~s V oiee Unthinking Loyalty To the Editor: I have come across an article in the UC News Record written by the distinguished Lew Moores. Mr. Moores wrote a very cutting article about an article by Arnold Toynbee. Not having read Toynbee's article, I cannot comment on the justness of Mr. Moores' remarks concerning its quality. It was his attitude concerning peace and people who desire peace which upset me and prompted me to write this. Mr. Moores makes it apparent th~t not only does he disagree with Toynbee's \"philosophical incantations\" about the criminality of war, but thinks the worse of Toynbee for having the empty-tJ_eaded.ness to think that war should be abolished. The article also complains that Toynbee's article offered no solution to war. It is as you say, Mr. Moores: \"perhaps this is because he cannot.\" Millions of people in this frantic world are too bogged down in the tradition of killing those with whom they disagree. Mr. Moores complains that Toynbee raises questions but \"answers nothing.\" How do you answer thousands of years of hate? Many people today are finally \u00b7 questioning war. There is no answer yet. War is a carryover from a more \u00b7 barbarous day, a carryover which \u00b7 certainly will not die within our lifetimes. Men bear grudges against nations which in the past warred with their own; they fear and hate men who \"talk different\" or have \"weird customs\" or, God forbid, \"immoral habits,\" and will kill for these reasons. I cannot help but see a , comparison between war and street gang fights. My gang is best, and you'd better not say nothing against my gang or we'll come and bash your head in. All too often, however, it is not only the belligerent who gets hurt. In war as well as in street gang fights, innocent bystanders become casualties; though the con~quences in war are much more tragic. Mr. Moores' chilling comment on this: \"Women and children and non-combatants are killed simply because women and children. tind non-combatants exist. \"My God! Why didn't we see it that way before? Now, when a pilot drops napalm on a _woman and her child, he can console himself, \"Well, if she didn't exist, her and her baby never would've got killed.\" We have to understand that war is man's natural occupation; living and enjoying life are peripheral activities. The pedestrian who is killed by a drunken driver died simply because he existed; the car, its driver, his drunken state, had nothing to do with it. Is this what you mean, Mr. Moores, or have I misinterpreted your statement? I certainly hope I have. The article also declares that it is naive to believe that differences can be resolved at a negotiating table. Are we to try to believe that war resolves differences? And how's this for a slogan \"worn sterile by empty heads\": \" ... peace can only be achieved if a nation is willing to wage war to secure it. \" If we destroy the other guy, of course Resident Living: Change '---------Mike Cristiani The News Record editorial of 7 May 1971, entitled \"A 26-Story Mistake\" ended with the statement, \"In the meanwhile, students who reject to the policy have no genuine, responsible recourse other than signing the Residence Hall Association's petition voicing objection to the policy, or, as RHA again advises, to note on their housing applications that they are applying for campus housing only because coerced by official University regulations. We urge them to do so.\" This statement is rather inaccurate, as have been most of the emotional comments made during the past few weeks about on-campus housing regulations and applications. The News Record defined the petition (the petition was not an RHA-sponsored event) as the only \"genuine, responsible recourse\" for students who object to the housing policies of the University. The editorial does not point out that there was substantial opposition to the petition in the Residence Halls Association Executive Council although it was unanimously opposed to UC's housing regulations. Since the News Record did not present the whole scope of the story, it would be advantageous, if the rest of the picture was presented. This opinion constitutes a philosophy of resident living, and discussed the reasons for dissent against the petition in the RHA Executive Council. TWs opinion holds that residence hall living at this University can be, at least, an educational experience for those who might choose it. The new friendships, challenged ideas, appreciation for the rights of others, and the feeling of being part of a group can all contribute to obtaining a well-rounded college experience. However, the option to live in a hall must belong to the students. The different configurations of spaces in each of the residence halls present at least some choices for residential living experiences. But, since the housing policy of the University states that most students under the age of 21, who cannot fmd approved housing as per the regulations, are required to live in University residence halls, the ultimate choice of living situations is clearly limited. This policy obscures the educational value of resident living. The atmosphere conducive to the pursuit of knowledge of all kinds-the development of \u00b7 Educational Environments for living-should be the goal of the Residence Hall Coordination Office and the Residence Halls Association. The programs presently instituted by both of these groups, indicate a misunderstanding of the changing needs and desires of the resident community as it evolves. Perhaps we are not equipped to hear or to see what is really being said. Hope for a better living-learning environment now really depends on the co-operative approach to the evolving problems and their subsequent alternative solutions. It should be the primary goal of administration, staff, and resident students to provide any student the opportunity to make the final choice of his-living situation, either off-campus or in University residence halls or apartments. The students must remember, however, the financial needs of the. University. Resident students should be guaranteed accomodation of their particular life styles. This University should encourage residence hall and apartment building construction companies to add to the private housing stock available to students by building residence halls and apartments, the facilities of which parallel students' values, needs and desires. If the above statements reflect the present concerns of a majority of resident students, it is evident that those statements call for change from the present housing policies of this University. The underlying philosophy here is that the University is a community AT ALL TIMES. Therefore the above statements are not framed as demands. Instead of satisfying only the vested interests of particular groups within this University, the changes in policy suggested would benefit the entire University community. If this philosophy of resident living is at all valid, and if it is true that this University can be a community at all times, then the methods we use to determine the values, needs, and desires of this community regarding resident living must be completely objective in character. It should be one of the primary goals of RHA to know what are the values, needs, and desires of resident students. However, the methods and procedures which RHA used to find out student opinion regarding the University housing contracts for the 1971-1972 academic year, are not in keeping with the purpose of RHA, expressed in its Constitution. To believe that the actions which RHA suggested will be effective in changing the existing policies is naive. The two recommendations from RHA have perhaps encouraged more than the usual number of students to return their new contracts either unsigned or signed with a note requesting release from the contract as per present regulations. Such actions will further limit the student's choice in housing, since these contracts are considered last. It is clear that RHA has not acted in response to the felt values, needs, and desires of the resident population at the present time. Since residence hall living is undeniably a dynamic experience, demanding opportunities for constant change, it is evident that the short-sighted, static attitude of RH A cannot respond to the problems of resident living. , Valuable change is most often accomplished and the public interest is most often met through long-range planning, based on a thorough understanding of the problem. The conflict-oriented response to which RHA ,has committed itself at this time, lacks the comprehensiveness to produce valid change. It has no place in a University setting. The mistrust these attitudes represent are the antithesis of community. Hopefully it is community which we are striving to achieve. he won't give us any more trouble ... for a while. Mr. Moores expresses the \"sincere\" hope that pleas for peace will remain \"consigned to the editorial pages of newspapers and scrawled with crayon on placards.\" Why? Is it harmful to publicly call for an end to hate and pain? Surely, such a call does go against long-established traditions; man has always been violent. But does this mean he must continue to be so? The article says, \"For Toynbee to maintain that it is unnatural for man to wage war is tantamount to saying that history . need be re-examined ... \" (Mr. Moores believes that peace is\u00b7 unnatural.) For Toynbee to say that war is an unnatural activity is not to say that war did not take place, but that if man were to use his natural intelligence he would realize its senselessness. A rational man can outgrow irrational, unthinking loyalty (\"My country, right or wrong, but my country ... \") and treat other men as his brothers. Tom Sloper Grad Student Sense of Dismay To the Editor: Philip Sicker's front page news analysis\" of May 11, \"What happens if UC closes?,\" left me with a sense of dismay not because it raised the restless ghost of last spring, but because the image produced was such a fuzzy one. The problem begins in the fist sentence, where we are asked .. what would happen if this university were forced to close.\" The blurring of focus thus established by the use of the passive voice remains untouched throughout the article, until the quote from Dean Scully that provides the closing note and completes the confusion: \"I think the students realize that they were the losers last year. I don't think it will happen again.\" The perhaps inadvertent implication of all this is that last spring students deliberately forced the closing of school, a move they have since learned would only . hurt them as individuals. Let's keep the record clear. Only a very few of the protesters involved in last. spring's activities hoJ?ed that therr efforts would effect the closing of schooL The administration voluntarily chose to close the school, offering the explanation that they feared violence would erupt if the protests continued. Whether or not it would have erupted thus remains an \u00b7unanswerable : question. It is clear, however, that what the vast majority of involved students did learn was not that closing the school would hurt _.them, but that their idealistically motivated protests could achieve no other response than the closing of school. This, 1 believe, is the primary reason for this year's relative quiet. Karin G. Rabe Grad. student, Dept. of English Student Concerts To the editor: Re: Your article of May 11 concerning student concerts. Over and over in the article, it is suggested that the reason for the Concert Committee's $14,000 loss and subsequent cancellation of the Spring Concert is due to a lack of student support. Reasoning such as this shows an extreme lack of insight by all parties concerned. It is quite unfair to olame the student body for not turning out in droves for (Continued on page 5) 4 ' \\ I . \" \\) .. / l J ''f ' r --.--.-- INSIGHT '71 This year's Insight ranks below last year's edition in both quantity and quality of evaluations. There are two reasons for this. First, Insight suffered the loss of two editors in the course of one year. This, understandably, caused much tunnoil. And secondly, there was a general lack of student support. Insight is highly regarded by the Arts and Science College so the decision was made to publish it, even if it meant a limited edition. Next year, with a good editorial staff and student support, we hope to put out a complete evaluation, worthy of the name Insight.

DILLINGHAM Evaluation: Students evaluation of the course were both complimentary and critical on class material. Some students felt the course was excellent and highly infonnative with good lectures and easy tests. But then again, students criticized Mrs. Dillinaham for covering too much infonnation which was often trivial. Several students felt the text was inadequate. GOTTSCHANG Evaluation : \u00b7Evaluating Dr. Gottschang's course is an impossibility, to say the least, due to the varied opinions of the students in the class. But a few definite points can be made. Dr. Gottschang is a knowledgeable professor, who exhibits a tremendous amount of enthusiasm in his lecture. He definitely cares about the course. But there is also strong opinion that his tests are unfair; loaded with trick questions . One student summed up the enigma surrounding Dr. Gottschang: \"Dr. Gottschang is in all fairness an egotistical teacher.\" 11)2.2 12)-13)3.0 (C) 202 ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY MISS WHITNEY Evaluation : Students generally saw this course as being good. The instructor seemed to cover the material well and knows the subject well although some felt that the instruc tor assumed more backgro~nd preparation than they -t l:: > ~.l-..(s I (, .. :;\\ .ll had. Some felt that the labs were a waste of time, that the T A did not know the material. There were also some students who thought that exams were either too difficult or unfair. In spite of the large size of the class, the instructor does take the time and trouble to try to know all students as well as possible and to help them individually. N= 105 1)3.0 FRASER Evaluation: The overall evaluation of this course tends to fall between \"poor\" and \"fair\". Consistant comments from students are: not nearly enough credit ( 2 hrs.) for the work involved, too much emphasis on trivial aspects of organism classification systems, and very difficult final ,exams. Labs are programmed using tape recorded instruction-and not always very clearly recorded at that. A pretty accurate summary of the course seems to be: \"This course emphasizes the wrong data. When breaking the course down to just what is its purpose, one finds it is an exercise in memory ... more emphasis should be placed on describing the subject. One can always check a book for genus and 372 URBAN ECOLOGY MR. MILLER Evaluation: The class met with two main criticisms: lectures were usually too fast, making note taking difficult, and notes on the blackboard were sometime s hard to read. Texts used in the course were thought to be poor. Lectures contained too much graphical and statistical information , according to some. Students felt the name of the course was a misnomer . They felt it was more of a substitute for Dr. Dreyer's Ecology course than an Urban Ecology course. The students regarded Dr. Umminger's indepth presentation of this broad subject as very good and interesting. It was no surprise to find one student praising the reading material since they used \"Scientific American.\" Testing was regarded as very fair by one student. Another wished to see more time for class discussion. Dr. Gottschang's knowledge of the subject area coupled with his \"contagious\" enthusiasm account for students rating this course as being excellent. There is not text for the course, the bulk of the material being given in very interesting lectures and field work. Grades are based on a paper and exams which are reported to be very difficult. .All in all, the course is described as being interesting and well worth the time. GIST Evaluation Most students felt that this course should have been spread over two (2) quarters due to the abundance of material presented . One factor that made this course worthwhile and enjoyable was the enthusiasm and excellent lecturing of Dr. Gist. However, many students felt that the grading was hard, the compr ehensive final too demanding and the tenn paper AMERICAN LITERATURE MR. MILLER Evaluation --2A- -JF.--\"The instructor of this course is excellent.\" The students of this claSs were most complimentary to Dr. Miller. The only complaint about him dealt with the incohesiveness of his lectures. However, the most predominant impression was that \"Dr. Miller teaches more than English to his students ... about society and what is going F AABORG Evaluation: The comment was made that this course is not the typical course and this should be taken into consideration. Students felt Mrs. Faaborg to be \"interesting and interes ted in students .\" Complaints dealt with course material rather than with the professor . Students wanted more practical experience and less theory. MRS. HARVEY Evaluation: Dr. Harvey is decidedly accomplished as a teacher of Shakespeare . Most often commented upon was her enthusiasm and knowledge. Students found the course challenging, but worthwhile . Dr. Harvey has a universe of knowledge to Dr. Mull's course was rated as \"more than adequate.\" In fact, all complaints had to do with surpluses--too much material to be covered, too much knowledge that Dr. Mull assumed the student knows, and too much dictionary work to understand what Dr. Mull says. Most students felt, however, that \"he is very interesting, apparently brilliant-a credit to the MRS. HARVEY Evaluation: Mrs. Harve)' is evidently a very good teacher. Studen ts complained of course material being deadly dull, but they were all enthusiastic about Mrs. Harvey's awesome knowledge and witty sense of CENTURY LITERATURE MR. FOX Evaluation : Even though Mr. Fox is teaching out of his field, students were impressed by his obvious knowledge and contagious enthusiasm. Any complaints lay more with what was taught than with how it was taught. Most students found this course worthwhile-\"! CRITICAL PROSE OF THE ROMANTIC PERIOD MR. CHARD Evaluation: Few students commented . Those who did were generally pleased with Dr. Chard. One student felt it was a great course because \"Chard is always happy.\" Emphasis in complaints was on the things which all students complain about: large classes and PROSE AND POETRY MR. COFFIN Evaluation : There may have been a variety of opinions as to the class, but the students agreed that Mr. Coffin is very knowledgeable. The greatest polarity of answers was to question nine, where students attuned to Mr. Coffin's low-key style rated him 4, and those not so attuned rated him 2. There were relatively few comments, but the majority of them were very favorable. One student did say that Mr. Coffin needs to involve the class as a whole, not just particular students POETRY MR. WOLFF Evaluation: Dr. Wolff received high scores from students due to his impressive knowledge of the subject materiaL Several students commented on Dr. Wolff's objectivity in regards to the poetry. Some enjoyed his lack of subjectivity, others felt it made the treatment of poetry a science. Dr. Wolff's only real difficulty seems to be communicating his ideas in an interesting CRITICISM MR. ATKINSON Evaluation : Students were impressed by Dr. Atkinson's knowledg e but expressed a fear of grades. There is minimal feedback due to the course set-up and anxiety was apparent . However. a student commented , \"The course is not an easy A-B course, but well worth the reading and time.\" L LINGUISTICS MR. LASHER Evaluation : This course is rated \"excellent\" by the students taking it. The central reasons for this evolve around the instructor. He seems to maintain \"a great rapport with his students ... he really knows his ... 501 SOCIAL student said that Dr. Lundgren \"comes across as very interested in what he is teaching and communicates the feeling of being down to earth and easy to approach.\" He is considered dynamic and enthusiastic, and an excellent instructor. However, Dr. Lundgren's excellence as a teacher fails to sufficiently make up for the tremendous amount of difficult outside work required. In addition to a full reading load, students were required to do a group research project on an experiment which they set up. The papers then had to be \"prepared ready for publication.\" Most students felt that for a mere three hours credit (for each of the two quarters), it simply wasn't worth it. There was too little guidance, the projects were too professional, and a group of five is difficult to get together. Testing was objective rather than.essay, probably due to the size of the class, and was thought to be too picky. It might be suggested that if the present requirements are to continue, the credit hours be increased to at least 5 a quarter. Many students thought the research would be well worth the time if more credit was given for it. As it is, Dr. Lundgren's abilities are obscured by the large amount of work required. SPEECH AND THFA TER ARTS 211 SPEECH CORRECTION Evaluation: Although comments were favorable, many students said that the title of the course was misleading, feeling that it covered language development rather than speech correction. Mrs. Kretschme r was praised for her teaching ability. Several people commented that her wit and humor greatly enhanced the lectures. Most of the students criticized the \"dry statistical textbook .\" The general feeling about the book seems to be summed up in one student's statement, \"My eyes are crossed from reading all those meaningless charts and graphs.\" Although burdened with a boring text, the class seemed otherwise pleased and felt the course was interesting and meaningful. 311 INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGY DR. \"Dr. Donnelly is always well prepared and presents difficult concepts clearly and concisely. He is both interesting and knowledgeable -a rare quality in college instructors.\" This comment, typical of those offered by students in Introduction to Audiology indicates a great deal of respect for Dr. Donnelly and an appreciation of his ability. The material was hard and often technical, but the presentation was excellent, and Dr. Donnelly was thought to provide \"a good atmosphere for learning.\" One student pointed out that \"few people would find the anatomy of the ear creatively stimulating, but Dr. Donnelly managed to make it so.\" Another said, \"I used to think sound waves were magic, and now I understand them.\" Obviously, Dr. Donnelly is a talented instructor. 388 ADVANCED ORAL INTERPRE TATION: PROSE Evaluation: Students seemed very pleased with this course and enjoyed Dr. Jisha. Most felt they had learned a great deal and were interested in continuing with this course. Dr. Jisha's wit and humor added a great deal to the class; few comments were given but no one seemed disappointed or unsatisfied. Evaluation: The scarcity of comments made it difficult to write an evaluation. However, all commenters agreed KAROLY Evaluation: This course is arranged by topics in the field of personality . The theories of personality were presented for the most part in an interesting manner. The reading material fluctuated from very interesting to painfuHy boring. .Students reported that tests tended to be ambiguous and sometimes too demanding. However, many options are available to students to bring up their grade (like outside papers, etc.). Dr. Karoly was described as having a really great sense of humor, initiating and welcoming discussion and questions, and in general relating very well to his students. He is extremely flexible and overall has an interesting and good 202 INTERMEDIATE SPANISH MRS. CARROLL Evaluation: . Overall, the course was a good one. Few students could doubt Mrs. Carroll's enthusiasm and depth of knowledge . Some students felt the assignments were too lengthy. Another complaint . was that too much emphasis was put on added that field and research work \u00b7 are important elements. N= ORGANIZATIONS MR. BOGART Evaluation: In general this seems to be a good course-o.;e that's \"interesting\" and \"where a great deal about organizations can be learned.\" B The course is structured around 202 INTERMEDIATE FRENC lectures and small group work. MRS. GOEPPER The small groups are organized as Evaluation: work teams and they produced an \"The course is excellent,\" wrote annotated bibliography as the one student. \"It should not be class project.

As one student put it, \"He gives 171 VOICE AND ARTICULATION MRS. FREEMAN Evaluat~on: The major gripe against Voice and Articulation is with its discussion groups. Most students feel that \u00b7they get absolutely nothing from these groups which meet once a week. Since many students are required to take this course, some of the students are forced to sit through lectures in which they feel is boring. But Mrs. Freeman does have ample support from some students who feel they learned sufficiently the basics of voice operation. The students were near unanimous on the sentiment that either Mrs. Freeman needs a smaller room or a louder voice. Evaluation: This course is designed as an overview of communications media-now. It covers many different forms of current communication like TV advertisements, plays, ialms, etc. with many examples (video tape, short films, etc.) used in the class. The format of this course is primarily a discussion \u00b7 session which didn't come off as well as it could have because of the large size of the class. Students report that Dr. Verderber is a very interesting and enthusiastic prof who spent a great deal of timing preparing for his classes and that his preparation helped make the \u00b7 course exciting. Course grades are Although overall the course was rated \"good,\" student evaluations range from \"it's hard and required a lot of work\" to \"if I can get through this course, anyone can.\" The i.nstl'uctor is said to have done ''his utmost\" to make the best of an exceedingly dry course. Some felt that the multiple choice exams were hard for the material covered in the book and lectures. This is a. required course for psychology majors and as one \u00b7 student said, \"how interesting can you make a stat course?\" Most students felt that this is an excellent course primarily because of Dr. Huvos' interesting lectures. He is very good at relating the novels to contemporary situations. There is not much class discussion (mostly lectures) but students are free to bring up questions when they have one. In this class the instructor speaks in French but often translates the ; important points which makes things much easier to understand.

WHALEY Evaluation: \"The only thing bad about this course is the time it's offered.\" The opinion of one student seems to be the opinion of the majority. Students taking this course described Prof. Whaley as \"warm, involved, aware.\" Clearly this is one class where the instructor makes the course. Some students cited the freedom and unstructured nature of the course and added that initiative was necessary to succeeed. O.ne student felt that the materi~l W!lS 7)3.6 8)3.6 the students and 11)3.2 12)-13)- frequent ' discussions made the class a very stimulating _ intellectual experience.

Many felt a single imal exam 12)-13)- SPEECH AND THEATER ARTS 141 FUNDAMENTALS OF SPEECH MISS HEIDER Evaluation: The section being evaluated is designed for students with a lack of confidence in public speaking. The vast majority of the comments were favorable towards Miss Heider and the way she presented public speaking to tbe students. The discussions after the speeches were very valuable and enabled the students to hear evaluation of their speeches. One student concluded, \"People were not numbers which is very important to learning. The course was fun and one in which students can greatly benefit.\" \\\u00b7-202 PUBLIC SPEAKING MR. LASHLEY AND STYLES OF ACTING STAFF Evaluation: This course is taught by grad students and the value is determined by the grad student assigned to the section. The student evaluated, Dee Helsel, was enthusiastic and interested. The comment could be made that \"finally you learn something This course rated very highly. Students thought the instructor was good. His \u00b7excellence was reflected in the quality of the Evaluation: This course involves studying the speech techniques of the greatest British persuasive speakers. The course provides excellent preparation for writing and giving persuasive speeches. Course work involves 2 exams during the term and a imal, 1 paper and the reading of one book outside of class. One student described it as one of the most beneficial and interesting speech courses he'd had in four years-which will help explain why the overall evaluation of the course and instructor was I (i H T '7 SCI DEVELOPMENT OF THE AMERICAN to the Arts and Sciences catalogue , the second quarter of Development of the American West is supposed to include \"why the West was wild.\" If you think that means cowboys and Indians, you \u00b7will be sorely disappointed. In Tact, chances are you will be sorely disappointed anyway. Dr. Aeschbache r is a lcnowledgeab le historian, but as one student noted, \"'he could use Speech 141.\" Lectures are in a monotone, cover only generalities, and are exceedingl y dull. However, if you're basically interested in the subject matter, the course could be tolerable or even rewarding . Just keep in mind that the subject matter is theory-not people. This course is potentiall y interesting- the problem seems to be communication. POLITICAL SCIENCE 301 ASIAN POLITICAL SYSTEMS: EAST ASIA DR. Dr. Kim's East Asian Political Systems provides as much of an historical view of the area as a political one. Lectures are infonnative, but many students miss out on them because Dr. Kim's voice does not always carry to the back of the room. Testing was thought to be picky and unfair, and grading was worse. The textbook was outdated and inadequate . It should be noted though, that the class was fairly polarized in its opinion of this course. About half of the class considers Dr. Kim to be an \"excellent, humorous, knowledgeable\" lecturer-one who is always open to questions. \u00b7If you have an interest in this area -and are willing to spend a good deal of time memorizing - this course could provide a fairly good introduction. PHILOSOPH) 105 PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY Evalaation: The overall evaluation of Dr. Long's course was high. He \"'knows what he's doing,\" and he must be doing it right. The students for the most part felt they were getting a good groundwork in philosophical and ethical problems, presented clearly and objectively. Tests are tak~home and require time and work, but the resulting grades are high. At times the text is bpring and at times the tests seem merely writing exercises in feedback, but on the whole the interest generated in lectures and discussions overshadows faults. 501 THE AMERICAN METROPOLIS MRS. Evaluation: The American Metropolis is an unusual course taught by a knowledgeab le and highly respected instructor. The format is very untraditional: some students are uncomfortable with it because few notes are given in class, but most find the discussion stimulating , and the outside speakers (about 5 a quarter) are excellent. The discussions , speakers, and readings are designed to present the student with problems for which he must find the solutions: learning is highly personalized and creatively stimulating. Some students complain of an \"excess\" of work required. Reading averages about 80 pages per week, and the required weekly \"letters\" were thought by some to be \"busy work,\" while others thought they were an excellent aid in keeping on top of the discussion. The tenn papers are \"worth putting work into.\" Mrs. Hessler herself was very well received. She \"takes a great deal of interest in her students.\" She listens to what they have to say and is sincerely interested in their ideas. She is primarily concerned with making them think creatively about urban problems . One student urged us to \"emphasize that this is a necessary course for anyone interested in dealing with the problems of the city.\" For genuinely concerned stu- der s. the course is a must. ,; \"\\'l'J'I< -tl,,;,.,t:.t. -9A-~ EUROPEAN DEMOCRATIC Dr. Libbey continues to draw mostly praise from his students. He \"conducts the class in a dignified and illumined manner,\" presenting clear easy-to-follow lectures. He is eminently fair in testing and grading. Much historical background is presented in class, which met with mixed reaction. Lectures can at times get bogged down, but that is generally not considered too detrimental. As one student put it, \"'Lectures are laborious . But his fairness and student empathy is remarkable. It's worth it for this reason.\" It's this empathy with the students that makes him so popular. Dr. Libbey is for people. 567 AMERIC AN FOREIGN POLICIES Evaluation: This is one of the more amazing courses offered by the poli sci department. Despite the huge size of the class, it consists almost entirely of discussion . Some students get lost because the \"lecture\" leads more often to tangents than to notes -as one said, his lectures \"are like watching Niagara Falls -a continuo us flow without really arriving anywhere.\" But Dr. Weise \"gives good non-lectures on foreign policy,\" and the class is usually exciting, provocative, and informative. Tests require analysis, with facts relegated to a supportive role (as they should be). Dr. Weise's \"availability\" was seriously hampered this year by his activities as Robert Taft's campaign manager. When you can catch him, he's helpful and willing to talk. This course can open your mind to the problems and complexi ties of international relations. It can make you think, if you let it. Take it. 679 POLITICAL THOUGHT IN\u00b7 THE DEVELOPING NATIONS Evaluation: That Dr. Power has developed his own style is apparent from our survey. Comments received from this class were virtually the same as those from Africa in World Affairs. This consistency of \u00b7style can be pretty wen generalized , so that anyone talting a course from Dr. Power can expect competent, thorough (and long) lectures and a lot of work. PSYCHOLOGY 174 INTRODUCTION TO INTERPRETING RESEARCH DATA DR. MELTON N=S3 Evaluation: \"This course is a required course for Psych majors. It is very dry, boring, and totally uninterestiD& but necessary.\" This statemen t sums up the general feelings of the students in this course. They were not enthusiastic about it, but they appreciated its importance. Their comments about Dr. Melton as a teacher were generally favorable. The only specific criticism made was that the text book was too elementary. 551 SYSTEMS OF PSYCHOLOGY DR. Evaluation: Disappointment was epidemic among the students in this course. Their reasons varied, but the source of the displeasure was more often the subject matter than anything else. One student called it \"a conglomeration of totally unrelated topics that have no value as far as I can see.\" The subject seemed to depend primarily on Dr. -;. ~?-.. Honeck's interests and whims. Some said '-f\"v had been expectinll a survey of classical psychology, but instead were faced with Mexpenmental psych all over again without the labs.\" Dr. Honeck himself is \"maturing quickly into a fme professor,\" but he hasn't arrived yet. He was more relaxed the second quarter and is gradually settling into the teaching situation. He is personally quite well liked. The required nature of this course for psych majors probably influenced the ratings. The indicated feeling was that perhaps the department should reconsider this \"pointless\" requir~ri'lent- or revamp it. ROMANCE lANGUAGES AND LITERATURES 601 INDUSTRIAL PSYCHOLOGY DR. Evaluation: Although some students were pleased with this course, the majority expressed feelings of disappointment. This disappointment was sparked mostly by the subject matter, but most recognized that the material covered has not yet been fully defined. As one student pointed out \"Industrial Psych is still at a point where one can only give opinion because very little research as of yet has been done in this area.\" Another\u00b7disappointment was in Dr. Hubert's monotone lecture voi~. although, the students did feel Dr. Hubert knew his material well, and was enthusiastic in teaching the subject. The informal class structure with the use of small groups for discussion, was well received by most. One area that led to numerous complaints was that of testing and grading. Many students did not agree with the theory of accepting the majority response as the correct answer. They seemed to think that individualistic approaches were inhibited by this procedure. On the whole the students who commented seemed rather unfavorable to the current course structure. like the field itself, this course will undoubtedly undergo a gradual metamorphosis. 301 SURVEY OF FRENCH LITERATURE DR. Dr. Burrell's class is centered around the needs of the students, and his concern for them is greatly appreciated. He has an avid enthusiasm for the material, and conducts open discussions in which everyone feels free to participate . As in most survey courses, however, the pace is too fast: there is too much material to be covered in too short a time. This hinders in-depth study, but the students seemed well satisfied despite this. 313 TEACHING OF SPANISH DR. Evaluation: Teaching of Spanish is a one quarter course for prospective high school Spanish teachers. The students seemed fairly well pleased with the course. Some comment indicated that the material covered was relevant and applicable, but other students found the subject matter boring. Dr. Seward is good, but the course itself received no lavish praise. 315 SPANISH PHONETICS students Dr. Seward's course in Spanish Phonetics -majors and non-majors alike -felt that the course was highly beneficial \u00b7 to their overall knowledge of Spanish. As evidenced by the questionnaires, Dr. Seward's lectures, his teaching ability, and his relationship with the students were all considered excellent. One student commented that the relaxed atmosphere of the class and the professor's willingness to provide individual help were conducive to learning. Another student felt motivated \"to do quite a bit of outside work\". Most students agreed that the course \"provided a solid background in the pronunciation of the Spanish language,\" -which of course is an important aspect of any phonetics course. 101 ELEMENTARY BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE The Portuguese department at U.C. is relatively small, consisting solely of Mr. MacNicoll. However, he is singlehandedly creating an interest and knowledge of the language and culture of Portuguese speaking peoples where none previously existed. Students were especially pleased with the enjoyable atmosphere which Mr. MacNicoll creates and his own obvious enthusiasm for the material. Even those who had previously disliked foreign languages felt they had benefited from this course. Two distinct advantages of the course are that classes are still relatively small, and that Mr. MacNicoll is more experienced and qualified than most instructors for teaching an elementary language course. These facts are well indicated by the ratings he received. SOCIOLOGY a3 MASS COMMUNICATION DR. course is '\"not as interesting as it sounds,\" as it is largely concerned with defming the topic and does not relate much to the real problems of \"the times.\" Lectures were thought to be unstimulating and disorganized, although, as one student said, \"the subject matter is provocative and interesting.\" Another complained that \"the extent of discussion has been limited by student apathy.\" Dr .. Johnson .. doesn't bring out much response from the students,\" though he mes. Outside reading is rather extensive, and many said they didn't have time for it. In aU fairness, though, as one student pointed out, .. This isn't one of Dr. Johnson's better courses.\" (Compare the above ratings with those in \"Social Movements\"). \"The course has offered me the opportunity to challenge the opinions of the professor and the textbooks, but more importantly it has permitted a reevaluation and testing of my own principles . And 'as the elders of our time choose to remain blind,' it is up to us to look into the light of the torch of knowledge and to search out new meanings and as this course would have you, to seek a new 'defmition of the situation.'\" Thus spoke one student. Some, however, are bored with defmitions and theory and would prefer that the course be oriented toward person-to-person contact rather than research. Nevertheless, an overworked word that kept popping up on the questionnaires was \"relevance\": theories arc presented clearly and in a manner most students could relate to quite easily. Adverse comments were few; this is a good course with ll capable professor. ' material and.knows how to get it across.\" He is one instructor who \"appreciates having students come in and talk with him.\" As one student put it, \"I'm not usually a user of superlatives, but in this case there is no WITH CONVERSATION MR.OBRATH 238 INTRODUCTION TO GERMAN LITERATURE MR. STERN majority of the class feels the essays test one's command of the subject. Although many would like more tune, they consider the\u00ad essay tests a better experience altogether than the multiple choice tests given in most classes. The lectures are extremely well-organized and cover an incredible amount of material. Dr. Workman is obviously enthusiastic about teaching. He not only knows his material thoroughly, but possesses the ability, far too rare in instructors, of getting it across. Dr. Workman is a true teacher and he runs a truly college-le vel course. This course is highly recommended to anyone by the present students. Evaluation: Evaluation: 402ELEMENTARYPETROLOGY BULLARD AND LARSON Although you must be willing to work, Mr. Obrath 's students rate his course and its instructor as being excellent. Mr. Obrath is desc.ribed as being very enthusiastic, fair, interested in his students and willing to spend as much time with his students as they need. Students do indicate that this is a fast paced course that requires you to keep up every day. The fast pace and work load notwithstanding, students consistantly rate this as an excellent and enjoyable course. Very few students commented on Dr. Stern's course but his numerical ratings speak for themselves . \"Very inspiring and beneficial\" seems to be the attitude of students toward \"one of the very best well structured course using two professors. The course is well planned, providing both aspects of petrology at the same time-megascopic anlaysis one week and microscopic analysis the next. The f1rst quarter of this course was good but some times consumed as much as 10 hrs. per week in lab. In general, students tend to see this as a very informative course which provides a lot of fundamentals and rate it overall as a good course. 362 COMPARATIVE ROMANTICISM MR. GLICK Evaluation: Mr. Glick is one of the most promising new teachers at UC. The course is very difficult but most of the students enjoy the lectures. The material for each quarter could easily be stretched into a fun year enabling the student to get an in depth knowledge of the area. GEOLOGY MR. HUFF Evaluation: The students who comJDented did so favorably with regard to Dr. Huff. Most felt that he was sincere and \"genuinely cared about the student.\" B-ut here the compliments ceased. Many felt the course too extensive and demanding for the introductory level More emphasis on class comprehension and less on fmishing the book would have been appreciated by many. Dr. Huff's exams and the associated lab came under universal attack. The exams were described as extremely difficult and technical, with questions ranging from picky to generalized. The lab was considered an \"utter waste of time for both student and professor.\" This was attributed to apathy on the T.A 's part, and a general lack of coordination between lecture and lab. BULLARD Evaluation: Dr. Bullard is a very good instructor, weD organized and quite enthusiastic. The course was taken \u00b7mostly by students not majoring in Geology who needed a science requirement. Many of these students received more out of the course than they anticipated. Most students felt his tests were fair, though there were a few who felt he covered too much material. He is known to be open to student suggestions dealing with this course. doing\" course was weD-received by his students. The informality of the class room atmosphere was praised and the enthusiasm with which Mr. Warren greeted discussion was especially pleasing. N= GERMAN RASFELD Evaluation: Miss Rasfeld is what a teacher \u00b7should be said one student. A very good rapport existed between instructor and student. Some complained that too much material was covered in too short a time. LORENZ Evaluation: Students felt too much material is concentrated into too short a time for any real learning to take place. Basically, students felt the teacher was good, but the course was not quite up to the high standards of the German department. ROTHFELD Evaluation : Miss Rothfeld has made the usually boring elementary course interesting for her students although her exams were frowned upon. The main problen in this course appears to be in the inadequacies of the final exam, which is a departmental exam. GERMAN MR. RUDOLPH Evaluation: Spending too much time on grammar and not enough in speaking appears to be the only fault in Mr. Rudolph's high scoring course. With the exception of the text book and the lab section, there was only praise for Dr. Lattman 's Geology course. The class was unanimous in the feeling that Dr. Lattman had a favorable attitude towards his students and that his lectures were extremely interesting. His enthusiasm towards teaching the course was hifhly noted. Examinations were conside~d fair and so was the assigning of grades. GERMAN CULTURE ll MR. HARRIS Evaluation: Comments were rare in Mr. Harris' class. The reason may be evident in the numerical ratings -there was small reason to (GEN.) MRS. SLESSAREY Evaluation: Students tend to describe this as a \"good\" course but with a very heavy work load. Some students feel that there is so much covered in such a short time that nothing is covered adequately or fully. There is also a feeling that non-German majors should not have to compete in class for grades with German majors. One unique feature is that German culture, history and current events literature was covered and this seemed to be of help in tying things MRS. SCHMIDT EvalUation: Mrs. Schmidt's class rates her highly. Her highest ratings are in fairness and depth of knowledge, with no ratings below BALINKIN Evaluation : Mrs. Balinkin is a very enthusiastic professor with a great interest in her students. She ranks highly in almost all areas covered. The high rating received for grading is GERMAN MR. COBBS Evaluation: The one thing that stands out the most in this course is the instructor's enthusiasm. He really makes a genuine effort to make a more or less dull subject interesting to students. He expects a lot of details at times-but students report learning a great deal from this course. Believe it or not, some students report that there isn't enough THE 19TH CENTURY MR. FRIEDRICHSMEYER Evaluation: Only one student commented, therefore written evaluation would RENAISSANCE HISTORY MR. SLESSAREV Evaluation: A consensus of class opinion was non-existence; comments were differing and varied. In one of the few areas on which a relatively large number of students commented, they were unanimous that grading and the grader were unfair and peculiar. Students found Mr. Slessan.v's enthusiasm appealing MR. BEAVER Evaluation: Mr. Beaver is an enthusiastic teacher who has a real understanding of his subject. He encourages intelligent class discussion. Mr. Beaver has a high regard for students' ability and demands much work; however, the benefits are worth it. N= HISTORY TO 1880 MR. ZANE MILLER Evaluation: Most students saw this as a good, interesting course. Dr. Miller knows his field very weD and lectures are outlined in a way that makes note-taking pretty easy. At times, students felt his lectures were \"too informative,\" due to his fast lectUre pace. Exams were reported to be difficult and long. Dr. Miller iS very considerate of his students especially in that. he returns papers promptly and is extremely fair in assiping grades. Overall, students report that they enjoyed this course and felt that they learned a great deal from IDEAS MR. WORKMAN Evaluation: Dr. Workman's midterms and finals are essay tests requiring application of the material from readings and lectures to a given situation . Some students fmd the questions ambiguous but the The class is a large one, therefore one can't very weD ask questions during the lecture. The discussion groups should take care of this problem, but not many students fmd their discussion sections thought-provoking. However , the quality of the sections varies greatly with the particular discussion Evaluation: Mr. Faaborg is an effective teacher who \"makes you want to learn.\" He is fair in grading and is honestly concerned with students. The class was divided as to the value of discussion. Some felt that class discussions were a waste of time; others felt that the balance between lecture and discussion was good and that the discussions made the lectures more \"relevant .\" Mr. Faaborg rated quite highly and can be considered an \"extreme MR.JOST Evaluation: Communication appeared to be a problem for Mr. Jost. His lectures, according to students' comments , I a c ked cohesion and his explanation often needed to be explained. The depth of his lectures and of the readings received criticism as being \"too much for an introductory course.\" The general impression was that Mr. Jost lmew a great deal that be was unable to tell the class. LOGIC MR. MILLER Evaluation: Dr. Miller is inf.erested in his subject and tries to make it interesting for his students. However , most students still tend to see logic as a cut and dried subject that is hard to really get interested in. The course consiats of large lecture section and smaller discussion sections. The discussion sections tend to be of help to the students since this is the only place where be can communicate.. freely with instructors and discuss problema he is having with course material. Overall, students rate this as being a good course. N= 126 Evaluation: The students questioned agreed that Mr. Fox is a brilliant, receptive teacher of a little known subject. The syllabus concentrates on the study of classical rhetoric as revealed in sixteenth-century literature. Mr. Fox is extremely enthusiastic about his subject; he feels that the study of rhetoric is a good aid to a basic understanding of English literature . This course is recommended to those who enjoy being taught the subtle and unobvious . GEOLOGY course. More laughs than a barrel of unknown crystals.\" More seriously, Dr. Koucky's talent is credited with malting an interesting subject fascinating. The instructor-student relationship is great. Even the labs are pertinent to the lectures and worthwhile. Outside preparation time depends on the student's ambition to excel. This course is obviously well worth an interested student's time. It is even popular among non-majors. 311 HISTORICAL GEOLOGY DR. CASTER Historical geology is one of the basic courses for geology majors, and is quite popular among students in other fields. The lectures are intriguing and informative -the professor gives exciting lector~ although the students complain about the poor student-professor rapport. Most students feel the labs were busy work and not beneficial. Despite these burdens, the course is popular and can be taken by anyone who has had introductory geology. 405 PRINCIPLES OF GEOMORPHOLOGY course in Geomorphology uses an excellent text and is greatly supported in lecture by slides and explanations . Professor. Durrell's exams are quite unique, but are graded very fairly. Labs consist of discussions of various types of maps and their interpretation . Although the slides bored some of the students, most got a lot out of the class and found geomorphology quite illuminating . 532 STRATIGRAPHY AND sedimentation encompasses environmental processes and interpretation . Informative, interesting lectures are supported by a good text and enthusiastic professor . Dr. Pryor's enthusiasm encourages imaginative and creative thinking. Second quarter stresses readings from journals in order for the student to get a more specific and up to date account of subject areas. Third quarter consists of a project which requires a practical application of what has been learned. The labs are bad. They con sist of time consuming drafting projects\u00b7, on which 'perfection is expected. Most students thought this was too much work for a three hour course. GEOGRAPHY 577 HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY DR. WOLF almost no comment offered by the students in this class. One person mentioned that the course tended to repeat material covered in Introduction to Cultural Geography; but beyond this, no one had anything to say. It might be suggested that you study the ratings carefully for some guidance . HISTORY 302 HISTORY OF ENGLAND DR. There are two main points about Dr. Curry's course that almost every questionnaire made: as a lecturer Dr. Curry is extremely interesting and exciting, but as a tester and grader he's a .. sadist.\" The discontent for his methods of testing and grading was overwhelming. One student said, .. We covered 113 years up to the midterm and were only tested on a 12 year period.\" Others said, .. To pick on particulars in a survey course is completely unfair,\" .. He is only testing the ability to memorize,\" and \"I do more work on this course to get a B than I have in any other t~ get an A.\" On the other hand he was praised in every way for his enthusiasm and. ability, which made the course worthwhile. From the students' stand point, however, perhaps s.c>me con\u00ad sideration should be given to the fact that this is a survey course, covering many years of history, and not a game to see whether the student can be stumped. Oh yes, plan to have plenty of paper and ink and a str<mg hand, if you're thinking of taking this course, for Dr. Curry goes at a fast and.furious pace which many have problems keeping up with for 7S minutes straight. 501 FOUNDATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES MR. .. luation: This is one of the most demanding courses that an undergraduate can get into, but it is also one of the most animated. Mr. Alexander is a dynamic young professor who will do anything to make his class exciting. His classes are many-faceted and provocative, allowing for a great variance in interpretation (and :with 16 paperbacks , you get many interpretations to choose from or build on). The instructor-student relationship is outstanding -Mr. Alexander is sincerely concerned about his students; he is \"approachable as a person.\" In short - a demanding, time consuming course, but well worth the effort. Mr. Alexander is a welcome addition to the faculty. 508 INTELLECT-UAL HISTORY OF THE UNITED STAT.ES DR. HENRY Shapiro's course in U.S. Intellectual History is a stiDlulating intellectual experience, but \"the material has to be reached through the professor's mind and that is a labyrinth .\" The subject matter is fascinating and worthwhile, but you must be willing \"to be confused for awhile, until issues are resolved.\" .Prevalent criticisms were the lack of a basic textbook to unify the course ~terial , and the disorganization of the presentation, which was often beyond the students' grasp. A compensating factor for those concerned enough is that Dr. Shapiro is readily available outside of class and eager to help; in fact, he seems to be at his best with closer, person-to-person contact. This course is highly stimulating and thought-provoking -perhaps too much so for many students. If you like challenges, this course is it. S11 THE CIVIL WAR DR. Favorable comments were abundant regarding Dr. Lewis's course in the American Civil War. Dr. Lewis has been described as \"one of the most competent and interesting professors at this University .\" He is enthusiastic , well-prepared , and most capable, and students remarked that his classes are interesting, informative, and thought-provoking . The sole criticism of the course was in regard to testing. Test questions were sometimes difficult to \"zero in\" on, and Dr. Lewis apparently expects his point of view to be used in answering questions rather than any other. Thus, despite a stimulating class, it's best not to disagree with the instructor on a test. But Dr. Lewis displays great ability as a teacher, and does allow differing opinions in class. If you're interested in this period in our history, this cQurse is definitely worth it. \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7~ The following evaluations were taken from last year's Insight. The instructors for \u00b7these courses have not changed, thus the imformation still may\u00b7be beneficial. INSIGHT '70 QUESTIONNAIRE N = Number of students answering questienaires. \u00b7 The following questions were to be rated on a scale ranging from 4 (excellent) to 0 (inadequate): I. Lectures 2. Instructor-student relationsh ip 3. Instructor's teaching ability 4. Instructor's enthusiasm in teaching this course 5. Instructor's availability outside of class 6. Instructor's fairness in testing 7. Instructor's fairness in assigning grades 8. Ability of subject matter to provoke imaginative thinking 9. Quality of required textbook(s) 10. Ability of course to encourage further pursuit of the subject (independently or in a higher level course) II. Total work required in relation to benefit received from the course 12. Quality of lab or discussion group (where applicable) 13. Overall evaluation -combination of course and instructor . ANTHROPOLOGY 172 EVOLUTION OF MAN DR. Evaluation: Evolution of Man is the first quarter of the introductory course to Anthropolog y, taught by Dr. Gustav Carlsmi. The primary purpose of the 'course is to acquaint \u00b7students to fhe..field of anthropology, causing much discussion and many lectures to center around the characterization of Anthropology . The second purpose is to trace man's evolution and picture his relationship to his relatives. The problem of this year's misleading title will be solved for 1970-71 when the course will be called \"Introduction to Anthropology.\" Dr. Carlson is\u00b7 an excellent lecturer and very . enthusiastic about his subject. A large amount of reading is required and the necessity of this has been questioned as well as his testing techniques. His lecturing technique and testing practices to many seem incompatible . Because of the largeness of the class, Dr. Carlson's availability outside class is limited; a suggestion was made that the class should be taught in smaller sections. Aside from these criticisms , the course is generally acclaimed as being \"thought-provoking\" and \"stimulating.\" 549 ETHNOGRAPHY: NORTH AMERICAN Ethnography of North American Indians, taught by Dr. Dillingham, is a survey of Amerind culture areas in North America. Many were misled by the word .. Ethnography.\" It means in essence .. a description\" , which some felt led to the lecturing of many unrelated facts. This may be the case, although Dr. Dillingham is well qualified to teach such a course and does a very good job. Most felt that to do the Amerind justice the course should be at least two quarters long, if not three. The present one quarter structure does not give enough time to present the material sufficiently . In lengthening the course it would allow the present and future of the Amerind to be presented . If more insight is desired as to the nature of the North American Indians this is the course. BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES 271 ELEMENTARY and practical presentation of bacteriology has been well accepted by the students. The only drawback seems to be the amount of lab work required in the time allotted. A student put it this way: .. Lab is interesting, but ma~y of the labs must be rushed too much to really get as much out of them as we could.\" Lab instructors were thought to be more hindrance than help in many cases. But the lab seems to be the only complaint. Mrs. Overman obviously handles it well, and her ability is credited with making it' an interesting and worthwhile course. 273 COMPARATIVE ANATOMY LABORATORY DR. ERWAY Evaluation: The students taking this course failed to make any comments but it can be stated that the text received the lowest rating for the second year in a row despite the fact that a different text was used. This indicates, once again, that a change in text would seem appropriate for next year. 671 IMMUNOLOGY . Dr. Bell is an excellent and interesting lecturer, who knows and presents her material in a thought-provoking manner. Students feel that her lectures are organized in a manner conducive to learning, rather than memorization without undentanding. It is felt, however, that there is too much material to be covered in only one quarter, and that the course should be lengthened to at least two quarters. There were also some complaints about the testing, which many students thought was ambiguous and unfair. Dr. Bell, though, has managed to make the course worthwh ile not only for majon, but also for non-majors interested in this fascinating and progressing field. CHEMISTRY 102 FIRST YEAR CHEMISTRY DR. CAMERON enthusiasm and ability in teaching his ftrst year chemistry class was obvious. However, the majority of the students expressed some disappointmen t in the course. The tests were usually difficult, with the time often required for study and preparation appearing far too great for a three hour course. The lectures were fairly good, but sometimes covered material a little too fast. The recitations were almost useless due to a lack of interest on the part of the instructors. The labs, as in most freshman courses, require much work for the credits involved, and were not always worth it. 105 BIO-ORGANIC CHEMISTRY Most students found this course enjoyable with much sincerity and enthusiasm displayed by Dr. Krueger. She, as evidenced by student response, took a difficult subject and made it understandab le to all. The course required much studying and preparation which was accepted willingly by the students as a result of the enthusiasm promoted by Dr. Krueger. Her concern for her students was regarded highly. The course material involves very little mathema tics and is regarded by most non-chemistry students as the .. perfect\" chemistry course. She has been exceedingly fair in her testing and grading. The only disappointment expressed by the students was the low quality of the laboratory. Poor lab assistants and too much work in the allotted time were the factors influencing this displeasure. -It-. -_, Evaluation: Students found this course to be pleasing although it did not cover the material that was expected. The course is designed primarily for majors, especially those with some background in physical chemistry which is the primary subject of the first quarter. Those students interested in registering for this course should be aware that the enrollment includes about SO% graduate students. However, even though the material is difficult and the text almost unreadable, Dr. Worley more than compensates with his enthusiastic and clear lectures. CLASSICS 101,1,3 ELEMENTARY GREEK DR. Evaluation: A terrifying course in Classical Greek Grammar is made bearable, even enjoyable by Professor Keefe. A rigorous schedule of five hours a week is highlighted by a weekly quiz, which most students, although they dread it, appreciate, as it requires each to keep on top of the class. The text is adequate and where it is lacking Dr. Keefe is quick to supplement. He is always available outside of class and ready to supply extra assistance when needed. Although not a requirement, a good background in Latin or another foreign language is extremely helpful to make the way to Greek easier. ~ll THE ART AND ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ANCIENT Boulter's archaeology course is mostly made up of Art and Classics majors, and is open to undergraduates who wish to tackle it. Most students find it difficult but enjoyable, and a stimulation to further study. For a student preparing for graduate school in Art, Ancient History or Classics this course would be almost indispensable. ECONOMICS 101 INTRODUCTION TO ECONOMICS DR. BERRY Because of the wide range of comments made (between the poles of favorable and unfavorable) on the various aspects of the course, generalization is difficult. So we shall proceed cautiously. Dr. Berry provides the lecture series, which ~s supplemented with once-a-week\u00ad type discussion sections. Largely, student evaluation indicated that the latter failed to be of value, yet a minority seemed quite satisfied. Moral: there are good discussion leaders and there are bad discussion leaders; mostly bad. At least not effective. Dr. Berry's lectures comprise a stickier problem. Rather than attempt to normalize from the far-flung set of reactions to his work, we will first describe. Dr. Berry is funny. His style is a pithy elemental stream of information, interlaced with ~oth comic relief and on-subject anecdotes. In short, he doesn't allow the course matter to become heavy. A list of potential test questions is provided previous to examination. Now, many students feel the humor to be somewhat overdone, yet most credit its inclusion with some success as an attention holder. In a number of cases, the former opinion was supported implicitly through statements that there is \"not enough economics.\" The text used is, naturally, Samuelson; which seemed to be adequate. The value of the work book is dubious. Incidentally, the serious student may find a treasure of advanced material in the appendices to the chapters in Samuelson. The presentation received a reasonable 2.6 in the overall evaluation. One marginal problem is the discipline itself, i.e., some folks cannot get close to scientification of human behavior or institution; particularly one which is mathematical in nature. It would seem though, in defense, that a cursory knowledge at very least would be prerequisite to a liberal education. -6A-171 MICROECONOMIC Evaluation: As is the case in many courses which are required for economics majors, most students felt that the subject matter was dry and even boring although it is difficult enough to present a certain challenge. The text books were considered to be poor. Despite the dull subject material, Mr. Goddard has managed to make this an interesting course for many students. He plans the course according to student needs rather than an inflexible schedule. Some people felt that a course in calculus would have been helpful in understanding the material. 171 MONEY AND BANKING DR. LEE Evaluation: In general, students for which Money and Banking is required rated the course higher than those students taking it as an elective. Most people felt that Dr. Lee was a good teacher enthusiastic and fair in testing and assigning grades, though at times he is hard to follow. Nearly everyone felt that the subject matter was dry and boring, but that Dr. Lee managed to make the most out of a bad situation (i.e., having to teach this course). Dr. Lee is one professor who takes his teaching job seriously. He takes a personal interest in his students and gives the class his maximum effort. He is sincerely interested in making the student understand the concepts he is presenting. 171 MICROECONOMIC THEORY Microeconomics is a highly theoretical course that requires a solid background in mathematics. It isn't the kind of course one would take to pad one's accum. However, if you're an Economics major and must take it, then Dr. Gallo is a wise choice. As one student pointed out, \"Although the material is difficult, Gallo's enthusiasm makes you want to learn it.\" Mr. Gallo's presentation is logical and easy to follow. His main fault as a lecturer is going too fast, but he realizes this and is willing to re-explain difficult points and answer questions. It should be pointed out, though, that some students manage to get lost in the maze of theory and mathematics despite Dr. Gallo's presentation and enthusiasm . Be prepared. This is not an easy course. 273 MACROECONOMIC THEORY MR. VALENTINE Evaluation: Mr. Valentine wrote the text book which was used in this class and some students felt that the lectures tended to repeat the text, so that often a broader understanding of the subject matter was difficult to get. Most felt that Mr. Valentine was fair in testing and grading and very much interested in the students. As with many economics courses, students felt that the subject matter was boring at times but essential for a greater knowledge of the field. The course as a whole, it was felt, is presented in as interesting and challenging manner as possible. 350 DEVELOPMENT OF ECONOMIC IDEAS Evaluation: This course was rated high in nearly every category. Apparently Dr. Zinam's enthusiasm is overbounding and his teaching ability is good. The subject matter was thought to be interesting and most people were pleased with the course. Some students felt, however, that he assumes too much prior knowledge on the part of the students and doesn't always explain concepts thoroughly. Others liked the course because it was broad and allowed for varying interpretations. \"\" <.., .. \"\"' 47S \u00b7 MONEY .. tion: To evaluate this course by the comments received would be extremely hard-due to fhe fact that little comment was made. Does this mean something? By inspecting the ratings one can see that Dr. Whitmore's ability didn't hurt the class rating but his enthusiasm in teaching did. As one student said, \"The course starts out interesting but grinds its way to a screaching halt in boredom.\" Although the ratings for the course were low and what comment there was, mostly adverse, there were some who stated they enjoyed the course and felt it to be very challenging. 571 LABOR PROBLEMS DR. Amazing. A course concerning labor which is not management-biased. Dr. Leftwich did this -and more. Actually his overall grade is an_ undistinguished 2.9. But contrary, he seems (as do, largely, the students) to be' genuinely enthusiastic about the course matter. Egle, like Socrates, is a midwife; but he kills it in delivery -a tedious, repetitive harangue straight from the text. Evidently though, some discussion exists and the situation is at bottom tolerable. Mr. Egle is no Socrates - but' in fairness, Socrates did not teach economics. SOl REGIONAL ECONOMICS (LOCATION THEORY) DR. tabulations. EvaluatiQn: While Regional Economics with Dr. Curtiss is nothing to write home about, it remains adequate. The overall evaluation was only average and thusly coincided with the written comments, which generally indicated the so-so nature of the whole affair. One student's comment is representative: \"This course is neither the best nor worst that I have taken.\" Like we say, it's adequate. 511 REGIONAL ECONOMICS (TOOLS OF ANALYSIS) DR. CUTLER Evaluation: There is a wide divergence of opinion on this course, centering generally around Dr. Cutler's technique. In this class, students are given greater responsibility for their own learning experience through reports on various aspects of the topic, which take up most of the class period. The success of this method obviously depends primarily on the interest of the student. Unfortunately, not all of the reports are well done. Many students regret the fact that a man with Dr. Cutler's background and experience as an economis t does not lecture more, while others complain of his frequent interruptions of student reports to the class. (It appears that, regardless of technique, it would be difficult to satisfy everyone in this class). This course is not designed for people deeply ingrained in the traditional lecture method of education. But if you're interested in more independen t learning, it could be a very worthwhile course. Incidentally, the textbooks received some highly favorable comments and DAA community planners generally rated the course hiaher than other students. 565 GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY Not computerized tabulation. Evaluation: Despite the fact that Dr. Cutler uses the same educational technique in this course as he does in Regional Economics , this course received a higher rating. That the method should have such varying responses between the two classes is an interesting point, but one which we are not prepared to explain. The class generally agreed that Dr. Cutler is extremely knowledgeable (his background includes the Vice Presidency of the Federal Reserve Bank in Cleveland), and student reports were analytical as well as factual. However, it was felt that Dr. Cutler tried to cover too much material, resulting in a somewha t superficial overview of the topic. .. -\"'A-', ' ~-., ~ll MATHEMATICAL The non-mathematician who has chosen to study economics would be well advised to reach at least this minimum proficiency level. Besides, Dr. Gallo has managed to make it interesting. His overall rating of 3.5 is highly respectable, and virtually all comment was favorable . There were hints that the course was somehow \"too\" difficult, but that attitude was not widely felt. The need for a rigorous background in this area is inescapable. Well done. 542 COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC SYSTEMS DR. Dr. Egle is no Socrates. Student comments indicate that his lectures are forgettable because of a lack of talent, !'ather than, say, a lack of effort or interest. To the approval, if contained, was nearly unanimous. The book is typically unexciting. Discussion of current labor problems is encouraged. As three students phrased it, the course is O.K. 585 STOCK MARKETS AND INVESTMENTS DR. Evaluation: Somewhat of a rush. Literally. There is too much material for the amount of time. Some of the students who reported were pleased, but most opined that the scope of\u00b7 the course was unreasonable . Testing is inappropriately difficult, i.e., not consisten t with the presumed nature of the course; too much detail. In trying to deal with the ensuing information overload, Dr. Herman bas confused communication with ritual -he assigns seats. If you can become involved with unnecessary challenges , do it. ENGLISH AND COMPARATI VE LITERATURE praised Dr. Godshalk's ability, enthusiasm, and Socratic teaching method. They called him' a \"great inciter of ideas,\" and felt his .. personal interest\" in his students helped create an informal, relaxed atmosphere . The work load, however, is too large; students are able to gain only a cursory knowledge of many of Shakespeare's plays -not a deep understanding of a few, which may be more beneficial. As one said, \"the work and pressure takes a lot out of my enthusiasm.\" 318 ENGLISH NOVEL I DR. 13-3.0. Evaluation: This course had relatively few, if any, complaints. Comments centered around Dr. Kiley's excellence and enthusiasm. But a word of warning to the slow reader .. Do not take this course unless you have enough time to read four to six novels a quarter.\" 341 MEDIEVAL LITERATURE Evaluation: The short but sweet evaluation of this course is that Dr. Armstrong's brilliant scholarship and enthusiasm puts across material that might otherwise be deadly dull. She was obviously highly deserving of the Cohen award, which she received last year. ) jll 't' ./ .... i .I ~ l ; , May 14, 1971 UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI NEWS RECORD II - IUtai!IIUI iii! lEI b \u00a7 I Ill 7 21 I Q li ?URI I ill I lUll m I The Reader~s V o1ee I It t 2 l IB l \u00b7 \u00b7 has to deal with the lowest common .

We certainly believe in his qualifications for Student Senator but please spare us any further \u00b7excerpts from a diary of a professional pain in the ass a Ia Richard Nixon or David Eisenhower. Student Senate turned down a bill Wednesda 'y night which would have permitted student government to co-sponsor with Delta Zeta sorority a \"Pro-Life\" film about abortion and a lecture by Dr. and Mrs. Wilke. Rationale for the bill submitted by Vice-President Chip Zoller was contained in the second whereas clause which stipulated that \"it would be beneficial to the University Community to explore all facets of this current topic ... \" Admittedly, the program is part of the Right to Life Party's campaign in preventing the reformation of laws in the state of Ohio which would, if enacted, facilitate the demise of the unborn. However, the bill did not concern itself with an endorsement of the aims of the program; it merely said that \"it would be beneficial to explore all facets of this current topic.\" In actuality, this bill is in line with the many and varied programs student senate has sponsored in the past which they felt was an academic service to the student community. Remember the \"Birthday\" f!lm co-sponsored by student government and the speakers which accompanied the film? Pro-abortion, pro-contraception. Student government as co-sponsor appeared on the publicity and that did not even come up for a vote! How about the Moratorium program last year. Would it be correct for me to infer that, after listening to some of the speakers, student government represented the forces of surrender in South Vietnam? How about the Jerry Rubirl speech in 1969? Did student government then endorse Mr. Rubin's suggestion that we kill our parents? What about the Day of Commitment Against Violence bill on May 4, 1970? the Rally for Soviet CANNES FILM FESTIVAL BEST A Free Parking -Lighted Lot l s 0 Jewry on March 31, 1971? the Political Involvement Trailer on Oct. 7, 1970? Environmental Awareness Week in April, 1970? the Walk for Development on April 21, 1971? All student government did here was ask the students to attend, to take part. Either something is afoul here or student senate has lost its bearings. What might one guess is the reason for this departure from traditional policy? Who knows? Perhaps it is just a case of their first meeting and their prejudices are still showing. Senator Bill Grossman confessed he would not vote for the bill because, ~fter all, he is for abortion; which, accordirlg to the way the legislation was worded, either means that the distinguished Senator Grossman is in favor of only pro-abortion advocacies being heard or that he should be excused for his inability to read. How many more of the senators harbored the same notions? So the bill was defeated and debate suggested that student government's co-sponsorship on literature publicizing the event would be mistaken for endorsement of the aims of the program. Mistaken by whom? Their constituents? With all the campaign rhetoric extollirlg the virtues of communication , one would thirlk that our senators would be able to explain the rationale behind the legislation to the students with whom they would be communicatin g. Or perhaps that is overestimating our senators' willingness to communicate \u00ad indicating that their rhetoric was just that-or even their ability to communicate . Could it not be explained that this bill would serve as notification to the students that there is another side to Daily At 7 P.M. Arrive by 8:30 P.M.

Student senate, I suppose, does not believe so-some called the bill, I believe, \"pittily-shit\". With the exception of our student body president and vice-president and a handful of student senators, the rest of student, senate appears to measure up to that standard. Dan, believing that actions speak loUder than words, please let us judge your contribution to UC on your actions as a Senator and not as a contributing writer to the News Record. Could have said a lot more but we are awaiting any further adolescent articles from one Dan Andriacco.

The words have been used in reference to a basketball contest May 21 at Cincinnati Gardens in which the Russian Olympic Basketball team will face a squad of past and present collegiate stars from the area. WSAI and the Cincinnati Recreation Commission are co-sponsors of the contest which will send its proceeds to the Teen Ward at Longview State Hospital and the ill and handicapped of the Cincinnati area. Steve Wenderfer will be one of two UC students playing in next Friday's contest. The senior served as co-captain of the Bearcats this past winter and led the team to a 14-12 record. Jack Ajzner, former member of the UC basketball team will be the other UC representative on the team. Ajzner played for the Bearcats three years plus one season when he was red-shirted before sitting out this past campaign. He has also been selected to com pete in the International Jewish Tournament next year for the All-American Jewish team. Dick Haucke, UC graduate of 1969, and Bob Wiesenhahn, '63 UC graduate, Artis Gilmore of Jacksonville, anq George McGinnis of Indiana, will also be among the members of the local squad. , Other players will be John Turner from Louisville, Dick Maile, :k 'Louisiana grad drafted by tht~ Cincinnati Royals in '65, Charli~ Dinkins of Miami who was drafte<( by Baltimore in '66, George Spencer, drafted by Baltimore in 1967 after graduation from Washington University, and Bo Wyenant from Vanderbilt who was drafted by both the Royals of the NBA and the Kentucky Colonels of the ABA in 1968. The Royals will be contributing John Mengill, their second choice in the recent NBA drafts. None of the players on Coach Jack Twyman's team have had any professional experience. The Russian Olympic squad is presently touring the U.S. for a series of 10 games. They will be corning off a contest in Louisville Wednesday as they visit Cincy. A record of 1-0 is presently being carried by the Soviets as they move into Indiana tomorrow night for a game. Thus far the crowds at the Russian exhibition ga1nes have been of substantial size with Indiana already reporting a sell-out of their 14,000 seats. Local promoters anticipate a crowd of over 11,000 to come out for the occasion. liNIVEH.SITY OF CINCINNATI NEWS IU:CORD May 14, 1971 I Coaches Pleased UC Football Looking Good by Joe Wasiluk Sports Editor Now that spring drills have been completed by the area's university football teams, such as X, Miami, and OU, many of the coaching staffs are less than satisfied with the results. X, though much improved, still faces major problems defensively. Miami, strong defensively, is very weak offensively and in search of a capable quarterback. Ohio is faced with inexperience all-around as many of the starting positions may have to be filleft by rookies. But at UC the coaching staff is all smiles, finally. The problems which beset the coaches are not serious and the type of problems any coach would welcome, such as placing an abundance of talented players in the best possible positions. \"The main objective of the spring drills was to move people around and situate them where we felt they would best serve the ball club. This was done with quite a bit of c;onfidence,\" commented head coach ,Ray Callahan. \"Defensively, we may not be as , strong physically at the tackle \u00b7 position but we have quickness and experience in Craig Heneveld and , Ron Bryant.

Gray-- This weekend, tonight and tomorrow night, the UC Advanced Theater Workshop, under the direction of Word Baker, Director of the Playhouse in the Park, will stage an innovative snowing of Christopher Marlpwe's, \"EDWARD II,\" on stage in Wilson Auditorium, at 8:30p.m. This is no ordinary \"EDWARD II.\" In fact, as Word explains, \"It is not a production at all. It's a workshop presentation in progress. And, its like \u00b7 no other EDWARD you have ever seen.\" This practice of first doing a play in workshop form is not new with the director. We are reminded that Word's production of \"The Fantasticks,\" now in it'.s 11th year in New York, began in much the same way at a workshop at Barnard College in New York, some 13 years ago. Baker's production of Arthur Miller's, \"The Crucible,\" which ran 18 months in New York in 1958, started as a workshop presentation. Then, after that, there was his prod.uction of Marlowe's \"DR FAUSTUS.\" It also began as a 'Yorkshop _p~esentatioll:\"\" PRELUDE TO THE BATTLE Scene from the UC Advanced Theatre Workshop presentation of Edward II, tonight and tomorrow night at Wilson Audtirium, Friday midnight at Playhouse in the Park. Musical Theatre Wednesday; Current Broadway Shows Excerpts from all styles of current Broadway musicals, everything from rock to tap dance numbers, will be presented by the Musical Theater Workshop at the UC College-Conservatory of Music on Wednesday, May 19, at 8:30 in Corbett Auditorium. Admission is free. The 21 singers and dancers will perform scenes from-\"Company\" and \"Applause\" (1970 \"Tony\" Superstar,\" and others. \u00b7 Students in the Workshop are majoring in a unique musi9al theater degree program at CCM, first of its -\"------- SKY DIVING Special Group Rates with the GREEN COUNTY SPORT PARACHUTE CENTER Xenia, Ohio For further information call Bill Baker, 861\u00b72125 kind at any U.S. university . Relevant academic studies, plus extensive performing experience at the University, on tour and in summer stock has ertabled a number of graduates to quickly step from semi-professional status to Broadway. Pam Myers, a 1969 graduate, who sings a leading role in \"Company,\" was nominated for a \"Tony\" Award this year as best suppo,ting actress. LeRoy Reams, a UC alumnus, is performing in \"Applause.\" The CCM Musical Theater Workshop is supervised by Bruce Fisher and staged by Howard Travis, Jack Rouse and Morleen Getz. Orchestra conductor is Everett Neill. Of the many innovative features unleashed in the UC presentation of EDWARD, perhaps the audience-actor relationship is most interesting. First of all, the audience and the actors are both on stage at the same time. The action, in fact, takes place in, around and above the audience. In addition, the audiehce is obliged to get up from their seats periodically to physically follow the action around the stage. Another example of Baker's method is that each actor has memorized the entire script-each is capable of delivering lines from the entire play. Characters are assigned, but instead of having just one Edward, there are four, each echoing and therefore emphasizing certain lines. The audience in tum, never misses a line and gets four different interpretations of the same character at the same time. Improvisation has been encouraged all along. With techniques of the \"Living Theater,\" \"The Open Theater,\" and perhaps a little \"Poor Theater,\" (Jerzi Grotowski and the Polish Lab Theater) coupled with Word Baker's knowledge and experience of the Theater, the UC Workshop \"EDWARD II\" should make an interesting experience. A very few tickets for this innovative workshop presentation are available from the UC Ticket Office located in the Tangeman University Center Old Lobby, call4754553. Those who are unable to get to see the UC presentation of EDWARD, will still get the chance to see it in the lobby of The Playhouse In The Park, Friday-Midnight. For information, call the Playhouse at 421-3888. \u00b7 Rock Concert Set at Garden English recording groups Emerson Lake & Palmer, and Free, along with The James Gang will appear in concert at Cincinnati Gardens on May 22. Emerson Lake & Palmer have been together about a year and are one of England's top five groups.
