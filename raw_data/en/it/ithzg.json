I can get all the recipes online for free! Yes, that is true. Unfortunately, many of them do not work. You waste of time, energy and money on recipes that are un-tested or amateurish. I have therefore partnered with two professionals; a skincare formulator and an herbalist to ensure that the recipes not only work but are hormone relevant. Meet Amber Graziano A certified herbalist and nutritionist, teacher, writer, and lover of plants. She has earned her certificate in clinical herbalism and nutrition from the North American Institute of Medical Herbalism. You can find her teaching classes across Colorado on a variety of interests including; Introductory Herbalism & Medicine Making, Mineral Make Up, Bitters & Cocktails, Hair Care, Medicinal Mushrooms, Botanical Body Care Products and more. When she's not whipping up batches of herbal recipes in her kitchen or continuing to learn about medicinal plants, Amber is spending time with her loving husband and sweet dog dancing to local music and sharing in the joy of the Rocky Mountains. Meet Michelle Lyons The herbalist and women's health educator. Michelle is a clinical educator on women's health, an herbalist, a physical therapist and a pelvic health expert. When she is not on the road lecturing at countless women's health conferences, she enjoys life in rural Ireland with menagerie of her animals her well stocked bookcases. Meet Magdalena Wszelaki The host, curator and hormonal expert. Magdalena is the founder of Hormones Balance, a successful online nutrition practice dedicated to helping women rebalance hormones naturally with food and herbs. FAQs Q: Can I refund the purchase? Because this is a mega deal and the $57 only covers our printing and shipping costs, there is no refund with this offer. If you follow us for a while you know that our programs are high quality and help women who apply the teachings. Q: Can I do the program while on bio-identical hormones? Q: Where do I get all the ingredients? Q: Can I get the ingredients where I live? Q: Can I use it with my whole family? Q: Which hormonal imbalances does Herbs for Balance help? Three additional modules focus on the digestion, liver support and sugar balance - the pillars of hormonal health. Q: When can I start the program? Q: How long will I have access for? Q: How do I get the printed book and posters? Q: I've got lots going in my life right now. Can I get the program later? If you think you will enjoy the Quick Action bonuses (especially the printed book and poster), think about getting the program now to take advantage of them (most people do that) and then dive into the program when your life settles down a little. Q: What is the size of the poster? Q: Are the herbs used in the program suitable for women in perimenopause or menopause? Q: Can this program help me if I had a full/partial hysterectomy or mastectomy? Q: Is it safe to take these herbs when I'm taking bio-identical hormones such as thyroid, estrogen or progesterone? Q: Is it safe to take the herbs when I'm on birth control pills? Q: What if I don't have the time to make the recipes? As for skincare recipes, if you prefer to purchase them ready-made, I've created the Safe & Clean Brands GUIDE that is available for the Quick Action participants (who join within the next 48 hours). Q: Are the herbs used in the program suitable for pregnant and lactating women? Q: Is it cheaper to make some of the recipes than buying ready-made? Q: My lotion/shampoo/soap/cream label says \"organic.\" Is it safe? Many chemicals are added even to organic brands without being fully tested (yes, the USDA and the FDA allow that) so you don't really know what you are putting on your body. - Unlike food, the body care and cosmetics industries are almost entirely not regulated. Therefore, when you see \"organic\" on the label it is at the sole discretion of the manufacturer. - To responsibly use the \"organic\" label, the Soil Association requires manufacturers to use 95% organic products excluding water. This is just a guideline which some follow and others do not. - Bottom line: To be 100% sure what you put on your skin (of which 60% will get absorbed to your body), it is therefore best to learn to make (at least some) of the skincare products.
