Abstract Title of dissertation: Progression of Stage I Pressure Ulcers in Elderly Hip Fracture Patients Azadeh Shoaibi, Doctor of Philosophy, 2014 Dissertation directed by: Mona Baumgarten PhD, Professor, Department of epidemiology and Public Health Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a major health problem associated with significant morbidity, diminished quality of life, and increased health care costs. The study objective wa s to evaluate the clinical course of stage I PUs, risk factors for their progression to a higher stage, and effectiveness of pressure -redistributing support surfaces (PRSS) to prevent their progression in elderly hip fracture patients. This study involve d secondary analyses of data collected in a prospective cohort study. It included 168 patients who were 65 years old or older, hospitalized for a hip fracture surgery, and developed at least one stage I PU. Patients were examined at baseline and on alterna ting days for 11 visits as they moved through different care settings. The primary outcome was progression of stage I PUs to a higher stage at all anatomical sites, and in hip and foot areas. The study population developed 278 stage I PUs. The crude IR a nd 95% confidence interval (CI) of progression was 7.8 (6.5 -9.4) per 100 ulcer -days at all anatomical sites. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI of progression comparing hip to foot PUs was 2.3 (1.3 -4.1). Older age [75 -84 years (HR: 0.3, (HR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.1 -0.6)] compared to younger age (65 -74 years), and moderate compared to low risk of nutrition -related complications (HR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.2 -0.8) were disorientation (HR: 2.9, 95% CI: (HR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.1 -4.1) were associated with increased risk of progression at all anatomical sites. In hip area, being chair bound compared to walking (HR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.1 -0.8) was associated with reduced risk of progression; there was no strong evidence for an association between incontinence or low body mass index (BMI) and progression . In foot area, there was no strong evidence for an association between respiratory disease or diabetes and progression; peripheral artery disease (HR: 6.1, 95% CI: 2.2 -17.3) was associated with increased risk of progression. There was no strong evidence for an association between PRSS use and progression at all anatomical sites or in hip or foot areas.

INTRODUCTION A pressure ulcer (PU) is localized injury to skin or underlying tissue over a bony prominence due to pressure, shear, or frict ion. (Black et al., 2007) PUs are caused by impaired blood supply and tissue ischemia due to prolonged pressure over skin, soft tissue, muscle, or bone. (C. Campb ell & Parish, 2010; Haleem, Heinert, & Parker, 2008) Reperfusion following ischemia results in the local accumulation of toxic metabolites and increases the rate of cell death (C. Campbell & Parish , 2010; Haleem et al., 2008) which leads to ulceration and necrosis of skin and underlying tissue. Constant pressure can arise when lying down or sitting. The skin overlying the sacrum, buttocks, and heels is most often affected, but PUs can develop on an y part of the body where sustained pressure and compressive forces are maintained for a sufficient period of time. (Bansal, Scott, Stewart, & Cockerell, 2005; C. Campbell & Parish, 2010) Accordin g to the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) (Black et al., 2007) , PUs are classified into four stages. Stage I is the least severe and is defined as intact skin with non -blanchable redness of a localized area over a bony prominence. Each subsequent stage is more severe and involves deeper layers of skin tissue, muscle, tendon, and bone. (Black et al., 2007) PUs are a major health problem associated with significant pain, mo rbidity, diminished quality of life (Bansal et al., 2005; Baumgarten, Margolis, Berlin et al., 2003; Lindholm et al., 2008) , prolonged hospital stay (Bansal et al., 2005; Lindholm et al., 2008) , 2 increased health care costs (Bansal et al., 2005; Baumgarten et al., 2006; Lindholm et 2005; Edsberg, Geyer, & Zulkowski, 2005) . The prevalence of PUs in United States (US) health care settings in 2009 was 12.3%. (VanGilder, Amlung, Harrison, & Meyer, 2009) Hospitalized surgical patients have a high incidence of PUs. (Bansal et al., 2005; Baumgarten, Margolis, Orwig et al., 2009) Hip fracture patients ar e at particularly high risk of developing PUs probably due to long periods of immobility and the high prevalence of PU risk factors in this population (Gunningberg, Lindh olm, 45 Gunningberg,L. 2000}} . The incidence of PUs among hip fracture patients is reported to be 36.1%. (Baumgarten, Margolis, Orwig et al., 2009) In the United States (US), the cost of hospital stays with a diagnosis of PUs totaled $11.0 billion in 2006. (AHRQ News and Numbers, 2008; Russo, Steiner, & Spector, 2008) Stage I PUs are difficult to detect and diagnose (Bates -Jensen, McCreath, Kono, Apeles, & Alessi, 2007; Halfens, Bours, & Van Ast, 200 1) and are often viewed as having little clinical significance. (Halfens et al., 2001) However, studies (Gunnin gberg, al., Halfens,R.J. 2001; 30 Gunningberg,L. 2004}} have shown that stage I PUs account for a relatively large proportion of PUs, and it has been suggested that stage I PUs are a risk factor for further PU development (Allman, Goode, Patrick, Burst, & Bartolucci, 1995; Bates -Jensen et al., 2007; Halfens et al., 2001) . Nevertheless, very little research has been performed on the clinical course, progression, prevention, 3 and treatment of stage I PUs. The few studies that have focused on stage I PUs have major methodologic limitations. Some of the recognized risk factors associated with the development of PUs include older age (Baumgarten et al., 2006; Haleem et al., al., 1995; Baumgarten, Berlin et al., 2006; Johnston, 2007; Maklebust & Magnan, 1994) s-Jensen Shahin et al., 2010) , and co - morbidities such as diabetes (Haleem et al., 2008; Lefaivre et al., 2009) . Lack of mobility is the single most important risk factor for PUs. (Thomas, 2010) Also, the risk of developing PUs is different in different care settings. (Baumgarten , Margolis, Orwig et al., 2009) However, due to the scant amount of research on stage I PUs, it is not clear whether the conventional PU risk factors also apply to the progression of stage I PUs and whether the progression of stage I PUs is associated wit h the type of care setting. Certain anatomical sites, such as the sacrum and heels, are at higher risk of PUs because these areas sustain a higher level of pressure. (Baumgarten et al., 2006; K. E. Campbell, 4 Grypdonck, 2002) It has been shown that the mechanis m of and risk factors for PU development may be different at different anatomical sites. (Clegg et al., 2009; Pompeo & Baxter, 2000; Thomas, 2010) For example, being bedbound is a significant risk factor for sacral PUs whereas being chair bound puts patients at higher risk for ischial PUs due to the concentration of unrelieved pressure that the body position applies to each anatomical site while lying down or sitting, respectivel y. (Pompeo & Baxter, 2000; Thorfinn, Sjoberg, & Lidman, 2009) Urinary and fecal incontinence are considered significant risk factors for PUs on the lower truncal area because of moisture and subst ances in fecal material damaging the skin surface resulting in skin maceration. (Anders et al., 2010) Certain medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus and peripheral artery disease are important risk factors for th e heels because these conditions reduce peripheral circulation and oxygen supply to the extremities. (Fowler, Scott -Williams, & McGuire, 2008) Reduced arterial blood flow in the lower extremities (Okuwa et al., 2006) has been shown to be a risk factor for the development of lower extremity PUs in bedbound older patients, and vascular occlusion and stretching of blood vessels caused by contracture is suggested as the potential mechani sm. (Okuwa et al., 2006) These results are from studies that assessed risk factors in relation to onset of new PUs, regardless of stage; there is very little evidence related to stage I PUs and their progression by anat omical site. A number of measures are recommended for the prevention and treatment of PUs including risk assessment, regular and frequent manual turning and repositioning, and use 5 of pressure -redistributing support surfaces (PRSS) such as mattresses, over lays, and beds. (Ratliff & WOCN, 2005; Royal College of Nursing and National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence, 20 05) Support surfaces are utilized to redistribute pressure over a larger surface area of the patient's body and reduce the amount of pressure to any one area of the skin. (Anderson, Hanson, Lange mo, Hunter, & Thompson, 2006; Edsberg et al., 2005) Clinical guidelines from professional clinical organizations (Comfort, 2008; Edsberg et al., 2005; European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel & National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel, 2009; Ratli ff & WOCN, 2005; Royal College of Nursing and National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence, 2005) recommend that patients at risk of developing PUs be placed on PRSS devices and not on an ordinary hospital mattress. However, studies have shown con flicting results in terms of the impact of PRSS devices on the prevention of PUs. Some studies have shown no benefit (Allman et al., 1995; 2007) while others have reported a significant decrease in incidence of PUs (Comfort, 2008; De 2008) . Nevertheless, there are very few studies that have investigated the use of such surfaces for preventing the progression of stage I PUs to higher stages. (Vanderwee et al., 2007) More importantly, studies have not focused on the effect of PRSS devices on the prevention of stage I PUs at specific anatomical sites. (Junkin & Gray, 2009; Vanderwee, Grypdonck, & Defloor, 2005) Since the source of unrelieved pressure and mechanism of PU development at different 6 anatomical sites are not the same, the impact of support surfaces on different anatomical sites may differ as well. The objective of this study is to provide knowledge about the clinical course and significance of stage I PUs, risk factors associated with their progression particularly by anatomical site and in different care sett ings, and the effect of prevention methods on progression by anatomical site. Preventing stage I PUs from progressing to higher stages could reduce the clinical and financial burden on patients and health care services. 7 II. RESEARCH QUESTIONS, SPECIFIC A IMS, AND HYPOTHESES The objective of this dissertation is to evaluate the clinical course of stage I PUs, risk factors associated with progression of stage I PUs, and the effectiveness of PRSS devices for the prevention of progression of stage I PUs in el derly hip fracture patients. A. Research Question 1 What are the clinical course and risk factors for the progression of stage I PUs to a higher stage in elderly hip fracture patients? Specific Aims a. Among patients with one or more stage I PUs, to determ ine the rate of each of the following outcomes: 1) progression of one or more stage I PUs to a higher stage; 2) development of one or more PUs at sites other than the site of stage I PUs; 3) both 1) and 2). The unit of analysis for this Aim is the individu al patient. b. To determine the rate of progression of stage I PUs to a higher stage, overall and by ulcer's anatomical site. The unit of analysis for this Aim is the individual ulcer. c. To compare the rate of progression of stage I PUs at different anatomica l sites after controlling for patients' demographic and baseline clinical characteristics, time-varying clinical characteristics, and care setting; the unit of analysis for this Aim is the individual ulcer. 8 d. To identify factors associated with progression r ate of stage I PUs to a higher stage, overall and by ulcer's anatomical site. The unit of analysis for this Aim is the individual ulcer. Hypotheses a. Descriptive analysis, no hypothesis b. Descriptive analysis, no hypothesis c. Stage I PUs in the hip a rea (iliac crest, trochanter, sacrum, and ischium) have a higher rate of progression to a higher stage than those in the foot area (Achilles tendon, heel, medial malleolus, lateral malleolus, tarsals, metatarsals, and phalanges). d1. Stage I PUs in patient s who possess the conventional risk factors for the development of PUs (e.g., older age , reduced mobility, incontinence, impaired mental status, poor nutritional status, and other comorbidit ies) or who are in an acute care setting have a higher rate of pro gression to a higher stage compared to stage I PUs in patients who do not have these risk factors or are in other care settings. d2. For stage I PUs in the hip area, risk factors associated with a higher rate of progression are bedbound or chair bound con dition, urinary and fecal incontinence, and low body mass index (BMI). d3. For stage I PUs in the foot area, risk factors associated with a higher rate of progression are peripheral artery disease , respiratory disease, and diabetes mellitus. 9 Rationale Most studies evaluating PUs concentrate on stage II or higher since stage I PUs are often considered to have little clinical significance. (Anders et al., 2010) Consequently, there is little evidence on factors that are associated with the progression of stage I PUs to higher stages. This study will contribute to knowledge about the clinical significance of stage I PUs. Since progression to a higher stage may be associated with higher morbidity and other adverse conseque nces, it is important to identify risk factors for the progression of stage I PUs to a higher stage so that preventive measures will target patients who are at high risk of progression. The literature shows that the main mechanism for PU development may in volve temporary local blocking of blood to tissue due to unrelieved pressure, along with shear and friction increasing the tissue's susceptibility to pressure. (Anders et al., 2010; C. Campbell & Parish, 2010; Jones, 2005; Kanj, Wilking, & Phillips, 1998) However, the etiology and pathophysiology of PUs at different anatomical sites are not the same and risk factors for PUs at different sites may differ. (Pompeo & Baxter, 2000) For example, certain conditions such as diabetes mellitus and peripheral artery disease impair peripheral blood flow to the lower extremities and reduce tolerance of the tissue to pressure and shear resulting in an increased risk of foot area PUs. (Junkin & Gray, 2009) Similarly, urinary and fecal incontinence are more important risk factors for PUs in the hip area than in the foot area because moisture can result in maceration of the skin in the truncal area. (Beldon, 2008) This study will evaluate specific risk factors for stage I PU progression in different anatomical sites. In addition, evaluation of clinical course of stag e I PUs in different care settings is important in hip fracture patients 10 because they typically move through several care settings during the post -fracture recovery period. Understanding the clinical course of stage I PU in acute vs. non -acute care setting s could help with planning of prevention and treatment measures. B. Research Question 2 What is the effect of PRSS devices on the progression of stage I PUs to a higher stage, overall and by ulcer's anatomical site in elderly hip fracture patients? Speci fic Aim To evaluate the effect of PRSS devices on progression of stage I PUs overall and by anatomical site after controlling for patients' demographic and baseline clinical characteristics, time -varying clinical characteristics, and care setting; the uni t of analysis for this aim is the individual ulcer. Hypotheses a. The use of PRSS devices is associated with a lower rate of progression of S1 PUs overall. b. The use of PRSS devices is associated with a lower rate of progression of S1 PUs in the hip area. c. The use of PRSS devices is not associated with the rate of progression of S1 PUs in the foot area. 11 Rationale The use of PRSS devices represents an important part of the standard approach to the prevention of PUs. (Anders et al., 2010; Edlich A., 2009) However, ther e is contradictory evidence in the literature about the effectiveness of PRSS devices in general (Allman et al., 1995; Comfort, 2008; Cullum, Deeks, Sheldon, Song, & Fletcher, 2000; Laat et al., 2006; McInnes et al., et al., 2006; Vanderwee et al., 2007; Vanderwee et al., 2008) while the effect of PRSS dev ices on the prevention of stage I PU progression has rarely been evaluated. In addition, just as the etiology and pathophysiology of PUs at different anatomical sites may be different, strategies for their prevention at different anatomical locations may a lso differ. (Junkin & Gray, 2009; McInnes et al., 2012; Pompeo & Baxter, 2000) Assessing the effect of PRSS devices on the progression of stage I PUs could have important clinic al and financial ramifications. Knowledge about the differential impact of PRSS devices by anatomical location could also highlight the need for more customized approaches to prevention. 12 III. BACKGROUND A. Definition and Staging of Pressure Ulcers A PU is localized injury to skin or underlying tissue over a bony prominence due to pressure, or pressure in combination with shear or friction. (Black et al., 2007) Historically, various staging methods have been used to d ifferentiate among severity levels of PUs. The most widely used classification or staging system is that of the NPUAP (Bansal et al., 2005; Black et al., 2007) described in Table 1. The NPUAP classifie s PUs into four stages plus deep tissue injury with stage I being the least severe and stage IV along with deep tissue injury the most severe. 13 Table 1: The 2007 NPUAP classification of PUs (Black et al., 2007) Stage of PU Description I Intact skin with non -blanchable redness of a localized area over a bony prominence; darkly pigmented skin may not have visible blanching, and its color may be different from that of the surrounding area. II Partial -thickness loss of dermis presenting as a shallow open ulcer with a red pink wound bed without slough. It may also present as an intact or ruptured serum -filled blister. III Full-thickness tissue loss; subcutaneous fat may be visible but bone, tendon, or muscle is not exposed. Slough may be present but does not obscure the depth of tissue loss; it may include undermining or tunneling. The depth of stage III PU varies by anatomical location. IV Full-thickness tissue loss with exposed bone, tendo n, or muscle. Slough or eschar may be present on some parts of the wound bed. It often includes undermining or tunneling. The depth of stage IV PU varies by anatomical location. Deep Tissue Injury Purple or maroon localized area of discolored intact ski n or blood -filled blister due to damage of underlying soft tissue from pressure or shear. The area may be preceded by tissue that is painful, firm, mushy, boggy, warmer, or cooler compared to adjacent tissue. Unstageable Full-thickness tissue loss in whic h the base of the ulcer is covered by slough or eschar in the wound bed. Until enough slough and eschar is removed to expose the base of the wound, the true depth and stage cannot be determined. There is not an orderly progression of damage from the epid ermis (lower stage) to the dermis and subcutis (higher stage) in PU development, and PUs do not always start at stage I and gradually move to a higher stage. (Bansal et al., 2005) There is no natural regression of PUs f rom stage IV to stage I during the healing process because \"healing PUs do not replace lost structural layers of tissue defined by the numerical PU stages. Instead, healing full -thickness ulcers are filled with granulation tissue (mainly endothelial cells) , fibroblasts, and extracellular matrix produced by fibroblasts.\" (Maklebust, 1997) Thus, use of reverse staging for healing PUs is inappropriate. 14 B. Mechanism and Pathophysiology of Pressure Ulcers The developmen t of PUs is related to the mechanical loading of soft tissue. Pressure is the most important factor in the formation of PUs, but other factors such as friction and shear are also involved. Moisture can exacerbate the effects of friction and shear as well. (C. Campbell & Parish, 2010) There are a few major hypotheses that explain the relationship between mechanical loading and tissue necrosis. (Bouten, Oomens , Baaijens, & Bader, 2003; Olesen, de Zee, & Rasmussen, 2010) The ischemia hypothesis proposes that when externally applied pressure exceeds the capillary pressure within the tissue, capillary occlusion and local ischemia occur. Cells which depend on th e transportation of oxygen, heat, and nutrients in the blood become hypoxic, and lymphatic drainage decreases. At the same time, interstitial fluid is squeezed out causing cell -to-cell contact, membrane rupture, and release of toxic intracellular materials . Interstitial edema interferes with metabolic exchange distorting and thickening the tissues which causes further compression and increased skin vulnerability. Concurrent shearing forces damage the arterioles, interrupt the microcirculation, disrupt the e ndothelium, and activate intrinsic clotting mechanisms. Then, platelet aggregation occludes the vessels and increases the incidence of ischemia. (Jones, 2005) After the relief of pressure, the blood flow returns to its previous level, but this recovery time may prolong hypoxia enough to cause necrosis. (Anders et al., 2010; C. Campbell & Parish, 2010; Thomas, 2010) 15 According to the reperf usion hypothesis, tissue is further damaged by the release of pressure. A sudden and large increase in blood flow occurs as anoxia and metabolites act on peri -capillary sphincters and metarterioles and increase the blood flow by up to 30 times creating a b right red flush -reactive hyperemia. This initial defense mechanism is to reduce the oxygen deficiency and remove waste products through the process of vasodilation. Free radicals are released and oxygen is converted to superoxide anions which are destructi ve to tissue. Through this process, endothelial damage causes neutrophil migration; the capillaries experience further blockage; there is an increase in free radical release; and cell death follows. Another effect of pressure removal is a sudden reduction in interstitial fluid pressure which causes capillary burst and interstitial flooding with the damaged lymphatic system preventing effective drainage. Subsequently, the toxic intracellular products remain and result in necrosis. (Jones, 2005) The level of reperfusion is positively correlated with the duration of ischemia. (Olesen et al., 2010; Thomas, 2010) The tissue deformation hypothesis suggests that pre ssure and shear lead to cellular damage caused by sustained cell deformation. Cell deformation leads to a variety of effects such as volume changes and cytoskeletal reorganization which may be involved in early tissue breakdown. This deformation results in physical damage as the tissue moves away from the area of highest pressure. Also, the microvasculature becomes over - stretched and partially torn and generates micro -thrombi which deprive a certain area of blood and result in the appearance of a plaque of necrosis. Such plaques are normally found over bony prominences and are the precursors of serious PUs. Thus, there is a 16 relationship between the amount of pressure and shear, the length of time the strain is applied, and the development of necrosis. (Bouten et al., 2003; Lowthian, 1997; Olesen et al., 2010) C. Common Anatomical Sites for Pressure Ulcers The process of PU development is most prominent where bony or car tilaginous prominences have only a thin soft -tissue covering. Thus, the common anatomical sites for PU development are the cutaneous surfaces in the lower trunk over the coccyx, sacrum, spinous processes, ischium, gluteal muscles as well as heels, ankles, and elbows; for patients lying on their side, the iliac crest and the trochanters (hips) are at high risk. (Anders et al., 2010; Jaul, 2010; Kanj et al., 1998) The most common ana tomical sites for PU development are the sacrum and heels. However, PUs can develop on any part of the body where sustained pressure and compressive forces are maintained for a sufficient period of time. Sacral PUs are 'lying down' wounds and develop in sicker patients who are primarily bedbound. (Pompeo & Baxter, 2000) In bedbound patients, sacral PUs are more common than PUs at other anatomical sites because the sacrum receives more pressure than other sites when th e individual is supine and because the sacrum has less fat padding than other areas. (Thomas, 2010) Ischial PUs are 'sitting up' wounds that develop in individuals who spend a lot of time in the seated position. They are seen in two groups: chair bound 17 or wheelchair -bound patients with spinal cord injury and mobility -impaired older adults. (Pompeo & Baxter, 2000) The subcutaneous tissue of the heel is made up primarily of connec tive tissue with sparse fat. The only muscle located in the heel is the panniculus carnosus. It is hypothesized that the panniculus carnosus is the primary site of tissue damage in patients with heel PUs. \"A combination of a broad bony prominence, a thin l ayer of subcutaneous tissue, and maximally distal vascular supply causes the entire heel to be vulnerable to both ischemia and ulceration.\" (Junkin & Gray, 2009) The heel is exposed to significant tissue interface pressure, shear, and friction especially when the patient is immobile for a long period of time, is in direct contact with a mattress or support surface, or is agitated, demented, or experiencing frequent lower extremity movement or tremors, or when the head o f the bed is elevated. (Junkin & Gray, 2009) D. Incidence and Prevalence of Pressure Ulcers The incidence and prevalence of PUs vary in different patient populations, and care settings. The wide range of reported inci dence and prevalence estimates from different studies may be due to different study designs and analytic methods, sampling strategies, lengths of follow -up, frequency and method of PU assessment, inclusion or exclusion of stage I PUs as an outcome, as well as presence of PU management and prevention practices, quality of care, and staffing in health care facilities. Therefore, it is difficult to draw conclusions about trends over time and across different care settings and 18 populations by comparing results f rom different studies. The examples listed below reflect this variation in estimates. It has been estimated that PUs affect approximately 2.5 million people annually. (House, Giles, & Whitcomb, 2011) The National Datab ase of Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI) (Bergquist -Beringer, Dong, He, & Dunton, 2013) is a large nursing quality registry in the US from which PU prevention performance and its influence on PU outcomes c an be examined. The NDNQI Pressure Ulcer Survey of 2010 (Bergquist - Beringer et al., 2013) included 1,419 acute care hospitals (almost a quarter of all hospitals in the US) whose participation was voluntary, and it collected data from 710,626 patients. The proportion of hospital -acquired PUs among all surveyed patients was 3.6%; this proportion was 7.9% among patients assessed to be at risk of PUs who comprised about 40% of all patients surveyed. Of all PUs d etected, 27.9% and 26.2% were stage I among all surveyed patients and patients at risk of PUs, respectively. These proportions for stage II PUs included 41.8% and 42.2%, respectively. The 2008 and 2009 International Pressure Ulcer Prevalence Surveys (VanGilder et al., 2009) provide an estimate for the prevalence of PUs. The majority of US patients included in the study were in the acute care setting (92.8% in 2008 and in 94.1% in 2009). The overall prevalence of P Us in acute care facilities was 13.1% in 2008 and went down slightly in 2009 to 11.9%. The facility -acquired prevalence was 6.0% in 2008 and 5.0% in 2009. (Table 2) The prevalence was lower when stage I PUs were not included in the estimates. 19 Table 2: Prevalence of PUs in acute care facilities in the US in 2008 and 2009 (VanGilder, MacFarlane, Meyer, & Lachenbruch, 2009) 2008 (N=90,398) 2009 (N=92,408) Stage I PUs included in prev Overall 13.1% 11.9% Facility -acquired only 6.0% 5.0% Stage I PUs excluded from prevalence estimate Overall 9.2% 8.7% Facility -acquired only 3.6% 3.2% The Collaborative Alliance for Nursing Outcomes performed a survey (Stotts, Brown, Donaldson, Aydin, & Fridman, 2013) on the prevalence of PUs in 78 acute care hospitals from 2003 to 2010. Almost all hospitals were located in California (only one in Arizona and one in Oregon), and their participati on in the survey was voluntary. The survey reported on 258,456 adult patients over the 8 -year period, and it included stage I PUs in the assessment. Table 3 shows the prevalence of hospital -acquired and community - acquired (already present at the time of ho spitalization) PUs over this time period. The prevalence of hospital -acquired PUs was higher than that of community -acquired PU in 2003, but it steadily and significantly decreased from 2003 to 2010. The decline included a decrease in prevalence of all sta ges of PUs. However, the prevalence of community - acquired PUs remained almost the same. 20 Table 3: Prevalence of hospital - and community -acquired PUs in acute care hospitals 2003 -2010 in California, Arizona, and Oregon Year Hospita l-acquired PUs (%) Community -acquired PUs (%) 2003 10.4 5.7 2004 9.4 5.7 2005 7.8 5.3 2006 7.0 5.6 2007 6.2 5.4 2008 4.5 5.9 2009 2.8 5.3 2010 1.8 5.0 Lyder et al (Lyder et al., 2012) utilized data from th e Medicare Patient Safety Monitoring System (MPSMS) which is a nationwide surveillance system designed to identify rates of specific adverse events within the hospitalized fee -for-service Medicare population. The study included 51,842 Medicare fee -for-service inpatient hospital discharges across the entire US, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands between January 2006 and December 2007. In this period, the incidence of hospital -acquired PUs was 4.5%, and PU prevalence on admission was 5.8%. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) in a report from 2006 (AHRQ News and Numbers, 2008; Russo et al., 2008) showed that PUs are increasingly common in US hospitalizations. In 2006, there were 503,300 hospital stays during which PUs were noted, an increase of 78.9% from 1993 when there were about 281,300 hospital stays during which PUs were noted. During this same time period, the total number of hospitalizations increased by only 15% . Stays with a secondary diagnosis of PUs increased by 86.4% during this period while stays principally for PUs increased by 27.2%. 21 Hip fracture patients are at particularly high risk of developing PUs due to long periods of immobility and the high preval ence of PU risk factors in this population (Gunningberg et al., 2000; Lardenoye et al., 2009; Lindholm et al., 2008) .The cumulative incidence of PUs among hip fracture p atients at 32 days after initial hospitalization was reported to be 36.1% in one study. (Baumgarten, Margolis, Orwig et al., 2009) Data on the incidence and prevalence of stage I PUs are scarce. The International Pressure Ulcer Prevalence Surveys reported the proportion of stage I PUs among patients with PUs from 1989 to 2005. The data predominantly came from the US (>95% of patients surveyed across survey years) and included acute care, long -term acute care, and long-term care settings. As shown in Table 4, the proportion of stage I PUs fluctuated slightly in this time period. (Vangilder, Macfarlane, & Meyer, 2008) Table 4: Proportion of stage I PUs am ong patients with PUs from 1989 to 2005 in all care settings combined (Vangilder et al., 2008) Year 1989 1991 1993 1995 1999 2001 2003 2004 2005 Proportion of stage I PUs among patients with PUs (%) 39 38 38 35 37 38 39 33 34 A nationwide survey (Baath, Idvall, Gunningberg, & Hommel, 2014) conducted in Sweden in 2011 and 2012 reported that about 55% of all PUs detected were stage I, and the overall prevalence of PU s was 16.1% in hospitals and 11.8% in nursing homes. As previously noted, the sacrum and heels are the most common anatomical sites for the development of PUs in both hospitals and long -term care facilities. (Baumgarten, Margolis, B erlin et al., 2003; Baumgarten Wann -Hansson, Hagell, & Willman, 2008) A study performed in hip fracture patients reported the incidence of PUs to be 3.8%; of all the PUs, 55% developed on the sacrum and 33% on the h eels. (Haleem et al., 2008) The 2005 International Pressure Ulcer Prevalence Survey reported the prevalence of PUs to be 15.1%; of all the PUs, 28.3% were located on the sacrum, 23.6% on heels, and 17.2% on buttocks. (Vangilder et al., 2008) A study (Lyder et al., 2012) using data from the Medicare Patient Safety Monitoring System reported that the incidence of hospital -acquired PUs was 4.5 % among Medicare fee-for-service inpatient hospital discharges across the entire US, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands between January 2006 and December 2007. The majority of PUs were located on the coccyx or sacrum (41%), followed by hip and buttock region (23%), and the heels (23%). The Swedish nationwide PU survey in 2012 (Baath et al., 2014) reported that the proportion of stage I PUs was 8.1% in hospitals and 5.7% in nursing homes. The largest proportion of all PUs including stage I PUs was on the sacrum and heels in both hospitals and nursing homes. The proportion of stage I PUs on the sacrum was 34% in hospitals and 27.1% in nursing homes, and that of the heels was 38.9% on the sacrum and 35.0% in nursing homes . 23 E. Impact of Pressure Ulcers PUs can be a debilitating health condition and can have significant negative impact on the patients' quality of life. (Gorecki et al., 2009) They can also slow down the process of rehabilitation following acute events such as surgically treated hip fractures. (Indig, Ronen, Eldar, Tamir, & Susak, 1995) Stage III and IV PUs which are more severe than lower stages have more significant and debilitating consequences. They can interfere with activities of daily living and quality of life due to reduced physical activity, pain, odor, and presence of major wounds. This limitation can lead to loss of independence and social isolation. The psychological impac t of PUs includes emotional problems, desire for regained control and independence, change in body image perception due to wounds and scars, and feelings of being a burden on family and friends. (Gorecki et al., 2009) Continuous and severe pain is a major debilitating factor associated with PUs. (Gorecki, Closs, Nixon, & Briggs, 2011) PUs also have substantial socioeconomic and financial consequences due to medical costs, inability to work or poor work opportunities, and poor living situations. (Gorecki et al., 2009) Advanced PUs can result in potentially life -threatening complications such as local infection, sepsis (Edsberg et al., 2005; Thomas, 2001b; fistulas, and carcinoma (Kanj et al., 1998) . It has also been reported that development of PUs is significantly associated with longer hospital lengths of stay, higher in -hospital mortality and mortality within 3 0 24 days after discharge. (Lyder et al., 2012) However, it is not clear whether the higher mortality associated with PUs represents a direct effect or is due to the fact that patients with PUs often have serious coexist ing illnesses and are functionally dependent. It may be these coexisting conditions and not the PUs themselves that are the cause of increased mortality. (Berlowitz, Bran deis, Anderson, Du, & Brand, 1997; Thomas, 2001b; Thomas, 2001c) In 2004, the NPUAP estimated that the annual direct cost of treating facility -acquired PUs ranged from $400,000 to $700,000. (House et al., 2011) It has been reported that the average cost of treating a patient with a PU is $15,229 higher than that for a patient without a PU even after adjusting costs for admission characteristics and other complications. (Edsberg et al., 2005) According to an AHRQ report in 2006, while the average hospital stay is five days and costs about $10,000, the average PU -related stay extends to between 13 and 14 days and costs between $16,755 and $20,430, depending on medical circumstances . Adult hospital stays noting a diagnosis of PUs totaled $11.0 billion in 2006. Stays principally for PUs were longer than stays with a secondary diagnosis of PUs and those with no PUs diagnosis. (AHRQ News and Numbers, 2008; Russo et al., 2008) Using data from the Ontario Case Costing Initiative from 2002 to 2006, a study estimated the net cost of hospital -acquired and pre -admission PUs in an acute care setting in Ontario, Canada. (Chan, Ieraci, Mitsakakis, Pham, & Krahn, 2013) The study population 25 consisted of individuals 65 years and older, and the outcome was a stage II or higher PU. The control group consisted of patients in the same age group wit hout any PUs. In modelling the net cost of PUs, the reason for admission was matched and adjusted for between PU and non -PU cohorts. For hospital -acquired PUs, the net costs ranged from CA$44,000 (currently approximately US$40,000) for stage II PUs to CA$9 0,000 (currently approximately US$82,000) for stage IV PUs. For pre -admission PUs, the net costs ranged between CA$11,000 (currently approximately US$10,000) for stage II PUs and CA$18,500 (currently approximately US$17,000) for stage IV PUs. The study fou nd that the net cost of hospital -acquired PUs was almost three times as high as that of chronic ischemic heart disease. F. Stage I Pressure Ulcers A stage I PU (or non -blanchable erythema) is the first outward sign of a pathological tissue reaction to pre ssure and shearing forces; a stage I PU is considered to be reversible if pressure and shearing forces are at least partially relieved soon after onset of the PU. (Vanderwee et al., 2007) A small number of studies have reported on the progression of stage I PUs to a higher stage (Table 5), and even fewer have reported on the timing of progression. The reported progression proportions have a large range probably due to the same reasons as for reported incidence and prevalence of PUs. Allman reported that stage I PUs progressed to a higher stage in 57.9% of chair bound, bedbound, or hip fracture patients in an acute hospital. (Allman et al., 1995) Among surgical patients in a ho spital in Netherlands, 26 27.9% of stage I PUs progressed to a higher stage in the first two days following surgery. (Schoonhoven et al., 2002) An Italian study (Bulfone, Marzoli, Quattrin, Fabbro, & Palese, 2012) reported that among patients who underwent major surgery and developed stage I PUs intra -operatively, 16.6% progressed to stage II by the third post -operative day. The anatomical site of PUs included sacrum, forearm, but tocks, heel, and knee. A Canadian study found that among patients with elective orthopedic surgery or surgical or non-surgical treatment of a fractured hip, 17.6% of stage I heel PUs progressed to a higher stage. (K. E. Campbell, Woodbury, & Houghton, 2010a) In another study in the Netherlands, 8.7% of stage I PUs in long -term care hospitals, and 22.1% of stage I PUs in acute care hospitals, deteriorated to a higher stage. Patients whose stage I PUs progressed and patients whose stage I PUs did not progress to a higher stage received similar type of preventive measures such as position change and pressure redistributing surfaces before progression of ulcers. (Halfens et al., 20 01) In a long -term care facility in Japan, 35.5% of stage I PUs progressed to a higher stage. (Sato, Sanada, Konya, Sugama, & Nakagami, 2006) Among Belgian nursing home residents, 18.7% had stage I PUs that progressed to a higher stage; 33 of 44 ulcers were located on the sacrum and 11 on heels and ankles. (Vanderwee, Grypdonck, De Bacquer, & Defloor, 2009) 27 Table 5: Studies reporting on progression of st age I PUs to a higher stage First Author, Year, Country Patient Population Care Setting Number (%) of stage I PUs that progressed or number (%) of patients whose stage I PUs progressed Allman, 1995, USA Chair bound, bedbound or hip fracture Acute care ho spital 11/19 patients (57.9%) Schoonhoven, 2002, Netherlands Surgical patients Acute care hospital 12/43 ulcers (27.9%) Bulfone, 2012, Italy Surgical patients Acute care hospital 1/6 ulcers (16.6%) Campbell, 2010, Canada Orthopedic patients Acute care h ospital 3/17 ulcers (17.6%) Halfens, 2001, Netherlands All patients Long -term care hospital Acute care hospital 12/141 ulcers (8.7%) in 115 patients 19/85 ulcers (22.1%) in 68 patients Sato, 2006, Japan All patients Long -term care facility 11/31 ulcers ( 35.5%) in 11/30 patients (36.7%) Vanderwee, 2009, Belgium All residents Nursing home 44/235 patients (18.7%) In few studies that have evaluated the progression of stage I PUs, the results show that a large proportion of these ulcers has the propensity to progress to higher stages and consequently to more severe clinical conditions. Although several studies have found the presence of stage I PUs to be associated with a higher incidence of stage II and higher PUs (Allman et al., 1995; Nixon et al., 2006; Nixon et al., 2007; Reed, Hepburn, Adelson, Center, & McKnight, 2003) (Nixon et al., 2006) {{99 Nixon,J. 2006}} , the clinical significance of stage I PUs remains unclear. G. Validity and Reliability of Stage I Pressure Ulcer Diagnosis The validity and reliability of PU diagnosis and staging are major methodological issues in stud ying PUs. (Stausberg et al., 2007) Stage I PUs are particularly difficult to diagnose 28 because there is no visible breakdown of the skin. (Stausberg et al., 2007; Sterner, Bacquer, & Defloor, 2006) One simple and common method used for distinguishing blanchable erythema from stage I PUs (non -blanchable erythema) is to apply light pressure from a finger or a transparent disk on an area of redness that has appeared on intact skin; if the skin blanches (blanching hyperemia), it is thought that the patient's microcirculation is intact and no PU is present. If the skin does not bl anch (non -blanchable erythema), a stage I PU is diagnosed. However, this method is subjective and depends on the assessor's experience and lighting conditions. Also, it has been suggested that accurate diagnosis of stage I PUs is particularly challenging i n individuals with dark skin. (Sterner et al., 2011) Erythema often remains undetected because of the need to turn patients in order to examine all parts of the body; this can be challenging in patients who are very frail, who are obese, or who are restricted by medical equipment. In obese patients, areas of redness may be hidden within skinfolds, making it difficult to detect stage I PUs. The predictive validity and inter -observer reliability of diagnosis and staging of PUs have been evaluated in a few studies, and they vary across different anatomical sites. (Baumgarten, Margolis, Selekof et al., 2009; Jesada et al., 2013; Localio et al., 2006; Stausberg et al., 2007) However, these parameters have not been sufficiently examined for stage I PUs. Using bedside examination, with diagnosis by a physician as the reference method, one study assessed the inter -rater re liability and predictive validity of distinguishing blanchable from non -blanchable erythema (stage I PU) using finger and disk methods. The results showed that the agreement between the nurses and the 29 physician for both methods was 92%. The inter -rater rel iability was 69% for the finger method and 72% for the disk method. The validity and reliability results varied across different anatomical sites. (Vanderwee et al., 2006) A study (Jesada et al., 2013) compared bedside assessment of PU staging by hospital certified wound ostomy nurses (CWON) to assessment of the same wounds by an expert panel of CWONs using digital photography. Inter -rater reliability was fair to moderate; kappa coefficients for NPUAP overall staging ranged from 0.39 to 0.58; percent agreement for stage III and IV PUs (6.1% -13.1%) was higher than for stage I and II PUs (1%-5%). H. Risk Factors for Development of Pressure Ulcers 1. Extrinsic Factors a. Inter face Pressure Normal capillary pressure ranges between 12 and 32 mmHg. Sitting on a hard surface, lying in bed, or lying on a hospital mattress can result in excessive local pressure between the body and the surface it is resting on. (Jaul, 2010) This local pressure is labeled interface pressure and is defined as the perpendicular force per unit area between the support surface and the body (Peterson, Gravenstein, Schwab, van Oost rom, & Caruso, 2013) . Interface pressure is highest around the sacrum, coccyx, and ischial tuberosities, and those are the anatomical sites where the majority of PUs occur. (Peterson et al., 2013) Interface pressu re over 32 mmHg raises interstitial pressure and causes a decrease in 30 capillary blood flow and occlusion of blood perfusion to the local area followed by tissue ischemia. (Kanj et al., 1998) Highest interstitial pressu res occur at the bone -muscle interface with less damage at the dermo -epidermal level. A PU is the product of both the intensity and duration of pressure. (Jaul, 2010) b. Shearing Shearing pressure results from the slid ing and relative displacement of two opposing surfaces. It happens when bone and subcutaneous layers move against the skin in opposite directions to each other. Shearing forces are major contributors to the size and stage of PUs. (Kanj et al., 1998) \"On a hospital bed, when the head of the bed for a supine patient is raised more than 30\u00b0, shearing forces occur in the sacral and coccygeal areas; while the outer sacral skin is fixed due to friction with the bed, sliding o f the torso transmits pressure to the sacrum and deep fascia. This results in angulation of vessels in the deep part of the superficial fascia with thrombosis and undermining of the dermis.\" (Kanj et al., 1998) c. Friction Friction is the force that resists relative motion between two surfaces in contact; in the case of PUs, the two surfaces are the surface of an external object and the skin. By damaging the protective stratum corneum, friction compromises the skin bar rier, and skin ulceration is enhanced. Friction can occur when a bedridden patient is dragged across the bed sheets. (Kanj et al., 1998) Agitated elderly patients rub their heels or elbows and cause the formation of in tra-epidermal blisters which damage the skin and accelerate the 31 formation of PUs. The effect of friction on development of PUs is increased considerably in the presence of excessive moisture. (Jaul, 2010) d. Moisture Moisture does not cause a pressure injury, but by macerating or softening the upper layers of the skin and changing the cutaneous pH, moisture facilitates injury to the skin even with light pressure. (Anders et al., 2010; Jaul, 2010) Moisture could be due to urinary or fecal incontinence or any type of body fluid such as perspiration, drainage of a fistula or excessive secretion from a wound, or even wetness after bathing. 2. Intrinsic Factors a. Immob ility Reduced mobility is the single most important risk factor for PUs in the elderly population. (Coleman et al., 2013; Jaul, 2010; Thomas, 2010) Immobility may be due to illnesses such as stroke or end -stage dementia. \"In patients with sensorimotor impairments or patients who have undergone prolonged periods of sedation or anesthesia, the afferent nerves are unable to engage the sensorimotor feedback system. As a result, early warnings of prolonged ischemia, such as discomfort, do not produce the normal adjustments in body position that intermittently relieve pressure on areas at risk.\" (Salcido, R., Popescu, A., 2009) Studi es have demonstrated an association between limited mobility or being bedbound or chair bound and the incidence of PUs in hip fracture patients and other medical and surgical patients. (Allman et al., 1995; 32 Baumgarten 2009; Lindgren, Unosson, Fredrikson, & Ek, 2004) b. Age and Comorbidities Older adults account for more than 60% of patients with PUs (Anders et al., 2010) , and there is a strong association between increa sing age and PU incidence. (AHRQ News and Numbers, 2008; Baumgarten et al., 2004; Nixon et al., 2006; Russo et al., 2008; Schultz, Bien, Dumond, Brown, & Myers, 1999; Stausberg et al., 2010; Wann -Hansson et al., 2008) Aging is associated with changes that undermine the physiological infrastructure of the skin including flattening of the dermo -epidermal junction and slo w turnover of skin cells, loss of elasticity, thinning of subcutaneous layers, reduction of overall muscle mass, and decreased intradermal vascular perfusion and oxygenation. (Jaul, 2010) The high prevalence of systemic chronic illnesses in the elderly also contributes to the risk of PUs. For instance, arterial insufficiency may cause ischemia by arteriosclerosis; venous insufficiency and chronic lymphedema may impair fluid return from the lower limbs; multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and stroke can cause sensory deprivation; congestive heart, liver, and kidney failure can cause chronic edema; neurological diseases such as dementia or Alzheimer's disease may cause agitation and friction; cancer and other terminal con ditions impair immune system response; Parkinson's disease, antipsychotic drugs and dementia increase the risk of spasticity; dehydration may cause skin dryness; fever and incontinence cause skin 33 wetness; and medications used to treat chronic diseases may have adverse effects such as bladder dysfunction, reduced blood pressure, rigidity, sedation, confusion, drowsiness, and constipation. All of these systemic diseases or states make the skin more vulnerable to ulceration and development of PUs. (Jaul, 2010) Several studies have found that low ABI (used to assess arterial blood flow in the lower extremities and to determine the level of ischemia) (Okuwa et al., 2006) and comorbidities su ch as diabetes, stroke, renal failure (Brandeis et al., 1994; Haleem et al., 2008; al., 1999; 2012) , and low diastolic (Schue & Langemo, 1999) and systolic blood pressure (Man & Au -Yeung, 2013) are independent risk factors for PUs among hospitalized patients and nursing home residents. c. Urinary and Fecal Incontinence Numerous studies have reported an association between urinary and fecal incontinence, and incidence o f PUs in hospitals and long -term care facilities. (Baumgarten et al., 2006; Brandeis et al., 1994; Reed et al., 2003; Schue & Langemo, 1999) Skin needs to maintain an acidic pH to prevent bacterial colonization and maintain healthy barrier function; it also needs a sufficiently moisturized surface supplied by the skin's natural oils. If these factors are depleted, the skin is at risk of drying and fissur ing. On the other hand, uncontrolled urinary incontinence can lead to the skin surface being too moist which makes it more vulnerable to the effect of friction and shearing forces that contribute to pressure damage in older incontinent patients. (Beldon, 2008) If the patient has both urinary and fecal incontinence, the risk of PUs is increased. \"Up to 60% of fecal matter is 34 bacteria. Urine and feces both contain proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes which are deactivated du ring the digestive process. However, if feces remain on the skin, ammonia released from the feces reactivates the enzymes and leads to further skin irritation.\" (Beldon, 2008) d. Cognitive Status PUs usually do not o ccur in patients with normal sensitivity, mobility, and mental status because conscious and unconscious feedback leads patients to shift their position before irreversible tissue damage occurs. (Bansal et al., 2005) Physical or chemical restraints used in delirious elderly patients can lead to motor or sensory impairment. (Jaul, 2010) The presence of sensory deficit may hamper the ability to perceive pain resulting from prolonged press ure so patients with sensory deficit are less likely to turn and reposition themselves. (Jaul, 2010) Lower mental status has been shown to be an independent risk factor for PUs among patients with mobility impairment and particularly hip fracture patients in hospitals. (Haleem et al., 2008; Reed et al., 2003; Soderqvist et al., 2007) e. Nutrition, BMI, and Albumin Contradictory results have been reported in terms of the relationship between poor nutritional status and development of PUs. Some studies have demonstrated a relationship (Hengstermann, Fischer, Steinhagen -Thiessen, & Schulz, 2007; Johnston, 2007) while some have failed to show such a relationship. (Thomas, 2001a) PUs and malnutrition frequently coexist in frail patients in both acute and long -term care settings. Nutritional p arameters have been correlated with development, progression, and healing 35 of PUs leading to suggestions that improving nutritional status can prevent or treat PUs. (Allman et al., 1995; Baumgarten et al., 2010; Thomas, 2001a; VanGilder, MacFarlane et al., 2009) For example, obesity in nursing home residents (Cai, Rahman, & Intrat or, 2013) , low BMI in surgical patients (Tschannen et al., 2012) , and low albumin (Coleman et al., 2013) have been reported to be associated with PU development. However, a ca usal relationship between poor nutritional status and development of PUs has not been established. (Thomas, 2001a) f. Surgery, Anesthesia, and Analgesics Long surgical procedures constitute a risk factor for PU dev elopment. Pressure and shear are difficult to manage during surgery so vasodilatory responses are compromised which can lead to skin damage. (Aronovitch, Wilber, Slezak, Martin, & Utter, 1 999; Aronovitch, 2007) Anesthetic agents used in surgery interrupt protective muscular mechanisms by creating alteration in the vascular status that affects blood pressure, tissue perfusion, response to pressure and pain, and the exchange of oxygen and ca rbon dioxide. (Thomas, 2010) Medications such as sedatives and analgesics may reduce pain sensation and mobility. Some hypotensive agents that affect blood flow may reduce blood pressure and tissue perfusion. Hence, these drugs may increase the risk of PUs. (Aronovitch, 2007; Haleem et al., 2008; Kanj et al., 1998) 36 g. Care setting The risk of PUs varies across different care settings. (Baumgarten, Margolis, Orwig et al., 2009) Nursing home residents are usually more likely to suffer from chronic diseases and have reduced mobility than the elderly who reside in the community. (Baumgarten, Margolis, Gruber -Baldini et al., 2003) Nursing home residents who are transferred to an acute hospital represent an older and more impaired subgroup of the nursing home population. Therefore, patients newly admitted to a ho spital from nursing homes are more likely to have certain risk factors associated with PUs and subsequently have a higher prevalence of PUs compared to elderly patients admitted from a community setting. (Baumgarten et al., 2006; Keelaghan et al., 2008) h. Risk factors for Pressure Ulcers at Specific Anatomical Sites Certain anatomical sites, such as the sacrum and the heels, are at higher risk of PUs because they sustain a higher level of p ressure, shear, and friction. (Baumgarten et al., 2006; K. E. Woodbury, & Houghton, 2010b; Clegg et al., 2009; Perneg er et al., 1998; Schoonhoven et al., 2002) As the etiology and mechanism of PU development are different at different anatomical sites, it has been shown that risk factors for PU development may be also different at different anatomical sites. (Clegg et al., 2009; Pompeo & Baxter, 2000; Thomas, 2010) For example, being bedbound is a significant risk factor for sacral PUs whereas being chair bound puts patients at higher risk for ischial PUs due to the concentration of unrelieved pressure that the body position applies to each anatomical site while lying down or sitting, respectively. (Pompeo & Baxter, 37 2000; Thorfinn et al ., 2009) Urinary and fecal incontinence are considered significant risk factors for PUs on the lower truncal area because of moisture and substances in fecal matter damaging the skin surface and resulting in skin maceration. (Anders et al., 2010) While elevation of the head of the bed is a risk factor for sacral and ischial PUs, it is not a risk factor for lower extremity PUs. (Pompeo & Baxter, 2000) Reduced arterial blood flow in the lower extremities (Okuwa et al., 2006) has been shown to be a risk factor for the development of lower extremity PUs in bedbound older patients; vascular occlusion and stretching of blood vessels caused by contract ure is suggested as the potential mechanism. (Okuwa et al., 2006) Arteriosclerosis is a common cause of lower -extremity arterial disease. When arteriosclerosis becomes severe, the mechanism of peripheral vasodilation is inadequate to meet the needs of skin, muscle, and nerves even at rest. Therefore, the development of lower extremity PUs among bedfast older patients may be related to immobilization, bed rest, and arteriosclerosis. (Okuwa et al., 2006) Older bedfast patients show a marked decrease in muscle mass of the lower extremities over bony prominences. Thus, high levels of external pressure may damage the skin of the lower extremities over the bony prominence. (Okuwa et al., 2006) Immobility, old age, impaired mental status, malnutrition, use of vasopressors, surgery, dry skin, neuropathy, ischemia, hemiparesis, smoking, bony deformities, and altered foot mechanics have been reported as risk factors associated with heel PUs. (Clegg et al., 2009) In addition, cerebrovascular injury, spinal cord injury, and multiple sclerosis increase the likelihood of PUs in the foot area and particularly in the heels by re ducing 38 the skin's ability to tolerate or recover from even relatively brief periods of ischemia or by enhancing the likelihood that the heel will be subjected to ischemia. (Fowler et al., 2008; Junki n & Gray, 2009) Iatrogenic conditions that acutely immobilize the patient, such as prolonged surgical procedures or peri -operative analgesia that impair mobility and sensation in the heel, are also associated with an increased likelihood of heel PUs. (Junkin & Gray, 2009) Diabetes mellitus, systemic infection, end -stage renal disease, and peripheral vascular disease are suggested to be associated with heel PUs because they impair peripheral blood flow and reduce tissue tolerance for pressure and shear. (Clegg et al., 2009; Jaul, 2010; Junkin & Gray, 2009) Conditions associated with lower extremity or pedal edema, such as chronic venous disease an d obesity, increase the risk of heel PUs by impairing both the delivery of oxygen and nutrients and the disposal of metabolic waste products. These results are from studies that assessed risk factors in relation to onset of new PUs at certain anatomical si tes regardless of PU stage. It is not clear whether the risk factors for PUs overall apply equally to the progression of stage I PUs. I. Prevention of Pressure Ulcers 1. Risk Assessment Early identification of patients at risk of developing PUs is critica l for implementing preventive measures. In order to identify patients who are at risk of developing PUs, several risk assessment tools have been devised. The most widely used quantitative risk assessment scales are the Norton scale (Norton, 1989) and the Braden scale (Bergstrom, Braden, Laguzza, & Holman, 1987) . The Norton scale, commonly used in England, assesses five risk items: physical condition, mental condition, activity, m obility, and 39 continence. (Jaul, 2010; Kanj et al., 1998) The Braden scale, commonly used in the US (Thomas, 2001b; Thomas, 2001c) , assesse s six risk items: sensory perception, skin moisture, activity level, mobility, observed nutritional intake, and friction and shearing forces. Each item is graded on a scale of 1 to 4. The score in the Braden scale ranges from 6 to 24, and a score of 16 is usually considered to indicate high risk. (Jaul, 2010; Kanj et al., 1998) Although both scales have high sensitivity and relatively high specificity, their positive predictive value is poor, meaning that a large proportion of patients identified as being at risk of developing PUs do not in fact develop a PU. (Lyder, 2002; Thomas, 2001b; Thomas, 2001c) The weaknesses ass ociated with the risk assessment tools pose a significant challenge in identifying patients at risk of developing PUs and in allocating resources to patients who are truly at risk. (Thomas, 2001b) 2. Current Preven tion Strategies Once a patient has been assessed and found to be at risk, an appropriate prevention plan should be devised and rapidly implemented (Gunningberg et al., 2000) because immobility as short as two hou rs can result in PU development (Defloor, De Bacquer, & Grypdonck, 2005) . Most PUs occur early in the hospitalization rather than uniformly throughout the hospital stay. Thus, the opportunity to prevent PUs for most p atients is early in the course of the illness. (Thomas, 2001b; Thomas, 2001c) The main objective of PU prevention is to reduce or eliminate pressure and to promote movement. Several professional clinical organizations (European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel & National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel, 2009; Ratliff & WOCN, 2005; Royal College of Nursing and National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence, 2005) have developed and 40 published guidelines and recommendations for pr evention and management of PUs. These guidelines recommend repeated risk assessments, regular and frequent turning and repositioning, maintaining head of bed at or below 30\u00b0, use of pressure -redistributing support surfaces for bedbound patients, use of pre ssure -redistributing chair pads for seated patients, maintaining adequate nutrition, heel elevation, and managing incontinence. However, the empirical evidence for many of these recommendations is weak. (Lyder, 2002) a. Turning and Repositioning Although regular turning and repositioning of bedbound patients is the standard care, the empirical evidence to prove its efficacy and to recommend optimal schedules is insufficient. (Levine, Sinno, Levine, & Saadeh, 2013) Some studies that have evaluated this practice reflect the lack of evidence or the presence of weak evidence. A study (Peterson et al., 2013) measured the interface pressure ar ound the peri -sacral area in bedridden patients who received lateral repositioning every two hours. The results showed that despite repositioning, patients still had certain skin areas that exceeded elevated pressure thresholds during the observation perio d. A randomized controlled trial (Bergstrom et al., 2013) performed in the US and Canada compared the efficacy of repositioning schedules (2, 3, or 4 hours) in nursing home residents who were 65 years or older, had mobility limitation, were at high or moderate risk of PUs, and did not have any PUs. All patients used high -density foam mattresses and received other preventive measures such as chair cushions, heel protectors, and heel 41 elevation. The results showed that the incidence of PUs was low (2%) and only included stage I and II; there was no statistically significant difference among the repositioning schedules overall and in either high or moderate risk groups in terms of the PU incidence. In this study, however , it is difficult to isolate the efficacy of the repositioning because of the use of high -density foam mattresses and other preventive measures. Another randomized controlled trial (Defloor et al., 2005) conducted in geriatric nursing home residents with a Braden score of <17 or Norton score of <12 in Belgium compared the efficacy of turning schedules among five groups: turning every two or three hours on a standard mattress, turning every four or six hours on a visco elastic polyurethane foam mattress, and standard -care group who received water mattress, alternating mattress, sheepskin, and gel cushions. The incidence of stage I PUs ranged from 42.4% to 47.6% among the five groups. Turning did not predict the occurrenc e of stage I PUs. The incidence of stage II or higher PUs ranged from 3.0% to 24.1% among the five groups and the four -hour turning group had the lowest incidence. Turning every four hours on a viscoelastic polyurethane foam mattress was associated with si gnificantly lower occurrence of stage II or higher PUs compared to the standard -care group and other turning schedules (OR=0.12, 95% CI=0.03 -0.48). In this study also, isolating the efficacy of turning without the use of the special mattress is difficult. b. Pressure Redistributing Support Surfaces An important focus in PU prevention and treatment is reducing pressure over the bony prominences. (Salcido, R., Popescu, A., 2009) It is suggested that beca use pressure over a 42 bony prominence is much higher than tissue surface pressure, complete pressure relief may be useful in preventing tissue ischemia (Kanj et al., 1998) , and some suggest that lowering interface pressu re below capillary pressure will reduce PU risk. (Kemp et al., 1993) Hence, it has been recommended that an appropriate pressure -relieving support surface based on patient's status and needs, ease of use, maintenance r equirements, and patient preference should be selected for patients who have PUs or are at risk of developing PUs in order to reduce interface pressure over bony prominences. According to the NPUAP (National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel, 2007) , a support surface is \"a specialized device for pressure redistribution designed for management of tissue loads, micro -climate, and/or other therapeutic functions (i.e., any mattresses, integrated be d system, mattress replacement, overlay, seat cushion, or seat cushion overlay).\" Support surfaces can be filled with a variety of materials including air; foam (viscoelastic, elastic, closed cell, and open cell); gel; viscous fluid; elastomer; solid; and water. (National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel, 2007) The NPUAP categorizes support surfaces into different groups. A support surface may be an overlay, which is defined as an additional su pport surface designed to be placed directly on top of an existing surface; it may be a mattress, defined as a support surface designed to be placed directly on a bed frame; or it can be an integrated bed system which includes a bed frame and a support surface combined into a single unit. Support surfaces may be active or reactive. An active support surface requires power and has the capability to change its load distribution properties with or without applied load; a reactive support surface may be powered or non-powered and has the capability to change its load distribution properties only in 43 response to applied load. Support surfaces can also be powered (requiring an external energy source to operate) or non -powered (not requiring an external energy sourc e to operate). (National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel, 2007) There are numerous challenges in the area of PRSS research. There is no international definition as to what constitutes a sta ndard foam hospital mattress, and the concept of a standard foam hospital mattress changes over time and even from hospital to hospital. (Cullum et al., 2000) Valid clinical practice guidelines for specialty bed use ha ve not been developed. (Edsberg et al., 2005) There is very limited knowledge about the effectiveness of the PRSS that are currently marketed. (Buckland, 2007; Kemp et al., 1993; Sprigle, 2004) Even more limited are studies comparing the effectiveness of different support surfaces to one another . (Lyder, 2002; McElhinny & Hooper , 2008) Information on the cost -effectiveness of support surfaces is scarce. (McInnes et al., 2008) The British National Institute for Clinical Excellence determined that, on the basis of a comprehensive search strate gy, there was little high quality evidence regarding the effectiveness of pressure -relief equipment. (Russell et al., 2003) c. Effectiveness of Pressure Redistributing Support Surfaces There have been several syste matic reviews and meta -analyses conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of PRSS on the prevention and treatment of PUs. These evaluations have included only randomized or quasi -randomized clinical trials. Some of the reported results are consistent and som e are contradictory, most likely due to methodological and population differences among studies included in the evaluations. 44 A Cochrane systematic review (McInnes et al., 2012) reported that alternative foam mattre sses and overlays compared to standard hospital foam mattresses can reduce the incidence of PUs in people at risk (relative risk [RR]=0.40, 95% CI=0.21 -0.74). Australian standard medical sheepskins prevent PUs to standard care (RR=0.48, 95% CI=0.3 1-0.74). Pressure -redistributing overlays on the operating table compared to standard care reduce post -operative PU incidence (RR=0.53, 95% CI=0.33 - 0.85). However, there is insufficient evidence to determine the value of seat cushions, limb protectors, var ious alternating and constant low pressure devices, and emergency department trolley overlays as PU prevention strategies. Another systematic review (Reddy, 2011) reported that alternative foam mattresses compared to st andard hospital foam mattresses, low air loss beds compared with standard intensive care beds and pressure relieving overlays on operating tables, medical sheepskin overlays compared with standard care, and hydrocellular heel supports compared with orthope dic wool padding may reduce the incidence of PUs in people at risk. On the other hand, a literature review (Vanderwee et al., 2008) concluded that alternating pressure air mattresses are likely to be more effective than standard hospital mattresses, but there is no evidence as to which type of alternating pressure air mattresses performs better. A different systematic review (Junkin & Gray, 2009) reported that PRSS vary in their ability to prevent heel PUs, but there is insufficient evidence to determine which surfaces are optimal for this purpose and whether heel protection devices are more effective than a standard hospital foam pillow. 45 A systematic review conducted by Colin (Colin et al., 2012) concluded that a structured foam mattress was superior to a standard hospital mattress. A fluidized bed expedited healing of PUs. An alternating air mattress compared to a visco -elastic support surf ace reduced the incidence of heel PUs. A low air -loss bed was more efficient than a mixed pulsating air mattress in prevention of heel PUs. Use of an overlay on an operating table reduced the incidence of peri -operative and post -operative PUs. Some types o f sheepskin could reduce the incidence of sacral PUs in orthopedic patients. A meta -analysis (Huang, Chen, & Xu, 2013) found that the use of PRSS compared to a standard foam mattress significantly decreased the inci dence of surgery -related PUs (OR=0.31, 95% CI=0.17 -0.59). The significant decline in were used post -operatively -analysis did not specif y whether stage I PUs had been included in the original studies, but it concluded that the selected studies had relatively poor quality and the results showed substantial heterogeneity. Only one study was found in the literature that investigated the us e of PRSS for preventing the progression of stage I PUs to higher stages. The study was a descriptive survey conducted in long -term care hospitals and acute care hospitals in Netherlands. It found that there was no statistically significant difference betw een patients whose stage I PUs did and did not progress to a higher stage in terms of use of PRSS except for the use of heel protection devices in long -term care hospitals; a larger proportion of patients 46 whose stage I PUs did not progress received heel pr otection devices. (Halfens et al., 2001) Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of PRSS effectiveness have poor quality and are not replicable. (McInnes et al., 2008) It is often difficult to determine whether patients with stage I PUs have been included in these studies and whether developing a stage I PU is considered part of the study outcome. Many of the trials do not provide sufficient assurance that manual repositioning is provided equally to each group of participants. These factors could introduce bias as care providers were not blinded to treatment allocation in any of the trials and may have repositioned patients in one group more frequently if they perceived a parti cular support surface to be more (or less) effective than another. (McInnes et al., 2008) Moreover, many trials did not use blinded outcome assessment which may result in misclassification of outcome based on the asse ssor's knowledge of the treatment arm to which patients belong. (McInnes et al., 2008) Comparison of results from existing studies is difficult because the studies have used different study populations, sampling strat egies, analytic methods, durations of follow - up, care settings, and outcome measures. In addition, there are many different support surfaces within each category, and many studies have evaluated the effectiveness of only a single manufacturer's product. Ho wever, it is not clear whether the results for one product would apply to others in the same category or even how products within the same category compare to each other with respect to their effectiveness. 47 Overall, as the above studies demonstrate, ther e is sparse and incongruent evidence about the effectiveness of PRSS with respect to PUs, and the quality of the evidence is not high. Therefore, it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions from the available literature in terms of the effectiveness of PRSS in preventing and treating PUs in general and preventing progression of stage I PUs in particular. 48 IV. SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY Stage I PUs are difficult to detect and diagnose (Bates-Jensen et al., 2007; Halfens et al., 2001) and are often viewed as having little clinical significance. (Halfens et al., 2001) The few studies that have focused on the clinical course and epidemiology of stage I PUs have major limitations such as very small sample size, cross -sectional design, lack of focus on specific anatomical sites, short follow -up periods, and infrequent assessment of patients. Studies have shown that risk factors for PUs at different anatom ical sites might be different and different prevention strategies, particularly different types of support surfaces, may be necessary at different anatomical sites. However, studies have not examined progression of stage I PUs, risk factors associated with them at specific anatomical sites, and the effectiveness of support surfaces in preventing progression. If stage I PUs have clinical significance, their early detection will be a crucial step in prevention. Clinical and cost effectiveness of prevention strategies, such as turning and repositioning and support surface products, are not clearly delineated for PUs in general, and they are even less clear for stage I PUs and their progression. (Jones, 2005; Junkin & Gray, 2009; Lyder, 2002; Thomas, 2 001c; Vanderwee et al., 2005; Vanderwee et al., 2007) Lack of consistent, standard terminology and methods to describe, categorize, and evaluate support surface products has resulted in insufficient knowledge in this area which in turn has contributed to lack of evidence - based clinical practice guidelines. (Cullum et al., 2000; McInnes et al., 2008) 49 The current study focuses on stage I PUs. It aims to fill a gap in knowledge about the clinical co urse and significance of stage I PUs. It will concentrate on the rate of progression of stage I PUs and risk factors associated with their progression overall and by anatomical site in different care settings. Knowledge about the rate of progression of stage I PUs will help to quantify their clinical and economic significance. Knowledge about risk factors for stage I progression is necessary for prevention purposes and for reducing the overall PU burden. This study will also evaluate the impact of PRSS, as a prevention method, on the progression of stage I PUs at different anatomical sites and in different care settings. It is important to determine the effectiveness of different types of PRSS at different anatomical sites so that the appropriate equipment a nd devices can be applied to appropriate anatomical sites to generate clinically favorable outcomes. Preventing stage I PUs from progressing to higher stages could reduce the clinical and financial burden on patients and health care services. Moreover, thi s study will evaluate the progression of stage I PUs in elderly hip fracture patients who constitute a population at high risk of developing PUs. Therefore, the results of this study may contribute to resolving a major complication in a high risk populatio n. 50 V. RESEARCH DESIGN A. Data Source This study involved secondary analyses of data collected for the \"Locus of Care & Pressure Ulcers in Hip Fracture Patients\" study (NIAMS 5R01 AR47711). (Baumgarten, Margoli s, Orwig et al., 2009) The Locus of Care study was a prospective cohort study conducted between 2004 and 2007. It included 658 patients with the following inclusion criteria: 1) 65 years of age or older, 2) had surgery for a hip fracture (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, code 820) in one of nine hospitals participating in the Baltimore Hip Studies network, and 3) were discharged from those hospitals to one of 105 post -acute facilities. Patients were excluded if 1) the hip fracture occurred in a hospital, or 2) the patient's attending physician did not give permission to contact the patient. Only 1.5% of eligible patients were not enrolled because of physician refusal. Written consent was obtained from patients who had a Mini -Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975) of 20 or greater. When the MMSE score was less than 20, verbal assent from patients and written consent from proxies were obtained. Proxy consent was obtained for patients who were unconscious or non -communicative. The institutional review boards of the University of Maryland Baltimore and of each of the participating hospitals approved the parent study. (Baum garten, Margolis, Orwig et al., 2009) The institutional review board of the University of Maryland Baltimore approved the current study as well. 51 B. Study Variables and Measurements To determine pressure ulcer (PU) status, trained research nurses perfor med a full -body skin examination of each patient at baseline (as soon as possible after hospital admission) and on alternating days for 21 days for a total of 11 assessments. To ensure that all participants had at least 10 days of follow -up in a post -acute care setting, patients who stayed in the acute hospital longer than 21 days were followed until they had 10 post - acute follow -up days or a total of 31 follow -up days, whichever occurred first. Each PU observed during the study was photographed when first observed and at the last visit. The follow -up examinations were performed in the care setting where the patient resided at the time of scheduled assessment. The definitions for PU staging from NPUAP 2001 (Pressure ulcers in america: Prevalence, incidence, and implications for the future. an executive summary of the national pressure ulcer advisory panel monograph.2001) were used (stages I -IV and unstageable). The following lesions were not considered PUs: lesions on an a rea with active skin disease, wounds on the plantar surface of the forefoot or mid -foot, and wounds on the leg between the malleolus and the popliteal fossa. (Baumgarten, Margolis, Orwig et al., 2009) The criterion for a stage I PU to be included in the study was that the ulcer was detected as a stage I for the first time during the study period without having a history of stage II or higher. As stated in a published paper describing the parent study (Baumgarten, Margolis, Orwig et al., 2009) , \"PUs observed at the baseline assessment were classified as preexisting, 52 possibly acquired, or definitely acquired based on specific criteria. According to these criteria, stage IV ulc ers were always considered to be preexisting. For stages I -III and unknown stage, the classification was based on a synthesis of information from up to four sources: the patient or patient's family member, the hospital or facility chart, the transfer form from previous institution, and hospital staff members. A stage I PU was always considered to be definitely acquired unless there was at least one undisputed source that said it was pre -existing. For stages II -III and unknown stage, if there was consistent information from more than one source, that information was used to classify the PU as pre-existing or definitely acquired; if there was conflicting information or no information, the PU was classified as possibly acquired.\" Patient or proxy interview a t baseline, clinical observation at baseline, and medical chart review by trained research nurses were the sources of risk factor information for the study. Demographic information was obtained by interviewing the patient or proxy at baseline. The Subjecti ve Global Assessment of Nutritional Status (Detsky, Smalley, & Chang, 1994) was used to classify patients as having a low, moderate, or high risk of nutrition -associated complications at baseline. The ankle brachial index (ABI) was measured by direct examination at baseline and was defined as the ratio of systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the arm to SBP in the ankle. Subsequently, peripheral artery disease was defined as lack of lower extremity pulses in dorsal pedis or ABI>1.30 (Rooke et al., 2011) . Information on weight and height was obtained from medical charts or, if missing from the chart, by patient or proxy interview at baseline. Cog nitive status was measured at baseline using the MMSE; a score of zero 53 was assigned to patients who were unconscious or non -communicative. History of chronic cognitive deficit was obtained from the medical charts; when information was missing in the chart, it was assumed to be absent. Albumin level was obtained from the medical chart and was considered normal if the level was 3.0 g/dL or the value was missing (Detsky et al., 1987) . Residence prior to hospitalization w as obtained from medical charts and by interviewing patient or proxy. The time period between admission to the emergency department (ED) and the hip surgery was also obtained from medical charts. The severity of illness was measured using the RAND Sickness at Admission Scale (hip fracture version) (Keeler et al., 1990) , and the number of comorbidities determined using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (Charlson, Pompei, Ales, & MacKenzie, 1987) information for both measures was obtained from medical charts at baseline. (Baumgarten, Margolis, Orwig et al., 2009) A variable was created indicating the presence of a respiratory disease at b aseline. The data for this variable were collected by chart abstraction. Respiratory disease was defined as having any of the following conditions at baseline: pneumonia by chest x -ray, chronic pulmonary disease, or prior chronic obstructive pulmonary dise ase. The patient's activity level was defined as being chair bound or bedbound, or walking occasionally or frequently. Acute mental status was operationalized as the number of orientations to person, place, and time with a range of 0 to 3. Activity level, acute mental status, and incontinence status information was obtained by interviewing clinical staff. Incontinence was also determined by direct observation of moisture or soiling. In addition, activity level, incontinence status, and acute mental status were assessed at each 54 follow -up visit. Research nurses performed skin examination for PU assessment and staging and determined use of PU prevention or treatment devices at baseline and all follow -up visits. (Baumgart en, Margolis, Orwig et al., 2009) A PRSS was considered to be in use if the device was observed to be on the patient's bed or chair even if the patient was not in bed or chair at the time of the assessment. (Baumga rten et al., 2010) At each assessment visit, research nurses documented level and location of care. For days on which assessment visits were not performed, the level and location of care were ascertained retrospectively at the next visit by consulting th e patient, the caregiver, and the facility chart. Mutually exclusive care settings based on location and level of care were defined as follows: acute hospital (acute care provided in an acute hospital); rehabilitation (acute or skilled rehabilitation provi ded in an acute hospital or rehabilitation facility); readmission to acute hospital (return to the acute hospital setting, as defined above, after discharge from the initial acute setting); nursing home; and home. (Baumgarten, Margolis, Orwig et al., 2009) C. Study Population The parent study identified 1,364 patients in the participating hospitals to be screened for eligibility. A total of 197 patients were not screened because 146 of them were discharged from hospital before contact could be made with them; for the remaining 51 patients who were not screened, patient, proxy, or physician could not be found, or they refused eligibility screening. Thus, 1,167 patients (86% of identified patients) were screened, a nd 1,055 patients (90% of screened patients) were eligible to participate in the 55 study; 397 patients were not enrolled due to refusal, and the parent study enrolled the remaining 658 patients (62% of eligible patients). Of 658 patients enrolled in the pare nt study, those who developed one or more stage I PUs during the study period were eligible to be included in the current study. Thus, the population for the current study consisted of 168 patients who developed 278 stage I PUs. Figure 1 shows the selectio n and enrollment of study participants. (Baumgarten, Margolis, Orwig et al., 2009) 56 Patients scre ened for eligibility (n=1,167) (86% of identified patients) Eligible patients (n=1,055) (90% of screened patients) Enrolled patients in Locus of Care study (n=658) (62% of eligible patients) Patients with stage I PUs included in the current study (n=168 ) (26% of patients in Locus of Care study) Patients not screened for eligibility (n=197) Patients not eligible to participate in study (n=112) Patient or proxy refused participation in study (n=3 97) Patients without any stage I PUs (n=490) Patients identified in hospitals (n=1,36 4) Figure 1: Selection and enrollment of study participants 57 D. Study Design A dataset was assembled that comprised data for all patients who d eveloped at least one stage I PU which was first detected as a stage I PU during the study period, and the dataset was set up so that each ulcer was considered a separate record. The first visit for each ulcer was the visit at which the ulcer was first obs erved. The last visit was the visit at which the ulcer progressed to a higher stage or disappeared, the patient died or was lost to follow -up, or the end of the follow -up period, whichever came first. The dataset was converted to a vertical format. That is , each row of data represented a study visit for each ulcer of each patient so that an ulcer visit (versus a patient visit) would be the unit of analysis. It should be noted that any reference to 'baseline' characteristics and measurements refers to the first visit of the parent study. However, in the current study, a number of patients had not developed their first stage I PU until sometime after the baseline visit. The start of the follow -up period for this study commenced on the first observation of th e first stage I PU; for some patients, that visit coincided with the baseline visit, but for the majority of patients, that visit occurred sometime after the baseline visit. Different types of pressure -redistributing support surfaces (PRSS) were used in this study. (Table 6) For analysis purposes, different categories of PRSS devices were combined due to their low frequency of use in the study population. Different types of 58 mattresses including static air, gel filled, fiber filled, alternating pressure, low air loss, air fluidized, water filled, other type, and type unknown were grouped into one variable called mattress . The mattress variable did not include standard foam and spring mattress because that was the default mattress in the absence of any othe r mattress type. Different categories of overlays including foam, static air, gel filled, alternating pressure, sheepskin, water filled, viscose elastic, other type, and type unknown were grouped into one variable called overlay . A variable called cushion was created to represent all types of chair cushion and wheelchair cushion. Cushion types included gel filled, viscose elastic, static air, other type, and type unknown. All types of heel protector devices, including everyday objects such as pillows and in travenous (IV) bags used to elevate heels as well as manufactured devices such as waffle boots, and type unknown, were combined to create the variable heel protector . 59 Table 6: Types of PRSS used in the study PRSS Type Specificati on Overlay Foam (convoluted, cubed, or egg crate) Static air Gel filled Fiber filled Alternating pressure Sheepskin Water filled Viscose elastic Other type Type unknown Mattress Standard foam and spring Static air Air filled Fiber filled Alternating pressure Low air loss (air passed through series of sacs) Air fluidized (air passed over ceramic beads) Water filled Other type Type unknown Chair cushion Gel filled Viscose elastic Static air Other type Type unknown Wheelchair cushion Gel filled Viscose elastic Static air Other type Type unknown Heel protectors Everyday objects (e.g., pillows, IV bags) used to elevate heels Manufactured devices (e.g., waffle boots) Type unknown Other Elbow pr otectors Positioning pillows or wedges other than abductor pillows 60 Data on the number of times per day a patient was repositioned during the first five days of inpatient hospitalization were obtained from the hospital chart. Since many stage I PUs were first observed after the first five days of inpatient hospitalization, the repositioning variable was missing for the majority of ulcers. Therefore, this variable could not be included in the analyses. A time variable was created to count the number of days between the visit at which the first observation of a stage I PU occurred and the date of each subsequent study visit. This variable was used to create the offset term in the regression models. Study visits occurred every two days on average. If a pr ogression occurred in the period between two consecutive visits, we assigned the date of the event to the later visit. Thus, there was uncertainty about the exact time of occurrence of those progressions. To partially remedy this uncertainty, we used Proc Genmod in SAS to calculate a hazard ratio (HR) because Proc Genmod uses an offset term which takes into account the uncertainty about the exact time of the outcome occurrence by appropriately calculating the daily hazard of the outcome for an interval -censored study design. Stage I PUs were divided into three categories based on their anatomical site. Ulcers located on iliac crest, trochanter, sacrum, and ischium were categorized into \"hip area\" ulcers. Ulcers located on tendon, heels, medial mall eolus, lateral malleolus, tarsals, metatarsals, and phalanges were categorized into \"foot area\" ulcers. The remaining ulcers located on posterior upper leg, knee, shin, scapula, spine, elbow, shoulder, posterior ribs, and orbital were categorized into the \"other area\" category. 61 Analyses that involved comparing anatomical sites focused on ulcers in the hip and foot areas only since the \"other\" category was too small for meaningful comparisons, and because it was anatomically and clinically heterogeneous. 62 VI. METHODS A. General Analytic Methods First, the exploratory analysis of the data was conducted. The frequency distribution of study variables was examined to describe the study population at patient level and ulcer level and also to look for invalid an d missing values as well as potential outliers. Comparisons were made between patients who had at least one stage I PU that progressed to a higher stage and patients who had none with respect to their baseline characteristics. Associations were examined by chi-square (2) test. The follow -up period for each ulcer was defined as starting when a stage I PU was first observed and ending at the visit at which the ulcer progressed to a higher stage or disappeared, the patient died or was lost to follow -up, or th e end of the follow -up period (11 visits), whichever came first. The crude incidence rate (IR) of progression was calculated by dividing the number of stage I PUs that progressed by the number of follow -up days for all stage I PUs, and the approximate 95% CI was calculated by using the number of events (PUs that progressed) according to the formula : exp{Log(IR)\u00b1(1.96sqrt(1/no. events))}. (Formula 1) The multivariable analysis involved use of discrete -time survival analysis using a complementary log -log link (P. D. Allison, 1982; D'Agostino et al., 1990) to evaluate the association between exposure and outcome variables adjusting for potential confounders. This analytical method is parame tric because it makes an assumption about the shape of the hazard and includes regression coefficients which have the interpretation of log rate ratio. This method provides the probability (or hazard) of the outcome given the exposure 63 and adjusted for conf ounders. (Singer & Willett, 1993) In the analyses for this study, it was assumed that the baseline hazard was constant. Discrete -time survival analysis was chosen for the study because it provides a time -to-event ana lysis for an interval -censored data and allows easier inclusion of time -varying predictor variables. It is an appropriate survival analysis in situations when events can only occur at regular discrete points in time such as in this study when assessments o ccurred every two days on average. The complementary log -log link converts the probability of expected value to the log scale. In this type of analysis, each discrete time unit for each ulcer was treated as a separate observation or unit of analysis. For e ach observation, the dependent variable was coded as one if a progression event occurred in that time unit; otherwise, it was coded as zero. The exposure variable and other covariates for each observation were assigned the value they had at the time of the observation. Then, these observations were pooled together, and the maximum likelihood estimate of the regression model for a dichotomous dependent variable was computed. (P. D. Allison, 1982) The Generalized Est imating Equations (GEE) method was used to account for within - person correlation related to the possibility of having more than one ulcer per person and observation of the same ulcers in the same patients multiple times over the study duration (repeated me asures). The GEE method is based on marginal models, and it uses a robust variance estimator which generates a valid estimate of variance of the mean response even if the selected covariance structure is mis -specified. That is the GEE method requires that only the specified model for the mean response be correct. The structure of covariance was specified as 'exchangeable' based on the correlation characteristics of 64 data and exploratory analysis. The exchangeable covariance has the interpretation that correl ation between observations is the same regardless of the length of time between observations. We used Proc Genmod in SAS with a complementary log log link. The Repeated statement within Proc Genmod applies the GEE method and adjusts variance estimates for correlation. An offset term was added to the model to account for the time interval. The regression formula for the analysis was as follows: Log( -Log(1 -Probability (Y=1) = Log(t 0) + 2X2 + ... (Formula 2) Where: Probability (Y=1) = probability of outcome variable Y= outcome variable t = time interval Log(t 0) = offset term 0 = intercept 1 = coefficient of exposure variable X1 = exposure variable 2 = coefficient of a covariate X2 = a covariate The discrete -time survival analysis makes three implicit assumptions (Singer & Willett, 1993) : 1) linearity, 2) propo rtionality, and 3) no unobserved heterogeneity if there are no additional terms in the model to relax the assumptions. Thus, before applying this analytical method, data were examined as to whether they met these assumptions. 65 The linearity assumption imp lies that the predictor variables affect the hazard function in a linear manner. This assumption was examined for all the numerical variables used in the study. Each variable was categorized based on its distribution; the hazard function was estimated for each category of each variable. The hazard function estimate was plotted against the covariate categories, and the shape of the graph was examined as to whether there was a straight line (linear association). If there was a linear association, the variable was used in the analysis as a continuous variable; otherwise, it was used as a categorical variable. (Singer & Willett, 1993) Age was the only variable that met the linearity assumption and was treated as a continuo us variable in the analyses. The proportionality assumption implies that the effect of the predictor variable on the hazard function does not change over time. A statistically significant interaction between a predictor variable and time implies that the effect of the predictor on the hazard profile differs from time period to time period. (Singer & Willett, 1993) To test this assumption, an interaction term for the product of time and PRSS variables was created, and a regression model was fit that included the main effects of PRSS devices and time as well as their interaction term. If the p -value of the interaction term was 0.05, it implied that there was no strong evidence of interaction between PRSS devices and ti me. The interaction term between the PRSS devices and time was not statistically significant (p=0.24), and the proportionality assumption was met. 66 The assumption regarding unobserved heterogeneity implies that there is no unobserved confounding present i n the study results, the correct regression model has been selected, and no important confounder is left out of the model. The discrete -time hazard model does not include an error term or random disturbance term so all variation in hazard profiles across i ndividuals is hypothesized to depend solely on observed variation in the predictors. This assumption is not unique to this analytical method and is needed to use the model for causal inference, and it cannot be tested in reality. (Singer & Willett, 1993) All analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 version (SAS; Cary, NC). Based on literature evidence, expert opinion, biological plausibility, and stratified analysis, a number of covariates were selected to be examined as potential risk factors for progression of stage I PUs. In addition, based on the same evidence source, a number of covariates were selected to be examined as potential confounders in the association between risk factors and progression. However, covari ates that had a low frequency (fewer than 10) were excluded from risk factor or confounder examination because their frequency distribution was not much different between ulcers that progressed and those that did not. Moreover, their inclusion would make t he regression model unstable. For example, covariate race was not examined as a potential risk factor or confounder because the entire study population was White except for two patients who were African - American. 67 The following method was used to examine potential confounders in regression models. In the presence of the main predictor variable and other selected covariates in the model, each potential confounder was entered in the model. The coefficient of the main predictor variable was examined in the p resence and absence of each potential confounder. If the presence of the potential confounder changed the HR by more than 15%, the covariate was considered a confounder and was added to the final model; otherwise it was not considered a confounder and was excluded from the final model. When a covariate met the criterion as a confounder, it was not added to the model while other covariates were being tested as a confounder. The covariates that met the criterion as a confounder were added to the final model a fter all covariates had been examined as confounders. The selection of 15% as a threshold for change on HR scale for identifying a confounding factor was somewhat arbitrary since there is no specific rule published in the literature for this purpose. The 15% change on the HR scale translated into an absolute change of >0.14 or < -0.16 in the coefficient of the main predictor variable. The translation of >15% change on HR scale to [>coefficient + 0.14] or [<coefficient -0.16] on the main predictor coefficien t scale is illustrated mathematically below (Formulae 3 and 4). Based on this mathematical calculation, there is confounding if the absolute change in the main predictor coefficient, in the presence of potential confounder, is outside the range of -0.16 and +0.14. 68 HR adjusted < 0.85* HR crude log (HR adjusted ) - log (HR crude) < log(0.85) log (HR adjusted ) - log (HR crude) < -0.16 (Formula 3) OR HR adjusted > 1.15*HR crude log (HR adjusted ) - log (HR crude) > log(1.15) log (HR adjusted ) - log (HR crude) > 0.14 (Formula 4) When fitting crude and adjusted regression models, observations that had missing values for any of the covariates controlled for in the final adjusted model were deleted from the dataset such that both crude and adjusted models use d the same dataset with the same number of observations, and HRs would be estimated for the same population so that the crude and adjusted HRs would be comparable for interpretation purposes. B. Statistical Analys es and Power Calculation Power calculation s for each research question and each aim were conducted before the statistical analysis of the study commenced. The purpose of the power calculation was to estimate the magnitude of effects that could be detected given the fixed sample size. 69 1. Researc h Question 1 What are the clinical course and risk factors for the progression of stage I PUs to a higher stage in elderly hip fracture patients? Figure 2 depicts the relationship between potential risk factors, outcomes, and potential confounders for Research Question 1. 70 **In the analysis for each risk factor, some of the other risk factors were considered confounders. Outcome Incidence rate of progression of stage 1 PUs in all, hip , and foot area ulcers Incidence rate of progression of stage 1 hip PUs compar ed to foot PUs Risk factors Age Sex Risk of nutrition -related complications Albumin level BMI Peripheral artery disease Pre-existing PUs Diabetes mellitus Charlson Comorbidity Index RAND Sickness at Admission Scale Respiratory disease MMSE score Chronic cognitive deficit Number of hours between ED admission and hip surgery Potential confounders ** Activity level Urinary or fecal incontinence Number of orientations to person, place, time Care setting Baseline Characteristics (time -invari ant) Follow -up Characteristics (time -varia nt) Figure 2: Depiction of relationship between risk factors, potential confounders, and progression of stage I PUs to a higher stage 71 Aim 1a Among patients with one or more stage I PUs, to deter mine the rate of each of the following outcomes: 1) progression of one or more stage I PUs to a higher stage; 2) development of one or more PUs at sites other than the site of stage I PUs; 3) both 1) and 2). The unit of analysis for this aim is the individ ual patient. Statistical Analysis The patient (not the individual ulcer) was the unit of analysis for this aim. The number of follow -up days among patients with stage I PUs was the denominator of the IR. For aim 1a.1 (IR of progression), the numerator of IR was the number of patients who had at least one stage I PU that progressed to a higher stage. For aim 1a.2 (IR of developing other PUs), the numerator was the number of patients with at least one stage I PU who developed at least one new PU of any st age at a site other than the site of stage I PUs. For aim 1a.3 (IR of progression and development of other PUs), the numerator was the number of patients with at least one stage I PU whose PU progressed to a higher stage and who also developed at least one new PU of any stage at a site other than the site of stage I PUs. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for these IRs were calculated according to Formula 1. 72 Estimated Precision The precision of IR point estimate (Table 7) was calculated based on the nu mber of events for each outcome and a 95% CI was calculated based on Formula 1. The precision was expressed as a factor by which the IR estimate needed to be divided or multiplied to obtain the lower and upper limits of the CI, respectively. For example, T able 1 shows that, for Subaim 1a.1, with 79 events, the precision factor was 1.25. Supposing the IR point estimate turned out to be 0.05 events per patient -days, the lower limit of the 95% CI would be 0.05/1.25 = 0.04 events per patient -day. The upper limi t would be 0.05*1.25 = 0.06 events per patient -day. Table 7: Estimated precision of IR for each Subaim of Aim 1a Subaim Number of events Precision factor 1a.1 79 patients had a stage I PU that progressed to a higher stage 1.25 1a.2 66 patients had at least one stage I PU and developed another PU of any stage at a site other than site of stage I PUs 1.27 1a.3 43 patients had a stage I PU that progressed to a higher stage and developed another PU of any stage at a site other than the site of stage I PUs 1.35 Aim 1b To determine the rate of progression of stage 1 PUs to a higher stage, overall and by ulcer's anatomical site. The unit of analysis for this Aim is the individual ulcer. 73 Statistical Analysis The unit of analysis was the individual ulcer, and patient characteristics were attributed to ulcers. The numerator of the progression rate for stage I PUs overall was the total number of stage I PUs at any site that progressed to a higher stage. The total number of follow -up days for all stage I ulcers was the denominator. The follow -up started when the stage I PU was first detected and ended when that ulcer progressed to a higher stage or disappeared, the patient died or was lost to follow -up, or the patient's prescribed foll ow- up period ended, whichever came first. For the site -specific rates, the same numerator and denominator definitions were applied. However, for each site, only stage I PUs at that site were included in the rate calculation. The 95% CI for the IR was calcu lated based on Formula 1. In addition, in order to estimate the probability of progression of an ulcer, the Kaplan - Meier (KM) estimate of survival function was generated for all, hip, and foot ulcers using Proc Lifetest in SAS. The KM plot showed the prob ability of progression on different days of follow -up with the assumption that the ulcers had not progressed up to that day and that all ulcers would eventually progress given sufficient time. The Log -Rank and Wilcoxon tests compared the probability of pro gression between hip and foot area ulcers. Wilcoxon test assigns higher weight to earlier events whereas Log -Rank test assigns higher weight to later events. The KM estimator is a non -parametric method; that is it does not make any assumptions about the sh ape of hazard. In this method, later events tend to lower the estimated survival curve more than earlier events (P. Allison, 2007; 74 Cantor, 2005) . In other words, the KM method assigns a higher we ight to later events versus earlier events. Because KM is a non -parametric method, the variance of hazard is higher than that when using a parametric method. The KM method does not account for repeated measures and correlation, interval censored data, and confounding. It only provides a crude probability of the event which in this case is progression of a stage I PU to a higher stage. In the KM analysis, for ulcers that did not progress, the follow -up time ended when the follow -up for the patient who had th e ulcer ended, not when the ulcer disappeared. The reason was to take into account the contribution to the follow -up time of ulcers that disappeared without progressing since not only did these ulcers not progress but they developed the opposite and more f avorable outcome. Estimated Precision Table 8 shows the precision factors for Aim 1b, which were calculated as described for Aim 1a. Table 8: Estimated precision of IR of stage I PU progression for Aim 1b, at all anatomical si tes and in hip and foot areas separately Site Number of stage I PUs that progressed Precision factor All anatomical sites* 111 1.20 Hip area 52 1.31 Foot area 49 1.32 *Includes ulcers in the hip, foot, and other areas. 75 Aim 1c To compare the rate o f progression of stage I PUs at different anatomical sites after controlling for patients' demographic and baseline clinical characteristics, time -varying clinical characteristics, and care setting; the unit of analysis for this Aim is the individual ulcer . Statistical Analysis To estimate the crude HR of progression of hip PUs compared to foot PUs, a regression model was fit with the anatomical site of PU as the main predictor variable and progression as the outcome. To estimate the adjusted HR of prog ression of hip PUs compared to foot PUs, a regression model was fit; based on literature evidence, expert opinion, biological plausibility, and stratified analysis, 10 covariates were identified as confounders a priori and were adjusted for in the model. T he covariates that were time -invariant and only measured at baseline included: 1) age, 2) presence of pre -existing PUs, 3) risk of nutrition -related complications, 4) BMI, and 5) Charlson Comorbidity Index. The covariates that were time -variant and measure d at each follow -up visit included: 1) number of orientations to person, place, and time; 2) activity level; 3) urinary and fecal incontinence; 4) care setting; and 5) presence of a mattress, overlay, cushion, or heel protector. In addition, covariates wit h weaker evidence as risk factors were empirically 76 tested in the model as to whether they were confounders. They included presence of mattress, overlay, cushion, or heel protector; number of orientations to person, place, and time; activity level; arterial conditions; peripheral artery disease; diabetes mellitus; hospitalized in the six months prior to the current hospitalization for hip fracture; MMSE; sex; albumin level; Rand Sickness at Admission Scale; number of hours between ED admission and hip surger y. However, none of these additional covariates turned out to be a confounder according to the criterion described earlier. Thus, the final adjusted model only included the above 10 covariates. The final dataset used for both crude and adjusted regression models excluded any observations that had any missing values for any of the covariates controlled for in the adjusted model. Power Calculation To estimate the power to compare the IR of stage I PU progression between hip and foot areas, we first used th e data to estimate the proportion of follow -up time contributed by hip area ulcers which turned out to be 0.36. From that proportion and the postulated rate ratio (R tR) comparing stage 1 PU progression in the hip and foot areas (1.50, 1.75, and 2.00 postul ated), the projected number of stage 1 PUs that progressed in hip and foot areas was calculated. Type I error () was set at 0.05, and the power was calculated using the formula 4: Power = Probability [standard normal random variable > Z (1-/2) - (value of measure of effect under alternative hypothesis) / square root (variance of the estimate of measure of effect given a sample size of n)] (Formula 5) 77 As Table 9 shows, the study had 80% power to detect a R tR of 1.75, and greater than 80% power to d etect a R tR of 2.00 or higher, comparing the progression rate between hip and foot area ulcers. Table 9: Power of the analysis for Aim 1c comparing progression rates between hip and foot area stage I PUs, by postulated R tR (=0.05, proportion of follow -up time contributed by hip area ulcers=0.38) Postulated RtR Projected number of PUs in hip area that progressed Projected number of PUs in foot area that progressed Power 1.50 46 55 0.526 1.75 50 51 0.800 2.00 53 48 0.936 Aim 1d To identify factors associated with progression rate of stage I PUs to a higher stage, overall and by ulcer's anatomical site. The unit of analysis for this Aim is the individual ulcer. Statistical Analysis Multiple variables were evaluated as potential risk factors for the progression of stage I PUs. As stated previously, these potential risk factors were selected based on evidence 78 from the literature about the risk factors for the progression of stage I PUs (although scant), evidence for ri sk factors for the development of PUs in general, expert opinion, biological plausibility, and stratified analysis. The following is the list of potential risk factors examined for PUs at all anatomical sites. The risk factors that were time -invariant and only measured at baseline included: 1) age, 2) sex, 3) risk of nutrition -related complications, 4) albumin level, 5) BMI, 6) peripheral artery disease, 7) pre -existing PUs, 8) diabetes mellitus, 9) Charlson Comorbidity Index, 10) RAND Sickness at Admission Scale, 11) respiratory disease, 12) MMSE score, 13) chronic cognitive deficit, and 14) number of hours between ED admission and hip surgery. The risk factors that were time -variant and measured at each follow -up visit included: 1) activity level, 2) urina ry and fecal incontinence, 3) number of orientations to person, place, time, and 4) care setting. For PUs in the hip area, three risk factors were postulated a priori including activity level (bedbound or chair bound condition), incontinence (urinary and fecal), and low BMI. However, there was literature evidence pointing to other risk factors associated with the development of PUs in general and not specific to any anatomical sites. Thus, those risk factors were evaluated as part of the exploratory analys is. They included: A) time- invariant and only measured at baseline: 1) age, 2) sex, 3) risk of nutrition -related complications, 4) albumin level, 5) peripheral artery disease, 6) pre -existing PUs, 7) diabetes mellitus, 8) Charlson Comorbidity Index, 9) RAN D Sickness at Admission Scale, 10) respiratory disease, 11) MMSE score, 12) chronic cognitive deficit, and 13) number of hours between ED admission and hip surgery. B) time -variant and measured at 79 each follow -up visit: 1) number of orientations to person, place, time, and 2) patient location. For PUs in the foot area, three risk factors were postulated a priori including peripheral artery disease , respiratory disease, and diabetes mellitus. The following risk factors were also evaluated as part of the exp loratory analysis. A) T ime-invariant and only measured at baseline: 1) age, 2) sex, 3) risk of nutrition -related complications, 4) albumin level, 5) BMI, 6) pre -existing PUs, 7) Charlson Comorbidity Index, 8) RAND Sickness at Admission Scale, 9) MMSE score , 10) chronic cognitive deficit, and 11) number of hours between ED admission and hip surgery. B) Time -variant and measured at each follow -up visit: 1) activity level, 2) urinary and fecal incontinence, 3) number of orientations to person, place, time, and 4) patient location. For PUs in the foot area, the age category 65 -74 years had only two PUs that progressed. To avoid unstable regression results due to small sample size, the category 65 -74 years was combined with category 75 -84 years, and the combined category (65 -84 years) was used as the reference category for foot PUs. Each potential risk factor was evaluated separately in a regression model using the discrete -time survival analysis method. The analysis was conducted separately for PUs in all anat omical sites, in the hip area, and in the foot area. Based on literature evidence and stratified analysis, a number of covariates were selected to be adjusted for as confounders in the regression model that evaluated each potential risk factor. Thus, some risk factors 80 were treated as confounders in the analysis for other risk factors. The time -invariant covariates measured at baseline included 1) age, 2) sex, 3) pre -existing PUs, 4) Charlson Comorbidity Index, 5) risk of nutrition -related complications, 6) diabetes mellitus, 7) albumin level, and 8) BMI. The time -varying covariates measured at each follow -up visit included: 1) activity level; 2) urinary and fecal incontinence; 3) number of orientations to person, place, and time; and 4) patient location. The analysis for each risk factor and anatomical site (Model 1) was repeated adjusting for the use of PRSS devices in addition to the above list of covariates (Model 2). For each risk factor in Model 1 , the above 12 covariates were controlled for in the analysis. In Model 2 , in addition to the above 12 covariates the following adjustment was also made. In the analysis for ulcers in: a) all anatomical sites , the presence of a mattress, overlay, cushion, or heel protector at follow -up visits was controlled for. b) the hip area , the presence of a mattress, overlay, or cushion at follow -up visits was controlled for. c) the foot area , the presence of a mattress, overlay, or heel protector at follow -up visits was controlled for. Power Calculation We estimated the power to compare the IR of progression of stage I PUs between patients who did (exposed) and did not (unexposed) have the risk factors of interest. The analysis 81 was based on the total number of stage I PUs that progressed (overall n=111, hip n=52, foot n=49), t he postulated proportion of follow -up time contributed by the ulcers in the exposed group (a range of 0.1 to 0.5 postulated), the postulated R tR comparing progression of stage I PUs in the exposed and unexposed groups (1.50, 1.75, and 2.00 postulated), and type I error set at 0.05. We calculated the projected number of ulcers that progressed in the exposed and unexposed groups based on the above parameters. Then, power was calculated based on Formula 5. As Table 10 shows for all stage I PUs, when the prop ortion of follow -up time in the exposed group was between 0.3 and 0.5, the study had greater than 80% power to detect a RtR as small as 1.75. When the proportion of follow -up time in the exposed group was between 0.1 and 0.5, the study had greater than 80% power to detect a R tR as small as 2.00. 82 Table 10: Power of the analysis comparing progression rates of stage I PUs (all anatomical sites) between patients with and without risk factors for stage I PUs, by postulated R tR and prop ortion of follow -up time in the exposed group (=0.05) Postulated proportion of follow - up time in exposed group Postulated RtR Projected number of PUs in exposed group that progressed Power 0.50 1.75 71 0.810 0.40 1.75 60 0.836 0.30 1.75 48 0.831 0.20 1.75 34 0.774 0.10 2.00 20 0.804 As Table 11 shows for hip area stage I PUs, when the proportion of follow -up time in the exposed group was between 0.2 and 0.4, the study had greater than 80% power to detect a RtR as small as 2.25. When the proportion of follow -up time in the exposed group was between 0.2 and 0.5, the study had greater than 80% power to detect a R tR as small as 2.50. 83 Table 11: Power of the analysis comparing progression rates of hip area stage I PUs between patients with and without risk factors, by postulated R tR and proportion of follow -up time in the exposed group (=0.05) Postulated proportion of follow -up time in exposed group Postulated RtR Projected number of PUs in hip area and exposed group that progressed Power 0.50 2.25 36 0.770 0.40 2.25 31 0.817 0.30 2.25 26 0.832 0.20 2.25 19 0.801 0.10 2.25 10 0.648 0.50 2.50 37 0.847 0.40 2.50 33 0.892 0.30 2.50 27 0.910 0.20 2.50 20 0.895 0.10 2.50 11 0.778 As Table 12 shows for foot area stage I PUs, when the proportion of follow -up time in the exposed group was between 0.2 and 0.5, the study had greater than 80% power to detect a R tR as small as 2.50. The study had greater than 80% power to detect a R tR as small as 2.75 when the proportion of follow -up time in the exposed group was between 0.1 and 0.5. 84 Table 12: Power of the analysis comparing progression rates o f foot area stage I PUs between patients with and without risk factors, by postulated R tR and proportion of follow -up time in the exposed group (=0.05) Postulated proportion of follow -up time in exposed group Postulated RtR Projected number of PUs in hip area and exposed group that progressed Power 0.50 2.50 35 0.826 0.40 2.50 31 0.874 0.30 2.50 25 0.893 0.20 2.50 19 0.877 0.10 2.50 11 0.754 0.50 2.75 36 0.879 0.40 2.75 32 0.923 0.30 2.75 27 0.942 0.20 2.75 20 0.936 0.10 2.75 11 0.850 2. Research Question 2 What is the effect of PRSS on the progression of stage I PUs to a higher stage, overall and by ulcer's anatom ical site in elderly hip fracture patients? Aim To evaluate the effect of PRSS on progression of stage I PUs overall and by anatomical site (hip and foot areas) after controlling for patients' demographic and baseline clinical characteristics, time -varying clinical characteristics, and care setting; the unit of analysis for this Aim is the individual ulcer. 85 Figure 3 depicts the relationship between exposure, outcome, and potential confounders for research question 2. 86 Use of PRSS: Mattress Overlay Cushion (chair and wheelchair ) Heel protector Outcome Incidence rate of progression of stage 1 PUs in all anatomical sites, hip and foot areas, separately Exposure Potential confounders Age Sex Risk of nutrition -related complications Albumin level BMI Arterial condition Peripheral artery disease Pre-existing PUs Diabetes mellitus Charlson Comorbidity Index RAND Sickness at Admission Scale Activity level Orientation MMSE score Hospitalized in the six months prior to the current hospitalization Number of hours between ED admission and hip surgery Presence of a mattress, overlay, cushion, or heel protector Activity level Urinary or fecal incontinence Num ber of orientations to person, place, time Care setting Baseline, time-invari ant Follow -up, time -variant Figure 3: Depiction of the relationship between the use of PRSS, potential confounders, and progression of stage I PUs to a higher s tage 87 Statistical Analysis As part of the exploratory analysis, we calculated the frequency distribution of visits in which different PRSS devices were in use among all PUs and each anatomical site individually and also diffe rent care settings. The multivariable regression analysis was similar to that for Research Question 1. The exposure of interest for this research question was use of PRSS devices. Use of different devices was examined in separate models including mattress alone; overlay alone; mattress or overlay; mattress or overlay or cushion; mattress or overlay or cushion or heel protector; cushion alone; and heel protector alone. The analysis was separately performed for all ulcers, hip, foot, and heel ulcers, and the outcome was the progression of stage I PUs. To estimate the crude HR of progression for each PRSS, a model was fit with the device variable as the main predictor variable and progression as the outcome variable. Based on evidence in the literature abou t the risk factors for the progression of stage I PUs, other literature related to PU development, expert opinion, biological plausibility, and stratified analysis, a number of covariates were selected and adjusted for in each regression model as confounde rs. The time -invariant covariates measured at baseline included: 1) age, 2) pre -existing PUs, 3) risk of nutrition -related complications, 4) BMI, and 5) Charlson Comorbidity Index. The time -variant covariates measured at follow -up visits included: 1) numb er of orientations to person, place, and time; 2) activity level; 3) urinary and fecal incontinence; and 4) patient location. 88 A number of other potential confounders, that were similarly selected and measured at baseline only (time -invariant), were each empirically examined in the association between PRSS devices and progression. If they met the criterion previously described, they were added to the regression model as a confounder in addition to the 9 covariates above. This list included: 1) sex; 2) numb er of orientations to person, place, and time; 3) activity level; 4) arterial conditions; 5) peripheral artery disease; 6) diabetes mellitus; 7) hospitalized in the six months prior to the current hospitalization for hip surgery; 8) MMSE score; 9) albumin level; 10) Rand Sickness at Admission scale; 11) number of hours between ED admission and hip surgery; and 12) use of a mattress, overlay, cushion, or heel protector. All observations that had missing values for covariates that were controlled for in the final adjusted model were deleted from the dataset so that both crude and adjusted models ran on the same dataset with the same number of observations, and crude and adjusted HRs would be comparable in terms of their interpretation. Power Calculation We estimated the power to evaluate the effect of PRSS devices on progression of stage I PUs overall, and in hip and foot area ulcers separately. The same method used to estimate power in Research Question 1, Aim 1d, was used for this Aim. For stage I PUs i n all anatomical sites (Table 13), when the proportion of follow -up time in the exposed group was between 0.3 and 0.5, the study had greater than 80% power to 89 detect a R tR as small as 1.75. When the proportion of follow -up time in the exposed group was bet ween 0.1 and 0.5, the study had greater than 80% power to detect a R tR as small as 2.00 or higher.

When the proportion of follow -up time in the exposed group was between 0.2 and 0.5, the study had greater than 80% power to detect a R tR as small a s 2.50, and when the proportion of follow -up time in the exposed group was between 0.1 and 0.5, the study had greater than 80% power to detect a R tR of 2.75 or higher. 90 Table 14: Power of the analysis comparing progression rates fo r stage I PUs in the hip area between patients with and without PRSS devices, by postulated R tR and proportion of follow -up time in the PRSS g roup (=0.05) Postulated proportion of follow - up time in PRSS (exposed) group Postulated RtR Projected number of PUs in hip area and PRSS (exposed) group that progressed Power 0.50 2.25 36 0.770 0.40 2.25 31 0.817 0.30 2.25 26 0.832 0.20 2.25 19 0.801 0.10 2.25 10 0.648 0.50 2.50 37 0.847 0.40 2.50 33 0.892 0.30 2.50 27 0.910 0.20 2.50 20 0.895 0.10 2.50 11 0.778 0.50 2.75 38 0.897 0.40 2.75 34 0.937 0.30 2.75 28 0.953 0.20 2.75 21 0.948 0.10 2.75 12 0.870 For PUs in the foot area (Table 1 5), when the proportion of follow -up time in the exposed group was between 0.2 and 0.5, the study had greater than 80% power to detect a R tR as small as 2.50. When the proportion of follow -up time in the exposed group was between 0.1 and 0.5, the study had greater than 80% power to detect a R tR of 2.75 or higher.

It is important to note that in most analyses in this study, the fact that some PUs not only did not progress but actually developed a favorable outcome (healing) was not taken into account. These PUs were cens ored when they disappeared and the censoring was not captured when estimating crude IRs and R tRs, or in regression analyses. The only exception is the KM analysis which did take into account the censoring by continuing the follow -up time for the PUs which disappeared until the end of the follow -up time for the patients who had those PUs. 92 VII. RESULTS A. Research Q uestion 1 1. Descriptive Analyses Table 16 shows the baseline characteristics of the study population. There were 168 patients with median age 85.5 years. Three quarters of the study population were women , and almost all were White . These patients develo ped a total of 278 stage I pressure ulcers (PUs) during the course of the study . A small proportion of patients had pre -existing PU s at the time of admission to the hospital. Since all of the patients were hospitalized for a hip fracture, very few could walk , even occasionally. The m ost common comorbidities were respiratory disease, peripheral artery disease, and diabetes . More than 40% of patients had a score of two or greater on t he Charlson Comorbidity Index. Over half of the patients were oriented to all three of person, place, and time , and 7.7% were oriented to none.

Inferential Analyses Research Question 1 What are the clinic al course and risk factors for the progression of stage I PUs to a higher stage in elderly hip fracture patients? Patients' characteristics at baseline were compared with respect to the progression of their stage I PUs using a c hi-square (2) test. (Table 2 7) Overall, there were no statistically significant (=0.05) differences between patients whose stage I PUs progressed and those whose PUs did not progress with respect to their baseline 104 characteristics although the youngest ag e group (65 -74 years) had a marginally significantly (p=0.046) higher proportion of progression compared to the other two age groups.

The unit of analysis for this aim is the individual patient. Table 28 shows the results for Aim 1a. Incidence rate (IR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of progre ssion of stage I PUs among patients who had at least one stage I PU was 9.2 (7.4 -11.5) per 100 patient -days. However, IR (95% CI) of progression of stage I PUs among patients who had more than one PU was 5.3 (4.0 -7.2) per 100 patient -days.

On day 21, the probability of progression was 0. 55, and 111 PUs had progressed. The follow -up days (11, 13, 15, 16, and 20) that are not shown in the Table represent days on which no progression occurred but some ulcers were censored . Figure 4 depicts the KM estimate of the probabilit y of progression for stage I PUs over time for all anatomical sites . The y -axis represents the probability of progression , and the x-axis represents time in days. The time started when a stage I PU was first detected, and it ended when the PU progressed or the patient's follow -up time ended. The follow -up time was not censored when a PU disappeared , as explained in the Methods chapter. In 109 the Figure below , the follow -up time is shown only until day 14 because by then only a small number of PUs remained in t he risk set.

In the adjusted model, the following covariates were controlled for: A) time -invariant covariates measured at baseline only: 1) age, 2) presence of pre -existing PUs, 3) risk of nutrition -related complicat ions, 4) BMI, and 5) Charlson Comorbidity Index; B) time - variant covariates measured at each follow -up visit: 1) number of orientations to person, place, and time; 2) activity level; 3) urinary and fecal incontinence; 4) care setting ; and 5) presence of a mattress, overlay, cushion, or heel protector. The final dataset used for both crude and adjusted regression models excluded ulcer visits that had any missing values for any of the variables included in the adjusted model. The crude regression model was also constructed including all observations with missing values for covariates (data not shown); however, the result was similar to that of the crude analysis excluding those observations. Table 33: Crude and adjusted HR of progres sion of stage I PUs in hip area compared to foot area Crude HR (95% CI) p-value Adjusted HR (95% CI) p-value 2.5 (1.4 -4.6) 0.003 (1.3-4.1) 0.006 113 The crude rate ratio (RtR) (95% CI) for progression comparing hip to foot area PUs when calculated by d ividing the crude IR of progression in hip by the crude IR of progression in foot [1.9 (1. 3-2.8)] was slightly different from the crude hazard ratio (HR) of progression comparing hip to foot area PUs [2.5 (1.4 -4.6)] when calculated by the regression analys is (Table 33). The difference was not large and did not change the direction or statistical significance of the association. There are factors that may have contributed to this difference: 1) When calculating RtR, correlation and repeated measures were not taken into account whereas Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE ) was applied to the regression analysis that generated the HR ; GEE assigns less weight to observations coming from the same person/ulcer; and 2) RtR was calculated using all ulcer visits wher eas HR was calculated after excluding ulcer visits that had missing values for any covariates controlled for in the adjusted models. Aim 1d To identify factors associated with progression rate of stage I PU s to a higher stage, overall and by ulcer's ana tomical site. The unit of analysis for this Aim is the individual ulcer. Hypothesis 1d.1 Stage I PUs in patients who possess the conventional risk factors for the development of PUs (e.g., older age , reduced mobility, incontinence, impaired mental statu s, poor nutritional status, and other comorbidit ies) or who are in an acute care setting have a 114 higher rate of progression to a higher stage compared to stage I PUs in patients who do not have these risk factors or are in other care settings. Eighteen factors were postulated as potential risk factors associated with progression of stage I PUs; 14 were only measured at baseline (time -invariant) and four at each follow - up visit (time -variant) . The baseline factors included : 1) age, 2) sex, 3) presence of pre - existing PUs, 4) MMSE score, 5) chronic cognitive deficit, 6) risk of nutrition -related complications, 7) albumin level, 8) BMI, 9) Charlson Comorbidity Index, 10) Rand Sickness at Admission scale, 11) respiratory disease, 12) peripheral artery disease, 13) diabetes, and 14) number of hours between ED admission and hip surgery. The time - variant factors included 1) urinary and fecal incontinence; 2) number of orientations to person, place, and time; 3) activity level; and 4) care setting. Each risk factor was analyzed separately. In the adjusted regression model for each risk factor, other postulated risk factors and other covariates were adjusted for as confounders. These factors and covariates are listed below. Table 34 displays the association s between postulated risk factors and progression of stage I PUs to a higher stage in all anatomical sites (hip, foot, and other areas) . For each risk factor, the crude IR per 100 ulcer -days of follow -up was estimated by dividing the number of PUs that progr essed by the total number of follow -up days and multiplying by 100. The unadjusted and adjusted HRs were estimated using regression models. Only ulcer visits that ha d non-missing values for all the covariates controlled for in the 115 adjusted model were inclu ded. The original dataset included 767 ulcer visits ; after removing the observations with missing values for the relevant covariates, the final dataset on which the regression models were fit included 573 ulcer visits for all risk factors except for number of hours between ED admission and hip surgery , which included 564 observations . The crude regression model was also constructed including all observations with missing values for covariates (data not shown); however, the results were similar to those of t he crude analysis excluding those observations. In the unadjusted model (Model 1) , no confounders were included . In the first adjusted model ( Model 2 ), the following covariates were controlled for : A) time-invariant covariates measured at baseline: 1) age , 2) sex, 3) presence of pre -existing PUs, 4) risk of nutrition -related complications, 5) albumin level, 6) BMI, 1) urinary and fecal incontinence ; 2) number of orientations to person, place, time; 3) activity level ; and 4) care setting . In Model 3 , in addition to the above 12 covariates, the presence of PRSS device s including mattress, overlay, cushion, or heel protector at follow -up visits (time -varying covariate) was also controlled for. The 95% CI and the global p -value for each model are also shown in Table 33. 116 Table 34: Crude and adjusted association between postulated risk factors and progression of stage I PUs, a ll anatomical sites Characteristic Number of PUs progressed (n=111) Number of ulcer -

Having modera te compared to low risk of nutrition -related complications at baseline was also a statistically significant protective factor in the adjusted models. Having 0 vs. 3 orientation s was a statistically significant risk factor for progression in the adjusted mo dels. In addition, peripheral artery disease was a significant risk factor for progression both in the crude and adjusted models . Hypothesis 1d .2 For stage I PUs in the hip area, risk factors associated with a higher rate of progression are bedbound or chair bound condition, urinary and fecal incontinence, and low BMI. Table 35 demonstrates the association between postulated risk factors and progression of stage I PUs to a higher stage in hip area. This T able shows the same type of data for PUs in the hip area as shown in Table 33 for PUs at all anatomical sites . The original dataset included 256 observations ( ulcer visits) ; after observations with missing values for covariates were excluded from the dataset, the final dataset on which the regression models were fit included 171 observations (visits). The crude regression model was also constructed including all observations with missing values for covariates (data not shown); however, the results were similar to those of the crude analysis excluding thos e observations. 121 Each risk factor was analyzed separately. In each adjusted regression model for each risk factor, the other two postulated risk factors and other covariates were adjusted for as confounders. In the unadjusted model (Model 1), no confounde rs were included. In the first adjusted model (Model 2), the following covariates were controlled for: A) time - invariant covariates measured at baseline: 1) age, 2) sex, 3) presence of pre -existing PUs, 4) risk of nutrition -related complications, 5) albumi n level, 6) BMI, 7) 8) Charlson Comorbidity Index; B) covariates visits: 1) urinary and fecal incontinence; 2) number of orientations to person, place, time; 3) activity level; and 4) care setting . In M odel 3, in addition to the above 12 covariates, the presence of PRSS devices including mattress, overlay, cushion, or heel protector at follow -up visits (time -varying covariate) was also controlled for. 122 Table 35: Crude and adjus ted association between postulated risk factors and progression of stage I PUs in hip area Characteristic Number of PUs progressed (n=52) Number of ulcer - days of follow -up IR per 100 ulcer - days of follow - up Model 1: Unadjusted HR (95% CI) Global p - value Model 2 *: Adjusted HR (95% CI) Global p-value Model 3 **: Adjusted HR (95% CI) Global p-value BMI at baseline High (25) Low (<18.5 ) Normal (18.5-<25) 15 5 29 104 73 241 14.4 6.8 12.0 1.1 (0.5 -2.4) 0.6 (0.2 -1.5) Reference 0.4 1.1 (0.4 -2.7) 0.6 (0.2 -1.4) Reference 0.5 1.1 (0.4 -2.8) 0.6 (0.2 -1.5) Reference 0.5 Incontinence at follow -up visits Urinary only Urinary & fecal None 18 18 16 131 232 104 13.7 7.8 15.4 1.1 (0.5 -2.5) 0.7 (0.3 -1.5) Reference 0.5 1.5 (0.6 -3.7) 0.7 (0.3 -2.1) Reference 0.4 1.5 (0.6 -3.7) 0.7 (0.3 -2.1) Reference 0.4 Activity level at follow -up visits Bedbound Chair bound Walking 14 18 20 92 194 181 15.2 9.3 11.0 1.0 (0.5 -2.1) 0.5 (0.2 -1.2) Reference 0.2 0.6 (0.2 -1.7) 0.3 (0.1 -0.8) Reference 0.06 0.7 (0.3 -1.8) 0.3 (0.1 -0.8) Reference 0.06 *Covariates adjusted for in Model 2: age; sex; presence and urinary and fecal incontinence; number of orientations to person, place, and time; activity level; and care setting at follow -up visits ** Covariates adjusted for in Model 3: a ll covariates adjusted in Model 2 plus the presence of any PRSS including mattress, overlay, cushion, or heel protector at follow -up visits 123 Low BMI and incontinence were not significantly associated with progression. However, stage I PUs in chair bound patients were significantly less likely to progress than ulcers in patients who could walk occasionally (adjusted HR=0.3, 95% CI 0.1 -0.8). (Table 34) In exploratory analyses, I analyzed other factors that were potentially associated with progression of s tage I PUs in the hip area . These factors included: A) Measured at baseline only (time -invariant): 1) age, 2) sex, 3) presence of pre -existing PUs, 4) MMSE score, 5) chronic cognitive deficit, 6) risk of nutrition -related complications, 7) albumin level, 8 ) Charlson Comorbidity Index, 9) Rand Sickness at Admission scale, 10) respiratory disease, 11) peripheral artery disease, 12) diabetes, 13) number of hours between ED admission and hip surgery. B) Measured at follow -up visits (time -variant factors): 1) nu mber of orientations to person, place, and time; and 2) care setting. Each risk factor was analyzed separately. In the adjusted regression model for each risk factor, some of the other risk factors and other covariates were adjusted for as confounders. Th e same Models 1 -3 as previously described were fit for these analyses. The analyses for the unadjusted models were performed by both including (data not shown) and excluding o bservations with missing values for any variables included in adjusted models ; the results were similar for both analyses.

Table 37 demonstrates the association between postulated risk factors and progression of stage I PUs in the foot area to a higher stage. This Table shows the same type of data for PUs in the foot area as shown in Table 33 for PUs at all anatomical sites and Table s 34 and 35 for PUs in the hip area. The original dataset included 430 observations (ulcer visits); after all observations with missing values for all variables in the model were excluded from the dataset, the final dataset on which the regression models were fit included 347 observations. The crude regr ession model was also constructed including all observations with missing values for covariates (data not shown); however, the results were similar to those of the crude analysis excluding those observations. Each risk factor was analyzed separately. In a djusted regression model s for respiratory disease and peripheral artery disease , diabetes was adjusted for as a confounder along with other covariates. In the unadjusted model (Model 1), no confounders were included. In the first adjusted model (Model 2), the following covariates were controlled for: A) time-invariant covariates measured at baseline: 1) age, 2) sex, 3) presence of pre -existing PUs, 4) risk of nutrition -related complications, 5) albumin level, 6) BMI, 7) visits: 1) urinary and fecal incontinence; 2) number of orientations to person, place, time; 3) activity level; and 4) care setting . In Model 3, in addition to the above 12 covariates, the prese nce of PRSS devices including mattress, overlay, cushion, or heel protector at follow -up visits (time -varying covariate) was also controlled for. 129 Table 37: Crude and adjusted association between postulated risk factors and prog ression of stage I PUs in foot area Characteristic Number of PU s progresse d (n=49) Number of ulcer - days of follow - up IR per 100 ulcer -days of follow - up Model 1: Unadjusted HR (95% CI) Global p - value Model 2 *: Adjusted HR (95% CI) Global p - value Model 3 **: Adjusted HR (95% CI) Global p - value Peripheral artery disease at baseline Yes No 17 32 96 734 17.7 4.4 8.7 (3.7 -20.2) Reference 0.08 5.6 (1.9 -16.5) Reference 0.03 6.1 (2.2 -17.3) Reference 0.03 Respiratory disease at baseline Yes No 10 39 244 586 4.1 6.7 0.7 (0.3 -1.5) Reference 0.3 0.5 (0.2 -1.4) Reference 0.2 0.6 (0.2 -1.7) Reference 0.2 Diabetes at baseline Yes No 13 36 166 664 7.8 5.4 1.2 (0.3 -4.5) Reference 0.8 0.8 (0.2 -2.7) Reference 0.7 0.9 (0.3 -2.8) Reference 0.8 *Covariates adjusted for in Model 2: age; sex; presence of pre -existing and urinary and fecal incontinence; number of orientations to person, place, and time; activity level; and care setting at follow -up visits ** Covariates adjusted for in Mode l 3: all covariates adjusted in Model 2 plus the presence of any PRSS including mattress, overlay, cushion, or heel protector at follow -up visits 130 Neither respiratory disease nor diabetes at baseline was associated with progression of stage I PUs in the foot area . However, peripheral artery disease showed a significant association with progression in both crude and adjusted models. Due to the small number of stage I PUs that progressed, the confidence intervals for the association were wide. (Table 37) Although not postulated a priori, but as exploratory analyses, I also analyzed other factors as potential risk factors associated with progression of stage I PUs in the foot area . These factors included: A) M easured at baseline only (time -invariant): 1) age , 2) sex, 3) presence of pre -existing PUs, 4) MMSE score, 5) chronic cognitive deficit, 6) risk of nutrition -related complications, 7) albumin level, 8) BMI, 9 ) Charlson Comorbidity Index, 10) Rand Sickness at Admission scale, and 11) number of hours betwe en ED admission and hip surgery. B) Measured at follow -up visits (time -variant factors): 1) urinary and fecal incontinence; 2) number of orientations to person, place, and time; and 3) care setting. Each risk factor was analyzed separately. In each adjust ed regression model for each risk factor, some of the other risk factors and other covariates were adjusted for as confounders. The same Models 1 -3 as previously described were fit for these analyses as well. The analyses for the unadjusted models were per formed by both including (data not shown) and excluding observations with missing values for any variables included in adjusted models; the results were similar for both analyses.

However, after adjusting for confounders , only being bedbound or chair bound remained significant. The adjusted HRs also indicated that being obese compared to having a normal BMI at baseline was statistically significantly protective again st progression of PUs in the foot area. In addition, being in a post -acute facility compared to a nursing home/assisted living residence/home at follow -up visits was a statistically significantly risk factor for progression of PUs in the foot area . (Table 38) In some cases, there was a larger than expected difference between the crude R tR calculated by the ratio of IRs , and the crude HR calculated by discrete -time survival regression modeling. However, the difference was not large and did not change the statistical significance or the direction of the association. Two factors may have contributed to the difference: 1) when calculating R tR, correlation and repeated measures were not taken into account whereas GEE was applied to the discrete -time survival analysis; GEE assigns less weight to observations coming from the same person/ulcer; and 2) RtR was calculated using all observations whereas HR was calculated after excluding observations that had missing values for any of the covariates controlled for in the adjusted models. 136 B. Research Question 2 1. Descriptive Analyses The study included 939 visits for stage I PUs at all anatomical sites . Table 39 shows the number of visits with known and unknown PRSS status by anatomical site . Table 39: Number of visits by status of PRSS device, by anatomical site Number of visits All anatomical sites Hip area Foot area Heel PUs Known PRSS status 888 314 483 348 Unknown PRSS status 51 23 28 23 Total 939 337 511 371 Table s 40 show s the nu mber and proportion of follow -up visits at which different PRSS device s were in use for all anatomical sites , and hip, and foot areas . Overall, in approximately a quarter of all visits, there were no devices in use. A mattress and an overlay w ere rarely us ed together (0.7) whereas cushions and heel protectors were used at the same visits more often (19.0) . Overall, cushions and heel protectors were more frequently used than overlays and mattresses. 137 Table 40: Frequency of follow -up visits for stage I PUs by PRSS type in use PRSS type Number (%) of visits All anatomical sites Hip area Foot area Heels Mattress or overlay 303 (34.1) 88 (28.0) 167 (34.6) Mattress and overlay 6 (0.7) 0 0 Mattress 149 (16.8) 44 (14.0) 79 (16.4) Overlay 160 (18.0) 44 (14.0) 88 (18.2) Cushion 378 (42.6) 119 (37.9) 227 (47.0) Heel protector 399 (44.9) 101 (32.2) 256 (53.0) 170 (48.9) Mattress and overlay and cushion 0 0 0 Mattress and overlay and heel protector 2 (0.2) 0 0 Mattress and overlay and heel protector and cushion 0 0 0 Heel protector and cushion 169 (19.0) 32 (10.2) 126 (26.1) Mattress and cushion 73 (8.2) 20 (6.4) 42 (8.7) Mattress and heel protector 68 (7.7) 17 (5.4) 39 (8.1) Overlay and cushion 76 (8.6) 17 (5.4) 55 (11.4) Overlay and heel protector 84 (9.5) 18 (5.7) 50 (10.4) Mattress and heel protector and cushion 32 (3.6) 8 (2.6) 21 (4.4) Overlay and heel protector and cushion 37 (4.2) 6 (1.9) 27 (5.6) Any device 681 (76.7) 218 (69.4) 386 (79.9) No device 207 (23.3) 96 (30.6) 97 (20.1) In the acute hospital setting , heel protectors were most frequently used , and in the post - acute facility setting, cushions were most frequently used (Table 40). In the nursing home, cushions and heel protectors were used most often . In the assisted -living residence, use of cushions , and in the home setting, use of a heel protector was most prevalent . When comparing the frequency of use of each PRSS type in different care settings, it was found that a mattress was most frequently used in an acute hospital setting than other settings ; an overlay was used most often in an assisted -living residence setting ; use of cushions was most prevalent in a post -acute facility setting ; and use of heel protectors 138 was the highest in the home setting. (Table 41) Overall, cushions and heel protectors were more frequently used than mattresses and overlays in all care settings.

Inferential Analyses Research Question 2 What is the effect of PRSS on the progression of stage I PUs to a higher stage, overall and by ulcer's anatomical site in elderly hip fra cture patients? Patients who did or did not have a PRSS in use at the baseline visit were compared with respect to the progression of their stage I PUs using a 2 test (Table 4 2), and there was no statistically significant difference between the two group s of patients. 139 Table 42: Baseline* use of PRSS by patients and stratified by progression of stage I PUs PRSS Progression of stage I PUs 2 p-value Yes N (%) No N (%) Mattress alone Yes No 17 (47.2) 62 (47.0) 19 (52.08) 70 (53.0) 0.98 Overlay alone Yes No 23 (45.1) 56 (47.9) 28 (54.9) 61 (52.1) 0.74 Mattress or overlay Yes No 39 (46.4) 40 (47.6) 45 (53.6) 44 (52.4) 0.88 Cushion alone Yes No 11 (55.0) 68 (46.0) 9 (45.0) 80 (54.0) 0.45 Heel protector alone Yes No 24 (43.6) 55 (48.7) 31 (56.4) 58 (51.3) 0.54 *Baseline refers to the first assessment visit after the patient was enrolled in the parent study. Aim To evaluate the effect of PRSS on progression of stage I PUs overall and by anato mical site (hip and foot areas) after controlling for patients' demographic and baseline clinical characteristics, time -varying clinical characteristics, and care setting; the unit of analysis for this Aim is the individual ulcer. Hypothesis 2a The use of PRSS is associated with a lower rate of progression of stage I PUs overall. 140 Table 43 demonstrates the association between the use of PRSS devices and progression of stage I PUs to a higher stage for PUs at all anatomic al sites. A separate analysis was conducted for the use of each of the following categories of devices: mattress or overlay ; mattress alone ; overlay alone ; mattress or overlay or cushion ; mattress or overlay or cushion or heel protector. The unadjusted and adjusted HRs were estimated using regression models. The full dataset included 659 observations (ulcer visits) . After excluding observations that had missing values for any of the covariates controlled for in the adjusted models, the final dataset included 573 observations. The analyses f or the unadjusted models were performed by both including (data not shown) and excluding observations with missing values for any variables included in adjusted models; the results were similar for both analyses. In the unadjusted model (Model 1) , no confo unders were included. In the adjusted model (Model 2) , the following covariates were controlled for: A) time -invariant covariates measured at baseline: 1) age, 2) pre- existing PUs, 3) risk of nutrition -related complications, 4) BMI, 5) Charlson Comorbidity Index; B) covariates measured at follow -up visits: 1) number of orientations to person, place, and time; 2) activity level; 3) urinary and fecal incontinence; and 4) care setting . The 9 covariates listed above were controlled for in Model 2 for the analysis of all, hip, foot, and heel PUs.141 Table 43: Crude and adjusted association between use of PRSS and progression of stage I PUs at all anatomical sites PRSS type Number of PUs progressed Number IR per 100 -days follow -up Model 1: Crude HR (95% CI) p-value Model 2 *: Adjusted HR (95% CI) p-value Mattress alone Yes No 22 89 248 1173 8.9 7.6 0.97 (0.4 -2.1) Reference 0.9 0.9 (0.4 -1.9) Reference 0.8 Overlay alone Yes No 19 92 278 1143 6.8 8.1 1.0 (0.4 -2.1) Reference 0.9 0.9 (0.4 -1.7) Reference 0.7 Mattress or overlay Yes No 40 71 522 899 7.7 7.9 1.0 (0.5 -1.9) Reference 0.9 0.9 (0.5 -1.6) Reference 0.6 Mattress or overlay or cushion Yes No 63 48 925 496 6.8 9.7 0.8 (0.5 -1.2) Reference 0.2 0.8 (0.5 -1.3) Reference 0.4 Mattress o r overlay or cushion or heel protector (any device) Yes No 87 24 1132 289 7.7 8.3 0.9 (0.6 -1.5) Reference 0.8 0.9 (0.5 -1.6) Reference 0.7 *Covariates adjusted in Model 2: age; at baseline; and to person, place, and time; activity level; urinary and fecal incontinence; and care setting at follow -up visits 142 As Table 43 shows , with respect to all anatomical sites the crude IR of progression was highest when a mattress alone was in use . The crude IR was the lowest when the following devices were in use: an overlay alone ; a mattress or overlay or cushion. None of the crude or adj usted associations was statistically significant. Hypothesis 2b The use of PRSS is associated with a lower rate of progression of stage I PUs in the hip area. Table 44 demonstrates the association between the use of PRSS devices and progression of stage I PUs to a higher stage in the hip area. This Table shows the data for hip area PUs as Table 40 shows for PUs in all anatomical sites . The full dataset for these analyses included 215 observations. After excluding observations that had missing values f or any of the covariates controlled for in the adjusted models, the final dataset s included between 166 and 171 observations depending on the device being analyzed . The analyses for the unadjusted models were performed by both including (data not shown) an d excluding observations with missing values for any variables included in adjusted models; the results were similar for both analyses. The crude and adjusted HRs for progression of PUs in hip area were estimated using the same method as for all PUs , and the same 9 covariates were adjusted for in Model 2. In addition to the 9 confounders listed previously , other covariates were empirically evaluated as confounders and selected if they changed the crude HR 15% or more . 143 Dependin g on the device being analyzed , other confounders were added to the models (in addition to the 9 confounders) as follows. In the analyses for A) mattress or overlay, B) cushion, and C) mattress or overlay or cushion, the number of orientations to person, place, and time at baseline was also controlled for in the model. In the analysis for overlay alone , 1) number of orientations to person, place, and time at baseline , and 2) number of hours between ED admission and hip surgery were also controlled for in the model. 144 Table 44: Crude and adjusted association between use of PRSS and progression of stage I PUs in hip area PRSS type Number of PUs progressed Number of ulcer -days of follow -up IR per 100 ulcer -days of follow -up Model 1: Crude HR (95% CI) p-value Model 2 *: Adjusted HR (95% CI) p-value Mattress alone Yes No 8 44 49 418 16.3 10.5 0.8 (0.3 -2.5) Reference 0.7 0.9 (0.3 -2.6) Reference 0.8 Overlay alone Yes No 6 46 77 390 7.8 11.8 1.0 (0.5 -2.2) Reference 0.9 0.8 (0.2 -2.6) Reference 0.7 Cushion alone Yes No 17 35 185 282 9.2 12.4 0.7 (0.4 -1.3) Reference 0.3 1.1 (0.4 -2.7)# Reference 0.8 Mattress or overlay Yes No 14 38 126 341 11.1 11.1 0.9 (0.4 -2.0) Reference 0.9 1.0 (0.4 -2.5)# Reference 0.9 Mattress or overlay or cushion Yes No 26 26 247 220 10.5 11.8 0.8 (0.4 -1.4) Reference 0.4 1.1 (0.6 -2.2)# Reference 0.7 *All the following covariates were adjusted for in Model 2: age; pre risk place, and time; activity level; urinary and fecal incontinence; and care setting at follow -up visits #Additional covariates adjusted for in Model 2 of each device model: number of orientations to person, place, and time at baseline; and number of hours between ED admission and hip surgery 145 As Table 44 shows, the crude IR of progression of PUs in the hip area was highest when a mattress alone was in use, and it was lowest when an overlay alone was in use. None of the crude or adjusted as sociations was statistically significant. Hypothesis 2c The use of PRSS is not associated with the rate of progression of stage I PUs in the foot area. Table 45 demonstrates the association between the use of PRSS devices and progression of stage I PUs to a higher stage in the foot area. The same data are shown in this Table for PUs in the foot area as were shown in Tables 42 and 43 for PUs in all anatomical sites and hip area, respectively. The full dataset for these analyses included 382 observatio ns. After excluding observations that had missing values for any of the covariates controlled for in the adjusted models, the final datasets included between 304 and 310 observations depending on the device being analyzed. The analyses for the unadjusted m odels were performed by both including (data not shown) and excluding observations with missing values for any variables included in adjusted models; the results were similar for both analyses. The crude and adjusted HRs were also estimated using the same method as for all anatomical sites and hip area PUs, and the same 9 covariates were adjusted for in Model 2. In addition to the 9 confounders listed previously, other covariates were empirically evaluated as confounders and selected if they changed the cr ude HR 15% or more . 146 Depending on the device being analyzed , other confounders were added to the models as follows . In the analysis for a mattress or overlay , 1) number of orientations to person, place, time at baseline , and 2) number of hours between ED ad mission and hip surgery were also controlled for in the model.

None of the crude or adjusted associations was statistically significant. The same type of analyses as for all anatomical sites , and hip and foot areas was also conducted for heel PUs and heel protectors (Table 46). The full dataset for this analysis included 275 observations. After excluding observations that had missing values for any of the c ovariates controlled for in the adjusted model, the final dataset included 244 observations. The analysis for the unadjusted model was performed by both including (data not shown) and excluding observations with missing values for any variables included in adjusted models; the result was similar for both analyses. The crude and adjusted HRs were also estimated using the same method as for all anatomical sites , and hip and foot areas , and the same 9 covariates were adjusted for in Model 2. In addition to th e 9 confounders previously listed, 1) use of mattress at follow - up visits, and 2) number of hours between ED admission and hip surgery were also controlled for in this analysis. 149 Table 46: Crude and adjusted association between use of heel protectors and progression of stage I PUs on heels PRSS type Number of PUs progressed Number of ulcer -days of follow -up IR per 100 ulcer -days of follow - up Model 1: Crude HR (95% CI) p-value Model 2 *: Adjusted HR (95% CI) p-value Heel protector alone Yes No 14 23 225 374 6.2 6.1 1.4 (0.6 -3.2) Reference 0.4 0.6 (0.2 -2.2) Reference 0.4 *Covariates adjusted for in Model 2: age; -existing Index; and number of hours between ED admission and hip surgery at baseline; and number of orientations to person, place, and time; activity level; urinary and fecal incontinence; care setting; and use of mattress at follow -up visits The crude IR of progression of stage I PUs on the heels (6.2 per 100 follow -up ulcer days) in the presence of a heel protector was close to that for PUs in the foot area (6.5 per 100 follow -up ulcer -days) in the presence of heel protectors. This is not surprising g iven that heel PUs made up the largest proportion (74.0%) of foot PUs. The crude and adjusted HRs showed that a heel protector was not a statistically significant factor for progression of heel PUs . 150 VIII . CONCLUSIONS & DISCUSSION A. Research Question 1 What are the clinical course and risk factors for the progression of stage I pressure ulcers (PUs) to a higher stage in elderly hip fracture patients? Aim 1a Among patients with one or more stage I PUs, to determine the rate of each of the following o utcomes: 1) progression of one or more stage I PUs to a higher stage; 2) development of one or more PUs at sites other than the site of stage I PUs; 3) both 1) and 2). Summary of Results This study described the clinical course of stage I PUs in elderly hip fracture patients. The study included 278 stage I PUs in 168 patients; 61% of patients developed only one, and a quarter of patients developed two stage I PUs. The sacrum (38%) and heels (34%) had the largest proportion of stage I PUs in all anatomical sites. One hundred eleven (39.9%) of stage I PUs progressed to a higher stage; of those, 109 (98%) reached the highest stage of II. A pproximately half of the ulcers that progressed did so within the first three days after they were first detected. In addi tion, 104 (37%) stage I PUs in 81 patients disappeared before the end of follow -up, and the median time to disappearance was two days. 151 The incidence rate (IR) of progression among patients who had at least one stage I PU was 9.2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.4 -11.5) per 100 patient -days of follow -up; IR of developing one or more PUs at sites other than site of stage I PU was 12.6 (95% CI: 9.9 - 16.1) per 100 patient -days; IR of progression among patients who had at least two PUs one of which was stage I was 5.3 (95% CI: 4.0 -7.2) per 100 patient -days. Aim 1b To determine the rate of progression of stage I PUs to a higher stage, overall and by ulcer's anatomical site. Summary of Results The Kaplan -Meier (KM) probability of a stage I PU progressing to a higher stage at all anatomical sites was 0.55 at the end of the study follow -up period (day 21); this probability was 0.52 and 0.55 for the hip and foot areas, respectively. The crude IR (95% CI) of progression of stage I PUs at all anatomical sites was 7.8 (6.5 - 9.4) per 100 ulcer -days of follow -up. The crude IR (95% CI) of progression in the hip and foot areas was 11.1 (8.5 -14.6) and 5.9 (4.5 -7.8) per 100 ulcer -days, respectively. Aim 1c 152 To compare the rate of progression of stage I PUs at different anatomical sites after controlling for patients' demographic and baseline clinical characteristics, time -varying clinical characteristics, and care setting. Summary of Results The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) (95% CI) of progression of stage I PUs in the hi p area compared to the foot area was 2.3 (1.3 -4.1). Discussion of Results The results of this study illustrate that a large proportion of stage I PUs are at risk of progressing to a higher stage, and this risk is highest in the first few days after they develop. Developing even one stage I PU could be a precursor to a clinically adverse condition, namely stage II PUs. Thus, their early detection is important so that preventive measures can be implemented. Although some stage I PUs may disappear without an y harmful events, a relatively large proportion quickly advances to a clinically significant event. The study results highlight the prominence of hip and foot anatomical sites whose stage I PUs are at high risk of progression, and particularly PUs in the hip area have over twice the risk of progression as compared to those in the foot area. Therefore, these anatomical sites demand more clinical monitoring and care. 153 The results of the KM estimation, crude R tR, and crude regression analyses (HR) with respect to the comparison of progression of stage I PUs in the hip and foot areas appear to be very different. The KM risks of progression on day 21 of follow -up for hip and foot areas were 52% and 55%, respectively, suggesting no difference between these anatomical sites. However, the crude R tR of progression comparing hip to foot PUs was 1.9, and the crude HR was 2.3, suggesting a double of the risk of progression for hip compared to foot PUs. One explanation for this difference is the fact that the KM method assigns higher weight to events occurring later in the follow -up period than to earlier events. Ulcers in the foot area progressed more slowly than those in the hip area so the risk of progression for the hip area was higher earlier in the course of the f ollow -up than the risk for foot area. However, as time went on, more ulcers in the foot area progressed and their risk became more similar to that of the hip ulcers. Another explanation is related to the effect of stage I PUs that disappeared or healed without progressing. These ulcers not only did not develop the unfavorable outcome of interest, namely progression, but they actually had a favorable clinical outcome (disappearance). To compute the KM risk of progression, these ulcers were not censored at the time of disappearance; their follow -up continued until the end of the follow -up time for the patient who had the ulcer. Thus, in the KM analysis, the improved outcome of healing was taken into account to some degree by adjusting for the censoring altho ugh the favorable outcome was not quantitatively accounted for by computing the risk of disappearance and offsetting it against the risk of progression. 154 In contrast, in computing the crude R tR, and crude HR, the censoring of disappeared ulcers was not tak en into account because they were censored at the time of disappearance. Another difference between the KM estimation and estimation of adjusted HR is that the adjusted HR was adjusted for confounders, correlation and repeated measures, and it excluded ob servations that had any missing values for covariates included in the model. However, the KM analysis did not take into account any of these factors. Seven previous studies (Allman et al., 1995; Bulfone et al., 2012; K. E. Campbell, Woodbury, & Houghton, 2010a; Halfens et al., 2001; Sato et al., 2006; Schoonhoven et al., 2002; Vanderwee et al., 2009) reported on some aspect of the clinical course of stage I PUs. Some of the results of the current study are consistent with those of previous studies, and some are different. The lack of consistency between results could be attributable to dif ferences in study populations, study designs, care settings, use of preventive measures, follow -up periods, as well as methodological limitations associated with previous studies. Among these seven studies, only three (Halfens et al., 2001; Sato et al., 2006; Vanderwee et al., 2009) evaluated the progression of stage I PUs as the main outcome; the report of progression proportion in the remainder of the studies was a tangential observation. Two (Halfens et al., 2001; Vanderwee et al., 2009) of three evaluated association between some risk factors and progression of stage I PUs, and one (Vanderwee et al., 2009) of 155 those two performed adjusted analysis for association between risk factors and progression. Some of the studies had a cross -sectional design in which establishing temporal relationship between exposure and outcome is diff icult. All had small sample size for stage I PUs; most studies were descriptive. Most studies were performed in a small number of facilities and a very small range of care settings. The age range of the study populations varied from adults of all ages to t he elderly with different upper limits of age; older patients are at a higher risk of incident PUs. Some studies included all general hospital patients, and some included only surgical patients or ones with a hip fracture or reduced mobility. Patients wi th reduced mobility have a higher incidence of PUs; patients with a hip fracture have differences in demographic and clinical characteristics compared to general hospital patients or all residents in long -term care facilities. Most studies did not report t he follow -up time associated with proportion of progression of stage I PUs, and the frequency of progression was reported either for patients or for ulcers but not for both. Because progression of stage I PUs was not the primary outcome in most of these studies, data on clinical characteristics of patients at baseline were not collected so the comparison between patients whose stage I PUs did and did not progress could not be made. The frequency of use, type, and timing of preventive measures greatly vari ed among these studies ranging from none to random allocation of repositioning schedules to use of some type of pressure -redistributing support surface (PRSS). Moreover, some studies did not clearly report what type of preventive measures patients received . The 156 follow -up period varied greatly among these studies ranging from one day to several weeks. These studies were conducted in different countries including European countries, Canada, Japan, and the United States (US); standard of care, access to care, and care delivery are likely to vary across these countries. Given these differences, it is not surprising that the frequency of progression differs between these studies and the current study. A summary of the results of these seven studies follows. These results were presented in Table 5 as well. A study (Allman et al., 1995) performed among patients with reduced mobility or hip fracture in an acute hospital in the US reported that of 19 patients who had stage I PUs, 11 (57.9%) progressed to a higher stage. Studies conducted among surgical or orthopedic patients or including all patients in acute care hospitals in different countries reported the following proportion of progression of stage I PUs: of 6 stage I PUs, 1 (16.6%) progressed (Bulfone et al., 2012) by the third post -operative day; of 17 stage I PUs, 3 (17.6%) progressed (K. E. Campbell, Woodbury, & Houghton, 2010a) ; of 85 st age I PUs, 19 (22.1%) progressed (Halfens et al., 2001) ; of 43 stage I PUs, 12 (27.9%) progressed (Schoonhoven et al., 2002) in the first two days after surgery. Studies cond ucted in long -term care facilities or nursing homes reported the following proportion of progression of stage I PUs: 12 of 141 (8.7%) stage I PUs progressed (Halfens et al., 2001) ; 11 of 31 stage I PUs (35.5%) in 11 of 30 (36.7%) patients progressed to a higher stage (Sato et al., 2006) ; stage I PUs in 44 of 235 patients (18.7%) progressed (Vanderwee et al., 2009) ; this study also reported that the incidence rate of progression of stage I PUs in nursing home residents was 12.7 per 1000 days (95% CI: 0.9 -1.6). 157 In two of the above seven studies, the study population comprised of patients who had stage I PUs, the primary outcome was progression of stage I PUs, and the studies had fewer design and analytic limitations. These two studies are described in more details below for comparison with the current study. Vanderwee's study (Vanderwee et al., 2009) includ ed secondary analyses of a randomized controlled trial that had evaluated efficacy of turning schedules. The study population comprised of 235 residents in 16 Belgian nursing homes. All patients had stage I PUs and received standard preventive care. The pa tients' skin was assessed daily; the median age was 87 years, and the median follow -up time was 15 days. The Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate the rate of and risk factors associated with progression of stage I PUs. Stage I PUs in 18.7% (44 /235) of patients progressed to stage II; the incidence rate of progression was 12.7 per 1000 days (95% CI: 0.9 -1.6). The proportion of progression in the sacrum was 75%, and in heels and ankles was 25%. The incidence of progression was not significantly d ifferent between different turning protocols in the study. Risk factors associated with progression included hypotension, contractures, history of cerebrovascular accidents although urinary incontinence was a protective factor against progression. Halfens (Halfens et al., 2001) reported that all patients, in six acute care hospitals and six long-term care hospitals in Netherlands, who had stage I PUs participated in the study. The outcome was the clinical course of s tage I PUs; risk factors associated with the 158 clinical course were also evaluated. Repositioning and PRSS devices were used as preventive measures. The follow -up period was one and two weeks in acute and long - term care hospitals, respectively. Patients were assessed on day 1, 3, 7, and 14. The study population included 92 patients in acute care hospitals with mean age 77 years, and 122 patients in long -term care hospitals with mean age 82 years. The study only performed descriptive analyses. Loss to follow -up was 60% and 25% in acute and long -term care hospitals, respectively. In acute care hospitals, 85 stage I PUs developed, and 15 of 68 patients (22.1%) had progression of stage I PUs progression. In long -term care hospitals, 141 stage I PU developed, and 1 0 of 115 patients (8.7%) had a progression. On the same day reassessment, 49% of ulcers disappeared. However, of the disappeared ulcers, 15% in acute care hospitals, and 26% in the long -term care hospitals reappeared during the subsequent follow -up assessm ents. No relationship was found between development and clinical course of stage I PUs, and patient characteristics or use of preventive methods except that patients whose stage I PUs progressed received significantly more repositioning measure than those whose stage I did not progress. In the current study, 111 of 278 stage I PUs (39.9%) in 79 of 168 patients (47.0%) progressed. The median time from development to progression was three day which is consistent with what previous studies reported. The diffe rence in the frequency of progression between the current and previous studies can be attributed to major differences in their design and population and some of the limitations of those studies previously described. Particularly, Vanderwee (Vanderwee et al., 2009) reported a much lower rate of progression than the current study. That study included all residents of some 159 nursing homes in Belgium; since the patient population only included nursing home residents, the po pulation was different from that of the current study in terms of clinical characteristics and comorbidities. The current study had a prospective cohort design and detected incident cases of stage I PUs; it had a larger sample size and included a wide range of care settings. The study population was limited to patients 65 years and older with limited mobility. Repositioning and use of PRSS devices were implemented in all facilities although perhaps to different degrees. The frequency of stage I PUs that disappeared was lower in the current study (37%) compared to that in previous studies. Halfends (Halfens et al., 2001) reported that 110 of 226 (49%) stage I PUs detected on a given day disappeared on the same day al though approximately 18% of the ulcers that had disappeared reappeared in subsequent assessments. Campbell (K. E. Campbell, Woodbury, & Houghton, 2010a) reported that 13 of 17 (76%) stage I PUs on the heels disappea red one week after discharge from the hospital (mean length of hospital stay 10 days). Bulfone (Bulfone et al., 2012) reported that 7 of 13 (54%) stage I PUs that developed intra -operatively disappeared by the third post-operative day. Some of the specific differences between the current study and previous ones that could account for variability in these results are as follows. Halfens' study was descriptive and included a large number of acute care and long -term car e hospitals across the Netherlands; the study population included all patients and not just patients with reduced mobility. By day 14, half of the patients had been discharged from the hospitals and their 160 PU status could not be assessed any longer. The dat a for the use of preventive measures were collected only on the first assessment day. In Campbell's study, the average age of the population was lower than that of the current study, and assessment of some of the patients occurred by phone and involved pat ients ' self-report which has the potential for under -reporting. The average age of population in Bulfone's study was also lower than that of the current study. In the current study, the majority of stage I PUs developed after the hip surgery while in Bulfo ne's study they all developed intra -operatively. Thus, the conditions that gave rise to the development and disappearance of stage I PUs might have been different in the two studies. Allman (Allman et al., 1995) reported that 11 of 19 (58%) patients with stage I PUs on the sacrococcygeal area progressed to a higher stage. In the current study, 40 of 85 (47.1%) patients with sacral stage I PUs had progression (48 of 105 [45.7%] ulcers). A direct comparison between th ese two proportions is not appropriate because although the current study included stage I PUs in the sacrum, it did not find any stage I PUs on the coccyx. Halfens (Halfens et al., 2001) reported that in long -term c are hospitals 5.4% and 5.8% of sacral stage I PUs progressed after 3 and 7 days, respectively; in acute care hospitals, the frequency of progression of sacral stage I PUs was 7% after both 3 and 7 days. The frequency of progression of heel stage I PUs was 0% and 3% in long -term care hospitals and 21% and 29% in acute care hospitals after 3 and 7 days, respectively. Although Halfens did not clearly report the number of PUs representing the progression proportion at each assessment, the total number of stage I PUs on the first assessment day was 108 on the sacrum and 69 on the heels. In the current study, the frequency of 161 progression on the sacrum and heels was 45.7% (48 of 105) and 39.4% (37 of 94), respectively. In addition, the current study included a wide range of care settings from acute hospitals to post -acute facilities to nursing homes and homes whereas Halfens study included acute and long -term care hospitals only. There were no studies that compared the incidence rate of progression of stage I PUs in specific anatomical sites so the higher risk of progression in hip than foot areas observed in the current study cannot be compared to results of other studies. Aim 1d To identify factors associated with progression rate of stage I PUs to a higher sta ge, overall and by ulcer's anatomical site. Summary of Results Eighteen factors were postulated as potential predictors associated with progression of stage I PUs at all anatomical sites. Fourteen factors were measured at baseline only: 1) age, 2) sex, 3 ) presence of pre -existing PUs, 4) MMSE score, 5) chronic cognitive deficit, 6) risk of nutrition -related complications, 7) albumin level, 8) BMI, 9) Charlson Comorbidity Index, 10) Rand Sickness at Admission scale, 11) respiratory disease, 12) peripheral artery disease, 13) diabetes, and 14) number of hours between ED admission and hip surgery. Four factors were measured at each follow -up visit: 1) urinary and fecal incontinence; 2) number of orientations to person, place, and time; 3) activity level; and 162 4) care setting. Each risk factor was analyzed separately, and confounders were adjusted for in the analyses. Older age [75 -84 years [HR (95% 0.3 (0.1-0.6)] moderate [HR (95% CI): 0.5 (0.2 -0.8)] compared to low risk of nutrition -related complications significantly reduced risk of progression of stage I PUs. Having 0 [HR (95% CI): 2.9 (1.4 -6.2)] vs. 3 orientations and peripheral artery disease [HR(95% CI): 2.1 (1.1 -4.1)] s ignificantly increased risk of progression. The study did not find strong evidence of an association between the rest of postulated risk factors and progression of stage I PUs. Three factors were postulated as potential risk factors associated with progre ssion of stage I PUs in the hip area, and they included bedbound or chair bound condition (activity level), urinary and fecal incontinence, and low BMI. The adjusted analyses showed that being chair bound [HR (95% CI): 0.3 (0.1 -0.8)] compared to walking si gnificantly reduced risk of progression, but being bedbound [HR (95% CI): 0.7 (0.3 -1.8)] did not show a strong association with progression. The study did not find strong support for the association of low BMI [HR (95% CI): 0.6 (0.2 0.7 (0.3-2.1)] compared to none] with progression. In exploratory analyses, older age (85 compared to 65 -74 years) [HR (95% CI): 0.3 (0.1 -0.9)] and moderate compared to low risk of nutrition -related complications [HR (95% CI): 0.2 (0.1 -0.7)] significantly reduced 163 risk of progression in the hip area. However, there was no strong e vidence for the association of other risk factors and progression of stage I PUs for the hip area. Three factors were postulated as potential risk factors associated with progression of stage I PUs in the foot area, and they included peripheral artery di sease, respiratory disease, and diabetes mellitus. The study did not find strong evidence for the association of respiratory disease [HR (95% CI): 0.6 (0.2 -1.7)] and diabetes [HR (95% CI): 0.9 (0.3 - 2.8)] with progression. However, peripheral artery disease [HR (95% CI) : 6.1 (2.2 -17.3)] significantly increased risk of progression of stage I PUs in the foot area. In the exploratory analyses, being bedbound [HR (95% 5.9 (1.9 -18.9)] compared to walking, and bei ng in a post -acute facility compared to a nursing home, assisted living residence, or home [HR (95% CI): 7.0 (1.3 - 38.0)] significantly increased risk of progression. Being obese compared to having a normal BMI significantly reduced risk of progression [HR (95% CI): 0.3 (0.1 -0.9)] in the foot area. Discussion of Results There is not much evidence to suggest that the conventional risk factors and biological mechanisms for development of PUs should be different from those for progression of stage I PUs. Howe ver, dearth of evidence on clinical course of stage I PUs does not provide support for or against this issue. 164 All Anatomical Sites This study found that, in all anatomical sites, older age reduced risk of progression whereas previous studies showed that older age increased PU incidence. (Baumgarten et al., 2006; Casimiro, Garcia -de-Lorenzo, & Usan, 2002; Lindgren et al., 2004) The association between older age and develo pment of PUs has biological plausibility. Aging is associated with changes that undermine the physiological infrastructure of the skin (Jaul, 2010) , and the high prevalence of systemic chronic illnesses in the elderly contributes to the risk of developing PUs. If the same physiological pathways and predictive factors are involved in the progression of stage I PUs as in the development of PUs, the current result appears to contradict previous results. One potential explana tion for this result is that o lder patients may have received more clinical care and preventive measures for PUs compared to the younger age group precisely because of the clinicians' perception that older patients were at higher risk of developing PUs. Al though this study controlled for the use of PRSS as a preventive measure, data on other preventive measures that may have been used were not collected in the study, and residual confounding may have remained. For example, data on repositioning of patients was only available in the first five days in the acute hospital, and most stage I PUs developed after that period. This result is also different from that of two studies (Halfens et al., 2001; V anderwee et al., 2009) that evaluated risk factors for progression of stage I PUs and did not find age to be significantly associated with progression. Major differences between those studies and 165 the current study and their major limitations which were pr eviously explained could account for different results. The two previous studies were conducted in Belgium and the Netherlands where the standard of care may be different from that of the US. Alternatively, the study results may be suggesting that mechanis m of progression of stage I PUs is different from that of PU development. This study also found that, in all anatomical sites, moderate compared to low risk of nutrition -related complications reduced the incidence of progression. Some studies have show n a relationship between poor nutritional status and development of PUs (Baumgarten et al., 2006; Hengstermann et al., 2007; Johnston, 2007) while some have not conf irmed such a relationship (Thomas, 2001a) . Although nutritional parameters have been correlated with development and healing of PUs (Allman et al., 1995; Baumgarten et al., 2007; Horn et al., 2004; Lindgren et al., 2004; Reed et al., 2003; Schultz al., 1999; Thomas, 2001a; VanGilder et al., 2009; VanGilder, MacFarlane et al., 2009) a causal relationship between poor nutritio nal status and development of PUs has not been established (Thomas, 2001a) . One explanation for the finding that poor nutritional status is associated with a lower incidence of progression is that clinicians identifi ed patients with poor nutritional status and realized their high risk of progression. Therefore, these patients may have subsequently received nutritional intervention to reduce their risk. High level of disorientation increased risk of progression in al l anatomical sites. People with normal mental status reposition themselves frequently, when in contact with a 166 surface, due to their skin's sensitivity to pressure, friction, or shear. However, lack of orientation and lower cognitive status can lead to sens ory deficit and impairment of pain perception particularly in individuals with limited mobility who cannot reposition themselves without assistance. Unrelieved pressure, friction, or shear are external risk factors for development of PUs and may also resul t in progression of stage I PUs. This result is consistent with that of other studies which showed l ower mental status was an independent risk factor for PU incidence among patients with mobility impairment and particularly with hip fracture (Haleem et al., 2008; Mecocci et al., 2005; Reed et al., 2003; Soderqvist et al., 2007) although previous stage I PU progression studies did not evaluate this factor. The result of the current study with respect to peripheral artery disease is consistent with that of previous studies (Fowler et al., 2008; Okuwa et al., 2006) that have shown that peripheral artery di sease reduces peripheral circulation to the extremities and increases PU incidence particularly in older patients with reduced mobility. One potential explanation for the overall unexpected results with respect to risk factors for progression across all anatomical sites could be that combining heterogeneous anatomical sites together and treating them homogeneously, as was done in this analysis, may not be appropriate if the risk factors and pathophysiology of PU development and progression of stage I PUs are different at different anatomical sites. 167 Hip Area It has been suggested that certain anatomical sites, such as the sacrum and heels, are at higher risk of PUs because these areas sustain a higher level of pressure. (Baumgarten et al., 2006; K. E. Campbell, Woodbury, & Houghton, Clegg et al., 2009; Perneger et al., 1998; Schoonhoven et al., 2002) Some studies have shown that the etiology and mechanism of, and predictive factors related to PU development may differ at different anatomical sites. (Clegg et al., 2009; Pompeo & Baxter, 2000; T homas, 2010) However, these results all came from studies that assessed risk factors in relation to onset of new PUs. There is little evidence related to stage I PUs and their progression by anatomical site. In the hip area, the study did not find stron g evidence that low BMI increased the incidence of progression of stage I PUs. Evidence for the association between BMI and PU development is contradictory. Some studies did not demonstrate such an association (Baumg arten et al., 2006) whereas some indicated that low BMI increased risk of PUs (Casimiro et al., 2002; Compher et al., 2007; Shahin et al., 2010; VanGil der, MacFarlane et al., 2009) , and still others illustrated that high BMI was a risk factor for development of PUs (Tschannen et al., 2012) . None of the previous studies, however, evaluated the association between BMI and progression of stage I PUs specifically in the hip area. There are physiological explanations for association between increased risk of PUs and both low and high BMI. One theory claims that obese patients have more adipose tissue 168 and enhanced subcu taneous cushion to more evenly distribute pressure from underlying bones and to protect the skin from breakdown when exposed to extrinsic risk factors such as pressure, friction, and shear. Another theory argues that a larger body mass exerts more pressure on soft tissues and increases PU risk. (Doley, 2010) There is yet another theory contending that in elderly individuals, because of kyphoscoliosis, deformities, and difference in individual height loss with aging, the measurement of height may limit BMI estimation and its predictive value for malnutrition (Hommel et al., 2007) . On the other hand, the relatively small number of PUs in the hip area in this study may have limited its ability to detect a relatively small association between BMI and progression. This study did not find strong support for the association between urinary and fecal incontinence and progression of stage I PUs in the hip area. Baumgarten (Baumgarten et al., 2006) reported that urinary and fecal incontinence was a risk factor for PU development among elderly patients admitted to acute hospitals. Brandeis (Brandeis et al., 1994) reported that fecal incontinence increased risk of developing stage II and greater PUs among elderly nursing home residents. However, Vanderwee (Vanderwee et al., 2009) reported that in nursing home residents urina ry incontinence was a protective factor for progression of stage I PUs. The study had a high frequency (75%) of sacral PUs; the limitations of this study were previously discussed. Plus, the current study collected data on incontinence at each visit so the change of incontinence status over time was taken into account. However, Vanderwee's study did not report whether the incontinence data were collected only at baseline or more often. Mechanistically, urinary and fecal incontinence may not have a direct as sociation with development of PUs, but 169 moisture and bacteria from urine and feces may provide an environment for the skin to become more vulnerable to the effect of pressure, shear, and friction. This study hypothesized that this effect would be more promi nent in the hip area because this area sustains a higher level of pressure particularly in patients with hip fracture who are likely to spend a lot of time lying in bed, and this area is more likely to be exposed to urine and feces from incontinence. One e xplanation for the incontinence results may be that since the data on incontinence were collected at each visit but not in the period between visits, there is a potential for misclassification of this variable. The misclassification is likely to be non -differential for the outcome and would bias the result toward the null. On the other hand, despite the biological plausibility of relation between incontinence and PU risk, the result of this study suggests that there may be no association between incontinenc e and progression of stage I PUs. Being chair bound, but not bedbound, compared to walking reduced risk of progression of stage I PUs in the hip area. Reduced mobility is the single most important risk factor for PU incidence in the elderly population. (Allman et al., 1995; Brandeis et al., 1994; 2009; Lindgren et al., 2004; Thomas, 2010) The study results for activity appear to be in the opposite direction of the results of previous studies for PU incidence. One potential explanation for these results is that the bedbound and chair bound catego ries may not adequately represent the patient's level of mobility and subsequently the degree of exposure to pressure, friction, and shear. Another potential explanation for not detecting an association between being bedbound and progression could be the d ifferential treatment of patients. Bedbound patients may 170 have been perceived to be at higher risk of developing PUs and received additional preventive measures that protected against progression of stage I PUs. Lack of repositioning data could be an exampl e for this explanation. In addition, the data on activity level were collected by interviewing the clinical staff so the potential non - differential misclassification of this variable, which would bias the results toward the null, cannot be ruled out. Exploratory analyses showed that older age (85 compared to 65 -74 years), and moderate compared to low risk of nutrition -related complications reduced the risk of progression in the hip area. These results are consistent with those for all anatomical sites, a nd the same explanations provided for those results apply to hip area results. Foot Area Respiratory disease, defined as pneumonia, chronic pulmonary disease, or prior chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, was postulated as a risk factor for progression of stage I PUs in the foot area because of its impact on the cardiovascular system, arterial blood flow, and peripheral circulation to the lower extremities. (Fowler et al., 2008; Okuwa et al., 2006) However, the study did not find strong support for this association. A study among elderly, bedbound or chair bound nursing home residents did not find a significant association between pneumonia and incidence of PUs. (Kwong et al., 2009) Another study in elderly hospitalized patients did not find a significant association between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and PU incidence . (Mecocci et al., 2005) Even though these stud ies did not concentrate on stage I PUs or the foot area, the result of the present study is in accordance with that of those studies. There is also the possibility that 171 the small number of PUs in the foot area may have limited this study's ability to detec t an association unless it was very strong. In addition, respiratory disease covers a wide range of clinical conditions with different etiology, risk factors, and chronicity. Thus, the selected definition of respiratory disease in this study may not have b een associated with progression of stage I PUs in the foot area. Diabetes mellitus was also postulated as a risk factor for progression of stage I PUs in the foot area. The rationale for this selection was that certain medical conditions such as diabetes reduce peripheral circulation and oxygen supply to the extremities (Fowler et al., 2008) ; reduced arterial blood flow in the lower extremities has been shown to be a risk factor for development of lower extremity PUs in older bedbound patients (Okuwa et al., 2006) . However, this study did not find strong evidence for such an association. A study (Tschannen et al., 2012) in surgical patients re ported that history of diabetes was a risk factor for development of stage I or greater PUs. Another study (Brandeis et al., 1994) in nursing home residents found that diabetes was significantly associated with ris k of stage II and higher PUs. One explanation for the result of this study may be the small number of PUs in the foot area in a small number of patients with diabetes that may have limited the study's ability to detect a small association. It was postula ted that peripheral artery disease would increase risk of progression of stage I PUs in the foot area for reasons similar to those for diabetes. That is peripheral artery disease reduces peripheral circulation to the extremities (Fowler et al., 2008) ; in older bedbound patients, reduced arterial blood flow in the lower extremities increases PU 172 incidence (Okuwa et al., 2006) . A study of heel PUs (Clegg et al., 2009) and a study of older bedbound patients with lower extremity PUs (Okuwa et al., 2006) reported such a significant association. The result of this study is in accordance with what previous studies repor ted. Exploratory analyses revealed that being bedbound or chair bound compared to walking, and being in a post -acute facility compared to being in a nursing home, assisted living residence, or home increased risk of progression of stage I PUs in the foot area whereas being obese compared to having a normal BMI reduced risk of progression. The significant association of immobility with progression of stage I PUs in the foot area is in accordance with findings of other studies (Allman et al., 1995; Brandeis et al., 1994; Kwong et al., 2009; Lindgren et ; Thomas, 2010) . The dermis and epidermis over the heel are very thin rendering it vulnerable to ischemia and tissue damage when exposed to pressure, shear, and sliding forces. The skin overlying the heel undergoes further thinning with aging. Reduced mob ility, restlessness, and unrelieved contact of the foot area with bedding in hip fracture patients expose that area to a high level of pressure, shear, and friction and increase risk of progression of stage I PUs. (Clegg et al., 2009) Being in a post -acute facility compared to a nursing home, assisted -living residence, or home was associated with progression of stage I PUs in the foot area. In this study, a post-acute facility was defined as a care setting to which pat ients were transferred from 173 an acute hospital after hip surgery, and that it had skilled rehabilitation and skilled nursing capabilities. Thus, patients in this type of facility were still in the process of recovering from hip surgery. One potential explan ation for this result is that stage I PUs that progressed belonged to patients who were sicker, had a slower recovery and more comorbidities than patients who were transferred to a nursing home, assisted living residence, or home; sicker elderly patients h ave higher risk of progression. (Gunningberg, 2004; Haleem et al., 2008; Houwing et al., 2004; Nixon et al., 2006) Campbell (K. E. Campbell, Woodbury, & Houghton, 2010a) reported frequency of progression of stage I PUs on heels in an acute hospital, but it did not include other care settings. No other study was found that evaluated progression of stage I PUs in the foot area in any care settings. High BMI reduced risk of progression of stage I PUs in the foot area. This result is consistent with reports of previous studies. (Casimiro et al., 2002; Compher et al., 2007; Shahin et al., 2010; VanGilder, MacFarlane et al., 2009) (VanGilder et al., 2009) Those studies offered the rationale that the presence of more fat tissue and enh anced subcutaneous cushion in obese patients distributes pressure from underlying bones more uniformly and protects the skin from breakdown when exposed to PU extrinsic risk factors. Although previous studies did not evaluate stage I PUs in the foot area, this explanation appears to be biologically plausible. 174 B. Research Question 2 What is the effect of PRSS on the progression of stage I PUs to a higher stage, overall and by ulcer's anatomical site in elderly hip fracture patients? Aim To evaluate the effect of PRSS on progression of stage I PUs overall and by anatomical site after controlling for patients' demographic and baseline clinical characteristics, time - varying clinical characteristics, and care setting . Summary of Results The PRSS devices ev aluated in the present study included mattress, overlay, cushion (chair and wheelchair combined), and heel protector. In about a third of the study visits a mattress or an overlay was in use. Heel protectors were used in about half of the visits in which a stage I PU in the foot area was present. Cushions were used in less than half of the visits in which a stage I PU in the foot area was present and in more than a third of the visits in which a stage I PU in the hip area was present. In approximately a qua rter of the study visits, no device was in use. Concurrent use of more than one PRSS did not occur frequently. 175 The frequency of use of PRSS varied greatly across different care settings. Compared to other care settings, a mattress was used most frequent ly in an acute hospital setting, and an overlay was present most often in an assisted -living residence setting. However, in all care settings, cushions and heel protectors were more frequently used than mattresses and overlays. The current study did not f ind strong support that use of PRSS devices was associated with a lower rate of progression of stage I PUs in all anatomical sites (use of any device: HR=0.9, 95% CI=0.5 -1.6), in the hip overlay or cushion: HR=1.1, 95% CI=0.6 -2.2), or i n the foot area (use of mattress or overlay or heel protector: HR=1.3, 95% CI=0.4 -4.1) after controlling for confounders. These results persisted when the association between the individual types of device and progression of stage I PUs was evaluated in PU s at all anatomical sites, and hip and foot areas separately. Moreover, exploratory analysis did not find strong evidence that use of heel protectors was associated with a lower rate of progression of PUs on the heels (HR=0.6, 95% CI=0.2 - 2.2). The lack of strong association between PRSS and lower rate of progression of stage I PUs in the foot area is in accordance with the study hypothesis formulated based on the results of previous studies. However, since the 95% CIs are wide, the possibility of an associa tion cannot be ruled out. Discussion of Results Since all of the patients in this study had at least one stage I PU and they were elderly patients with reduced mobility, they were all at high risk of PUs. However, PRSS devices 176 were not in use in between a third and a half of study visits (depending on type of device), and specific devices presumed to target specific anatomical sites were not in use when PUs in those areas were present. Particularly, the frequency of use of mattresses and overlays in this high risk population was very low. One reason for less frequent use of mattresses and overlays compared to that of cushions and heel protectors is higher cost and more resources required for their operation and maintenance. The low frequency of use of PRSS devices occurred in all care settings but to different degrees. These results show that the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) guidelines (European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel & National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel, 2009) with respect to the use of PRSS devices for patients at high risk of PUs were not followed consistently when stage I PUs were present although the degree of lack of adherence to the guidelines varied greatly among different care settings. Baumgarten (Baumgarten et al., 2010) showed that in a study of hip fracture patients there was considerable variation in use of PRSS acros s different care settings and even among acute care hospitals. Large variation in use of PRSS across different care settings and facilities may stem from different standards and levels of care delivered at different facilities, and the fact that these fact ors were not measured by the current study. One explanation for lack of association between use of PRSS and prevention of progression of stage I PUs is misclassification of PRSS use. One source of such misclassification is that the PRSS in use may have ch anged between study visits. Another explanation for these results is confounding by indication. That is, patients who received 177 a PRSS may have differed from those who did not receive a PRSS with respect both to clinical characteristics related to the reaso n for needing a PRSS and to the risk of progression. Although we adjusted for a large number of known PU risk factors, it is possible that there are unmeasured factors that could not be controlled for in the analyses. In addition, the small sample size of the study may have limited its ability to detect a relatively weak association between the use of PRSS and prevention of progression of stage I PUs. Another explanation for not observing such an association is that the current study did not take into ac count disappearance of stage I PUs as a clinically beneficial outcome. Stage I PUs that disappeared were censored at the time of disappearance, but disappearance itself was not considered as an outcome in the study. Thus, although the results did not show strong evidence that use of PRSS devices had an effect on preventing progression, the study did not evaluate whether they had an impact on the disappearance of ulcers. The literature evidence supporting the effectiveness of PRSS devices in the prevention and treatment of PUs is inconsistent. Studies have provided contradictory results, and most of them suffer from design and methodological limitations. (McInnes et al., 2008) Systematic reviews of some of the higher q uality studies (Colin et al., 2012; McInnes et al., 2012; Reddy, 2011) have concluded that some types of mattresses and overlays compared to a standard foam mattress, which is the standard care in all care settings, may reduce the incidence of PUs in general, but there is not sufficient evidence to determine which specific types may be more effective than others. Rich (Rich et al., 2011) report ed 178 that use of PRSS was not associated with a lower incidence of stage II and higher PUs among hip fracture patients across different care settings although use of non -powered PRSS in bedbound patients reduced that incidence. There is also lack of evidence as to the appropriate timing and length of use of these devices. The support is even more limited with respect to the effectiveness of these devices in prevention of PUs at specific anatomical sites. One systematic review (Colin et al., 2012) concluded that a n alternating air mattress compared to a visco -elastic support surface reduced the incidence of heel PUs; a low air -loss bed was more efficient than a mixed pulsating air mattress in prevention of heel PUs; and some types of sheepskin could reduce the incidence of sacral PUs in orthopedic patients. There is even more uncertainty about the effectiveness of cushions and heel protectors. Moreover, most of previous studies neither included stage I PUs (McInnes et al., 2008) nor evaluated their progression so the effectiveness of these devices with respect to the progression of stage I PUs remains unknown. 179 IX. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS OF STUDY This study fills a major gap in knowle dge about the clinical course of, risk factors for, and effectiveness of PRSS on progression of stage I PUs. This study has several strengths. First, the prospective study design reduces the potential for temporal ambiguity and increases the study's abilit y to detect the true association between the exposures and outcome. Also, PUs were ascertained by nurses directly examining patients, whereas in many PU studies, PU data are collected retrospectively from medical charts, a method that is known to lead to s ubstantial under -detection of PUs (Briggs & Banks, 1996; Gruen, Chang, & MacLellan, 1997) . Direct observation of patients reduces the probability of misclassification of the outcome. The ability of this study to collect and analyze data for specific anatomical locations also contributes to further knowledge about progression of stage I PUs in high risk body areas. The availability of data on a large number of PU risk factors, and the availabili ty of time - varying data for risk factors that are likely to change as the patient progresses through the recovery period, allow for better control of confounding and increase the validity of study findings. The frequency and type of assessment of PUs were the same for all study participants regardless of their exposure status which reduces the probability of differential misclassification of outcome. The fact that patients were followed across different care settings increases generalizability of study find ings. Finally, since only a small portion of study data was collected by self -report, the probability for recall bias is low. The collection of data on specific anatomical sites and conducting the analyses with 180 the ulcer -visit as the unit of analysis enabl ed the study to provide evidence in terms of clinical course of stage I PUs in specific anatomical sites. On the other hand, the relatively small number of patients and stage I PUs reduces the power to detect a weak association between the exposures and o utcome and precludes the possibility of testing interactions. Although the method of PU detection used in this study has been shown to be valid and reliable for PUs in general (Localio et al., 2006) , it is not known whether the method is as valid for the detection of stage I PUs (Vanderwee et al., 2006) . Under -detection of stage I PUs would result in a reduced sample size for this study and could lead to selection bias if there were systematic differences between stage I PUs that were missed and stage I PUs that were detected. Over -detection of stage I PUs, namely classification of non -PU skin problems as stage I PUs, could result in bias and under -estimation of the measure of as sociation given that the non -PU wounds are not likely to have the same prognosis as stage I PUs. On the other hand, under -detection of progression of stage I PUs would lead to over -estimating the preventive effect of PRSS on progression and bias the measur e of association away from the null. It would also result in under -estimating the effect of risk factors on progression and bias the measure of association toward the null. Over -detection of progression would bring about the opposite effects. Potential m isclassification of PRSS use cannot be ruled out. However, it is difficult to predict whether the misclassification would be differential or non -differential with respect to the outcome so the direction of bias in the measure of association cannot be 181 predi cted. Moreover, confounding by indication in terms of use of PRSS cannot be ruled out, as described earlier. Data on repositioning of patients were collected only during the first five days in acute hospitals, but a large proportion of stage I PUs develo ped after the first five days. This is a limitation of the study because the potential effect of repositioning on the progression of stage I PUs and its possible interaction with use of PRSS were not taken into account. However, studies have not clearly sh own that repositioning is a significant preventive factor for PUs or progression of stage I PUs although it is standard care. (Levine et al., 2013) Because of non -response and loss to follow -up, there is the possibi lity that the population included in this study differs from the target population in terms of characteristics related to both the exposures and outcome of interest which may result in selection bias. A number of patients in the study had co -existing stage II PUs, and the presence of stage II PUs may be a risk factor for progression of stage I PUs. The reason is that a patient with a stage II PU may have clinical characteristics that would make him/her more vulnerable to progression of his/her stage I PU. H owever, the presence of co -existing stage II PUs was not adjusted for in the analyses. Since the study population consisted of hip fracture patients only, the generalizability of findings to other populations is limited although hip fracture patients provi de a good model for studying PUs. Another limitation of the study is that it did not take into account disappearance of stage I 182 PUs as a clinically beneficial outcome. Hence, the effect of PRSS, and of clinical and demographic characteristics on the clin ical course of stage I PUs was only partially evaluated. 183 X. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE STUDIES The results of this study amplify the importance of stage I PUs as a precursor to more advanced clinical conditions. This is one of the few studies that evalu ated the clinical course of stage I PUs and reported on their progression. More studies with a larger sample size should be conducted to confirm these results. The study results raise the question as to what factors distinguish stage I PUs that will progr ess to a higher stage from those that will persist or disappear without any adverse consequences. The current study did not focus on factors associated with disappearance of stage I PUs. However, this question should be explored in future studies because t he answer can help to identify those patients who need more preventive measures. Most PU studies exclude stage I PUs as an outcome. This exclusion is justifiable, to some extent, because detection of stage I PUs is difficult and their clinical signific ance has not been fully determined. However, now that the evidence from this study points to the harmful consequences of stage I PUs, they should be included as an outcome in PU studies. Hence, there is a need for more research focusing on developing tools and measures for more accurate detection of stage I PUs. This is one of the few studies that explored the association of predictors of progression of stage I PUs. Some, but not all, of the results of this study with respect to risk factors associated wit h progression of stage I PUs were consistent with those of previous studies for PU development in general and progression of stage I PUs in particular. More studies 184 concentrating on risk factors involved in development and progression of stage I PUs ought to be conducted to confirm these findings. Also, more research on deciphering the pathophysiology of development and progression of stage I PUs may help to shed light on risk factors involved in these pathways. The study results do not provide strong e vidence that PRSS devices are effective in preventing progression of stage I PUs. The results also show that frequently these devices are not in use regardless of the type of care setting. These results raise a question about the timing of use of PRSS. Tha t is, when in the clinical course of stage I PUs, PRSS should be utilized to have an impact on the prevention of progression. This question should be explored in future studies to more clearly determine the effect of PRSS devices on progression of stage I PUs. Moreover, studies with sufficiently large sample size should further delineate the effect of PRSS on progression of stage I PUs while taking into account the effect of PRSS on disappearance or healing of ulcers. Particularly, future studies should b e large enough to detect potentially smaller effects of PRSS on progression of stage I PUs at high risk anatomical sites. Ultimately, randomized controlled trials would provide the strongest evidence in evaluating the effectiveness of PRSS on progression o f stage I PUs and enable clinicians and policy makers to draw causal inference in this regard. Since there are many different types of PRSS devices available on the market and evaluating their comparative effectiveness would be very resource intensive, developing 185 a different and improved method of classifying these devices may make it easier to compare their effectiveness in general and to each other. 186 XI. IMPLICATIONS The present study illustrated a comprehensive picture of the clinical course of s tage I PUs in elderly hip fracture patients, including incidence rate of progression, proportion of disappearance, number of stage I PUs developed by each patient, clinical data on hip and 2foot areas as high risk anatomical sites , and follow -up of patient s in multiple care settings. The results highlight the fact that stage I PUs should be neither ignored nor excluded from PU studies as a clinically important outcome because a relatively large proportion of the se ulcers progresses to stage II which is more difficult to treat , and the risk of progression persists in all care settings. Hence, more resources should be expended to monitor and prevent development of these ulcers in all care settings. The results also underline the importance of focusing on stage I PUs in hip and foot areas as high risk sites , and particularly hip area, which has even a higher risk of progression. This study is one of the few studies that evaluated potential risk factors associated with progression of stage I PUs , and it evaluat ed a large number of such predictors. Moreover, evaluation of these factors in the hip and foot areas is novel . Some of the predictor results were surprising, and some were consistent with limited previous knowledge about stage I PUs and general informatio n about conventional predictors for development of PUs . Regardless, these results provide new signals and directions to fill some of the gaps with respect to stage I PUs. Identifying risk factors associated with progression of stage I PUs provides clinical input for the care of patients with such ulcers. Particularly, information about risk factors associated with progression of stage I PUs in high risk anatomical sites 187 can translate into targeted preventive measures for these areas and potentially lead to a decrease in PU complications. This study also provided information regarding health care settings' adherence to clinical guidelines for PUs. Although the current guidelines suggest the use of PRSS devices in patients at risk of developing PUs as a prev entive measure, according to the results of this study, adherence to these guidelines does not occur frequently and consistently, regardless of the care setting, when stage I PUs are present. The study results evaluated the effectiveness of multiple type s of PRSS devices on progression of stage I PUs in all anatomical sites as well as in the hip and foot areas separately. Overall, the effectiveness of these devices on incidence of PUs is not clearly delineated , and the study results did not furnish strong support for the effectiveness of these devices to prevent progression . The current clinical guidelines do not provide any specific recommendations for or against use of PRSS in preventing progression of stage I PUs. These guidelines should be updated base d on empirical evidence and provide recommendations for clinicians and policy makers in terms of the effectiveness of PRSS in preventing progression of stage I PUs. If future studies confirm lack of effectiveness of these devices in preventing progression of stage I PUs, the health care system would save resources by not utilizing them for this purpose. On the other hand, if further studies show that they are effective preventive measures, their use can be targeted to patients at risk of progression, and th e health care system would still benefit from having a smaller number of patients with such ulcers. 188 Compared to previous studies, t he current study is one of the largest and most comprehensive studies with robust study design and analytic method s conduct ed to date in terms of delineating clinical course and progression of stage I PUs. The study has many strengths as described previously. However, its relatively small sample size limited its ability to detect small associations, and its generalizability is limited to the population of elderly hip fracture patients. Therefore, larger studies comprising more diverse populations ought to be performed to confirm and further delineate these results. 189 XII. REFERENCES AHRQ News and Numbers. (200 8).
